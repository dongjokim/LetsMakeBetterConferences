  Issues with Talk Data
There are some unusual patterns in the data that might need investigation:
QM2011 (Annecy) shows only 4 talks with no plenary/parallel classification
QM2015 (Kobe) shows only 26 talks with no plenary/parallel classification
QM2014 (Darmstadt) and QM2023 (Houston) show 0 parallel talks
These anomalies suggest there might be issues with how talks are being categorized or extracted from older conferences.
Possible Causes
Different Session Naming: Older conferences might use different terminology for "plenary" and "parallel" sessions
Indico Format Changes: The Indico API structure has evolved over the years
Data Availability: Some older conferences may have limited data in the Indico system
Suggested Improvements
To address these issues, we could:

   # Enhance the session type detection
   if any(plenary_term in str(session).lower() for plenary_term in 
         ['plenary', 'keynote', 'overview', 'summary', 'highlight']):
       plenary_talks.append(talk_data)
