IMPORTANT NOTE ON GENDER ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

The gender analysis presented in these visualizations is based on algorithmic inference from first names.
This approach has significant limitations and inherent biases, including:

1. Names do not always reliably indicate gender identity
2. The algorithm uses simplified Western/European naming patterns
3. Many names are culturally specific and may be misclassified
4. Non-binary and other gender identities are not represented

These results should be interpreted as approximate patterns only and not definitive analyses.
A more accurate approach would require self-reported gender information which is not available in the dataset.
