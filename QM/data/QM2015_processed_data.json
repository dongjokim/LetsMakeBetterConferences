      "Abstract": "Jets are modified in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to jet-medium interactions. Measurements of jet medium modifications have so far been obscure because of the large underlying anisotropic flow background. In this analysis we devise a novel method to subtract the flow background using data themselves. We select events with a large recoil momentum ($P_x$) within a pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) window of $0.5<\\eta<1$ ($-1<\\eta<-0.5$) from a high-$p_T$ trigger particle to enhance the away-side jet population. Di-hadron azimuthal correlations are analyzed with associated particles in two $\\eta$ ranges ($-0.5<\\eta<0$ and $0<\\eta<0.5$) symmetric about midrapidity, one (close-region) close to and the other (far-region) far away from the $P_x$ selection $\\eta$ window. The away-side jet contributes to the \"close-region\" but not as much to the \"far-region\" due to the large $\\eta$ gap, while the flow contributions are equal. Assuming the $\\Delta\\phi$ shape of jet-like correlations does not depend on $\\Delta\\eta$, the correlation difference measures the away-side jet shape where the anisotropic flow background is cleanly subtracted.  \r\n\r\nThe away-side jet correlation width is studied as a function of centrality and associated particle $p_T$. The width is found to increase with centrality at modest to high associated particle $p_T$. The increase can arise from jet-medium modifications, event averaging of away-side jets deflected by medium flow, and/or simply nuclear $k_T$ broadening. To further discriminate various physics mechanisms, a three-particle correlation analysis is conducted with robust flow background subtraction also using data themselves.  Based on this analysis we discuss possible physics mechanisms of away-side broadening of jet-like correlations.",

      "Speaker": "Zi-Wei Lin",
      "Institute": "ECU",
      "Country": "ECU",
      "Abstract": "It is commonly believed that azimuthal anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collisions are generated by hydrodynamic evolution of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. Recently, apparent anisotropy signals have been observed in small systems of proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions, and the signals can again be described by hydrodynamics. A natural question is why hydrodynamics still seems to be applicable to such small systems. Since A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT), like hydrodynamics, has been quite successful in describing a large amount of experimental data, we investigate the generation of anisotropies in AMPT by analyzing the complete parton collision history. We also use another transport model, the MPC/Cascade, to check the model dependence of our results.\r\n\r\nTo our surprise, we find [1] that the majority of $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons, not from the parton collective flow, for semi-central Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV. Hydrodynamic-type collective flow will eventually dominate over the escape mechanism at unrealistically large parton cross sections. However, even at the parton cross section of 40 mb, the escape mechanism still contributes to about one-third of the final parton $v_2$. The picture is qualitatively the same from both transport models, and for the smaller d+Au system the escape mechanism is more dominant as expected. Our results thus show that elliptic anisotropy $v_2$ is dominated by particle escape instead of hydrodynamic flow in transport models. If confirmed, our finding could change the paradigm of anisotropic flow. Our results also suggest the need for hydrodynamics to include the escape mechanism, without which the extracted viscosity to entropy density ($\\eta/s$) ratio would be severely underestimated.\r\n\r\n[1] L.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions have played an essential role in understanding the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in such collisions. In particular, $J/\\psi$ suppression in the medium has been proposed as a direct probe of the QGP formation, where quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom. However,  regeneration of $J/\\psi$ from uncorrelated $c$ and $\\bar{c}$ quarks in the medium adds extra complications to the interpretation of $J/\\psi$ suppression. The measurement of the second order harmonic coefficient ($v_{2}$) for $J/\\psi$ would help disentangle different production mechanisms since the regenerated $J/\\psi$ is expected to inherit the flow of the charm quarks while the primordial $J/\\psi$  should have almost zero $v_{2}$. On the other hand, the contribution from regeneration to $\\Upsilon$, $b\\bar{b}$ bound states, is much smaller at RHIC energies, making them ideal probes to study the color-screening feature. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), designed to trigger on and identify muons based on precise timing information, was fully installed in STAR at mid-rapidity. Due to the low trigger threshold on muon $p_{\\rm{T}}$, the MTD trigger has a relatively high efficiency for low $p_{\\rm{T}}$ $J/\\psi$, where the regeneration contribution is expected to be the largest. Moreover, the MTD opens the door for separating different $\\Upsilon$ states for the first time at STAR as the Bremsstrahlung radiation for muons is much smaller compared to electrons. In this talk, we present the measurements of $J/\\psi$ suppression, quantified as the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm{AA}}$,  and $v_{2}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV down to zero $p_{\\rm{T}}$. These measurements bring extra insights into the $J/\\psi$ production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the measurement of different $\\Upsilon$ states is explored within the precision of the available statistics.",

The shapes are measured with a constituent cutoff of 0.15 GeV and small jet resolution $R=0.2$.  New techniques for background subtraction are applied and a 2D unfolding is performed to correct the shapes to particle level. We further present differential studies of jet suppression measured via full jet $R_{\\rm AA}$ as function of sub-jet structure. We systematically study the jet $R_{\\rm AA}$ by selecting jets with different sub-jet structure (using  collinear and infrared safe observable(s) that are robust against heavy-ion background) and present comparison to a variety of jet quenching Monte Carlo models.",

Moreover, the gauge boson (Z0, W\u00b1) production in association with hadron that fragments from the incoming quark is calculated, and then applied to study gauge boson-hadron correlations at LHC energies. This provides a complementary analysis tool to prompt-photon\u2013hadron and hadron-hadron correlations within the color dipole formalism.\r\nAs a very promising measurement we suggest to study correlations between forward high-pT pion and J/psi or Y produced at mid-rapidity at RHIC energies. Such forward-midrapidity correlations test higher order pQCD in pp collisions at modest energies.

We confirm this dual condensate exhibits the similar temperature dependence as the\r\nconventional Polyakov-loop.

On the other hand, the dressed Polyakov-loop shows abnormal thermal behavior, which even\r\ndecreases with $T$ at low temperatures due to the influence of pion condensate.

The advantage of using this method is that we can suppress non-flow (e.g from jets and/or resonances) in addition to suppressing self-correlation effects. We measure the correlation between different flow harmonics  (both magnitude and event plane angle direction) and estimate non-linear coefficients of the hydrodynamic response In this presentation, our methods will be discussed in detail, and our results will be compared to the AMPT simulation and various hydrodynamic calculations.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

We then demonstrate that the SO(3)_q symmetry in de Sitter space further constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form. The resulting system of two coupled ordinary differential equations for the de Sitter-space momentum scale and anisotropy parameter are solved numerically and compared to a recently obtained exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We show that anisotropic hydrodynamics describes the spatio-temporal evolution of the system better than all currently known dissipative hydrodynamics approaches.

Due to their large masses, the production process of heavy quarks is essentially restricted to primordial nucleon-nucleon collisions. Thus, heavy quarks are clean probes to study the hot and dense matter because they carry information about the entire time-evolution of the medium.\r\nThe Silicon Vertex Tracker (VTX) was installed in the RHIC-PHENIX detector in year 2011.\r\nThe VTX was designed to give precise tracking reconstructions of the distance of closest approach (DCA) to the collision vertex in order to distinguish prompt particles from in-flight decays. In this way, we will be able to statistically separate electrons from semi-leptonic decay of heavy flavor hadrons. In order to extract the heavy flavor contributions from DCA     distribution, understanding of background and its subtraction from the DCA distribution play crucial roles.

The ratios of $\\eta/\\pi^0$ in $\\rm p+p$ and in central $\\rm Au+Au$ collisions at $200$~GeV are found to overlap in a wide $p_T$ region, which matches well the measured ratio $\\eta / \\pi^0$ by PHENIX. We demonstrate that, at the asymptotic region when $p_{T} \\rightarrow \\infty$ the ratios of $\\eta/\\pi^{0}$ in both $\\rm Au+Au$ and $\\rm p+p$ are almost determined only by quark jets fragmentation and thus approach to the one in $e^{+} e^{-}$ scattering; in addition, the almost identical gluon (quark) contribution fractions to $\\eta$ and to $\\pi$ result in a rather moderate variation of $\\eta/\\pi^{0}$ distribution at intermediate and high $p_T$ region in $\\rm A+A$ relative to that in $\\rm p+p$; while a slight higher $\\eta/\\pi^{0}$ at small $p_T$ in $\\rm Au+Au$ can be observed due to larger suppression of gluon contribution fraction to $\\pi^{0}$ as compared to the one to $\\eta$.

      "Country": "PL",
      "Abstract": "Conservation laws strongly influence particle production. Effects connected to this mechanism were studied in details using correlation techniques in $e^+e^-$ collisions. At the time models were tuned to correctly reproduce measured data [1]. Similar studies for hadron-hadron collisions have never been performed, until recent ALICE measurement [2]. ALICE reported on studies of untriggered two-particle angular correlations of identified particles ($\\pi$, K, and p) measured in pp collisions at center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} =$ 7 TeV. The ALICE results confirm that also in hadron-hadron collisions conservation laws strongly influence the shape of the correlation functions for different particle types and must be taken into account while analysing the data. Moreover, now, when ALICE results are available, it can be observed that the contemporary models (Pythia, Phojet) no longer reproduce the data well. It should be noted, that also in heavy-ion collisions conservation laws (i.e. local charge conservation) provide crucial elements that are needed to describe experimental data [3]. \r\n\r\nIn the talk we would like to present a brief history of experimental measurements of correlations induced by conservation laws, also including the newest Preliminary results from ALICE. We explain interesting structures observed in ALICE LHC data employing a dedicated model, called CALM (ConservAtion Laws Model). CALM is a model developed to study analytically the influence of the conservation laws on the shape of the $\\Delta\\eta\\Delta\\phi$ correlation functions. With this model we demonstrate that local conservation of charge, strangeness, and baryon number in hadron production mechanism is essential for description of experimental data.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] H.

      "Abstract": "The study of event-by-event fluctuations of identified hadrons may reveal the degrees of freedom of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions and reflect the underlying dynamics of the system. The observable $\\nu_{dyn}$ , which is given in terms of the moments of identified-particle multiplicity distributions, is used to quantify the magnitude of the dynamical fluctuations in event-by- event measurements of given particle ratios. The ALICE detector at the LHC is well suited for the study of $\\nu_{dyn}$, due to its excellent particle identification capabilities.\r\nParticle identification that is based on the measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss dE/dx works well on a statistical basis, but suffers from ambiguities when applied on the event-by- event level. A novel experimental technique called the \"Identity Method\" was recently proposed to overcome such limitations. The method follows a probabilistic approach using the inclusive dE/dx distributions measured in the ALICE TPC, and determines the moments of the multiplicity distributions by an unfolding procedure. In this contribution, an analysis of identified particle ratio fluctuations that applies the Identity Method to Pb-Pb data from ALICE will be presented.",

While pp collisions provide a reference measurement for a medium-free environment, the impact of cold nuclear matter effects on the dielectron production can be estimated from p-Pb collisions. Moreover, the measurement of low-mass dileptons has a high sensitivity to the production of charmed mesons at low $p_{T}$ via their decay into correlated $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs.\r\n\r\nIn this poster the results of the dielectron measurements at mid-rapidity in minimum bias p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Recently the results of HBT measurements of charged pions with respect to the second and third order event plane are presented by PHENIX [1]. They extract $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$ from the HBT measurements which contain information about not only the source shape at freezeout but also the space-time evolution of QGP matter.  They show the relation between initial $\\epsilon_{2, 3}$ which are obtained from a Glauber model and final $\\epsilon_{2,3}$ which are extracted from the HBT radii. They find that the final $\\epsilon_2$ from the HBT radii is finite and smaller than the initial $\\epsilon_2$. On the other hand, the final $\\epsilon_3$ is significantly reduced and potential reversed by the end in spite of existence of finite initial $\\epsilon_3$. The interesting different response of $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$  during space-time evolution gives us a clue to understand the detailed QGP properties. \r\n\r\nFor analyses of such high statistics experimental results, we develop a state of the art numerical scheme of causal viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion collisions, which has a shock-wave capturing scheme and less numerical dissipation [2]. Furthermore, using the hydrodynamic algorithm, we construct a hybrid model of hydrodynamic model plus UrQMD to include the realistic freezeout processes.  Using the model we investigate the time evolution of spatial anisotropies $\\epsilon_n$. We find that the sign of $\\epsilon_3$ changes from positive to negative during the space-time evolution, which suggests a solution of the vanishing final $\\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii by PHENIX. From detailed analyses,  we discuss the initial conditions of hydrodynamic model and the detailed QGP properties such as transport coefficients.  \r\n\r\n[1] A.Adare et al.

      "Abstract": "We study effects of hadronic rescattering on final observables for\r\nmulti-strange hadrons in high-energy nuclear collisions within an\r\nintegrated dynamical model. We simulate the whole collision process on\r\nan event-by-event basis by using a fully (3+1)-dimensional ideal\r\nhydrodynamic description for the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and a\r\nsubsequent kinetic transport description for the hadron resonance gas.\r\n\r\nThe QGP created in a collision expands, cools down and then turns into\r\nhadron gas. In the last stage of the collisions, hadrons continue to\r\nscatter with each other. Therefore observed hadron spectra are, in\r\ngeneral, contaminated by the hadronic rescatterings. In order to probe\r\nthe QGP more directly, multi-strange hadrons, in particular $\\phi$-meson\r\nand $\\Omega$-baryon, can be utilized since multi-strange hadrons have\r\nsmall scattering cross-sections and less scatter with non-strange\r\nhadrons. Thus final observables of $\\phi$-mesons and $\\Omega$-baryons\r\nare expected to reflect the properties of the system just after\r\nhadronization.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, violation of mass ordering in $v_2(p_{\\rm T})$ was\r\npredicted by using a hydro + cascade hybrid model and thereafter\r\nobserved by the STAR collaboration. Following this work, we scrutinize\r\nmulti-strange hadron spectra at both RHIC and LHC energies by using a\r\nmore sophisticated integrated dynamical model towards comprehensive\r\nunderstanding of this phenomenon. In addition to $v_2(p_{\\rm T})$, we\r\ninvestigate the hadronic rescattering effects on mean transverse momenta\r\n($\\langle p_{\\rm T} \\rangle$) and $p_{\\rm T}$-averaged $v_2$ of hadrons\r\nincluding heavier multi-strange hadrons such as $\\Xi$- and\r\n$\\Omega$-baryons. We also discuss the collision energy dependence of the\r\nhadronic rescattering effects on the violation of mass ordering behavior\r\nand show that multi-strange hadrons can be used as \u201cpenetrating probes\u201d\r\nof the QGP.",

We calculate the elliptic, $v_2$, and triangular, $v_3$, Fourier coefficients of the two-particle azimuthal correlation function in p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. Our results for $v_3$ are in a good agreement with the CMS data. The $v_2$ coefficient is very well described in p+Pb collisions and is underestimated for higher $p_T$ in Pb+Pb collisions. The characteristic mass ordering of $v_2$ in p+Pb is also reproduced whereas for $v_3$ such ordering is not observed [2]. An escape mechanism has been proposed recently to explain these successful model results [3]. We investigate this issue in detail and show that collisions between active partons are directly responsible for generating the final $v_n$.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n 1.

The calculations have been carried out by estimating the pp cross-sections at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV within the framework of NRQCD [J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part. Phys. 42 065101 (2015)]. The cross-sections have been scaled by the Glauber model for Pb-Pb collisions and convoluted with the survival probability fraction due to color screening [Phys. Rev. D 37, 1851 (1988)]. The feed-down contributions from $\\psi$(2S), $\\chi_{c}$ and $B$ mesons to J/$\\psi$ have been included to compare the inclusive results from ALICE. The comparison with experimental values shows a good agreement beyond $p_{\\rm T}$ = 4 GeV for the three centrality bins namely, 0%$-$20%, 20%$-$40% and 40%$-$90%. These results indicate that the cold nuclear matter and recombination effects on J/$\\psi$ production at forward rapidities in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV is negligible for $p_{\\rm T}$ $>$ 4 GeV.

      "Abstract": "Femtoscopic analyses have a long history towards comprehensive\r\nunderstanding of the space-time structure of dynamically evolving matter\r\ncreated in high-energy nuclear collisions. Among them, the source\r\nimaging technique enables us to extract the source function, namely\r\ndistribution of the relative distance between two emission points for\r\nobserved particles, directly from two particle correlation functions.\r\nSince the source function looks no longer a Gaussian in general, it\r\ncontains richer information about the space-time distribution of\r\nemission source than HBT radii and is an ideal quantity to compare\r\nexperimental data with theoretical results. In this study, we discuss\r\none- and three-dimensional source functions for pions and kaons from a\r\nhydro + hadronic cascade hybrid model simulations [1]. Our model\r\nconsists of event-by-event Glauber-type initial conditions,\r\n(3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics for the quark gluon plasma and a\r\nhadronic cascade for the hadron resonance gas. We first confirm the\r\n$p_{T}$ spectra for pions and kaons are reproduced well. We next\r\ncalculate one-dimensional source function of pions and kaons in Au + Au\r\ncollisions at the top RHIC energy and find that hadronic rescatterings\r\nplay a significant role to describe non-Gaussian tail which was observed\r\nby the PHENIX Collaboration. We also analyze three-dimensional source\r\nfunctions at the RHIC energy, where a special attention is paid to\r\nobtain the source function by decomposing them into coefficients of\r\nCartesian spherical harmonics as the PHENIX Collaboration employed the\r\nsame technique. Finally we also predict the source functions of pions\r\nand kaons from hybrid model simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC\r\nenergy and compare them with the ones at the RHIC energy.\r\n\r\n[1] T.Hirano et al., Prog.

In addition to the attractive terms, the potential has confining \r\nterms both at $T = 0$ and $T \\neq 0 $, compared to the calculations usually done in the \r\nliterature, where only the Coulomb-like term is present in the deconfined phase. The \r\npotential also develops an (negative) imaginary part above a critical separation, $r_c (= \r\n0.53 z_h )$.

Nominally, $v_{2}$ is expected to be a monotonically decreasing function of rapidity from the Au going direction to the $^{3}He$ going direction. PHENIX's Silicon Vertex Detector (VTX) has a wide mid-pseudorapidity coverage ($eta$ < |1.5|) which allows for the measurement of $dN_{charge}$/d$eta$. When the VTX is coupled with information from PHENIX's forward detectors in the Au going direction, such as the MPC (-3.8 < $eta$ < -3.1), a measurement of $v_{2}$ in several $eta$ bins can be made.\r\n\r\nThis poster will present the latest status of analysis of the $dN_{charge}$/d$eta$ and $v_{2}$ pseudorapidity dependence in $^{3}He$+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector at RHIC.

In particular, we discuss event-averaged results for energy density and energy flow as well as for longitudinal and transverse pressure of this system.  Our results are generally applicable if $\\tau < 1/Q_s$.  The transverse energy flow of the gluon field exhibits hydrodynamic-like contributions that follow transverse gradients of the energy density. In addition, a rapidity-odd energy flow also emerges from the non-abelian analog of Gauss' Law and generates non-vanishing angular momentum of the field.

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Dissociation of heavy quarkonia is expected to happen in the quark-gluon plasma due to the Debye screening, which causes suppression of quarkonium yields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Actually the $J/\\psi$ suppression in SPS, RHIC and LHC as well as the sequential $\\Upsilon$ suppression in LHC have been observed. However, since there are not only the medium effect but also other processes, e.g. cold nuclear matter effects, to contribute to the quarkonium suppression and production, the experimental results are still not fully understood. Therefore theoretical understanding of in-medium quarkonium properties plays an important role to explain the experimental data. Moreover, since the elliptic flow suggesting collective motion of heavy quarks due to the hydrodynamic effects has been observed, in-medium behavior of a single heavy quark is also of great theoretical interest.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we report our study on charmonium and bottomonium in lattice QCD at finite temperature. Similarly to a previous study [1] simulations have been performed on large and fine isotropic lattices by using quenched gauge field configurations. A couple of lattice spacings towards the continuum limit were also chosen. At temperatures in a range from 0.73$T_c$ to 2.2$T_c$ we construct charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators which have been computed in our previous studies\r\n[2,3]. From the temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions we discuss the dissociation of the quarkonium states. We will also extract the transport properties of heavy quarks from the spectral function in the vector channel and estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient for both charm and bottom.\r\n\r\n[1] H.-T.

      "Speaker": "Di-Lun Yang",
      "Institute": "University of Crete",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A semi-holographic approach combining the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to study a gluon plasma which consists of hard and soft degrees of freedom, where the former is at the saturation scale of QCD and the latter is around the temperature of the quark gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model aims at analyzing gluonic transport in the phase after the thermalization of soft degrees of freedom. The hard sector is presumed to be weakly interacting, where its dynamics is characterized by kinetic theory with the collisional term incorporating the scattering of hard and soft gluons. In contrast, the soft sector is strongly interacting, which could be described by an infrared conformal field theory (IR-CFT) as the gauge theory dual of a supergravity theory in thermal equilibrium. In general, the dynamics of the IR-CFT could be captured by hydrodynamics and the interaction with the hard sector then appears as a driving force thorough the conservation equation, while the input of holography is to obtain the transport coefficients. The corrections on both sectors could be solved order by order in terms of the marginal coupling of two sectors on the boundary. It is found that the correction on the hard gluons is sub-leading compared with that on the soft gluons. In early times, the hard gluons could be characterized by classical Yang-Mills theory with large occupation numbers. In the longitudinal expanding system, the energy density of the IR-CFT receives non-hydrodynamic correction, which depends on the dynamics of the hard gluons captured by the non-thermal attractor solution. In late times, we may expect the thermalization of the hard sector, which then gives rise to hydrodynamic correction on the soft sector.",

      "Country": "V",
      "Abstract": "A strongly interacting medium, namely Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), is formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Light nuclei (anti-nuclei) can be produced in such heavy-ion collisions by the recombination of produced nucleons (anti-nucleons) or stopped nucleons. This formation process is called final-state coalescence. The production of light nuclei is dependent on the baryon density and the correlation (freeze-out) volume. Therefore, by studying the yield and azimuthal anisotropy of light nuclei (anti-nuclei) and comparing them with that of proton (anti-proton) we can gain insight in the particle production mechanism via coalescence and physical properties of the expanding system at the thermal  freeze-out. Unlike the quark coalescence phenomena of identified hadrons, nucleonic coalescence is directly measurable as both the light nuclei and nucleons (proton and anti-proton) are measured by the detectors in a given experiment. \r\n    In this poster, we will show the invariant yields of $d$ and \r\n$\\overline{d}$ for  Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\tiny{NN}}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV from the STAR experiment at RHIC. Light nuclei are identified using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) detector of the STAR experiment. The ToF detector enhances the identification of the light nuclei and extends the $p_{T}$ reach of light nuclei beyond 1 GeV/c. The $p_{T}$ spectra of nuclei will be compared with $p$ $(\\overline{p})$ to obtain the nuclei to nucleon ratio and $B_{2}$ parameter to understand the light nuclei production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. Light nuclei spectra will also be compared with the prediction from Blast-wave model, using the fit parameters obtained from Blast-wave fit of $\\pi$, $K$, $p$ spectra.",

      "Abstract": "Nature of dark matter (DM) is not known in both particle physics and astrophysics perspectives. Recently, there are lots of arguments to give some constraints on the physical quantities of DM by using neutron stars (NSs) when it is assumed to be weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). If DM is the WIMP, there exists a finite DM-nucleon cross section, which may result in DM capture in NSs. Once DM is captured, it could have various sizable effects on NSs. So from the NS observations, one can provide some constraints on DM properties such as the mass and the cross sections. Here we propose some new effect. If DM is a boson, it might be able to form a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC).  In this presentation, we discuss a possibility that such a BEC state of DM can influence the magnetic field or the magnetic field formation of NSs.",

PHENIX Au+Au data recorded at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV during RHIC run 14 benefit from the background rejection capability of the silicon vertex detector, enabling the extraction of a higher purity hadron signal.

      "Abstract": "The LHC data on hadron production, transverse-momentum spectra, and particle correlations in Pb+Pb collisions demonstrate a peculiar behavior [1,2], which can be interpreted as a coherent emission of pions with low momenta [2-5]. It can be a consequence of the prior gluon condensation [6,7], or the overcooling of the quark-qluon plasma deeply into the hadronic phase [8]. In both cases a possible consequence is the formation of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of pions at the freeze-out. The presence of the condensate decreases the non-equilibrium parameters [5], and therefore improves the agreement of the non-equilibrium thermal model with the data for heavy nuclei. The combined analysis of the hadronic multiplicities and the pion transverse momentum spectra indicates that about 5% of pions at each centrality of the collision could be in the condensate [5]. The data on two- and three-pion correlations support even larger coherent fraction of 23% [2]. This could be the consequence of the fact that correlations are much more sensitive observables [9]. The correlated pions have a momentum below 150-200 MeV [5,8]. It is on the edge of the current acceptance range of the LHC [1,8]. Therefore some efforts are required in order to clarify whether the BEC of pions is reached. However, if the BEC of pions is formed, then its temperature is 10^10 times higher than the temperature of the famous BEC of ultra-cold atoms. There are also much higher densities, smaller volumes and different interaction forces involved. The studies of the properties of the high temperature pion condensate could open a wide new field of research, similar to the studies of the BEC of ultra-cold atoms. This talk is proposed to bring the attention of the heavy-ion community to this interesting and promising opportunity.",

A full assessment of this suppression requires understanding of nuclear effects which may affect the production of quarkonium states even in the absence of the medium.  The study of quarkonium production in proton-nucleus collisions serves as a baseline for understanding heavy-ion collisions and furthers our knowledge of such nuclear effects.  Using proton-lead and proton-proton collision data collected at the LHC in 2013, the ATLAS experiment measures J/psi, psi(2S) and Upsilon(nS) production. The yields of charmonium states are separated into contributions from b-hadron decays and prompt production. The nuclear modification factors and excited-to-ground state ratios are presented. All quarkonium states are reconstructed via the dimuon decay channel and the yields are shown differentially in intervals of transverse momentum, rapidity and event activity.",

      "Abstract": "Dilepton measurements play an essential role in the study of hot and dense nuclear matter, created in heavy-ion collisions. Dileptons are produced in the whole evolution of the system and escape with minimum interaction with the strongly interacting medium. Thus, they provide information about the various stages of the system during the evolution. In the low mass region ($M_{ee}<1.1$ $GeV/c^{2}$), they retain information about the in-medium modifications of vector mesons which are considered as a link to chiral symmetry restoration. Recently, it is found in a model calculation that the charged particle multiplicity normalized dilepton excess yield in the low mass region is proportional to the lifetime of the hot, dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6-200 $GeV$ [1]. The energy density created in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ is expected to be higher by about 20% and the medium created might have a longer lifetime compared with the Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 $GeV$. Thus it would be interesting to compare the normalized dielectron excess yields in U+U and Au+Au collisions. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and centrality dependent measurements of dielectron production in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$. With the acceptance correction applied, we will report the invariant dielectron excess mass spectra in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ and in Au+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27, 39, and 62.4 $GeV$. Comparisons with the NA60 results and the STAR measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 19.6 and 200 $GeV$ will be shown. System-size and energy dependences of low mass excess yield will be discussed together with model comparisons.\r\n\r\n[1] R. Rapp and H. van Hees, arXiv: 1411.4612.",

The charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of a hadron gas with unit-charged particles. We investigate the evolution of fluctuations in rapidity space, which hints at signal damping as a function of rapidity.

      "Abstract": "Experimental evidence indicates that the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC behaves like a strongly coupled liquid. These features are intimately related to the infrared (IR) behavior of QCD at finite temperature and present a challenge for conventional perturbative approaches. A way to tackle this obstacle is to improve the description of soft non-Abelian gauge degrees of freedom (DoF) using Gribov's quantization. In consequence, a physical scale, which at high temperature corresponds to the (chromo)magnetic scale, is induced in the system. We discuss how this novel framework affects the relevant quark collective DoF's. Strikingly, we uncover a previously unknown massless mode which is protected by a novel non-Abelian magnetic scaling. As a result, the quark spectral function violates positivity, a well-known feature of confinement. This sheds new light on the interplay of quasi-particle DoF's and genuine long-range modes in the deconfined pase of QCD. Within the same framework, we also discuss the impact of the modified IR dynamics on the jet quenching parameter. We calculate its temperature dependence and find a strong enhancement near the phase transition that is in line with the expectation of a strongly coupled QGP.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nN. Su and K.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are produced at the initial fusion of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. After their production, they propagate through the quark gluon plasma and lose energy by colliding with quarks and gluons and by radiating gluons. After their production, they may also get fragmented into heavy mesons by picking up light quarks/antiquarks and in turn may decay through leptonic channels. These leptons would carry information of the initial stage of heavy ion collisions and also the evolution of the plasma.  In this work, we calculate the elliptic flow of muons from heavy flavours decay at forward rapidities in Pb+Pb collision. \r\nThe transverse momentum distribution of heavy quarks produced from the initial fusion of partons, is calculated by FONLL ( Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Logarithms) approach. We consider both radiative and collisional energy loss along with a boost-invariant expansion of the plasma for the calculation of elliptic flow. The fragmentation of heavy quarks into mesons is governed by Peterson fragmentation function.  We compare our result at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE Preliminary data.   \r\nReferences:  \r\n1. R.

      "Abstract": "Experiments at RHIC and LHC are on the quest to unearth the nature of\r\nthe QCD phase transition and to get a glimpse of how matter behaves at\r\nsuch extreme conditions. Phase transitions are governed by a set of\r\nthermodynamic parameters, like, temperature ($T$), pressure, entropy,\r\nand energy density ($E$), and can be further characterized by their\r\nresponse functions, like, specific heat,\r\ncompressibility, and susceptibility. In thermodynamics, the heat\r\ncapacity ($C$) is defined in terms of the ratio of the event-by-event\r\nfluctuations of the energy of a part of a finite system in thermal\r\nequilibrium to the energy ${(\\Delta E^2)} = {T^2}C(T)$. This can be\r\napplied for a locally thermalized system produced during the evolution\r\nof heavy-ion collisions. But for a system at freeze-out, specific heat\r\ncan expressed in terms of the event-by-event fluctuations in temperature\r\nof the system where volume is fixed: $ \\frac{1}{C} = \\frac{(\\langle T^2\r\n\\rangle - \\langle T \\rangle ^2 )}{\\langle T \\rangle ^2}$.

      "Abstract": "We are developing a future heavy-ion program at J-PARC, which is one of the world\u2019s highest intensity proton synchrotrons. In heavy-ion collisions at J-PARC, matter whose density is 8-10 times as high as the normal nuclear density, comparable to that of the neutron star core will be created. There, we aim at exploring QCD phase structures such as the critical point and phase boundaries, and studying modifications of the strong interaction at high baryon density through the investigation of hadron properties and production of exotic hadrons and nuclei.\r\nIons up to U will be accelerated to 1-19 AGeV ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2-6.2$ GeV) at the beam rate up to $10^{11}$ ions per cycle of Main Ring synchrotron (MR). We have designed a heavy-ion acceleration scheme with a new linac and a booster as the injector, combined with the existing 3-GeV Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 50-GeV MR that have been proven to accelerate high-rate proton beams. \r\nIn heavy-ion experiments, we will measure electrons and muons to study the chiral restoration of vector mesons, and the event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges to search for the critical point in addition to the conventional systematic studies of various hadrons in the wide energy range. We will also measure particle correlations to study the properties of particle interactions. Last but not least, we will also search for exotic hadrons and nuclei such as dibaryons, kaonic nuclei, and measure hypernuclei at high density, which is one of the important topics in hadron physics. We are designing a large acceptance heavy-ion spectrometer based on a Toroidal magnet to measure hadrons, lepton pairs, and event-by-event fluctuations. We are also designing a closed geometry spectrometer to measure hypernuclei to study weak decays and magnetic moments.\r\nIn this presentation, the preliminary version of the designed acceleration scheme, as well as the spectrometers and their expected performance and physics results are presented.",

      "Abstract": "The suppression of upsilon Y(1S) states in AA collisions, observed by the STAR collaboration at RHIC and by the CMS and ALICE collaboration at LHC, is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the quark gluon plasma. The precise survival of excited Y(2S) and Y(3S) states vs ground state could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions, according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature. \r\n\r\nIn our contribution, we address the question of upsilon dissociation resorting to a dynamical approach, i.e. the non-linear Schroedinger-Langevin equation (SLE). In this scheme, the time-dependent real potential implements the Debye-screening while the stochastic forces express the (hard) interactions between the QGP and the $b\\bar b$ state, possibly leading to instantaneous dissociation. The SLE preserves unitarity and enables to treat the transitions between bound and open quantum states, which are mocked up resorting to imaginary potential in other treatments. It allows to consider a realistic compact initial state, made of a linear superposition of upsilon eigenstates and to preserve quantum coherence in the time-evolution of the $b\\bar b$ pair.\r\nIn a stationary QGP, our SLE naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of {Y(1S), Y(2S),...} following correct statistical weights, which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination. This sanity check is a unique feature of our approach.\r\n \r\nWe will describe the main ingredients of our SLE as well as some of its most important properties. We will then present the suppression prediction resulting from SLE embedded in state-of-the-art evolution scenario of the QGP background, both for RHIC and LHC energies. The relations with other theoretical frameworks will also be described.\r\n\r\nRef.: arxiv 1504.08087",

      "Abstract": "With the recently measured Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 14.5~GeV, STAR completed its first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC. The main motivation of the BES program is the study of the QCD phase diagram and the search for a conjectured critical point. Amongst the various collision energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39~GeV, that have been previously presented by STAR, collisions at 14.5~GeV will provide data set in the relatively large chemical potential gap between the 11.5 and 19.6~GeV center-of-mass energies. In this contribution, we report new STAR measurements of Au$+$Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=14.5~GeV that involve identified light particle R$_{CP}$ and spectra, as well as measurements of the strange hadrons ($K^0_{s}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, $\\Omega$ and $\\phi$). The spectra from both light and strange particles cover a significant range of the intermediate transverse momentum (2 $<p_T<$ 5~GeV/c) in all beam energies. This provides a unique set of data for a systematic study of the baryon-to-meson ratio at intermediate $p_T$ from BES Phase I. We will discuss its physics implications and whether hadronic interactions at late stage dominate the collision dynamics.",

It is shown that a given spin state of the intermediate resonance exhibits a characteristic angular dependence of the spin-anisotropy coefficient. Furthermore, the anisotropy coefficient resulting from the interference between resonances with different spin is presented. Our results show that the polarization of the photon provides information that is useful for disentangling the resonance contributions to elementary di-lepton production processes [W. Przygoda (HADES Collaboration), talk presented at The 10th International Workshop on the Physics of Excited Nucleons, NSTAR2015, 25-28 May 2015, Osaka].

      "Abstract": "The by now well-established scalar-isoscalar resonance f0(500) (the \u03c3 meson) seems potentially relevant in evaluation of thermodynamic quantities of a hadronic gas, since its mass is low. In this talk, based on the recent work of Ref. [1], we show that its contribution to isospin-averaged observables is, to a surprising accuracy, canceled by the repulsion from the pion-pion scalar-isotensor channel. As a result, in practice one should not incorporate f0(500) in standard hadronic resonance-gas models for studies of isospin averaged quantities. In our analysis we use the formalism of the virial expansion, which allows one to calculate the thermal properties of an interacting hadron gas in terms of derivatives of the scattering phase shifts, hence in a model-independent way directly from experimentally accessible quantities. A similar cancellation mechanism occurs for the scalar kaonic interactions between I=1/2 channel (containing the alleged K\u22170(800) or the \u03ba meson) and the I=3/2 channel.\r\n\r\n[1] W.

      "Abstract": "Heavy mesons are one of the few probes which allow for studying the properties of a plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To do this we have to follow the heavy quarks from their production point through the QGP up to the final rescattering of heavy mesons with hadrons after the hadronization. \r\nThe interaction of heavy quarks in the QPG is calculated in pQCD with a running coupling constant and including elastic as well as radiative collisions (arXiv 1307.5270). Due to event by event fluctuations the interaction of heavy mesons in the hadronic phase depends on the light quarks/mesons which are produced simultaneously with the heavy quarks during the initial phase of the heavy ion reaction. Therefore the observables of the heavy and light hadrons are correlated and both have to be studied simultaneously. \r\nCombining the event generator EPOS with our Heavy Quark approach we can for the first time present event-by-event results simultaneously for the light and heavy meson sector and overcome by this uncertainties of the heavy quark observables due to the ambiguities in the plasma expansion  (arXiv:1102.1114).\r\nWe will present detailed studies for pA in which also a (small) plasma is created to explore cold nuclear matter effects and an analysis of  AA collisions, simultaneously in the light and heavy mesons sector  to show which information about the elementary interaction between heavy quarks  and partons is contained in the presently available data.",

These corrections are of quantum origin and their leading terms are of second order in the gradients of the thermodynamic fields. The relevant coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the Lorentz group. With respect to previous assessments, we find that there are more second order coefficients and that all thermodynamic functions including energy density receive acceleration and vorticity dependent corrections. Notably, also the relation between $\\rho$ and p, that is the equation of state, is affected by acceleration and vorticity. We have calculated the corrections for a free real scalar field -- both massive and massless -- and we have found that they increase, particularly for a massive field, at very high acceleration and vorticity and very low temperature. Finally, these non-ideal terms depend on the explicit form of the stress-energy operator, meaning that different stress-energy tensor of the scalar field -- canonical or improved -- are thermodynamically inequivalent.",

      "Abstract": "We have developed a hadronization model for jet parton showers based on the quark recombination model. Gluons at the end of a perturbative shower evolution undergo a non-perturbative splitting into quark and antiquark pairs, then a Monte-Carlo version of instantaneous quark recombination is applied. Finally remnant quarks (those which have not found a recombination partner) are connected by color strings and subjected to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to parton showers from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, the final hadron spectra from our calculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been hadronized with the default Lund string fragmentation. This hadronization model readily generalizes to jet showers emerging from a quark gluon plasma by allowing recombination of shower partons with thermal partons, sampled from fluid dynamics or blast wave models.  We find that the recombination of shower and thermal partons leads to a significant enhancement of intermediate transverse momentum pions and protons at both RHIC and LHC. Our results thus suggest that medium modification of jet fragmentation provides a plausible explanation for the enhanced production of intermediate transverse momentum hadrons and the changed hadron chemistry observed in experiments. A computer code based on this vacuum and medium hadronization model has been developed within the JET collaboration and can be combined with existing jet shower Monte Carlo codes.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Interaction of heavy quarks with particles in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) results in the heavy quark energy loss. In the nonrelativistic regime, the effective theory for this process is the Langevin equation, a classic example in the nonequilibrium physics. In the heavy-ion collisions, several studies have applied the Langevin dynamics to phenomenology and tried to interpret the experimental data of nuclear modification factor (R_AA) and elliptic flow (v2) of charm quarks.\r\n\r\n  In this talk, I would like to introduce a new aspect to the Langevin dynamics, namely the dynamics of heavy quark color charge [1]. In the perturbative picture, each scattering rotates heavy quark color into a new color state and causes a macroscopic superposition state (Schr\u00f6dinger's cat state) of the momentum. To derive classical descriptions of the Langevin dynamics, the quantum interference of the superposition must be destroyed by decoherence. I estimated this time scale to be \\sqrt(M/\\gamma), where \\gamma is the momentum diffusion constant of heavy quarks. This time scale should be the lower limit of the discretization of the Langevin equation. Interestingly, this is estimated to be about 3-5fm for charm and bottom quarks, which is not small enough compared to the QGP lifetime so that the na\u00efve application of Langevin equation to heavy-ion physics might be questioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nReference:  \r\n[1] Yukinao Akamatsu, arXiv:1503.08110 [nucl-th].",

The $v_{jet}^{2}$ is in good agreement with the recent ATLAS data. However, the $v_{jet}^{3}$ shows a smaller magnitude than $v_{jet}^{2}$ , and approaches zero at a larger transverse momentum. It is attributed to the path-length dependence in which the jet energy loss fraction depends on the azimuthal angles with respect to different orders of event planes. The ratio $v_{jet}^{n}$ /$\u03b5_{n}$ increases from peripheral to noncentral collisions, and $v_{jet}^{n}$ increases with the initial spatial asymmetry ($\u03b5_n$) for a given centrality bin. These behaviors indicate that the $v_{jet}^{n}$ is produced by the strong interactions between jet and the partonic medium with different initial geometry shapes. Therefore, azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jet are proposed as a good probe to study the initial spatial fluctuations, which are expected to provide constraints on the path-length dependence of jet quenching models.",

      "Abstract": "The QGP created at RHIC and LHC behaves like a perfect fluid, which suggests it reaches thermal equilibrium state. Stability of thermal equilibrium state is a consequence of an interplay between thermal fluctuation and dissipation. On the other hand, only dissipation has been taken into account in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for the past years. In addition to dissipation, thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution (a.k.a., hydrodynamic fluctuation) must be taken into account to consistently describe the dynamics of the QGP. To study this, causal fluctuating hydrodynamics was formulated [1] and implemented in numerical hydrodynamic simulations recently [2]\r\n\r\n   In this study, we apply this framework to the (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion and show that, under some limited conditions, the dynamics of the QGP satisfies \"stationary fluctuation theorem\" [3] which was established in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Through this theorem, we focus on the entropy fluctuation and claim that the thermal fluctuation becomes more important in the smaller systems such as p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. We further investigate the effects of finite relaxation time in causal hydrodynamics and find it significantly affects the final entropy distribution. This suggests we have an opportunity to extract some information about relaxation time from final observables on multiplicity.\r\n\r\n[1] K. Murase and T. Hirano, arXiv:1304.3243.\r\n\r\n[2] K.

We have studied the dependance of radiative decay width on the mass of the constituting mesons  and on the binding energies. Besides this, we have also included finite size effects in terms of size parameter $\\Lambda_H$ which gives appropriate physical description of the heavy hadron molecule. This analysis can shed light on their still unresolved structure. In this work, we have focused particularly on $Y(3940)$ and $Y(4140)$ states. We have predicted $Y(3940)$  state as a molecular bound state of $D^{*0}$ and $ \\bar D^{*0}$ and $Y(4140)$ as a loosely bound molecular state of ${D}_s^{*}$ and $\\bar {D}_s^{*}$. The narrow decay widths of these states are in good agreement with the available experimental data given by BELLE and BaBar experiments.  The predictions for the radiative decays can serve further to distinguish between the different structure identification of these heavy hadron states.

      "Abstract": "Because of their large masses and long lifetimes, heavy quarks are dominantly produced from initial hard parton scattering processes and can experience the whole evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Therefore heavy quarks have been suggested as excellent probes to study the properties of the QGP. Measurements of non-prompt J/\u03c8 produced from B hadron decays are very interesting because they may provide an opportunity to access bottom quark production in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Such measurements have become possible with the installation of the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) and Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) into the STAR experiment in 2014. The HFT can precisely measure track impact parameters, and thus allows a separation between prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 through measuring their decay lengths. The MTD enables J/\u03c8 reconstruction in the dimuon channel at STAR for the first time, which is important for J/\u03c8 measurements at transverse momentum $p_{T}$<5 GeV/c and complementary to those in the dielectron channel at higher $p_{T}$.  In this poster, we will discuss the current status and prospect of non-prompt J/\u03c8 measurements in both the dielectron and the dimuon channels using the p+p, p+Au and Au+Au data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV taken in 2014-2016 with the STAR experiment.",

      "Abstract": "The study of heavy-quark production (charm and beauty) in pp collisions at LHC energies allows us to test perturbative QCD calculations and provides a reference for studies in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements in p--Pb collisions help to characterize the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the collision (cold nuclear matter effects). ALICE has provided measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ in the heavy-flavour sector. More differential measurements of charm and beauty production in pp and p--Pb collisions can provide further insight on the above topics.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of angular correlations between heavy-flavour particles and charged particles allows us to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and is sensitive to their production mechanism. Differences between the measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can give insight on how cold nuclear matter effects affect the heavy-quark production and hadronisation in p--Pb collisions. In the analysis of hadron-hadron correlations in p--Pb collisions, a double-ridge long-range structure was observed, possibly coming from a collective behavior of the system or gluon saturation in the initial state. This feature can be investigated for heavy quarks as well through heavy-flavour correlation studies. Moreover, the study of heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity is a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between hard and soft QCD processes responsible for particle production in hadronic collisions and provides information on the role of multi-parton interactions. \r\n\r\nWe present ALICE measurements of azimuthal correlations between prompt D mesons and heavy-flavour decay electrons with charged hadrons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt s$ = 7 TeV and p--Pb collisions at  $\\sqrt {s_{\\rm NN}}$= 5.02 TeV. We also show the per-event yields of D mesons as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt s$ = 7 TeV.",

      "Abstract": "The mass of charm quarks is larger than the scales of the medium\r\ncreated in heavy\u00ad-ion collisions at RHIC energies (m<sub>c</sub> >>\r\n\u039b<sub>QCD</sub>, T, m<sub>u,d,s</sub> ). Therefore, charm production\r\nis mainly feasible in the primordial nucleon-\u00adnucleon collisions and\r\nexperience all the subsequent stages of the medium evolution. The\r\nmodification of charm quark production in heavy -ion collisions and\r\nsignatures of their interactions with the created medium are imprinted\r\non the final kinematics of charmed mesons which can be studied\r\nexperimentally using Nuclear Modification Factors (NMFs). Recent\r\nmeasurement of D<sup>0</sup> NMFs has shown rich enhancement and\r\nsuppression structures in different transverse-momentum regions that\r\nshed light on the intricate interplay of Cold Nuclear Matter effects,\r\ncollectivity with the bulk matter, hadronization mechanisms and energy\r\nloss of charm quarks in heavy-\u00adion collisions. Higher precision\r\nmeasurements of NMFs are instrumental for accurately delineating the\r\nroles of these different mechanisms, their system size and kinematics\r\ndependencies, and can ultimately help in extracting medium parameters.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we will discuss the topological reconstruction of D\r\nmesons via their hadronic decay channels (D<sup>0</sup> \u2192 K\u03c0,\r\nD<sup>+/-</sup>\u2192 K \u03c0 \u03c0 and D<sup>*+/-</sup> \u2192D<sup>0</sup> \u03c0 \u2192 K \u03c0 \u03c0)\r\nutilizing STAR\u2019s recently installed Heavy Flavor Tracker for secondary\r\nvertex identification. We will also discuss transverse-momentum and\r\ncentrality dependence of D meson productions and NMFs and compare them\r\nwith published data from RHIC and the LHC experiments as well as with\r\nmodel calculations for heavy quark production and energy loss in heavy\r\n-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "In Au+Au-collisions at 1.23 AGeV incident energy, strangeness is produced\r\nbelow the free nucleon-nucleon threshold. In baryon dominated matter K$^+$ and K$^-$ mesons exhibit different properties,\r\nsince only K$^-$ can be resonantly absorbed by nucleons. \r\n\r\nAlthough strangeness exchange reactions have been proposed to be the\r\ndominant channel for K$^-$ production in this energy regime, the production yield\r\ncould also be explained in Ar+KCl-reactions at 1.76 AGeV based on a\r\nstatistical hadronization model fit to the measured particle yields. To guarantee strangeness conservation, strangeness is calculated canonically\r\nwithin R$_c$ in these models, and therefore the ratio of $\\phi$/K$^-$ is predicted to rise with\r\ndecreasing beam energies and as a consequence the feed-down of $\\phi$-mesons to kaons becomes important. \r\n\r\nIn total 7.3 Billion 40% most central Au(1.23 GeV per nucleon)+Au collisions have been analyzed for this investigation. The data has been recorded with HADES and a substantially improved reconstruction method has been employed to reconstruct the hadrons with high purity in a wide phase space region. In this contribution, we present results on charged kaons and $\\phi$-mesons. \r\n\r\nSupported by BMBF (05P12RFGHJ), HIC for FAIR, HGS-HIRe, H-QM and GSI.",

      "Country": "Sophia Univ",
      "Abstract": "Whether hydrodynamic flow is generated in small systems such as p+Pb\r\ncollisions at LHC and d+Au collisions at RHIC is hotly debated open problem. We analyze these systems by employing a fully 3-dimensional integrated dynamical model [1] in which an initial model with various kinds of fluctuations, hydrodynamic QGP evolution and hadronic transports are incorporated. For this purpose, we develop a novel type of hydrodynamic initialization model by combining an event generator, PYTHIA [2], Brodsky-Gunion-Kuhn type initial nuclear effects [3] and MC-Glauber model. In addition to the fluctuation of transverse profile having been discussed frequently so far, this newly developed model enables us to demonstrate multiplicity fluctuation, longitudinal fluctuations and highly asymmetric longitudinal profile, which have not been available in the conventional MC-Glauber model. Since the size of the system is small and, in turn, the lifetime of the QGP fluid is short, the hadronic afterburner must play a major role in the whole dynamical evolution. So we investigate this by switching on/off the hadronic rescatterings in the integrated dynamical model so that we can quantify how much the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP is attributed for the observed collective-flow-like behaviors in the experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] T.

The free energy has been calculated as a function of the holonomy and the dyon densities, using standard Metropolis Monte Carlo and integration over parameter methods.

In order to fully exploit the longitudinal boost invariance of this problem, we use a basis in which the mode functions are labelled by the Fourier conjugate $\\nu$ of the spatial rapidity. This choice has also the virtue of being suitable for a lattice implementation in which the rapidity $\\eta$ is used as longitudinal coordinate. We have derived analytic expressions for the initial value (at $Q_s\\tau_0\\ll 1$) of these mode functions, and based on them we will present preliminary results for the spectrum of produced quarks in the CGC.\r\n\r\nRef: arXiv:1506.03327 [hep-ph].",

In this talk we present recent calculations and theoretical interpretation for two such examples - the nuclear enhancement for heavy meson production in the backward rapidity region and single inclusive jet production in both d+Au and p+Pb collisions. We demonstrate that the incoherent multiple parton scattering can describe rather well the observed Cronin-like nuclear enhancement in the intermediate pT region of heavy meson production at RHIC and the LHC [1,2]. On the other hand, we show that initial-state inelastic parton processes in p+A collisions lead to attenuation of the jet production cross section, which is amplified at very high pT and forward rapidity. We demonstrate quantitatively to what extent parton energy loss effects in cold nuclear matter can explain the attenuation of the recently observed jet production yields in p(d)+A reactions at RHIC and the LHC [3]. We further show the consistency between the observed scaling behavior of the nuclear modification factor as a function of the jet energy and the initial-state parton energy loss picture.\r\n\r\n[1].

The calculations are carried out both in the center-of-mass frame and in the longitudinal co-moving system, for heavy ion collisions at 130 GeV and 200 GeV energies at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The resulting anisotropy flow coefficients v2, v3 v4, as well as the femtoscopic lengths of homogeneity, are compared with the data from STAR, PHOBOS and PHENIX Collaborations. It is shown that, although the three different types of equation of state investigated in this work give a reasonable description of the observed data, none is clearly favored in this comparison.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The mechanism of rapid thermalization in heavy-ion reaction is still an open problem. While 2->2 perturbative QCD rates do not thermalize sufficiently fast (e.g., Molnar & Gyulassy anno 2000), it has been claimed a decade ago by Xu & Greiner using their BAMPS code that perturbative 3<->2 rates shorten thermalization time-scales in A+A at RHIC and LHC energies to 1 fm/c or smaller. Later it has been argued, however, (e.g., Deng et al) that the BAMPS calculation may have missed the rates by a factor of 3!=6. We investigate the thermalization question using the transport code MPC/Grid, which algorithmically is quite similar to BAMPS (it has scatterings implemented via sampling test particles in small spatial cells in discrete timesteps). The new code has been verified against every analytic test we could think of, and in 2->2 mode also against earlier A+A results from the geometric MPC/Cascade code. On one hand, we do find that the inclusion of 3<->2 rates speeds up thermalization very significantly, however, the rates are still not as high as those published from BAMPS. The difference in 3<->2 rates, however, is not simply a factor of 6 even when we try to reproduce their calculation exactly. On the other hand, we do find that the 3<->2 rates are very sensitive to how screening and the LPM effect are implemented. Results from MPC/Grid for collective flow in A+A reactions will also be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The nature of chiral phase transition for two flavour QCD is an interesting but unresolved problem. One of the most intriguing issues is\r\nwhether or not the anomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavour sector is effectively restored along with the chiral symmetry.\r\n This may determine the universality class of the chiral phase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is essentially\r\nnon-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\r\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of  2+1 flavour dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The\r\nlatter also optimally preserves chiral and flavour symmetries on the lattice, since it is known that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light\r\nquarks influences the scaling  of the chiral condensate [1] in the crossover\r\ntransition region. We observe that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively\r\nrestored in the chiral crossover region. This effectively means that the eta' excitations remains distinct from the pion excitations well into\r\nthe QGP medium. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it.\r\nWe also provide a glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium that are responsible for the strongly interacting\r\nnature of the quark gluon plasma phase. We study the effect of these microscopic constituents through our first calculations for the topological susceptibility of QCD at finite temperature, which could be a crucial input for the equation of state with a finite chiral chemical potential.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] S.

      "Abstract": "The measurement of heavy-flavour production cross sections in pp collisions at the LHC has provided a reference for heavy-ion studies and a test for perturbative QCD calculations. Moreover the LHC has started the Run 2 operations this year, and the study of D-meson production in  pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV could provide a measurement of heavy-flavour production cross section at an unprecedented energy. In p--Pb collisions, heavy-flavour measurements are essential to assess the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the initial state, such as the modification of the parton densities and the $k_{\\rm T}$-broadening resulting from multiple soft scatterings of the partons.\r\nIn this poster we will focus on D$^{+}$-meson measurements as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision. These measurements are sensitive to the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production in p--Pb collisions and, in particular, could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies. The measurement is performed in  p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector in 2013. D$^{+}$ mesons are reconstructed in their hadronic $K^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}$ decay channels in the central rapidity region, and their yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals.\r\nThe per-event yield of D$^{+}$ mesons in the different multiplicity intervals, normalized to its multiplicity-integrated value, and its evolution with $p_{\\rm T}$ will be compared for pp and p--Pb collisions. The nuclear modification factor of D$^{+}$ mesons in p--Pb collisions, defined as the ratio of the D-meson yield in p--Pb and pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions $N_{\\rm coll}$, will be discussed in terms of its event activity dependence.",

The magnetic field is time-dependent and the conducting medium is expanding, which leads to the induction of charged currents due to the  combination of Faraday and Hall effects. We extend our previous work by studying the imprint of the magnetic fields produced in non-central heavy ion collisions on the azimuthal distributions and correlations of the produced charged hadrons by employing a hydrodynamic description of the expanding cooling droplet of liquid produced in a heavy ion collision combined with the electromagnetic effects in a perturbative fashion. We use the Cooper-Frye freeze-out procedure to obtain the azimuthal hadron distributions. We find that the charged currents induced by the presence of the electromagnetic fields result in a charge-dependent directed flow $v_1$, elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ that is respectively odd, even, odd in rapidity and always odd under charge exchange. It can be detected by measuring correlations between the directed, elliptic and triangular flow of charged hadrons at different rapidities, $\\langle v_i(y_1)v_i(y_2)\\rangle$. We also investigate the dependence of our model on the various parameters and make estimates of the magnitude of the charge-dependent flow observables expected at RHIC and the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), notably its transport coefficients, such as the specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$.  Since these properties are not directly measurable, one relies on a comparison of the data to computational models of the time-evolution of the collision to connect measured observables to the properties of the transient QGP state.  The computational model parameters are tuned such that simulated observables optimally match experimental data.\r\n\r\nWe employ a Bayesian model-to-data comparison method for extracting QGP properties [1303.5769, 1502.00339].  First, we choose a set of salient model parameters -- including physical properties such as $\\eta/s$ -- then evaluate a modern event-by-event heavy-ion collision model at a small set of points in the multidimensional parameter space, varying all parameters simultaneously.  We use a Gaussian process emulator to non-parametrically interpolate the parameter space, providing fast predictions at any point in parameter space with quantitative uncertainty.  Finally, we systematically explore the parameter space with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain rigorous constraints on all parameters simultaneously, including all correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we apply the Bayesian methodology to the new TRENTO initial condition model [1412.4708] and standard MC-Glauber initial conditions, coupled to event-by-event viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics and UrQMD [1409.8164].  We calibrate several initial condition and medium parameters to experimentally observed particle yields, spectra, and flows from RHIC and the LHC.\r\n\r\nThis systematic model-to-data comparison yields rigorous constraints on the nature of the initial state and on fundamental QGP medium properties.

      "Abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter to a state of quark and gluons. Phase transitions are often associated with enhanced fluctuations in various globally conserved quantities, such as electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, etc. Therefore, the study of the event-by-event fluctuations of these quantities can be a probe to explore the properties of the matter created in heavy ion collisions and its phase structure. A study of particle ratio fluctuations has been carried out by using the variable $\\nu_{dyn}$ which, by its construction, is free from collisional biases, i.e. impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of particles within the detector acceptance. We present the first results on event-by-event dynamical fluctuations of identified particle ratios, such as, K/$\\pi$, p/K and p/$\\pi$ in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. In order to gain insight into the origin of these fluctuations, we measure $\\nu_{dyn}$ for all like-sign and unlike-sign particle pairs as a function of number of participants. We will also make comparisons with measurements at lower center-of-mass energies from the SPS and RHIC, and discuss the results to models.",

Since 2010, the LHC delivered Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, pp collisions at various energies and, in 2013, p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.\r\n\r\nThe inclusive J/$\\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV was studied by ALICE down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) in the backward (-4.46 < $y_{cms}$ < -2.96) and forward (2.03 < $y_{cms}$ < 3.53) center-of-mass rapidity intervals in the dimuon decay channel and in the mid-rapidity region (-1.37 < $y_{cms}$ < 0.43) in the dielectron decay channel. The two former rapidity intervals correspond to the Pb-going and p-going directions, respectively. In this presentation, the J/$\\psi$ nuclear modification factors will be presented as a function of the J/$\\psi$ rapidity and $p_{\\rm T}$ and of the centrality of the collision, as estimated from the energy deposited in the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The forward-to-backward ratios and the average $p_{\\rm T}$-square values will be also reported. The measurements will be compared to theoretical models and the implication of these measurements to the interpretation of the nuclear modification factor measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV will be discussed.",

The chief finding of\r\nour work is that the potential develops an imaginary part\r\nbeyond a critical separation of the heavy quark pair, which\r\nis nowadays beleived to be the main source of dissociation.\r\nThe imaginary part is found to vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the \r\nperturbative result. Finally we have estimated the thermal width\r\nfor the ground and first excited states and found that\r\nnon-zero rapidities lead to an increase of thermal width.\r\nThis implies that the moving medium fecilitates the dissociation of quarkonium states \r\nthan in the static medium, thus agrees with other calculations.

In the years 2010 and 2011, STAR collected data of Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 62.4 GeV, leaving a wide gap of about $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ ~110 MeV between 19.6 ($\\mu_{\\rm B}$ ~206 MeV) and 11.5 GeV  ($\\mu_{\\rm B}$ ~316 MeV).   \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present first experimental results of higher moments and their products of net-charge and net-proton distributions in Au+Au collisions at 14.5 GeV, measured with the STAR detector at RHIC at mid-rapidity and a transverse momentum up to $p_{\\rm T}$ = 2 GeV/c.

      "Abstract": "The possible existence of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram has recently received enhanced attention.\r\nWe elucidate some peculiar features of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the magnetic field. Taking the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) [1], we have found that the energy spectrum of the Dirac operator exhibits the spectral asymmetry in the lowest Landau level, which is closely related to chiral anomaly [2]. It is a topological effect due to the phase od the chiral condensate inherent in the DCDW phase and gives rise to some interesting consequences such as a novel Lifshitz point [2], spontaneous magnetization [3] or appearance of the hybrid chiral condensate [4].\r\nA new term appears in the generalized Ginzburg-Landau (gGL) expansion and the Lifshitz point appears on $\\mu=0$ in the chiral limit. Such point should be directly explored by the lattice QCD simulations [2].\r\nWe can further pursue the Lifshitz point in a realistic situation, where quark mass is finite. Within the gGL theory the thermodynamic potential should include an additional term proportional to the quark mass and disfavor DCDW: DCDW is greatly modified around the Lifshitz point by the mass term, and it is shifted to larger $\\mu$.  As a result one may expect a shift of the Lifshitz point from $\\mu\\sim 0$. On the other hand, it is well known that this term changes the usual chiral transition to be cross over at high temperature but small $\\mu$. Note that the inhomogeneous to homogeneous phases should exhibit a clear phase transition due to the difference of symmetry between them. \r\nWe discuss how the finite mass effect modifies our earlier findings and some implications on the lattice QCD simulations.  \r\n\r\n[1]E.

Even though these signals suggest the creation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in such collisions, they do not represent concrete proof. In order to better address this problem, other signals must be investigated.\r\n\r\nIn this work we calculate the thermal photon radiation produced by a small and rapidly expanding QGP droplet [1] and evaluate how much energy jets can loose when penetrating through such a small system.  We find that a significant amount of thermal radiation is produced in proton-nucleus collisions, with thermal photons accounting for ~50% of the direct photons produced in high multiplicity pA collisions at low $p_T$. Furthermore, we show that despite the small system size, jets still loose a significant fraction of their initial energy, leading to a charged hadron Raa of 0.7--0.8 at a transverse momentum of ~10 GeV.  If these two signatures can be accessed by the experiments, they will serve as additional evidence that a strongly coupled QGP is being produced in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC. To complete the analysis, we study direct photon production and jet quenching in other small systems, such as d-Au and He-Au collisions at RHIC energies. \r\n\r\n[1] C. Shen, J.-F. Paquet, G. S.

In femtoscopy, measuring homogeneity radii as a function of pair $k_T$ is of fundamental importance. From numerous investigations it is known that the accessible range in $k_T$ is highly limited in small collision systems due to a steady rise in background correlations, which are associated to the mini-jet collimation effect. In this analysis we propose a novel method of event shape dependent two-particle interferometry with the aim of removing a large portion of the jet-background. By categorizing events by their transverse sphericity ($S_T$) we identify two classes of events, which significantly differ in hardness. Spherical event ($S_T$>0.7)  show a strong reduction in background correlations while jet-like ($S_T$<0.3) carry all the characteristics of previously observed background.

Using the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, we investigate the azimuthal \r\ncorrelations in p+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02 TeV with two- and four-particle cumulants. Our calculations indicate that pure hadronic \r\ninteractions can not generate the collective flow as measured in experiments, additional effects from initial state and/or \r\nfrom the QGP are needed to reproduce the flow data[1].\r\nUsing the same flow analysis method, we predict the collective flow in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with three different\r\nbaseline calculations, including: 1. UrQMD hadronic cascade simulations with the assumption that high energy pp collisions \r\nonly create pure hadronic systems, 2. VISHNU hybrid model simulations that connect viscous hydrodynamics for the QGP expansion \r\nand UrQMD for the hadron resonance gas evolution, using smooth initial conditions, \r\n3.

Real photons and lepton pairs produced \r\nin a hard scattering are not accompanied with any final state interaction, \r\neither energy loss or absorption. Consequently, such observables as transverse momentum pT and rapidity distributions of real photons\u00a0and lepton pairs at low and high dilepton invariant masses M may, therefore, serve as more efficient and cleaner probes for nuclear modification effects than inclusive hadron production. \r\n\r\nWe have shown that shadowing effects in production of lepton pairs coming from the coherence are suppressed at large invariant masses and at very large pT at mid-rapidities. So naively one should not expect any nuclear effects\r\nis this kinematical regime. Contrary to this expectation, we found \r\na significant large-pT suppression which was already observed by PHENIX \r\nexperiment in d+Au and central Au+Au collisions, as well as by fixed-target \r\nFNAL E772 and E866 experiments at large Feynman xF. This new effect can be \r\ntreated as an effective energy loss proportional to the initial energy and \r\nis universally induced by multiple initial state interactions.\r\n\r\nBesides, we present a systematic analysis of the nuclear effects in \r\nproduction of real photons and Drell-Yan pairs in p+Pb interaction at the LHC. We perform predictions for nuclear suppression as a function of pT, rapidity and dilepton invariant mass that can be verified by the LHC experiments. We include and analyze also a contribution of coherent effects associated with gluon shadowing affecting the observables predominantly at small and medium-high pT.",

      "Abstract": "Properties of a hot and dense strongly interacting form of matter called the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) are being studied in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Heavy quarks are created during early stages of heavy-ion collisions in hard processes before the QGP is formed. Their identities are not lost during the evolution of the QGP and subsequent phases, which makes them a good probe for the study of the properties of the QGP. Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) that originate from semileptonic decays of $D$ and $B$ hadrons can serve as a good proxy for heavy flavor quarks. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of NPE is sensitive to the interaction of heavy quarks with the QGP and thus the QGP properties.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of NPE $R_{AA}$ have revealed a strong suppression at high $p_T$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 $ GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In the year 2012 STAR collected data in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV. In the most central U+U collisions a higher energy density can be achieved than that in Au+Au collisions, which is expected to enhance the suppression of NPE. In this poster the preliminary results on NPE $R_{AA}$ with $1.2 < p_T < 6.0$ GeV/$c$ in 0-5% most central U+U collisions will be presented and compared to those in Au+Au collisions.",

In doing so, we are able to extend the applicability of the saturation formalism to higher $p_\\perp$, where it can be more accurately matched with the collinear factorization result. Furthermore, with an enhanced numerical implementation, we are able to present a comparison to single inclusive hadron production measurements from both RHIC and, for the first time, the LHC.

      "Abstract": "Heavy-flavor hadrons serve as valuable probes for the  quark-gluon plasma (QGP): low transverse momentum ($p_T$) heavy quarks provide important information about thermal properties of the system, while high $p_T$ heavy quarks provide a reference to quantify the in-medium modification. We establish a comprehensive framework to describe the full heavy flavor evolution in heavy-ion collisions: the QGP medium is described in a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics model, the dynamics of heavy quarks are studied in an improved Langevin framework incorporating both radiative and collisional energy loss, and the hadronization of heavy quarks is described with a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination.\\\\\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present first calculations of heavy flavor energy loss and collective behavior in p+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The Nuclear modification factor shows a centrality dependence: in the untra-central collisions, in-medium energy loss leads to suppression of heavy quarks; while cold-nuclear-matter effects are dominant in mid-central to peripheral collisions. The comparison between the elliptic flow of mesons and light charged hadrons indicates an incomplete coupling of heavy quarks with the medium due to the reduced temperature and medium size. We propose to use centrality dependence of the observables in p+Pb collisions in order to disentangle hot-nuclear-matter effects from cold-nuclear-matter effects. In addition, we go beyond the typically studied systems in heavy-ion collisions and focus on small systems (Cu+Cu collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV) and on a lower collisional energy ( Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV). Looking at the nuclear modification factor and collective flow of $D$ and $B$ mesons, we are able to quantify the QGP modifications to heavy quark over the entire $p_T$ range: suppression at high $p_T$, and collective behavior as well as signs for partial thermalization at low $p_T$.",

The new formula is applicable for an arbitrary value of the momentum imbalance of the two jets, $k_t$. This generalizes the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization formula that has been derived before by Dominguez et al. Their formula is valid only for small values of the transverse momentum of the small-x gluon from the target; it has TMD gluon distributions, but on-shell hard matrix elements. We extend their formula to all ranges of $k_t$ by including off-shell matrix elements. We also add finite $N_c$ corrections. The derivation is done with a standard Feynman diagram technique, and, independently, with a color ordered amplitudes method. The new formula encompasses both, the TMD factorization for small $k_t$ on the order of the saturation scale, and the High Energy Factorization (HEF) for large $k_t$ on the order of the momentum of the jets. The TMD and HEF factorizations can be derived from the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formula for forward di-jet production in the appropriate limits. We show explicitly the equivalence of HEF and CGC in the dilute target approximation.",

As a typical property of nonlinear systems, the late terms of the series grow factorially and in order to have a well defined answer, the usual hydrodynamic gradient expansion is required to be supplemented by an infinite tower of exponentially damped terms which are non-hyrodynamic modes. In this work we analyze in a concrete way such an enhanced gradient expansion for a plasma that undergoes a boost invariant expansion. We show that, remarkably, the usual hydrodynamic gradient expansion carries information about the non-hydrodynamic modes. Moreover different non-hydrodynamic modes are also interrelated in a similar fashion.

We provide analytical results for the Tsallis distribution in the presence of collective flow up to the first order in (q-1) and observe that the pion  $p_{T}$ spectrum for Pb+Pb collisions at center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV at LHC, could be well described by Tsallis q-statistics with inclusion of  a constant radial flow. We study the degree of deviation of the thermodynamic observables like, the number density, pressure and energy density, from a Boltzmann type of distribution, in the ambient of Tsallis q-statistics, for different physically acceptable values of the q-parameter. Further, we extend the q-statistics for the Hagedorn resonance gas to examine the basic thermodynamical quantities for systems having different \u2018q\u2019 parameters.

      "Abstract": "A new generation of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has been proposed for an ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment at CERN) upgrade for continuous readout at high luminosity. Such a continuously sensitive high-rate imaging detector is also highly desirable as a central tracking detector for a future electron-ion collider and a linear electron collider. This device would rely on the intrinsic ion back flow (IBF) suppression of micro-pattern gas detectors to minimize space charge build-up in the main drift volume and thus would not require the standard gating grid and the resulting intrinsic dead time. We have proposed, simulated, and measured the properties of a combination of a MicroMeGas (MMG) detector with two Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM) for this application. We have measured the positive ion backflow (IBF) and energy resolution of this structure at various settings of the gains of the elements and electric field between the elements with different working gases. At a gain of 2000, this configuration allows achievement of both an ion back-flow below 0.4% and an energy resolution better than 12% (standard deviation) for 55Fe x-rays.  Spark rates measured for a variety of conditions also will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "The description of the modifications of the coherence pattern of the parton shower when in the presence of a QGP has been actively addressed in recent studies. Among the several achievements, finite energy corrections, transverse momentum broadening due to medium interactions and interference effects between successive emissions has been extensively improved as they seem to be essential features for a correct description of heavy-ion collisions results. In this work, based on the insights of our previous work [2], we fully explore the physical interplay between broadening and decoherence, by generalising previous studies of medium-modifications of the antenna spectrum [1] - so far restricted to the case where transverse motion is neglected. The result allow us to identify two quantities controlling the decoherence of a medium modified shower that can be used as building blocks for a successful future generation of Jet quenching Monte Carlos: a generalisation of the $\\Delta_{med}$ parameter of the works of [1] - that controls the interplay between the transverse scale of the hard probe and the transverse scale of the medium - and of the $\\Delta_{coh}$ in [2] - that dictates the interferences between two emitters as a function of the transverse momentum broadening acquired by multiple scatterings with the medium.\r\n\r\n[1] L.

In A+A reactions we have shown that covariance matters because compared to the \"vanilla\" (D)GLV energy loss model it gives about 50% higher v2 for pions, and also D and B mesons, due to an interplay between jet propagation direction and collective flow of the medium. I will now present results on the nuclear modification factor (R_AA) and harmonic flow (v_n) in p+Pb collisions at LHC energies. This is especially interesting because hydrodynamics requires high opacities which should then be visible in energy loss. I will discuss whether hydrodynamics in p+A reactions can be reconciled with (D)GLV energy loss and experiments, especially in view of measurements finding R_AA close to unity but with significant v2 at modestly high pT.",

      "Abstract": "A major goal of ongoing experiments in heavy-ion physics is the exploration of the QCD phase diagram with the potential discovery of the QCD critical point. Here, fluctuation observables are considered to be promising quantities for achieving this goal. Present experimental results alone are however inconclusive and need to be accompanied by advanced theoretical calculations which capture the relevant aspects of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we address two main topics in this context: the dynamical modelling of fluctuations within fluid dynamics and the impact of late stage effects on the (non-)critical signals in the fluctuation observables. In the first part we report on the inclusion of fluctuations into the fluid dynamical evolution equations. We show that (thermal) noise can be consistently incorporated in fluid dynamics and check our results against known equilibrium fluctuations and analytical results for Bjorken flow. This framework also allows one to study the evolution of critical fluctuations, for example by applying transport coefficients with critical behavior or by coupling the sigma-field to a fluid dynamical background. In the second part we assume that critical fluctuations have formed in the collision dynamics according to universality arguments and parametrizations of the correlation length. We study how resonance decay and regeneration as well as the distance of the system's trajectory and the chemical freeze-out from the critical point alter the signals that are expected to be seen in net-proton and net-charge fluctuations.",

      "Abstract": "In this talk we report our recent finding of a new gapless collective excitation in a rotating fluid system with chiral fermions, named as the Chiral Vortical Wave (CVW). The CVW has its microscopic origin at the quantum anomaly and macroscopically arises from interplay between vector and axial charge fluctuations induced by chiral vortical effects. An intuitive picture for the underlying mechanism of CVW will be provided, and the CVW wave equation will be derived both from anomalous hydrodynamic current equations and from chiral kinetic theory framework. The solutions of such wave equation show nontrivial CVW-induced charge transport from various initial conditions, which could give rise to observable signals. Using the rotating quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions as a concrete example, we demonstrate the formation of induced flavor quadrupole in QGP and estimate the elliptic flow splitting effect for Lambda baryons that may be experimentally measured. \r\n[arXiv:1504.03201, submitted to PRL]",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics plays an important role in the quantitative description of the space-time evolution of the strongly coupled QGP created in Ultrarelativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions. Thus, it is necessary to have under control the physical assumptions made in the hydrodynamical modelling.  In this work we present a new exact solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation. This solution describes a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric radial expansion for arbitrary shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. The resulting solution is invariant under the $SO(3)_q \\otimes SO(1,1) \\otimes Z_2$ group symmetry. We test the efficiency of various hydrodynamic approximation methods by comparing the evolution of the moments of the exact solution (such as energy density and shear viscous tensor) with the corresponding solutions of the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase-space evolution of this new exact solution and the physical constraints on its applicability. \r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n\r\n1. G. S. Denicol, U. Heinz, M.

      "Abstract": "The CMS Collaboration has measured the pseudorapidity and centrality dependence $dE{T}/d\\eta$ for 5.02 TeV pPb collisions over 10 units of pseudo-rapidity. This was carried out in a systematic way by measuring centrality using different experimental definitions. As the centrality increases the mean pseudorapidity moves backwards and the $1/N dE_{T}/d\\eta$ distribution widens. For the most central pPb collisions the maximum $1/N dE_{T}/d\\eta$ reaches 25 GeV. The rate of change of dEt/deta with eta and centrality is characterized by the ratio $S_{pc} (eta, centrality) = E_{T} (\\eta, centrality)/E_{T}(\\eta, centrality=0-10\\%)$. This ratio depends very strongly upon the definition of centrality and shows strong auto-correlations if a particular eta region is used to define centrality. For the most central events there is a large overlap in the event classes selected by different centrality measurements, but for peripheral events different centrality measures select quite different. This is quite different to the situation in PbPb and suggests that event-by-event fluctuations in the pseudorapidity distribution of particles are much stronger in pPb than in PbPb.",

Recent measurements of the pPb nuclear modification factor ($R_{pPb}$), with diverging values for inclusive jets and charged hadrons, have raised question on jet fragmentation properties in pPb collisions. These spectra measurements are performed with pp reference at 5.02 TeV constructed by interpolation or extrapolation from different $\\sqrt{s}$, and on steeply falling power-law spectra. As the jet fragmentation function is only evolving logarithmically with $\\sqrt{s}$, this further underscores the importance of a direct measurement. Together with the CMS results in pPb inclusive jets and charge hadron $R_{pPb}$, we introduce the new CMS measurement of fragmentation function in pPb collisions, where within our uncertainties, jets in pPb is found to have identical fragmentation property vs. pp jets. We will further discuss the consistency and tension among the results, and their possible origins. This measurement also gives important reference for the interpretation of the fragmentation function in PbPb collisions.",

The production cross section of the three Y states (1S, 2S, 3S) was measured separately using the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experimental apparatus, in pp and PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV. A strong suppression is observed in PbPb collisions, by up to a factor of 2 and 10 for the Y(1S) and Y(2S) respectively. The Y(3S) was not observed in PbPb collisions, being suppressed by more than 7 at the 95% confidence level. This suppression was seen to also depend on centrality, but not significantly on transverse momentum or rapidity. A similar suppression pattern of the excited states (2S and 3S) as compared to the ground state (1S), though less pronounced than in PbPb data, was observed also when analyzing the pPb data at 5.02 TeV center of mass collision energy. A surprising dependence of the excited over the ground state ratio, as a function of the global event activity, was also found in pPb data. The three states are also observed to be individually more produced in events with more activity, for the three collision systems.

These mechanisms could give different angular distribution of quenched energy. In this talk, the missing $p_{T}$ technique has been improved so that it allows the study of angular distribution of the energy flow with respect to the dijet axis. Moreover, in order to get insights about the number of particles which carry the quenched energy, charged particle multiplicity differences in the leading and subleading jet hemispheres are measured.

Studies of two-dimensional angular correlations of charged hadrons with respect to reconstructed jets make it possible to experimentally assess the energy radiation patterns of an energetic parton traversing the medium as well as its fragmentation function. In this talk, we will present new differential measurements of charged particle densities and energy flow about the jet direction as a function of relative azimuth and relative pseudorapidity from 2.76 TeV PbPb and pp collisions recorded by the CMS Collaboration. With a sample of back-to-back dijets, previously used to reconstruct the event-wise momentum imbalance (missing $p_{T}$), we explore modifications to correlated charged hadron distributions for both the leading and the subleading sides of the dijet. With this technique, we can individually assess the contribution of the medium-induced modifications to each side of the dijet and explore the extent of potential medium response to the jet propagation, while also extending these measurements to large angular and radial distances.",

Specifically, pPb measurements provide crucial insights into the behavior of the cold nuclear matter effect, which is required to fully understand the hot and dense medium effects on jets in PbPb collisions.

      "Abstract": "For the first time we investigate non-equilibrium dynamic properties of a plasma consisting of confining gluons resulting from Gribov quantization [1]. For this purpose we employ the infrared-improved Gribov dispersion relation of gluons in the kinetic theory setup in the relaxation time approximation and determine the exact in- and out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system. In the static case the resulting equation of state of the studied system provides a good qualitative description of the pure-glue lattice QCD data down to the vicinity of the phase transition [2,3,4], thus permitting a study of the non-equilibrium phenomena in a plasma that exhibits crucial features of the QCD phase transition. In the case of local thermal equilibrium we observe Bjorken-like cooling of the boost-invariant expanding system. Out of equilibrium, by matching to the first order viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate bulk [3] and shear [5] viscosity of the system. We find significant enhancement of the bulk to shear viscosity ratio close to the transition temperature and its universal scaling behavior, in line with the one expected in a strongly-coupled theories [5]. We interpret the onset of strongly-coupled features in the system as the possible explanation of the close to perfect fluid behavior of the quark-gluon plasma.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n 1. V.

For example, entropy\r\nproduction fluctuates during the expansion even if we start from a common\r\ninitial condition in a macroscopic sense [2]. On the other hand, the\r\neffect of the fluctuations must be significant in small colliding systems\r\nsuch as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions [2]. Stability of thermal\r\nequilibrium systems is a consequence of an interplay between thermal\r\nfluctuations and dissipation.

      "Abstract": "New developments have changed the picture of quarkonium suppression in the last years. On one hand, perturbative and lattice computations indicate that the potential describing the interaction of two heavy quarks in a plasma has an imaginary part that effectively takes into account the collisions of the heavy quarks with the plasma constituents. There are also experimental indications that recombination plays an important role in determining the observed suppression. Both of these developments force us to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of quarkonia in a medium, beyond the static or equilibrium picture that prevails in most discussions. In this talk we investigate the quantum evolution of quarkonium in a thermal medium, including finite momentum effects that are usually ignored in potential models. By treating color degrees of freedom in a rigorous way we are able to understand under which circumstances a classical evolution, similar to that given by a Langevin equation, can be obtained. This classical equation can be generalized to an arbitrary number of heavy quarks, allowing us to study within the same formalism quarkonium suppression and recombination.",

      "Abstract": "At RHIC energies, heavy quark pairs are mostly produced through initial hard scatter- ings, leading to a cleaner interpretation and understanding of the measurements in heavy- ion collisions. Correlations between heavy flavor quark (c, b) pairs offer a unique insight into early interaction dynamics of the hot and dense QCD matter. In the meantime, a comprehensive investigation of heavy quark pair production mechanisms in proton- proton collisions is of great importance and interest as a fundamental perturbative QCD (pQCD) test and baseline measurement for heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nWe report new STAR measurements of heavy flavor correlations in p+p and Au+Au\r\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV using D mesons, Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) from semileptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons as well\r\nas J/$\\psi$'s as trigger particles. Azimuthal angular correlation distributions between trigger\r\nD mesons and associated charged hadrons (D-h), NPE (D-NPE) as well as anti-D mesons\r\n(D-$\\overline{\\rm{D}}$) are measured in p+p 500 GeV for the first time. Results with much improved precisions are also obtained on J/$\\psi$-h and NPE-h correlations in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$= 200 and 500 GeV, respectively. These results are compared with pQCD calculations\r\nto improve understanding of charm and bottom quark production in elementary hadron\r\ncollisions. NPE-h correlations are also measured in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV and compared with those in p+p collisions at\r\n$\\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV to investigate parton-medium interactions. Finally, the first measurement of electron-muon correlations from heavy flavor quark-antiquark pair decays is presented, utilizing the new STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker and Muon Telescope Detector in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

Measurements of heavy flavor production will advance our understanding of the properties of the QGP. Studies in different heavy-ion collision systems and centralities, and separately for charm and bottom quarks can provide new insights in how partons interact with the\r\nQGP, and QGP evolution and dynamics. In this talk, we will present the most recent results on Non-Photonic Electron (NPE) production from semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. We will first report updated results on NPE production in p+p collsions at $\\sqrt{s}$= 200 GeV with much improved precision and wider kinematic coverage than previous ones. These results are instrumental to test the validity of perturbative QCD calculations, and provide precise references for heavy-ion collisions. Calculations suggest that a 20% higher Bjorken energy density may be reached in U+U collisions, which can lead to a stronger suppression for NPE production. We will also report new results on the nuclear modification factor, $R_{AA}$, for NPE production in the 0-5% most central U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=193 GeV and compare with those in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV.

However, it is still not well understood after decades of effort. Simultaneous measurement of quarkonium spectrum and polarization in a wide kinematic range, notably at high transverse momentum, is suggested as a necessary step towards determination of quarkonium production mechanism. Moreover, an intriguing trend of a sharp increase of the quarkonium yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity was observed in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$= 7 TeV at the LHC. Such a behavior could be qualitatively explained in the framework of multiparton interactions, hydrodynamic evolution, or the percolation model and the latter two assume the formation of a high density medium. Therefore it is very interesting and important to study if such effects are also present at much lower energies in order to discriminate among these theoretical interpretations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present new J/$\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ measurements in p+p\r\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$= 500 GeV with the STAR experiment.

Due to their heavy mass, charm quarks are expected to thermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. As a result, the charm quark flow is a unique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated by light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is sensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the medium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms - gluon radiation vs. collisional processes.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the STAR measurement of elliptic flow ($v_2$) of D$^0$, D$^\\pm$, D$^{*\\pm}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, for a wide transverse momentum range and different centrality bins. These results are obtained from the data taken in the first year of physics running of the new STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker detector, which greatly improves open heavy flavor hadron measurements by the topological reconstruction of secondary decay vertices. The D meson $v_2$ is compared with those of other particle species at the same energy, measurements at the LHC collision energy and the latest model calculations.

      "Abstract": "Effective field theory (EFT) is a powerful framework based on exploiting symmetries and controlled expansions for problems with a natural separation of energy or distance scales. EFTs are particularly important in QCD and nuclear physics. An effective theory of QCD, ideally suited to jet applications, is Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). Recently, first steps were taken to extend SCET and describe jet evolution in strongly-interacting matter. In this talk I will demonstrate that the newly constructed theory, called SCETG, allows us for the first time in more than a decade to go beyond the traditional energy loss approximation in heavy ion collisions and unify the treatment of vacuum and medium-induced parton showers. It provides quantitative control over the uncertainties associated with the implementation of the in-medium modification of hadron production cross sections and allows us to accurately constrain the coupling between the jet and the medium. I will further show how SCETG is implemented to present predictions for inclusive hadron suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the highest LHC energies of 5.1 ATeV and discuss the relative significance of cold and hot nuclear matter effects.\r\n\r\n[1] Z.B.

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor jets at the LHC have emerged as a new tool to test the theory of heavy flavor production and parton shower formation initiated by prompt b-quarks. They provide new insights into the mechanism of heavy flavor propagation and energy loss in dense QCD matter. B-jets are also an important physics thrust of the RHIC heavy ion program. In this talk we present recent theoretical advances in understanding single inclusive beauty jet production, as well as photon-tagged and B-meson-tagged b-jet production in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We find that predictions for the nuclear-induced attenuation of inclusive b-jets, based on the theory of coherent energy loss in the QGP, agree well with recent CMS experimental data at a center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV. We further extend our results to photon-tagged and B-meson tagged b-jet production at 5.1 TeV for comparison to data from the upcoming LHC Pb+Pb run.  We find that photon-tagged b-jets exhibit smaller momentum imbalance shift in nuclear matter, and correspondingly smaller energy loss, than photon-tagged light flavor jets. Our results show that B-meson tagging is most effective in ensuring that the dominant fraction of recoiling jets originate from prompt b-quarks. Interestingly, in this channel the large suppression of the cross section is not accompanied by a significant momentum imbalance shift, a behavior quite different from the one observed in dijet asymmetry distributions. Last but not least, we present comparison between the b-jet attenuation and the quenching of open heavy flavor (D and B mesons) in heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1]. J. Huang, Z. Kang and I.

In this coupled approach, propagation of energetic shower partons are treated in the Linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model with the 3+1D hydrodynamic model providing the evolving bulk medium. Soft partons from both elastic and inelastic processes from the LBT are fed back into the medium as a source term in the 3+1D hydrodynamic. Such source terms in the hydrodynamic will induce medium excitation.

      "Abstract": "Hybrid models based on hydrodynamics and Boltzmann transport provide a powerful tool to extract properties of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in the first fm/c of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. The largest source of uncertainty in these model-to-data extractions is the choice of theoretical initial conditions used to model the distribution of entropy (energy) at the hydrodynamic thermalization time. \r\n\r\nIn this work we adopt a data driven approach and introduce a new parametric initial condition model that is constrained by systematic model-to-data comparison [1412.4708]. Starting from a participant nucleon model, we eschew binary collision scaling and parameterize the mapping from participant nucleon density to entropy deposition using a family of functions known as generalized means. These functions \u2014 described by a single continuous parameter \u2014 interpolate between the minimum and maximum of the local participant thickness functions and reduce to well known harmonic, geometric and arithmetic means for certain special cases.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that this new ansatz is flexible and can be used to emulate a broad class of initial condition models which are not described by a two-component wounded nucleon and binary collision parameterization. The model is then embedded in a state of the art hybrid simulation, and Bayesian model-to-data comparison is used to constrain initial state and medium properties simultaneously [1502.00339]. We compare results to measured flows, spectra and charged particle multiplicities and discuss implications for first principle initial condition calculations.",

      "Abstract": "The ALICE detector was designed for the study of the high energy-density QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are  important probes of this matter, as they are produced in initial hard scattering processes and  they experience all the stages of the medium evolution. Therefore measurements of heavy-flavour hadron production provide important information on the early stage of the collision and the parton-medium interaction. Open heavy-flavour production measurements in pp collisions provide the necessary baseline to understand the results in Pb-Pb collisions and a test of pQCD (perturbative quantum chromodynamics) calculations. Furthermore, the study of open heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity allows us to investigate the interplay between hard and soft mechanisms in particle production. In particular, it could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the measurement of  open heavy-flavour per-event yields as a function of  charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ =7 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector will be presented. D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ mesons are reconstructed from their hadronic decay channels in the central rapidity region, and their yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals.

      "Abstract": "The ALICE experiment is dedicated to an in-depth characterisation of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed at the LHC in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Prominent results from the LHC Run1 involved the measurement of single and dimuons in the ALICE Muon Spectrometer (MS) at -4 < \u03b7 < -2.5 to look for low mass vector mesons, rare probes from the charmonium and bottomonium families, and open-heavy flavor. These probes allow to investigate the chiral symmetry restoration, to test the predictions from the lattice QCD about the melting temperature of a tightly bound heavy \r\n<i>qqbar</i> pair, to test the in-medium regeneration scenario, and to scrutinise the gluon density in the QGP using the in-medium heavy-quark energy loss. By the end of the Run2, the ALICE experiment will accumulate around 1/nb of Pb\u2013Pb collisions. However, at least 10/nb will be needed to conduct high precision multidifferential studies on rare probes. To that end, LHC will be able to provide high rate running conditions for Run3 and beyond, i.e. 50 kHz for Pb\u2013Pb collisions.\r\nThe ALICE apparatus will have to inspect all heavy-ion collisions to achieve the physics goals. We will present the required upgrade for the MS. The new Front-End and Read-Out Electronics are designed to cope with a peaking readout rate of 100 kHz, to be compared with the current capability of 1 kHz.\r\nIn addition, a new CMOS monolithic pixel tracking detector, the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), will be added upstream of the absorber located before the MS, to provide vertexing capabilities at -3.6 < \u03b7 < -2.45. On top of substantially improving the current performances of the MS, the MFT also opens a wealth of new measurements not accessible presently, such as open charm/beauty separation, \u03c8(2S) in central Pb\u2013Pb collisions, prompt and non-prompt J/\u03c8 separation. We will present a selection of this new physics program. We will also discuss the design of the MFT and the on-going tests of the prototype pixels.",

To study the high-energy cosmic rays with low flux, atmospheric air showers are observed instead of primary particles.  To interpret the air shower observation to the properties of primary particles, the knowledge of the high-energy interaction is indispensable.\r\n  The Large Hadron Collider forward (LHCf) experiment was designed to study the particle production at LHC. Though the ultimate target of the experiment is the ultrarelativistic nucleus collisions, LHCf has so far measured precise cross sections in the LHC proton-proton collisions.  LHCf has measured particle production at pseudo-rapidity >8.4, where the secondary particles carry a large fraction of collisions energy, with the LHC sqrt(s)=0.9, 2.76, 7 and 13 TeV proton-proton collisions.  To study the nuclear effect at an extreme condition, measurements with the sqrt(s_NN)=5 TeV proton-lead collisions were also performed.\r\n   The observed production cross sections of pi^0\u2019s and neutrons, nuclear effect of the pi^0 production in p-Pb collisions are so far well explained by the major interaction models used in the cosmic-ray physics.

      "Abstract": "We investigate effects of causal hydrodynamic fluctuation on dynamics of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) in Bjorken expansion in high-energy nuclear collisions. The space-time evolution of the QGP can be well described by relativistic hydrodynamics. In the recent hydrodynamic analyses, effects of event-by-event (e-by-e) initial fluctuation on final flow observables have been focused. Moreover, it is hotly debated whether the same hydrodynamic models can be applicable even in small systems such as p-p, p-A, and peripheral A-A collisions. \r\n\r\nIn this study, we focus on thermal fluctuation during hydrodynamic evolution which must be also important on an e-by-e basis of hydrodynamic description, in particular, in small systems.\r\nWe first introduce causal hydrodynamic fluctuation, namely the thermal noises arising during the hydrodynamic evolution, into the boost invariant Bjorken expansion. We next perform hydrodynamic simulations of the Bjorken model with hydrodynamic fluctuation on an e-by-e basis. \r\n\r\nWe find the final entropy fluctuates around the mean value even if the initial condition is fixed in a macroscopic sense. We also find the entropy can temporally decreases during the time evolution, which is allowed by the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Fluctuation of entropy results in multiplicity fluctuation as an observable. Through the fluctuation-dissipation relation, hydrodynamic fluctuation is intimately related with dissipation. Thus final multiplicity fluctuation contains transport properties of the QGP. The fluctuation effect would be significant in small system such as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. Therefore we may have a chance to constrain the transport properties in such small systems. \r\n\r\nWe further discuss rapidity\u3000dependent hydrodynamic fluctuation on top of boost-invariant Bjorken expansion to see whether long-range rapidity correlation can be contaminated by hydrodynamic fluctuations.",

      "Abstract": "The Color Glass Condensate effective theory is the perturbative QCD description of the initial state for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The BK-JIMWLK equations describing the evolution of this theory with increasing energy have recently been extended to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy, which should allow for direct comparisons with the phenomenology.  However, some of the NLO corrections turn out to be extremely large, since amplified by (double and single) `collinear\u2019 logarithms, i.e. logarithms of ratios of transverse momenta. As a result, the evolution at NLO becomes unstable and void of any predictive power. This difficulty points towards the existence of large radiative corrections to all orders in $\\alpha_s$, which must be computed and resummed in order to restore the predictive power of the perturbative expansion. \r\n\r\nIn Ref. [1], we performed such a resummation for the largest corrections \u2014 those where each power of $\\alpha_s$ is accompanied by a double transverse logarithm. Subsequently, in Ref. [2], we have extended this resummation by including single transverse logarithms and running coupling corrections. This led us to a `collinearly improved\u2019 version of BK equation, which resums the largest radiative corrections to all orders. Numerical studies of this equation show that the evolution is now stable and also considerably slowed down by the resummation. To demonstrate the usefulness of this equation as a tool for phenomenology, for have used it for fits to the HERA data for electron-proton deep inelastic scattering at high energy [2].

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies create matter at extreme conditions of energy density and temperature, similar to the ones that existed within a few microseconds after the Big Bang. The fireball produced in the collision goes through a rapid evolution from an early partonic phase of deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to a hadronic phase and ultimately freezing out after a few tens of fm. \r\nTemperature fluctuations have been discussed in the literature as a means of characterizing the evolving system. The fluctuations may have two distinct origins, first, quantum fluctuations that are initial state fluctuations, and second, thermodynamical fluctuations. We discuss a method of extracting the thermodynamic temperature from the mean transverse momentum of pions, by using controllable parameters such as centrality of the system, and range of the transverse momenta. Event-by-event fluctuations in global temperature over a large phase space provide the specific heat of the system. We present Beam Energy Scan of sp. heat from data, AMPT and HRG model prediction. For Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, because of the production of a large number of particles in every event, it is possible to divide the phase space into small bins and obtain local temperature for each bin. Event-by-event fluctuations in local temperature can be obtained by following a novel procedure of making fluctuation map of each event. \r\nThe origin of the local fluctuations has been studied with the help of event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations, which shows that the system exhibits fiercely large fluctuations at early times after the collision, which diminishes with the elapse of time. Any observation of non-zero local fluctuations may imply that a part of the early fluctuations might have survived till freeze-out. We discuss the hydrodynamic calculations and a feasibility study at LHC using AMPT simulated data.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In high energy heavy ion collisions of RHIC and LHC, a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created. Due to the finite number of nucleons, the initial distribution fluctuates on an event-by-event basis. This medium undergoes a hydrodynamic evolution, before it freezes out to form a hadronic matter. In the last years it has been revealed that if measuring relative to higher order event planes $\\Psi_n$, higher order flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n>2$ can be measured. It also turned out that Bose-Einstein (HBT) correlation radii also show 3rd order oscillations if measured versus the third order event plane $\\Psi_3$. The initial transverse plane anisotropy causing these phenomena can be translated into a series of anisotropy coefficients or eccentricities: $\\epsilon_2$, $\\epsilon_3$, $\\epsilon_4$, etc. These anisotropies then evolve in time, and result in measurable momentum-space anisotropies, to be measured with respect to their respective symmetry planes. In our work we investigate the time evolution of the asymmetries and the mixing of spatial and momentum space anisotropies via numerical viscous hydrodynamics and via analytic solutions.",

      "Abstract": "We construct an equation of state for massive neutron stars based on QCD phenomenology, with special attention to the behavior at density larger than twice of saturation density. Our primary purpose is to delineate the relevant ingredients of equations of state that simultaneously have the required stiffness and satisfy constraints from thermodynamics and causality. We construct the equations of state following the 3-window description proposed by Masuda-Hatsuda-Takatsuka: at low density, we use the APR equation of state; at high density we use the NJL model with supplemental vector and diquark interactions that are inferred from the hadron spectroscopy and nuclear physics; at intermediate density we interpolate the low and high density equations of state. The 3-window approach allows us to consider a class of quark equations of state which have been implicitly omitted in the conventional hybrid construction. In particular, quark matter equation of state can be stiff in this approach. We will argue how the neutrons star mass-radius curves can be related to the microscopic effects in the QCD dynamics.",

      "Institute": "Los Alamos National Laboratory",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Strong suppressions of charmonia have been observed in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The suppressions exhibit strong nucleus A and also kinematic dependences, especially with Feynman-x (or rapidity) and transverse momentum pT. Such suppression in heavy ion collisions is predicted to be an important signature for the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) due to color screening, however, there are also other non-QGP effects, such as initial state parton energy loss, parton shadowing and final state breakup, that affect the formation of charmonia. It is important to quantify the contributions from the cold nuclear matter, and it could be achieved through studying charmonia and Drell-Yan productions in proton-nucleus collisions where no significant QGP is expected. E906/SeaQuest is a fixed-target dimuon experiment at Fermilab using the 120 GeV proton beam from the Main Injector. E906 has been taking high statistic data samples of p+p, p+d, p+C, p+Fe and p+W collisions since 2014 and will continue data taking until the summer of 2016. E906 measures J/Psi, Psi\u2019 and Drell-Yan productions in the dimuon channel in p+p and p+A collisions over a wide range of kinematic coverage, that is optimal for the study of the cold nuclear matter effects. Recently, we released the first preliminary measurements of Drell-Yan production in p+A collisions from the 2014 Run-II data. Analyses of J/Psi and Psi\u2019 productions are underway. In this talk, the latest status of the analyses and preliminary results will be presented.",

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "We complete the physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma by investigating the thermalization of the soft components of the jet. We argue that the following scenario should hold: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via quasi-democratic branchings and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature T. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the jet. We support this scenario, first, via parametric arguments and, next, by studying a simplified kinetic equation, which describes the jet dynamics in longitudinal phase-space. We solve the kinetic equation using both (semi-)analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain the first exact, analytic, solutions to the ultrarelativistic Fokker-Planck equation in one-dimensional phase-space. Our results confirm the physical picture aforementioned and demonstrate the quenching of the jet via multiple branching followed by the thermalization of the soft gluons in the cascades.",

      "Abstract": "We utilize a new framework, CUJET3.0, to deduce the energy and temperature dependence of the jet quenching parameter, $\\hat{q}(E>10\\;{\\rm GeV},T)$, from a combined analysis of available data on the nuclear modification factor and azimuthal asymmetry of high $p_T$ light hadrons and open heavy flavors in high-energy A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC. Extending a previous perturbative QCD based jet energy loss model (known as CUJET2.0) with (2+1)D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds, this new framework includes three novel features of nonperturbative physics origin: (1) the Polyakov loop suppression of color-electric scatterings and (2) the enhancement of the jet scattering due to emergent chromomagnetic monopoles near $T_c$ and (3) thermodynamic properties constrained by lattice QCD data. CUJET3.0 reduces to CUJET2.0 at high temperatures $T > 400$ MeV, but greatly enhances $\\hat{q}$ near the QCD deconfinement transition temperature. This enhancement accounts well for the observed elliptic harmonics of jets with $p_T>10$ GeV. Extrapolating our data-constrained $\\hat{q}$ down to thermal energy scales, $E \\sim 2$ GeV, we find for the first time a remarkable consistency between the high energy jet quenching and bulk perfect fluidity with $\\eta/s\\sim T^3/\\hat{q} \\sim 0.1$ near $T_c$.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] Jiechen Xu, Jinfeng Liao, Miklos Gyulassy, arXiv:1411.3673 [hep-ph].\r\n\r\n[2] Jiechen Xu, Alessandro Buzzatti, Miklos Gyulassy, JHEP 1408, 063 (2014).",

      "Abstract": "The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider aims to study the QCD phase diagram in regions where net baryon density is large, a region where a critical point may exist.  Possible signatures of a softening of the QCD equation of state have been reported at BES energies, and directed flow (rapidity-odd $v_1(y)$) is one of the more striking examples in this category. This talk will focus on $v_1$, and its slope $dv_1/dy$, near midrapidity. Ten identified particle types will be presented: $\\Lambda$, $\\bar\\Lambda$, $\\phi$, $K^0_s$, $K^\\pm$, $p$, $\\bar{p}$, and $\\pi^\\pm$ produced in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV as a function of rapidity. For $\\Lambda$, $K^0_s$, $K^\\pm$, $p$ and $\\pi^\\pm$, all results are presented in the centrality bins $0-5\\%$, $5-10\\%$, $10-20\\%$, $20-30\\%$, $30-40\\%$, $40-50\\%$, $50-60\\%$, $60-70\\%$ and $70-80\\%$.    \r\n\r\nAt intermediate centrality (10-40\\%), $dv_1/dy$ shows a minimum near 14.5 GeV for several particle species while $p$ and $\\Lambda$ also show a sign change. The $\\phi$ meson appears to follow $\\bar{p}$ at the higher BES energies, while protons, kaons and pions have a lower magnitude than $\\bar{p}$ at 14.5 GeV and above. $\\Lambda$ and $p$ are consistent within errors at all energies. $dv_1/dy$ shows a strong centrality dependence, especially for $p$ and $\\Lambda$ at the lower beam energies. Results for net kaons and net protons will also be discussed.  \r\n\r\nThe UrQMD model shows a qualitatively similar trend for only a subset of the ten particle types under investigation.

The invariant mass and pair $p_{T}$ distributions are expected to be modified from the pp reference due to the energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium and the excess of thermal radiation. A correct understanding of heavy-ion results requires, in addition, an evaluation of initial state nuclear effects, through the study of p-Pb collisions.\r\nTo access the intermediate and high mass regions, abundant high $p_{T}$ electron samples are needed. In the ALICE experiment, the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is used for  electron identification at momenta above $p > 1$ GeV/$c$.

Using the Ginzburg-Landau expansion near the Lifshitz point, we derive elastic free energies for phonons and pions in dependence on the temperature and chemical potential. We show that the one-dimensional modulation is destroyed by thermal fluctuations of phonons at nonzero temperature, and compute the exponent that characterizes the anisotropic algebraic decay of quasicondensate correlations at long distance.

Working to leading order in the coupling constant of QCD, we find that there is a mild enhancement, ~ 20%, for dilepton production in the semi-QGP over that in the perturbative QGP. In contrast, we find that photon production is strongly suppressed in the semi-QGP, by about an order of magnitude, relative to the perturbative QGP. In the perturbative QGP photon production contains contributions from 2->2 scattering and collinear emission with the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In the semi-QGP we show that the two contributions are modified differently. The rate for 2->2 scattering is suppressed by a factor which depends upon the Polyakov loop. In contrast, the collinear rate is suppressed not by the Polyakov loop, but by 1/N. We compute the rate from 2->2 scattering to the leading logarithmic order and the collinear rate with the LPM effect to leading order in the semi-QGP. We also discuss that the effect of the photon suppression to the photon elliptic flow.\r\nReference: Yoshimasa Hidaka, Shu Lin, Robert D. Pisarski and  Daisuke Satow, 1504.01770[hep-ph]",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamic simulations play a key role in understanding the property of the QGP and the QCD phase transition from analyses of high-energy heavy ion collisions. Recently, significant developments are achieved in construction of realistic hydrodynamic models with viscosity effects and event-by-event fluctuations. As a result, we can discuss the bulk feature of the QGP such as transport coefficients and the equations of state in detail from comparison between hydrodynamic calculations and experimental results at RHIC and LHC. One of the current hottest topics is higher flow harmonics which has the information of initial conditions through event-by-event fluctuations and the space-time evolution of the QGP matter. In particular, it is pointed out that the higher flow harmonics is related to the ridge structure which is remnant of long correlations in the longitudinal direction [1]. The dynamics in the longitudinal direction may affect that on the transvers plane. Here, we investigate the effect of longitudinal fluctuations to the higher flow harmonics, using a hydrodynamic simulation [2]. Especially, we discuss possible existence and time evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy ion collisions. If the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs through longitudinal fluctuations, the vortexes form, which may affect the expansion in the transvers direction. We also argue the influence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to physical observables such as particle distributions and higher flow harmonics.  \r\n \r\n[1] G. Aad *et al*.

      "Abstract": "Recently, we proposed a new type of QCD sum rules i.e. the complex Borel sum rules (CBSR) [1]. It has been found that the CBSR is superior to the conventional QCD sum rules from the point of view of the maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis. Specifically, we have demonstrated that our novel method can be used to study the excited states of hadrons. The suppression of quarkonium states (e.g. J/psi and upsilon) is an important signature of the hot matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Recently, the behavior of the excited states at finite temperature, which can be different from the ground state, has attracted much attention. The suppression of the quarkonium ground states has already been analyzed by conventional QCD sum rules with MEM [2,3].\r\n In this presentation, we report on the results of a reanalysis by CBSR with MEM to investigate the thermal behavior of the charmonium excited states.\r\n\r\n[1] K.J.

      "Abstract": "Based on the well known topological properties of\r\n non-abelian gauge theories, a dual QCD gauge theory is constructed in terms\r\n of magnetic symmetry, which manifest the topological structure of the symmetry group in a non-trivial way. The topological magnetic charges associated with monopoles have been  brought into the dynamics by the possible homotopy $\\Pi_{2}[SU(3)/U(1) \\otimes U^{'}(1)]$. The dynamical breaking of the magnetic symmetry has been shown to impart\r\n the dual superconducting properties to the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum which ultimately leads to a unique flux tube configuration in QCD vacuum responsible for enforcing the color confinement. The color singlet physical spectrum in accordance with the color confinement has been achieved through the requirement of the color reflection invariance which provides two magnetic glueballs as the collective excitations of the magnetically condensed dual superconducting QCD vacuum which in turn, are intimately connected to the flux confining parameters (penetration length and coherence length) of the superconducting vacuum. Furthermore, in view of the relevance of the phase transitions at finite temperatures, utilizing the path-integral formalism, dual QCD theory has also been extended to the thermal domain to examine the deconfinement phase transition. The effective potential at finite temperature has, thus, been derived to compute the critical temperature for phase transition which has been shown to be  in good agreement with the lattice results. A large reduction of color monopole condensate\r\n and glueball masses near the critical temperature has been shown to lead to a first order deconfinement phase transition and the complete evaporation of color monopole condensate in the high temperature domain reveals to the restoration of magnetic symmetry.",

In order to do this, fundamental theory needs to be linked to experimental observables, and sophisticated dynamical modeling becomes necessary.  \r\n\r\nWe present important advancements in the fluid dynamic description of heavy ion collisions needed to account for the relevant physics of heavy ion collisions with center of mass energies ranging from 7 to 200 GeV. In particular, we present the latest developments in the 3+1 dimensional viscous relativistic simulation MUSIC, including bulk viscosity and finite baryon chemical potential. We construct an equation of state for finite baryon chemical potential, using Taylor expanded lattice QCD data and a hadron resonance gas model. Further we present a new model of the initial state using an extension of the conventional Monte Carlo Glauber model to three spatial dimensions, which provides fluctuating initial distributions of net baryon and entropy densities.\r\n\r\nWe use this model to compute a wide range of observables, including multiplicity and net-baryon rapidity distributions, as well as directed and higher order flow as functions of rapidity and beam energy.

This process lead to not only energy loss of leading partons but also convert its flavor  to others due to induced gluon and quark pair production. As a consequence, beside the suppression of leading hadron spectra, the flavor compositions of a jet should be modified. Through a numerical study of the medium-modified QCD evolution, the leading K^- strange meson spectra are found to be particularly sensitive to the induced flavor conversion in e+A collisions. This conversion can lead to increased number of gluons and sea quarks in a jet and enhance the K^- spectra to counter the effect of energy loss with large momentum fractions x_B where the struck quarks are mostly valence quarks of the nucleus.",

The hadronic equations of state include all known hadrons; repulsive interactions are taken into account via two versions of the excluded volume approximation.  A switching function is employed to make the crossover transition from one phase to another without introducing a thermodynamic phase transition. A fit to accurate lattice calculations of the pressure and trace anomaly, with temperature $100 < T < 1000$ MeV and $\\mu = 0$, determines the parameters. These parameters quantify the behavior of the QCD running gauge coupling and the hard core radius of the nucleon.   With no new parameters, the pressure and trace anomaly from lattice calculations for $\\mu = 400$ MeV are equally well reproduced, as is the speed of sound.  We then compute the skewness and kurtosis and compare to measurements of the fluctuations of the proton number distribution in central Au-Au collisions as measured by the STAR collaboration in a beam energy scan at RHIC.  The crossover equations of state can reproduce the data if the fluctuations are frozen at a temperature significantly lower than the average chemical freeze-out.",

The Event Plane Detector (EPD) is a proposed high $\\eta$ hit detector that would replace the STAR Beam Beam Counter (BBC \u2013 a 32 channel hit detector 3.3 $< |\\eta| <$ 5.0 used for BES triggering and first order event plane reconstruction) for BES II, which is scheduled to begin in 2019. The EPD would provide improved triggering, increased detector coverage in jet-like $\\eta$-$\\phi$ correlation measurements, improved resolution for event plane determination independent of the TPC ($|\\eta| < 1$), and provide a TPC independent centrality definition. Divorcing event plane and centrality determination from the TPC via a forward detector is crucial for correlation measurements performed at mid-rapidity. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe EPD design consists of two scintillator discs at $\\pm$ 3.75m, each is separated into ~500 tiles.

Similarly, the NLO treatment describes how the soft collinear emissions can be incorporated into the drag coefficient at NLO. We describe how many of the ingredients of the NLO transport equations (such as the drag coefficient) can be computed using a Euclidean formalism pioneered by S.

There are three intrinsic length scales associated with this process: the transverse size of the baryon fluctuation $r_\\perp$, the inverse of the saturation scale $Q_s^{-1}$ and the inverse of the mass $M^{-1}_{q(\\bar{q})}$ for heavy massive quarks. We identify two regimes determined by the dominant scale $R_{max}= \\text{max} (Q_s^{-1},M^{-1})$ and discuss in detail the properties of each regime as one varies the transverse scale of the baryon fluctuation $r_\\perp$. In proton-nucleus collisions the net baryon correlation function is suppressed when $r_\\perp > R_{max}$, while for heavy-light ion collisions this correlation extends up to the typical transverse size of the nucleus. These baryon number fluctuations generate non-trivial correlations which may propagate into the subsequent hydrodynamical evolution of the expanding fireball.",

Measurement of charged particles at high pT (above 30 GeV) show an increase in yields with respect to the expectation from binary scaling which is larger than any deviations seen in the jet measurements. Since particles at these pT arise from jet production, these measurements could be an evidence for modification of the jet fragmentation in p+Pb collisions compared to pp collisions.

Remarkably, the new constraints turn out to be highly insensitive to the amount - or even presence - of quark matter inside the stars. \r\n\r\nIn this framework, we also present a simple effective equation of state for cold quark matter that consistently incorporates the effects of interactions and furthermore includes a built-in estimate of the inherent systematic uncertainties. This goes beyond the MIT bag model description in a crucial way, yet leads to an equation of state that is equally straightforward to use.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of the centrality dependence of low-$p_T$ and high-$p_T$ particle production in proton-lead collisions at the LHC can provide unique insight into the dynamics of soft and hard scattering processes and the initial state of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. Recent results have shown that both soft and hard processes may be significantly influenced by event-to-event fluctuations (variations) in the structure of the proton. In this talk, the latest measurements of the centrality dependence of charged particle, jet, and Z boson production with the ATLAS detector at the LHC will be used to explore these questions. In particular, the sensitivity of the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution in proton--lead collisions to the choice of centrality variable will be discussed. Separately, the strong centrality dependence of jet production in proton--lead collisions has raised questions about energy production at large rapidities in collisions involving a large proton-$x$. To address this, measurements of the correlation between the initial-state hard scattering kinematics in dijet events and forward transverse energy in proton-proton collisions will be presented.",

The related higher cumulants (moments) present large deviations from the poisson baselines, showing the potential of discovery the QCD critical point in experiment. \r\n\r\n  In this talk, we introduce a freeze-out scheme for  the dynamical models near the QCD critical point through coupling the classical particles with the correlated fluctuating sigma field [2]. For an infinite and stationary medium, such freeze-out scheme can reproduce the standard Staphanov formulas for cumulants presented in Ref[3].\r\n\r\n  Within this framework, we calculate the correlated fluctuations of net protons emitted from the hydrodynamic freeze-out surface at various collision energies.  A comparison with recent STAR BES data shows that our model could reproduce kurtosis (and C4) through tuning the related parameters. However, the critical fluctuations in our model (also in the Stephanov formula) always give positive contributions to the cumulants C2 and C3, which over-predicts the data with poisson expectations served as the thermal fluctuation baselines[2].

      "Abstract": "A study of the universality of multihadron production in nucleus-nucleus and pp/p \u0304p collisions is performed using the dependenceies of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities and of the mean multiplicity on the collision energy and on the number of nucleon participants, or centrality, in the energy range from a few GeV to a few TeV. The approach in which the multiparticle production is driven by the dissipating centrality-dependent effective energy of participants is introduced exploiting the earlier proposed consideration that combines the constituent quark picture with Landau hydrodynamics. Within this approach, the data on the energy dependence of the global variables studied and the pseudorapidity spectra from the most central nuclear collisions are well reproduced. The centrality dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities of charged particles are well described pointing to a similarity in the most central collisions and centrality data. The study of the mean multiplicty centrality dependence reveals a new scaling between the measured and calculated pseudorapidity spectra. Using this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation scaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra at all centralities. The obtained scaling clarifies on the differences in the multiplicty centrality dependence from RHIC and LHC as well as on the dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity density vs. multiplicity at RHIC. A complementarity in the multiplicity energy dependence in the most central collisions and centrality data is obtained. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions is pointed out to occur at \u223c 1 TeV. The pseudorapidity spectra of photons are also well reproduced within the proposed approach in the entire collision energy range and an explanation of their centrality independence is given. Predictions are made for the forthcoming higher-energy measurements in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal fluctuations cause modifications of meson bound states as well as restoration of broken chiral and $U_A(1)$ symmetries. The former (latter) plays an important role in the analysis of sequential melting patterns of open-flavor mesons (the nature of phase transition in QCD) in hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nWe present recent results on lattice QCD calculations of meson correlations which express in-medium modifications of mesonic excitations containing up/down, strange and charmed quarks. Thermal effects are clearly visible in the spatial correlations which, unlike the temporal correlations, can be calculated at separations larger than the inverse of temperature. This makes them more sensitive to thermal modifications of hadrons. Moreover the spatial correlations provide a direct signal for the thermal modification of spectral functions which carry all the information about in-medium properties of mesons and their dissolution.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of lattice QCD simulations using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical strange quark mass and (nearly) physical up/down quark masses, we find that light-unflavored, open-strange and open-charm mesons in the pseudo-scalar ($\\pi$, $K$ and $D$) and vector ($\\rho$, $K^\\ast$ and $D^\\ast$) channels show significant modifications even below the critical temperature ($T_c$). The modification pattern of these mesons is very similar below $T_c$, whereas a clear flavor dependence appears above $T_c$ where lighter mesons suffer larger modifications. The strange meson ($\\phi$) and strange-charmed mesons ($D_s$ and $D_s^\\ast$) show slight modification already at $T_c$, while the charmonium states ($\\eta_c$ and $J/\\psi$) feel thermal effects only at $T>1.2T_c$. This confirms that 1S charmonium states can survive beyond $T_c$. From degeneracies of parity partner it is also found that at $T_c$ the chiral symmetry is restored, whereas the breaking of the $U_A(1)$ symmetry is significant.",

ALICE's excellent tracking, vertexing and particle identification capabilities allow it to fully reconstruct the hadronic decays of open-charmed D mesons, as well as enabling the study of leptons stemming from charm and beauty decays at forward and mid-rapidity.\r\n\r\nMeasurements in p--Pb collisions allow us to disentangle experimental observations arising due to the hot and dense medium from those occurring due to cold nuclear matter effects such as momentum broadening, initial-state energy loss, and the modification of nuclear PDFs in the Pb nucleus. In particular, it is possible to measure nuclear modification factors in p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions in order to determine whether the observed suppression of particles at high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ in central Pb--Pb collisions is a medium-induced effect. Further insight into cold nuclear matter effects can be obtained by examining the yields of D mesons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in p--Pb collisions.\r\n\r\nHere we present the most recent results from ALICE for charm and beauty production in p--Pb collisions via heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity, heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity, and the hadronic decays of D$^0$, D$^+$, D$^{\\star +}$ and D$_\\mathrm{s}^+$ mesons at mid-rapidity.",

Using a standard collinear gluon distribution for the probe and an up to date dipole cross section fitted to HERA data to describe the target we achieve a rather good description of the cross section in proton-proton collisions, although with a rather large normalization uncertainty.

We found the scale invariant operators are given as follows:\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\phi_1=\\alpha_s^{-9/11}\\left\\langle O_1\\right\\rangle ,\\\\\r\n\\phi_{2,3}=\\alpha_s^{-(15 \\mp \\sqrt{17})/44}\\left\\langle \\frac{-653 \\pm 21\\sqrt{17}}{424}O_1+\\frac{1 \\mp \\sqrt{17}}{8}O_2+O_3\\right\\rangle.\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nTogether with the dim 6 scalar operators whose renormalization has been worked out before[2],\r\nour result completes the calculation of renormalization of all the dim 6 gluon operators, hence is  a first step toward identifying their mixing and thus a systematic analysis in the operator product expansion (OPE) of heavy quark correlation functions up to dimension 6.  After using the equation of motion in the purge gauge theory, only $O_1$ remains nonzero. \r\n\r\nAs an application, we rewrite the dim 6 scalar and twist 4 operators as $f^{abc}B^a\\cdot(B^b \\times B^c)$ and $f^{abc}B^a\\cdot(E^b \\times E^c)$ and estimate their temperature  dependence using inputs  of dim 4 electric and magnetic condensate extracted from lattice gauge theory. We then improve the previous QCD sum rules for $J/\\Psi$ mass near the $T_c$ based on dim 4 operators, by including the contribution of the dim 6 operators to the OPE. We find an enhanced stability in the sum rule and confirm that the $J/\\psi$ will undergo an abrupt change in the property across $T_c$.\r\n\r\n[1]H.J.Kim and S.H.Lee, arXiv:1503.02280[hep-ph]\r\n\r\n[2]S.Narison and R.Tarrach, Phys.Lett.B 125 217 (1983)",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The Kondo effect has been known as a phenomenon in electron systems with heavy mass impurities having finite spins. This phenomena is caused by imperfect cancelation of the infrared divergences of particle and hole excitations and is realized by a combination of the following ingredients; (0) heavy mass of impurity, (i) existence of Fermi surface, (ii) quantum loop effects, (iii) non-Abelian nature of interaction (e.g. the spin-spin interaction). These are indeed identified in a (light) quark matter with small number of heavy flavor quarks as impurities. In the quark matter, the non-Abelian properties of the interaction is given by the color exchange by gluons (S. Yasui and K. Sudoh, Phys. Rev. C88, 015201 (2013)). This is called the QCD Kondo effect, which modifies the transport properties of the quark matter with heavy flavor impurities, and can be relevant to experiments in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we discuss how the effective coupling strength, between a heavy flavor impurity and a light quark, evolves in the low energy effective theory near the Fermi surface (K. Hattori, K. Itakura, S. Ozaki and S. Yasui, arXiv:1504.07619 [hep-ph]). We investigate the renormalization group flow at the leading log accuracy on the basis of the high-density QCD where the gluon propagator has the static screening mass and the dynamical screening effect for the electric and magnetic components, respectively, and show that the effective coupling becomes divergently large at a certain infrared scale near the Fermi surface, which is called the Kondo scale. This indicates the presence of a strongly coupled regime in the dynamics of the quark matter containing heavy flavor impurities. We find that, while the dynamical magnetic screening provides the dominant effect in the color superconductivity, it is sub-dominant compared to the static electric screening in the QCD Kondo effect.",

It is shown in this work that the use of a modern hydrodynamical model of heavy ion collisions [1] together with more complete photon emission rates greatly improves agreement with both ALICE and PHENIX data, supporting the idea that thermal photons are the dominant source of direct photon momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions. The event-by-event hydrodynamical model used includes, for the first time, both shear and bulk viscosities, along with second order couplings between the two viscosities. Different photon emission rates are investigated, including one that takes into account the effect of confinement on photon emission [2]. The effect of both shear and bulk viscosities on the photon rates is studied and is shown to have a measurable effect on the photon momentum anisotropy. The inclusion of parton energy loss on prompt photons and its importance for comparisons of direct photon calculations with experiments is discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] Ryu, Paquet, Shen, Denicol, Schenke, Jeon and Gale.

      "Abstract": "Event-by-event hybrid models construct the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution from non-equilibrium approaches by matching the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. After splitting the obtained energy-momentum tensor and four-current into\r\nideal-hydrodynamics part and viscous correction, it often appears that the \"correction\" is large. However, all the existing models neglect viscous correction, assuming instant thermalization and violating angular momentum conservation.\r\n\r\nHere we study the complete time evolution of heavy ion collisions within the coarse-grained UrQMD transport approach and quantify deviations from local equilibrium. Since these deviations are expected to be larger at lower beam energies and in more peripheral collisions, Au+Au collisions from $E_{lab} = 5 - 160 A$ GeV at different centralities are investigated. At every position in space-time the energy-momentum tensor and net baryon four-current are determined in the Landau rest frame.\r\n\r\nWe find that the largest contribution to the deviation from local equilibrium is the pressure difference in the transverse and\r\nlongitudinal direction, while the off-diagonal components of the tensor and baryon charge flow play a minor role in most of the cases. In addition, for every considered energy and centrality there exists a rather sharp time $t_0$, after which energy-momentum tensor from UrQMD is close to ideal hydrodynamics in a vast space region. This time $t_0$ decreases with collision energy and slightly increases with centrality, being larger than the typical times of hydrodynamics initialization found in the literature. By comparing the result from single events to the average result we also investigate the effect of event-by-event fluctuations on $t_0$.",

If the\r\nsystem has a bound state, the behavior of $C(Q)$ at low $Q$ also depends\r\non the binding energy. We discuss how the behavior the scattering wave\r\nfunction can influence the behavior of $C(Q)$ and its interplay with the\r\nsource size.

The key feature of TopMetal-II- is that it can directly collect charge via metal nodes of each pixel to form two-dimensional images of charge cloud distribution. Topmetal-II- sensor is designed with a low power consumption of 104 mW and low ENC value of 30 e-. From our measurement by injecting pulse signal into the top metal of each pixel, we got the ENC value of 13 e-, which is even better than the design value. Furthermore, the noise distribution of the sensor is almost uniform among pixel matrix. With such a low noise, we can measure charge particle track without any gas amplification, achieving high energy and spatial resolution. Thus making Topmetal-II- a competitive candidate for next generation of TPC readout node in high energy physics.",

      "Abstract": "Event by event hydrodynamic simulations of AA and pA collisions involve initial energy densities with large spatial gradients. This is associated with the presence of large Knudsen numbers ($K_n \\sim 1$) at early times, which may lead one to question the validity of the hydrodynamic approach in these rapidly evolving, largely inhomogeneous systems. A new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities, $\\varepsilon_n$,  are remarkably robust with respect to variations in the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients, $\\lambda$. For $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV LHC initial conditions generated by the MCKLN code[1], $\\varepsilon_n$ (across centralities) remains nearly constant if the fluctuation scale varies by an order of magnitude, i.e., when $\\lambda$ varies from 0.1 to 1 fm. Given that the local Knudsen number $K_n \\sim 1/\\lambda$, the robustness of the initial eccentricities with respect to changes in the fluctuation scale suggests that the $v_n$'s cannot be used to distinguish between events with large $K_n$ from events where $K_n$ is in the hydrodynamic regime. We use the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code v-USPhydro[2] to show that this is indeed the case: anisotropic flow coefficients computed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics are only sensitive to long wavelength scales of order $ 1/\\Lambda_{QCD}\\sim 1$ fm and are incredibly robust with respect to variations in the initial local Knudsen number (see [3]).

      "Abstract": "We construct a combined effective model reproducing the equation of state of strongly interacting matter as obtained in recent lattice QCD simulations. The model reproduces basic physical characteristics of\r\nthe hadronic resonance gas at low temperatures and embodies the crucial effect of hadron dissociation. The quark and gluon degrees of freedom are described within an effective mean-field theory, the Polyakov-loop improved Nambu, Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The  hadron dissociation is obtained by the Mott effect within a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach. The\r\nlowering of the thresholds for the two- and three-quark scattering state continuous spectrum triggers the\r\ntransformation of hadronic bound states to resonances in the scattering continuum. We postulate a generic temperature dependent behavior of the scattering phase shifts in these channels. The in-medium phase shift model is in\r\naccordance with the Levinson theorem. This results in the vanishing of hadronic contributions to the thermodynamics at high temperatures. The crucial in-medium effect responsible for the hadron-to-quark matter phase transition is the lowering\r\nof the quark masses in the chiral restoration transition which itself is a result of the behavior of the chiral condensate. We aim at a selfconsistent solution of the model. The used PNJL model is improved over its standard versions by adding\r\nperturbative corrections in $0(\\alpha_s)$ for the high-momentum region above the three-momentum cutoff. This leads to the broadening of the quarks, while the quark  selfenergy is calculated from the same kind of diagrams as hadronic selfenergy.\r\n\r\nThis is an extension of former results obtained in arxiv:1501.00485 (Phys.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "One of the largest uncertainties in the modeling of heavy-ion collision arises from present poor understanding of the early-time dynamics especially in the longitudinal direction. Forward-backward (FB) multiplicity correlation has been regarded as a power observable on the early time dynamics since it probe directly the initial state density fluctuations in pseudorapidity. Previous studies of FB multiplicity correlation  were primarily based on two-bin or multi-bin correlation method in selected $\\eta$ ranges, whose connection to underlying dynamics is complicated by statistical smearing due to finite multiplicity and residual centrality or volume effects. In a recent paper (1506.03496), we have developed a data-driven two-particle correlation method which overcome both limitations and hence allow direct connection between the correlation function and underlying heavy-ion collision dynamics. The robustness and physics potential of the method are demonstrated using the AMPT and HIJING simulation. We found that the long-range component of the FB correlation is captured by a few longitudinal harmonics, with the first component driven by the asymmetry in the number of participating nucleons in the two colliding nuclei and the second component reflecting the EbyE fluctuation of nuclear-stopping. The higher-order longitudinal harmonics are found be strongly damped in AMPT compare to HIJING, due to weaker short-range correlations as well as the final-state effects present in the AMPT model. Two-particle pseudorapidity correlation reveals interesting charge-dependent short-range structures in AMPT model that are absent in HIJING model. The proposed method opens a new avenue to elucidate the particle production mechanism and early time dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Future analysis directions and prospects of using the pseudorapidity correlation function to understand the centrality bias in p+p, p+A and A+A collisions are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The development of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is a very important scientific achievement of the last two decades. It has inspired many authors to apply its methodology to lots of possible applications in physical problems. For example it allows to derive hydrodynamical like equations for  relativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysics, cosmology and plasma physics. So far a symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations for the independent field variables has been obtained up to second order with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium. However the exploitation to third order is desirable in order to study the couplings between the three major dissipative fluxes which contribute to the entropy generation in a single-component fluid. In this paper the development of relativistic fluid dynamics is carried through\r\nto third order with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium. The set of obtained field equations is closed by imposing the relativity principle and the entropy principle up to third order. Imposing these conditions up to third order affects and restricts the lower order terms. This, in turn, affects the equilibrium expressions which are already explicitly known.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "To understand the origin of high-energy cosmic rays, many experiments were carried at ground level, thereby observing air showers. Many measurements confirm a steepening and a flattening of the all-particle spectrum at $10^{15.5}$ and $10^{18.5}$ eV, that are called 'knee' and 'ankle', respectively. Both are considered to be the indices of change in propagation or origin of cosmic rays. Despite the high statistics, interpretation of the results depend strongly on the hadronic interaction model used in the Monte Carlo calculation which has larger uncertainties than the statistical errors. Chemical composition of cosmic ray (from proton to iron nucleus) is one interest of astroparticle physics, but results are not settled yet. Calibration of interaction models is an urgent need for air shower measurements.\r\n LHCf experiment has measured data of the forward region in proton-proton collision at $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$, 7 and 13 TeV and proton-lead collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. Nuclear effect must be well understood, since air shower consists of interactions between cosmic ray (proton to iron nucleus) and the atmosphere (mainly nitrogen); lead and gold are too heavy target. Unfortunately, no high energy collision of light ion has been provided. RHIC and LHC are good candidates that can provide such collisions. We focus on the result expected with proton-nitrogen inelastic collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV ($10^{14}$ eV in lab frame) where we use the LHCf detector in the forward region ($\\eta>6$) of the proton-remnant side at RHIC. We compare the energy spectrum with that of proton-proton inelastic collision at $\\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV to evaluate the nuclear effect. A MC calculation shows that it is possible to discriminate nuclear effect incorporated in some models widely used in air shower measurements and demonstrates that it can be the first good test to evaluate air shower.",

      "Institute": "RIKEN/University of Crete",
      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "In the quark gluon plasma (QGP), the transport properties of electromagnetic (EM) probes such as leptons and photons could be modified by the lepton/photon-parton scattering compared with the case in the QED plasma. In order to incorporate the non-perturbative effects from the strongly couple QGP on the lepton/photon-parton collisions, a semi-holographic approach which combines the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to compute the shear viscosity of thermal leptons and photons. It is found that the lepton shear viscosity due to the lepton-quark scattering is inversely proportional to the ratio of electric conductivity of the QGP to temperature up to the leading logarithmic order of the EM coupling and is suppressed compared with the one from lepton-lepton scattering. On the other hand, the photon shear viscosity up to the leading order of the EM coupling is suppressed by the photon-parton scattering, where the suppression is favored by the coupling of the QGP. Such suppression stems from the blue shift of the thermal-photon spectrum at fixed temperature when the coupling of the QGP is increased. On the contrary, the lepton shear viscosity behaves oppositely due to the decrease of electric conductivity of the QGP at stronger coupling. Moreover, in a holographic model breaking conformal symmetry, both the conductivity and the amplitude of the thermal-photon spectrum scaled by temperature decrease rapidly near the deconfinement transition. Accordingly, a sharp enhancement of the shear viscosity of both thermal leptons and thermal photons close to the critical temperature is observed. In conclusion, our findings imply that the thermal leptons and photons in the QGP are less viscous than in the QED plasma. In particular, thermal photons may become fluid-like in the strongly coupled scenario. We argue that it may strengthen the anisotropic flow of direct photons. \r\nPart of the talk is based on Phys.Rev. D91 (2015) 12, 125010.",

      "Abstract": "Recent measurements of jet and charged particle suppression and single jet fragmentation in heavy ion collisions at the LHC provide important experimental information on the quenching of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma. Important features such as the variation of jet $R_{AA}$ with $p_T$, the pattern of modification of the jet fragmentation functions and the evolution of the charged particle $R_{AA}$ with $p_T$, taken together, should provide insight on the physics mechanism responsible for the quenching. While a proper understanding of the data requires a detailed theoretical model of jet quenching in a dynamically evolving medium, we argue that multiple features of the data including those listed above arise from a common origin. Using a phenomenological model with minimal assumptions on the parametric behavior of the parton energy loss, we can reproduce most of the features of the single-jet data. Results of our analysis will be presented and used to argue that there are important features of the underlying jet production that may need particular attention in jet quenching models.",

The QuarkGluon plasma formed in these reactions has low viscosity [1], which leads to significant fluctuations and turbulent instabilities [2]. One has to study and separate these two effects [3], but this is not done yet in experiments. When such separation is performed, both fluctuations and new collective effects, like rotation and turbulence and the arising polarization [4] and two particle correlations [5] can be studied. The polarization arises from the shear flow based on the equipartition principle between local flow vorticity [6] and particle spin. Vorticity increases with beam energy in peripheral collisions, while higher temperatures counteract spin alignment. Due to these two effects polarization is expected to be observable at lower energies also [6].\r\n\r\nhttp://folk.uib.no/csernai_lp/Thermal-8.pdf\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.

We use these distributions to obtain the full phase space yields of the pions to provide additional information of the system's chemistry. Further, we report the width of the rapidity density distributions compared to the width expected from Landau hydrodynamics.

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "The electromagnetic-field-induced transport related to the axial chemical potential may play an important role in many chiral systems such as the quark gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. It has been found that the presence of both a vector and an axial chemical potential could induce an axial current parallel to the applied electric field known as the chiral electric separation effect (CESE), where the axial conductivity is proportional to the product of the small vector and axial chemical potentials in QED and weakly coupled QCD plasmas. By implementing the gauge/gravity duality, we qualitatively obtain the same relation in the strongly coupled scenario. On the other hand, we find that an axial Hall current can also be generated when introducing an electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to each other with an axial chemical potential, which could be dubbed as the chiral Hall effect (CHE). The fluctuations of chemical potentials will further result in chiral electric waves (CEW) as propagating density waves led by the applied electromagnetic fields. Interestingly, the Hall density waves propagating perpendicular to both applied fields may exist even at zero chemical potentials and become non-dissipative. The transport coefficients including the Hall conductivities, damping times, wave velocities, and diffusion constants of CEW in a strongly coupled plasma via the AdS/CFT correspondence will be presented. We argue that the CHE could lead to nontrivial charge distributions at different rapidity in asymmetric heavy ion collisions. The presentation is based on  Phys.Rev.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We provide a holographic evaluation of novel contributions to the drag force acting on a heavy quark moving through strongly interacting plasma. The new contributions are chiral in that they act in opposite directions in plasmas containing an excess of left- or right-handed quarks and in that they are proportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly. These new contributions to the drag force act either parallel to or antiparallel to an external magnetic field or to the vorticity of the fluid plasma. In all these respects, these contributions to the drag force felt by a heavy quark are analogous to the chiral magnetic effect on light quarks. However, the new contribution to the drag force is independent of the electric charge of the heavy quark and is the same for heavy quarks and antiquarks. We show that although the chiral drag force can be non-vanishing for heavy quarks that are at rest in the local fluid rest frame, it does vanish for heavy quarks that are at rest in a frame in which there is no local entropy current. In this frame, the heavy quark at rest sees counterpropagating momentum and charge currents, both proportional to the axial anomaly coefficient, but feels no drag force. This provides strong concrete evidence for the absence of dissipation in chiral transport, something that has been predicted previously via consideration of symmetries. Along the way to our principal results, we provide a general calculation of the corrections to the drag force due to the presence of gradients in the flowing fluid in the presence of a nonzero chemical potential. We close with a consequence of our result that is at least in principle observable in heavy ion collisions, namely an anticorrelation between the direction of the CME current for light quarks in a given event and the direction of the kick given to the momentum of all the heavy quarks and antiquarks in that event.",

This has been postulated as stemming out of a common underlying mechanism--both systems are strongly interacting and expand hydrodynamically--despite of the very different nature of their interactions. However, recent transport model studies suggest that the anisotropy in heavy-ion collisions may not be dominated by hydrodynamics, but the escape mechanism [L.He et al., arXiv:1502.05572 (2015)]. Moreover, quantum uncertainty principle may be relevant for the anisotropy of the quark-gluon plasma [D.Molnar et al., arXiv:1404.4119 (2014)]. In this talk I will illustrate why the hot quark-gluon plasma and the cold atom experiments performed to date are not similar as have been envisaged, and what it takes to truly use cold atoms to simulate the conditions of the quark-gluon plasma. I will outline a possible future cold atom experiment and discuss the technical challenges of such an experiment as well as the physics opportunities coming with it.",

      "Speaker": "Stephen Horvat",

      "Country": "STAR",
      "Abstract": "At top RHIC energies and at the LHC, the suppression of high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) hadrons provides evidence for partonic energy loss in a QGP. We study jet quenching in the RHIC BES by investigating the centrality dependence of the binary-collision-scaled high-$p_{T}$ yields. In this representation we can see if the scaled yield decreases as we go to larger overlap regions and higher energy densities.  Phenomena like radial flow that increase the yield in this measurement are all expected to become stronger for more central collisions. Measurement of a decrease in the scaled yield while studying more central collisions can serve as possible evidence for jet quenching if initial state effects can be accounted for. One such effect is the suppression of per nucleon cross sections in heavier nuclei relative to lighter nuclei for Bjorken $x>$0.3 first measured by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC). Even at energies and centralities where this signature is lost a QGP may still be formed since the suppression caused by energy loss must overpower all the phenomena responsible for enhancement. Measurements will be shown for several ranges of $p_{T}$ for 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV data showing that relative hadron suppression persists for collisions at least down to 14.5 GeV. \r\n\r\nModels have also shown that the development of $v_{3}$ and a ridge requires the presence of a low viscosity QGP phase. To further investigate the presence of the QGP at these lower energies and whether the observed hadron suppression coincides with onset of other QGP signatures, we cross-examine the energy and centrality dependence of $v_{3}$. We find that for collisions with $N_{\\mathrm{part}}<$50, the ridge and $v_{3}$ disappear for energies below 14.5 GeV, suggestive of a turn-off of the QGP. But for $N_{part}>$50, $v_{3}$ and the ridge persist down to the lowest energies, consistent with the hadron suppression defined in the new variable at the lower beam energies.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are important probes of the energy loss mechanism in the quark gluon plasma formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are produced only by hard scattering in the initial stage of a heavy-ion collision, since the charm and bottom masses are larger than the energy scale of QCD ($m_{c,b}$ >> $\\Lambda_{QCD}$). The energy loss of heavy quarks would be expected to be smaller than that of light quarks due to the Dead-Cone-Effect that leads to a strong suppression of small angle gluon radiation.\r\n\r\n We will present the status of the analysis of single electrons from heavy flavor decays in Au+Au collisions from the PHENIX Run14 dataset. The goal of the analysis is to understand the quark mass dependence of QCD medium effects via the $p_{T}$ spectrum of single electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays separately. The first step of the analysis is the evaluation of key variables such as the Distance of Closest Approach (DCA) distributions of electrons and hadrons, inclusive electron $p_{T}$ spectra and variables for electron identification. The total resolution of the transverse DCA and primary vertex is ~ 80\u03bcm at $p_{T}$ > 1GeV/c, which is enough to separate decay electrons from charm and bottom hadrons.",

To the usual Langevin evolution in the plasma we added a new modeling of the hadronization stage including the recombination with thermal partons from the medium at the decoupling hypersurface, to form colour-singlet strings eventually fragmented according to the Lund model implemented in PYTHIA. The additional radial and elliptic flow inherited by the heavy-flavour hadrons from the light quarks will affect the final observables, providing a better agreement with the experimental data for RAA and v2. \r\nWe will show how, with our setup, it is also possible to study more differential observables like various kind of azimuthal correlations: D-h, e-h -- for which experimental data start getting available -- but also D-Dbar or e+-e-, not yet experimentally accessible but allowing in principle a more direct information on the decorrelation occurred at the partonic level. If the interaction with the medium tends to partially wash-out the initial Q-Qbar angular correlation, the elliptic flow acquired in the medium and at hadronization will tend to introduce a common correlation of all the heavy-flavour hadrons with the reaction plane, which will also contribute to the experimental signal.\r\nFinally we will display the first results of our ongoing study on heavy-flavour observables in small systems, like the ones produced in p-Pb or d-Au collisions, trying to check whether the presence of a hot medium suggested by observables in the light sector (e.g. double ridge, elliptic flow...) can leave its fingerprints also in heavy-flavour signals.",

By dividing the box into several parts, the volume dependence of the fluctuations is investigated. After confirming that the initial distributions follow the expectations from a Poisson distribution, the influence of quantum number conservation like the net baryon number and the net charge in the system on the higher moments is evaluated. For this purpose, the composition of the hadron gas is adjusted for different scenarios, only baryons are simulated to study the net baryon conservation or only pions and $\\rho$ mesons to investigate the charge conservation effect. In addition, the effect of imposing kinematic cuts in momentum space is analysed. The role of resonance excitations and decays on the higher moments can also be studied within this model. This work is highly relevant to understand the experimental measurements of higher moments obtained in the RHIC beam energy scan and their comparison to lattice results and other theoretical calculations assuming infinite matter.",

      "Abstract": "The statistical hadronization (or thermal) model was initially developed by Hagedorn for hadron collisions above 10 GeV/c primary laboratory momentum [1]. In relativistic heavy-ion physics, many authors have developed it further and compared to a large amount of data in particular for hadron production rates, e.g. [2,3,4], where it  yields excellent results. \r\n\r\nTo decide whether the system is indeed in thermal equilibrium, the distribution functions rather than production yields are decisive:\r\nIn the transverse momentum distributions of produced particles, deviations from thermal behaviour plus collective expansion occur beyond about 8 GeV/c. Not only the rapidity distributions of net baryons, but also the pseudorapidity distributions of produced mesons deviate from pure thermal behaviour: the thermal model does not generate a plateau in dN/dy, or a dip in dN/deta. \r\n\r\nSuch non-equilibrium effects can to a certain extent be accounted for in a relativistic diffusion model [5,6] with three sources - two fragmentation sources, and a mid-rapidity source arising from gluon-gluon collisions - that merges with the thermal model only for time to infinity. Given the short interaction times of AuAu at RHIC or PbPb at LHC, the fragmentation sources still contribute substantially, providing good results when compared [6,7] to data from PHOBOS and ALICE, and also for asymmetric systems such as dAu at RHIC and pPb at LHC.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

With the come out of recent LHC results on particle production of various species, we find it a good opportunity to use this approach to interpret the data. The transverse-momentum spectra, from both $p+p$ and Pb+Pb collisions, are systematically studied within the Tsallis Blast-Wave (TBW) model, and compared to the RHIC results. Good agreement between the data and the fit is achieved over a broad kinetic range - 0-10 GeV/$c$ for $p+p$ collisions from 200 to 7000 GeV, and 0-5 GeV/$c$ for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV.\r\n\r\nFrom the fit the kinetic freeze-out temperature T, the average radial flow velocity <\u03b2> and the parameter q, which is a measure of the degree of non-equilibrium of the system, can be extracted. The evolution of these parameters with collision energy and centrality will be presented. For $p+p$ collisions, the radial flow is found to be consistent with zero at beam energy below 900 GeV and increases to $\\sim0.3$ at 7 TeV. For Pb+Pb collisions, the TBW model illustrates better fit stability compared with the normal BW model. The centrality dependence of T, <\u03b2> and q are demonstrated.

We show that the dynamics of chiral order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking transition in heavy-ion collisions, with dissipative dynamics, is governed by one such equation, specifically, the Newell-Whitehead equation. Further, required boundary conditions are automatically satisfied due to the geometry of the collision. The chiral transition is, therefore, completed by a propagating interface, exactly as for a first order transition, even though the transition actually is a crossover for relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Same thing also happens when we consider the initial confinement-deconfinement transition with Polyakov loop order parameter. The resulting equation, again with dissipative dynamics, can then be identified with the reaction-diffusion equation known as the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation which is used in population genetics. We discuss the implications of these results for heavy-ion collisions. We also discuss possible extensions for the case of early universe.",

Such collisions will be explored at the upcoming Facility for the Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). Multi-strange hadrons will play a major role as diagnostic probes of the of the dense QCD matter. The yields of (anti)hyperons and their relative enhancement with respect to pions have been investigated in heavy-ion collisions at beam energies between 5 and 90 A GeV using the hadronic-string model (UrQMD), hadronic and partonic modes of the transport model (AMPT) and a statistical hadronization model (Therminator). It is found that the yields of multi-strange (anti)hyperons are sensitive to the partonic medium. At beam energies around 10 A GeV - which is the top energy of the FAIR start version - the partonic contribution to the\r\nproduction yield increases strongly with increasing number of (anti-)strange quarks.",

It was realized in recent years that this assumption may not be valid in presence of initial-state fluctuations, especially along the longitudinal direction. The effect of eta-dependent event plane fluctuations would break the factorization relation of Fourier coefficients from two-particle azimuthal correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropy Fourier harmonics as a function of $\\eta$. First study of factorization breakdown effect in $\\eta$ is carried out using the CMS detector, which covers a wide $\\eta$ range of 10 units. A novel method is employed to suppress nonflow correlations at small pseudorapidity gaps of two particles. Significant eta-dependent factorization breakdown is observed in both PbPb and high-multiplicity pPb collisions. The measurements are presented for various orders of flow harmonics as a function of centrality or event multiplicity classes in PbPb and pPb, and are also compared to three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations with longitudinal fluctuations. The new results presented here provide new insights into the longitudinal dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions, and help improve the three-dimensional modeling of the evolution of the strongly-coupled quark gluon medium.",

With current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models a simultaneous description of the yield and flow of low pT direct photons is difficult to achieve, a finding which is referred to as \"photon puzzle\". In this talk direct photon spectra measured in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV are presented. Two independent methods were used, the photon conversion method based on the reconstruction of electron-positron pairs from converted photons and the reconstruction in the electromagnetic calorimeter PHOS. With both methods direct photon spectra were obtained for three centrality classes. The statistical significance of the direct excess is quantified in each case taking into account correlated systematic uncertainties.",

This collectivity is consistent with a hydrodynamic flow origin. However, it can also be interpreted in terms of initial state effects arising from gluon saturation. The pseudorapidity dependence of the azimuthal Fourier coefficients ($v_n$) is expected to be sensitive to the underlying mechanism with, in the hydrodynamic picture, the longer lifetime of the fireball on the Pb-going side expected to lead to a larger flow signal than found on the p-going side. To investigate the detailed properties of the observed collectivity, differential $v_n$ values in transverse momentum ($p_T$) and pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) are presented over the full range of the CMS tracker detector ($-2.4 < \\eta < 2.4$) for pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Results based on multiparticle analyses involving four or more particles are shown. An event plane analysis is presented where the influence of recently demonstrated event-plane de-correlation is considered. Comparisons are made with peripheral PbPb collisions measured at similar mid-rapidity particle multiplicities. The results will be discussed in the context of current models of the longitudinal dependence of the multiparticle correlations.",

While extensive studies of this long-range correlation phenomenon in pPb collisions have revealed its collective properties, the nature of the ridge in pp collisions still remains unknown. New measurements of two-particle angular correlations for charged particles, and identified $K^0_s$ and $\\Lambda$ particles emitted in 7 TeV pp collisions are presented using the CMS detector. With the implementation of a high-multiplicity trigger during the 2010 LHC pp run, CMS is capable of probing the most exotic high multiplicity pp collisions. The second-order ($v_2$) and third-order ($v_3$) anisotropy harmonics of charged particles, $K^0_s$ and $\\Lambda$ particles are extracted from long-range correlations as a function of particle multiplicity and $p_T$, after correcting for the contribution of back-to-back jet correlations. Four-particle cumulants ($c_2${4}) are also measured for charged particles as a function of multiplicity. The results are compared to 5.02 TeV pPb data covering a similar range of particle multiplicity.

It has recently been shown that factorization breaking of two-particle azimuthal correlations can be attributed to the effect of initial-state fluctuations. Using a PCA approach, Fourier coefficients of observed two-particle azimuthal correlations as a function of both particles' $p_T$ are characterized into leading and subleading mode terms. The leading modes are essentially equivalent to anisotropy harmonics ($v_n$) previously extracted from event-plane or two-particle correlation methods as a function of $p_T$. The subleading modes represent the largest sources of factorization breaking. In the context of hydrodynamic models, they are a direct consequence of initial-state fluctuations, particularly providing new insights on the radial excitations of initial-state eccentricity. The results are presented over a wide range of centrality and event multiplicity, and are compared to hydrodynamic predictions.

Surprisingly, a few years ago, similar features were discovered in high multiplicity events in a small system such as p-p and p-A. Even if the latter one has already revealed its collective properties, the nature of the ridge in p-p collisions remains unknown. Studying the Ridge in small systems is also a good probe to improve our knowledge of initial conditions and its fluctuations. A deeper look into 7 TeV p-p data using CMS detector allowed us to have a better idea about the possible origin of long-range correlations. Furthermore, in light of 13 TeV p-p data this year, we will provide more constraints on potential hydrodynamic properties in small systems. In this poster, results on long-range near-side dihadron correlations are shown at different energies and for different colliding systems using CMS detector.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks observables, such as the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$, are sensitive to the transport properties and space-time evolution of the quark-gluon-plasma. Generally this connection is made via transport calculations of the time-evolution of the collision. However, how the choice of the initial condition model for the QGP medium as well as spatial correlations between the medium and the initial production vertices of the heavy quarks affect these observable is still unclear. Of particular interest is the effect of initial correlation between heavy quark production vertices with the underlying event (referred as soft-hard correlation). Experimentally, open charm production in pp collisions is found to increases with charged particle multiplicity, indicating a strong correlation between the heavy quark production with sub-nucleonic fluctuation of soft matter density, which is often overlooked in  existing initial conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we focus on the response of heavy quark observables to various initial condition models with different hard-soft correlation behavior and soft matter geometry. We study D meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ in AA collision with TRENTo, a recently developed effective model for initial entropy deposition, and a Langevin transport model. Comparing calculations with and without initial sub-nucleonic hard-soft correlations, and for different modes of entropy deposition, we assess the sensitivity of heavy quark observables to these correlations.

      "Abstract": "The chirally anomalous transport including the chiral magnetic effect seems to get established from the theoretical side, but some theorists address serious concerns about the physical interpretation of $\\langle\\Omega|\\boldsymbol{j}|\\Omega\\rangle$.  In my talk I will emphasize how the conventional scenario can be verified from the dynamical process of the particle production.\r\n\r\nIf $|\\Omega\\rangle$ is an equilibrated static state, a current which is a real-time phenomenon, cannot flow and $\\langle\\Omega|\\boldsymbol{j}|\\Omega\\rangle$ is not a current but should be a polarization.  Such an interpretation is manifest for the chiral separation effect.  Besides, in a quick derivation of the chiral magnetic effect using the Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory, the anomalous current appears in the same way as the Maxwell's displacement current, and we all know that the displacement current is a source of the magnetic field but there is no flow of electric carriers.  Logically, it is possible that $\\langle\\Omega|\\boldsymbol{j}|\\Omega\\rangle$ is also such a current containing no flow of charged particles, which is actually the case if the chiral magnetic current is formulated in the chiral perturbation theory.\r\n\r\nI would however, emphasize that the genuine current generation occurs at the same time as the particle production with glasma flux tubes that locally violate P- and CP-symmetries together with an external magnetic field.  The distribution function in momentum space is dynamically determined by microscopic processes of the particle production and I will present some results from the numerical simulation.  A non-trivial observation found in the numerical simulation includes a quantitative estimate of the response time of the system until the anomalous current starts growing up after the switch-on of the background fields, which has a practically important implication for the detection of the physical observables sensisive to the chrally anomalous transport in experiments.",

      "Abstract": "Electromagnetic probes have been expected to be penetrating probes of the early-time dynamics and quark-gluon plasma. Indeed, the photon spectra measured in the recent RHIC and LHC experiments provide us with an opportunity to deepen understanding of the photon emission mechanism, as they have significantly larger anisotropies compared to theoretical estimates by the hydrodynamic modeling of the bulk properties, implying a missing photon production mechanism giving rise to the large anisotropy. This also implies that the sensible production mechanism should be able to provide a good amount of photons so the anisotropy survives in averaging over various photon sources.\r\n\r\nWe discuss a photon production mechanism associated with the fragmentation of jets of quarks and antiquarks. We show theoretical estimates of the photon yield obtained from a convolution of the phenomenological jet distribution and the photon emission rate by the bremsstrahlung after the hard parton scatterings at the impact of heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nOur estimate shows a significant photon yield in a few GeV transverse momentum range and a power low behavior. This transverse momentum dependence may be consistent with a recent observation that the photon spectra measured in distinct collision energies can be fitted by power low exponents and the saturation momentum which characterizes the energy scale before and just after the collisions [Klein-Boesing, McLerran, Phys. Lett. B 741 (2015)]. An implication from this observation is the early-time emission of photons before other scales come into play. As a possible interpretation of the early-time emission, we argue that the power low behavior of the phenomenological jet distribution with an infrared cutoff by the saturation momentum is taken over by the photon spectrum. We also discuss anisotropy of the photon spectrum due to the jet energy loss which captures the anisotropic spatial geometry of the matter.",

      "Abstract": "The primary goal in heavy ion collision (HIC) experiments is to characterise \r\nthe properties of the hot and dense strongly interacting matter produced after \r\nthe collision. A precise comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental \r\ndata helps to select one theoretical model over another. However, one of the \r\nsignificant challenges in such endeavors is the ignorance of the initial condition \r\nat the time of collision. The nuclei being extended objects, there are event by \r\nevent geometric fluctuations in addition to quantum fluctuations of the nuclear \r\nwave function. The standard method of analyzing the collisions in bins of centrality \r\nis only able to select events with the initial condition averaged over many possible \r\ninitial states. \r\n\r\n   In this work, we perform an additional binning in terms of total spectator neutrons \r\nin an event. A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model has been used in our analysis.\r\nWe have used the left ($L$) going and right ($R$) going spectator neutrons to form the \r\nobservable $L+R$ that can be measured in experiments using Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC). \r\nThe spectator binning helps us to analyse rarer events whose property usually get masked \r\nin the standard analysis with centrality bins. We find that in a given centrality bin, events \r\nwith different ellipticity can be selected with $L+R$ binning. This serves as a complementary \r\ntechnique to $q_2$-binning to analyse intial event shape. The advantage in using spectators \r\nis that they are never part of the fireball produced and hence are pristine carriers of the \r\ninitial state information. We find that the scaling relation between $v_2/\\varepsilon_2$ and \r\n$\\left(1/S\\right)dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ obeyed by different centrality bins is broken by the $L+R$ bins, \r\ninstead the hydrodynamic response for both centrality as well as $L+R$ bins exhibit scaling \r\nwith the initial transverse dimension.",

This class of detectors, which include Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs), Micro-MEsh Gaseous Structure detectors (MicroMegas) and similar, usually require the measurement of small currents (pA) at high potentials (kV) with respect to ground. While only this in itself presents an obstacle, the measurements very often need to satisfy other strict requirements, such as small current resolution, low power consumption, high readout frequencies (1 kHz) or simultaneous readouts of multiple channels.\r\n\r\nSeveral instruments that overcome some of these difficulties have been proposed or developed, often lacking in characteristics that would make them universally applicable. We present a description of a high-resolution picoammeter developed in our laboratory. Tests of the prototype with a local Gas Electron Multiplier sheet setup demonstrate that it satisfies all the aforementioned requirements, including a current resolution of less than 15pA, a readout frequency of 1kHz, the ability of simultaneous readout of multiple channels (up to 16) and low battery power consumption. Several prototypes have been sent for independent testing to other institutions, providing feedback for possible improvements, which are either already under way or planned as future upgrades.",

      "Abstract": "Nuclear symmetry energy is an important ingredient in understanding asymmetric nuclear configuration starting from rare isotopes at nuclear matter density to the core of neutron star at extremely high density.\r\nThe symmetry energy in continuous matter can be defined as\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\bar{E}(\\rho_N,I)=E_0(\\rho_N)+E_{\\textrm{sym}}(\\rho_N)I^2 +\r\nO(I^4)+\\cdots,\r\n\\end{equation}\r\nwhere $\\rho_N$ is the nuclear medium density and $I =\r\n(\\rho_n-\\rho_p)/(\\rho_n+\\rho_p)$ the asymmetric parameter. Our goal\r\nis to understand the iso-spin asymmetric nature of the nuclear\r\nmatter using the QCD degree of freedom.\r\n\r\nFor the hadronic phase, by taking the\r\ndifference between the  neutron and proton self-energies calculated in the QCD sum rules, we obtained the\r\nsymmetry energy in terms of local operators [1]. We\r\nfind that the scalar (vector) part gives a negative (positive)\r\ncontribution to the nuclear symmetry energy, which is consistent\r\nwith the results from relativistic mean field theories.\r\n\r\nFor the  quark phase, we used hard dense loop (HDL) resummation for\r\nthe normal phase and considered BCS pairing in 2-color\r\nsuperconductor (2SC) phase [2]. In the normal\r\nphase, the effect of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy,\r\nobtained from the HDL resumed free energy, was found to be small. In\r\nthe 2SC phase, the BCS paring gives enhanced symmetry energy as the\r\ngapped states are forced to be in the common Fermi sea reducing\r\niso-spin asymmetrizable states. Also, in the 2SC phase, the gluonic\r\ncontribution to the symmetry energy is expected to be minimal as\r\nonly the unimportant Meissner mass has iso-spin dependence. The\r\ndifferent symmetry energy in each phase will affect the iso-spin\r\ndensity of the dense matter and subsequently lead to different\r\nprediction for the particle yields in HIC experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  K.~S.~Jeong and S.~H.~Lee, \r\n  Phys.

      "Abstract": "The collective anisotropic flows observed in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC and the agreement with hydrodynamic calculations strongly support that a hot and dense QGP may be formed in such small collisions systems. However, the current experimental measurement showed no indication of nuclear modification on the production of large transverse momentum hadrons and jets in minimum-bias proton-lead collisions. As is well known, jet quenching has been one of the most important evidences for the formation of QGP in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Thus, the search for the signature of jet modification is essential to our understanding of high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nWe study the nuclear modification of full jets and their structure in proton-lead collisions at the LHC. The evolution of full jet shower in dense QCD matter is simulated via a pQCD-based Monte-Carlo transport model which includes the medium effects from both radiative and collisional processes. The space-time evolution of the hot and dense nuclear matter produced in proton-lead collisions at the LHC is simulated utilizing a (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions as obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber-based energy deposition model, from which we calculate the anistropic flows and compare to the experimental data. We are particularly interested in the multiplicity dependence and the rapidity dependence for the nuclear modification of the inner structure of single inclusive jets and photon-triggered jets in proton-lead collisions. Comparing to the single inclusive hadron or jet spectra, the modification of full jet structure is more sensitive to the details of jet-medium interaction. We argue that the multiplicity and rapidity dependences for the nuclear modification of full jet structure, once observed, should clearly signal the formation of QGP in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.",

Chemical equilibration of strange quarks formed in such medium happens faster than would be the situation in hadronic scenario [2].\r\n\r\nWith 20% larger energy density expected [3] and a larger lifetime of fireball than Au+Au collisions, we can have a better insight of testing these facts in U+U collisions.\r\n\r\nWe will present transverse momentum (pT ) spectra of Ks , \u039b(\u039b \u0304) and \u039e(\u039e \u0304) in U+U collisions at \u221asNN = 193 GeV in STAR experiment at RHIC.

A thermodynamically consistent form of the Tsallis distribution at y = 0 has been used for fitting the transverse momentum spectra $d^{2}N/dp_Tdy$ and to evaluate the particle yields. The Tsallis distribution described the $p_T$ spectra very well. The values of $dN/dy|_{y=0}$ obtained from the Tsallis distribution are in agreement with the values measured by the LHC experiments. The centre-of-mass energy dependence of $dN/dy|_{y=0}$ and data to fit ratio will be presented and discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) have raised special interest due to the fact that they can produce QGP-like effects in small systems, specifically, flow-like patterns. Now we will show that the same mechanisms produce an explicit dependence of the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra with the number of constituent quarks. In addition, a Cronin-like peak, at intermediate transverse momentum (2 $<  p_{\\rm T} <$ 10 GeV/$c$), and a sort of binary scaling, at higher $p_{\\rm T}$, are also observed in events with large number of MPI in pp collisions. While those effects have been revealed in pA collisions at  RHIC and at  LHC. In pp collisions, the last two effects have not been reported. This suggests that if MPI and CR are the mechanisms which originate the observed effects, then, the conditions for jet quenching would not be satisfied in small systems.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will discuss the experimental challenges to select on MPI. Specifically, the limitations and the biases of the event multiplicity, when, it is calculated in certain kinematic regions. We will show that such a selection can be improved using new approaches based on event shapes. Among the findings we will report that the multiplicity selection bias may affect the average \\pt at high multiplicity, producing the so-called second rise of $\\langle p_{\\rm T} \\rangle$ as reported by the ALICE Collaboration. Also, it will be argued that the average expansion velocity extracted from the analysis of the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra can be increased by the same kind of bias. Results for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 13 TeV, and comparisons with the available experimental data will be presented.",

However, the QGP equation of state needs to be interpreted in terms of effective degrees of freedom (d.o.f). Considering the QGP as a dynamical quasi-particle medium of massive off-shell particles (as described by the dynamical quasi-particles model \u201cDQPM\u201d [2]), we reproduce the lQCD results at finite temperature and chemical potential including the speed of sound. Moreover, we simultaneously describe the quark number density and susceptibility. Within our study, we determine the momentum, temperature and chemical potential dependencies of the QGP d.o.f. within the dynamical quasi-particle model [3].\r\n\r\nIn the same approach, we compute the transport properties (shear and bulk viscosities, electric and heat conductivities, etc) of the QGP at finite temperature and chemical potential. The cross sections at finite temperature and chemical potential, used in our study, are evaluated for these dynamical quasi-particles using the leading order Born diagrams [4].

In high-energy hadronic collisions such as those delivered by the LHC between\r\n 2010 and 2013, charmonium production results from the hard scattering of two gluons,\r\n which occurs very early. In heavy ion collisions, charmonia can thus probe all states of the\r\n nuclear matter formed afterward and have therefore been used extensively to study the\r\n properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will report on published charmonium measurements performed\r\n by ALICE in Pb \u2212 Pb collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision\r\n \u221asNN = 2.76 TeV, at both mid (|y| < 0.8) and forward (2.5 < y < 4) rapidities. The\r\n nuclear modification factor of inclusive J/\u03c8 will be presented as a function of the collision\r\n centrality, the J/\u03c8 transverse momentum (pT) as well as its rapidity. The variation of the\r\n J/\u03c8 mean transverse momentum and mean transverse momentum squared as a function\r\n of the collision centrality will also be discussed. These measurements will be compared to\r\n models that include one or several of the following mechanisms: color screening; balance\r\n between dissociation and recombination in the QGP; recombination at the QGP phase\r\n boundary; interaction with a dense comoving medium. Results on the production of the\r\n heavier and less bound \u03c8(2S) meson in Pb \u2212 Pb collisions at forward-rapidity will also\r\n be presented and compared to both models and measurements performed by other experiments. At mid-rapidity we will also report on ALICE unique capability to separate prompt\r\n and non-prompt J/\u03c8 production down to low pT (\u2265 1.5 GeV/c) and thus provide direct\r\n insight on the energy loss of b quarks in the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "The cross section for photoproducion of vector meson in ultra-peripheral collisions, i.e. collisions without nuclear overlap (b > 2R), is huge at high collision energies. This process can, however, occur also in peripheral and semi-central nucleus-nucleus collisions, where there are large spectator fragments, which can act as photon sources and targets.\r\n\r\nAs this presentation will show, one can expect significant photoproduction of J/\\psi in Pb+Pb collisions with impact parameters in the range 10 - 15 fm at the LHC.  This contribution is important to understand in order to be able to determine the true centrality dependence of the J/\\psi yield from hadronic sources. It also addresses some interesting questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in a semi-central collision: if the number of photons is \"frozen\" before the collision and all protons contribute to the photon flux, or if only the protons in the spectator fragments contribute. Similarly, it is not clear if the photon target is restricted to the spectator fragments or if production can occur also in the participant region. In the latter case, photoproduction will provide a novel probe of strongly interacting matter, and the interplay with hadronic production, e.g. regarding regeneration and thermalization, would merit further experimental and theoretical study.\r\n\r\nThe model used to calculate the photoproduction cross section will be discussed and the expected yield as function of centrality will be compared with the expected hadronic contribution. The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the two production mechanisms will be compared.  The calculations indicate that the yield from photoproduction changes from a few percent of the hadronic yield for the 50-60% most central collisions to around 50% of the hadronic yield for the 80-90% most central collisions.",

Comparing our calculations within the PHSD transport approach to the multitude of data by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC as well as by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations at RHIC allows us to determine the space-time evolution of the collision, the sheer viscosity of the produced matter and to put experimental constrains on its electric conductivity. We model the heavy-ion collisions using the PHSD microscopic transport approach, which includes the dynamics of quarks, antiquarks and gluons as well as a covariant dynamical hadronization scheme and the subsequent off-shell hadronic reaction dynamics. The implementation of photon bremsstrahlung in transport approaches has been based until now on the soft photon approximation, which is valid only at low energy of the produced photon. Presently, we have improved the calculation of this channel beyond the soft photon approximation by using the one-boson-exchange model. In order to clarify the channel decomposition of the direct photon spectra, we investigate the centrality dependence of the photon yield at RHIC and, most recently, also at the LHC. We will also present predictions for the photon production in the RHIC Beam-Energy-Scan and the comparison of dilepton data to the results of the PHENIX Collaboration with the Hadron-Blind Detector. Additionally, we propose a new observable with the potential to monitor the dynamics of the QGP equilibration in the initial stages of the collision.",

The PHOS detector in ALICE is an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of 12,544 lead-tungstate (PWO) crystals attached with avalanche photodiodes (APD). The PHOS realizes a fine granularity as well as a high energy-resolution of  $\\sigma/E$ = 3.5\\% at 1 GeV. One of important physics goals by the detector is to reveal thermal properties of the QGP by measuring thermal photons.\r\nFor this goal, it is essential to accumulate high statistics in Pb-Pb collisions with a peak luminosity of L = $\\rm 6 \\times 10^{27} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$. The PHOS team has decided to upgrade its readout system to a new one based on the point-to-point readout technique after the end of RUN-1. The new readout system is composed of 392 Front-End Electronics (FEE) boards and 14 Scalable Readout Units (SRU) and makes it possible to read faster.\r\nThe current status of the PHOS detector performed in RUN-2 for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV will be presented.",

A summary of the performance will be presented. \r\nFor RUN 3 and RUN 4, where collision rates of 50 kHz are expected, our aim is to preserve this excellent performance while removing the inherent rate limitation imposed by the gating grid, such that 50 kHz read-out rate can be achieved. \r\nTo this end, a new concept for continuous readout at a minimum of space-charge build-up in the drift volume will be adopted. A novel configuration of GEM detectors has been developed that allows one to maintain excellent particle identification and effective ion trapping, by stacking four GEM foils with different hole pitches and operated under an ad hoc field configuration. Results of intensive R&D to achieve this goal will be summarized, including the demonstration of robustness against discharges.\r\nWe will also discuss the detector production phase, which is just starting, and includes extensive and repeated quality assurance to ensure the reliability of the chambers once they are installed in the TPC.",

Heavy quark production in p+p collisions is a baseline to investigation of the QGP in heavy-ion collisions and is expected to be well described by perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD). However, the pQCD calculations have large uncertainties at low transverse momentum (pT). Thus measurements of heavy quark production at low pT in p+p collisions, which can be studied by measuring electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor hadrons, are crucial for constraining the pQCD models.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the STAR measurements of low pT heavy flavor decay electron production in p+p collisions at \u221as=200 GeV in RHIC run 2012 with 6\uff5e7 times more statistics than measurements of run 2009 data.",

So far in p+p collisions at 200 GeV, ridge-like signal have not been found yet. However, there is significant difference in the multiplicity between 510 GeV and 200 GeV, so comparison of the two energies could provide an important insight on multiplicity and collision energy dependent studies with small collision systems.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we report current status of flow and long-range correlation studies in high-multiplicity $p+p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=510$ GeV with various analysis methods including (1) 2-particle correlation, (2) event plane as well as (3) reference fitting methods, and possibly to compare with $p+p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and other small collision systems, such as $p+A$, $d+A$ and $^{3}He+A$ collisions at RHIC energies in PHENIX experiment.",

      "Abstract": "In recent theoretical studies of QCD at finite temperature and density, there is a growing consensus that spatially inhomogeneous chiral condensed phases appear in the region where a first-order chiral phase transition would occur. We present a study on the stability of a Fulde-Ferrell type inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase, the so-called dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase, of dense quark matter against low energy fluctuations about a spatially modulated order parameter [1]. We find that the DCDW phase exhibits a flavor-translation locking symmetry from the symmetry point of view. We also show that the Nambu-Goldstone modes, whose dispersion relations are spatially anisotropic and soft in the directions transverse to the modulation, wash out the long-range order at non-zero temperatures, but sustain quasi-long-range correlations (algebraically decaying long-range correlations), starting with a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective Lagrangian. Consequently, at finite temperatures the DCDW phase is found to be a quasi-one-dimensional ordered phase as in smectic phases of liquid crystals.\r\n[1] T.-G. Lee, E. Nakano, Y. Tsue, T.

      "Abstract": "In this talk, we propose that heavy-light mesons can be good probes to investigate the nuclear matter. It is said that inhomogeneous chiral condensation phases in which neutral pion condense can exist in high density and low temperature region near the chiral restoration point. Then, we put heavy-light mesons into such phases and investigate what happens. At first, we put heavy-light mesons on some inhomogeneous phases and see the modification of their masses. In this case, heavy-light mesons carrying different spin and iso-spin mix each other. And this causes the mass splitting of heavy-light mesons, e.g., $D(0^-)$ and $D^*(1^-)$ degenerated in the vacuum. Furthermore, these splitting patterns reflect what kind of inhomogeneous phase occurs. Next, we show the dispersion relations for heavy-light mesons in the Chiral Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW is one of the inhomogeneous phases where scalar mode and neutral pseudo-scalar mode can condense. In this phase, potentials for heavy-light mesons are periodic, so that we have to employ the Bloch\u2019s theorem to get the dispersion relations. Thereby, dispersion relations drastically change, i.e., the existence of the Brillouin zones and the emergence of collective modes. These modifications are signal of the existence of the inhomogeneous phases.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Enhanced near critical fluctuations can be quantified by the variance of the critical field (the Gaussian cumulant), as well as higher non-Gaussian cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis. These non-Gaussian cumulants are accessible through measurements of event-by-event fluctuations of various particle multiplicities. Non-Gaussian event-by-event fluctuations of multiplicities are generically expected to show nonmonotonic behavior in the proximity of the critical point.  These expectations are entirely based on the assumption that the soft modes responsible for critical fluctuations are in equilibrium with the medium. However, the expanding medium created in heavy-ion collisions only spends a limited amount of time in the QCD critical regime and it is unlikely the critical modes remain in equilibrium in this duration.\r\n\r\nWe derive a coupled set of equations that describe the non-equilibrium evolution of cumulants of critical fluctuations for space-time trajectories on the cross-over side of the QCD phase diagram. In particular, novel expressions are obtained for the non-equilibrium evolution of non-Gaussian Skewness and Kurtosis cumulants. Utilizing a simple model of the space-time evolution of a heavyion collision, we demonstrate that, depending on the relaxation rate of critical fluctuations, Skewness and Kurtosis can differ significantly in magnitude as well as in sign from equilibrium expectations. Memory effects are important and shown to persist even for trajectories that skirt the edge of the critical regime. We use phenomenologically motivated parameterizations of freeze-out curves, and of the beam energy dependence of the net baryon chemical potential, to explore the implications of our model study for the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions.",

By inspecting the corresponding leading-order expressions within the collinearly factorized QCD we find that the center-of-mass energy dependence at forward/backward direction should be describable by a simple power law. The physical interpretation of the scaling exponent is in the small-x behaviour of the parton densities. The most thrilling consequence, however, is the resulting extremely simple scaling law for the lepton charge asymmetry which also relates measurements in different collision systems. For example, this allows an almost-direct comparison of measurements in p-p and p-Pb or in p-Pb and Pb-Pb, pairwise, even if the center-of-mass energies would be different! The expectations are contrasted with the existing data and a very good overall agreement is indeed found.

These phenomena might take place at different time after the collision based on fulfilling the required conditions at a particular time. Fluctuations are therefore expected to show non-monotonic behaviour at the of time of occurence of these phenomena. Experimentally, fluctuations are measured at freezeout. In this work, using the hybrid version of the UrQMD event generator, we have investigated the propagation of fluctuations of particle multiplicities, their ratios and the ratio of total positive and negative charges in AuAu collisions at E$_{lab} < $ 90 AGeV. Two commonly used experimental measures i.e., $\\sigma^2$/mean and $\\nu_{dyn}$ have been used in the analysis in a given acceptance. The hybrid model, i.e., UrQMD with hydrodynamic evolution has been used to  study the effect of hydrodynamic evolution on these conventional fluctuation measures. It is observed that the fluctuations as measured by $\\sigma^2$/mean and $\\nu_{dyn}$ gets reduced considerably at freezeout. The dominat structures present at the initial stage of the evolution get smoothen out. However, the energy dependence of the fluctuations remain preserved till the freezeout. The hydrodynamic evolution of the model with chiral equation of state shows considerably higher fluctuation at lower collision energy as compared to pure hadronic transport version or the hybrid version with hadronic equation of state. The time evolution of the higher order moments of net-proton distributios for particles in a specified coverage showed similar behaviour.",

Long range di-hadron correlations, also known as the ridge, have been observed at the top RHIC energies and the LHC in A+A, p+A, and d+A collisions and are crucial to probing the collectivity of the various systems. We will present the first set of results of 2D di-hadron correlations ($\\Delta \\phi,\\Delta \\eta$) for Au+Au collisions with center-of-mass energies 7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV from the STAR experiment. Measurements of these correlations will utilize both the TPC and FTPC to provide extensive coverage in azimuth and pseudo-rapidity, where the ranges extend to $0 < \\phi < 2\\pi$ and $0 < |\\eta| < 4$ respectively and are integrated over $0.2<p_T<2.0$ GeV/c. We will obtain anisotropy coefficients of orders 2-5 ($v_{2-5}\\{2\\}$) from the ridge, and show how they depend on energy and centrality. In particular, when scaled by the multiplicity, we find $v_3\\{2\\}$ shows a non-monotonic behavior as a function of energy. Hints of similar behavior are observed when $v_3\\{2\\}$ and $v_4\\{2\\}$ are scaled by $v_2\\{2\\}$. We will discuss the relevance of this observation in terms of a possible pressure minimum, and how such a minimum might relate to critical point searches in the Beam Energy Scan.

Besides, we present a variety of predictions for the nuclear suppression as function of transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass of the lepton pair that can be verified by experiments at RHIC and LHC. We found that the nuclear suppression is caused predominantly by effects of quantum coherence (shadowing corrections) and by the effective energy loss induced by multiple initial state interactions. Whereas the former dominates at small Bjorken x2 in the target, the latter turns out to be significant at large x1 in the projectile beam and is universal at different energies and transverse momenta. Remarkably, the second new source of suppression appears to be significant even in those kinematic regions where the shadowing corrections are naturally suppressed.",

The HFT, composed of two silicon PiXeL detector (PXL) layers, an Intermediate Silicon Tracker (IST) and a Silicon Strip Detector (SSD), greatly improves the impact parameter resolution of STAR tracking and enables reconstruction of hadronic decays of heavy flavor mesons and baryons in the heavy ion collision environment, providing unique probes for studying the Quark-Gluon Plasma. In this talk we will discuss the HFT hardware design, and current detector status and performance.\r\n\r\nThe HFT was successfully commissioned during the 2014 RHIC run, taking data in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. The HFT performance during this run matches the expected performance, most significantly for track pointing resolution. We will show preliminary results from 2014 Au+Au data analyses, demonstrating the capabilities of charm reconstruction with the HFT. We will also describe recent modifications to HFT subsystems to improve its reliability, material budget, and tracking in the 2015 run, when the HFT has been taking data in p+p, p+Au and p+Al collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. \r\n\r\nIn order to extend these capabilities of measuring bottom quark hadrons at RHIC energies, a faster heavy flavor tracker (HFT+) is needed to collect data at higher luminosity with good efficiency. The proposed HFT+ will be equipped with new generation of MAPS sensors with a much shorter integration time (\u2264 20 \u03bcs) and possibly extend the current PXL detector acceptance with minimal modification to the original mechanical and air cooling infrastructure.

      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly in the context of heavy-ion collisions. The anomaly-induced transport effects like the CME are macroscopic and are incorporated into hydrodynamic equations giving rise to \"anomalous hydrodynamics\". Theoretically, the CME is expected to occur in heavy-ion collisions. The data reported by STAR[1] and PHENIX[2] collaborations at RHIC and ALICE collaborations [3] at the LHC show a behavior consistent with the CME, but the quantitative understanding is still lacking. In order to reach a definitive conclusion, a reliable theoretical tool that can describe the charge-dependent observables is indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we report our recent attempt of quantitative modeling of the CME for heavy-ion collisions. We develop an event-by-event hydrodynamic model which includes the anomalous transport effects. We perform 3+1 dimensional anomalous hydrodynamic simulations, with constitutive equations that contain the anomaly-induced effects. We also develop a model of the initial condition for the axial charge that captures the statistical nature of random chirality imbalance created by color flux tubes. Basing on the event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for hundreds of thousands of collisions, we calculate the correlation functions that are measured in experiments, and discuss how the anomalous transports affect the observables.\r\n\r\n[1] B.

Femtoscopic measurements may provide useful insight on both of these problems because they image the spatio-temporal size of the particle emitting region. In particular, the evolution of HBT radii with pair momentum should have a characteristic behavior in the presence of collective expansion. This talk will present identical-pion HBT measurements from ATLAS using one- and three-dimensional correlation functions. Pions are identified using $dE/dx$ measured in the pixel detector. Correlation functions and the resulting HBT radii will be presented as a function of pair momentum ($k_T$) and collision centrality. The contribution to the two-particle correlation function from hard processes is studied in depth, and a new method for completely constraining this background will be described. The measured source sizes are observed to decrease with $k_T$ and increase significantly in more central collisions.",

An enhancement is observed along \u03b7- =\u03b71-\u03b72  \u22480 and a suppression is observed at large \u03b7- values. The correlation function is expanded in Legendre polynomials, and root-mean-square values of the Legendre coefficients at the single particle level an are measured. Significant values are observed for an, which decrease quickly for larger n. The leading coefficient a1 is compared to that estimated from a fit to CN(\u03b7+) for different \u03b7- slices, as well as to the asymmetry of the number of participating nucleons between the two colliding nuclei ANpart = (NpartF-NpartB)/ (NpartF+NpartB). The centrality dependence of a1 show a very similar shape as ANpart in mid-central collisions (20-50%), but show faster increase in more central and more peripheral collisions. The latter behavior suggests additional forward-backward multiplicity fluctuations that may arise from fluctuations at the sub-nucleonic level.

In relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments performed in RHIC and LHC, it is predicted to be produced a strong magnetic field by non-central collision of charged nuclei. In particular, hadron properties under such external field can be drastically modified by perturbative and non-perturbative effects. \r\n\r\nIn this study, we investigate theoretically the properties of heavy hadrons (especially, D mesons) including a charm quark in a magnetic field by using some theoretical approaches such as the QCD sum rules and effective models. \r\nFrom our approaches, we can predict the D meson mass shifts by magnetic effects such as the Landau level for a charged particle, the mixing effect between different hadron states and magnetic field dependence of condensates. Technically, in the QCD sum rules, the OPE up to the order of the square of magnetic field is calculated and the magnetic field dependences of condensates are taken from the recent results of lattice QCD or effective field theory. For the phenomenological side, we introduce a new structures induced by a magnetic field to go beyond the analysis by (conventional) ``pole + continuum\" assumption.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we discuss some magnetic properties of the hadrons induced by a magnetic field, such as Landau level of the charged meson, mixing effect with other hadron states and magnetic field dependence of QCD condensates.

The resulting fluctuations and correlations are consistent with Lattice QCD results at the chiral crossover pseudocritical temperature Tc \u2243 155 MeV. This agreement lends strong support to the assumption that the fireball created in these collisions is of thermal origin and exhibits characteristic properties expected in QCD at the transition from the quark gluon plasma to the hadronic phase. Since Lattice QCD calculations are performed at a baryochemical potential of mu$_B$ = 0, the comparisons with LHC data are the most direct due to the vanishing baryon transport to midrapidity at these high energies. As an outlook, we will also present the applicability of our approach to RHIC data thus extending the comparisons to non-zero baryochemical potentials.",

      "Abstract": "We discuss the generation of anisotropic flows $v_n$ for a fluid at fixed $\\eta/s(T)$ by means of an \r\nevent-by-event transport approach. Such an approach, as shown in [1], recovers the universal features \r\nof the ideal hydrodynamics showing an agreement with the recent analitical solutions.\r\nWe discuss the effect of the $\\eta/s$ and its temperature dependence on the \r\nbuild up of the $v_n(p_T)$ revealing that only in ultra-central collisions ($0-0.2\\%$) the $v_n(p_T)$ have a stronger sensitivity to the T dependence of $\\eta/s$ in the QGP phase and this sensitivity increases with \r\nthe order of the harmonic n. \r\nMoreover, the study of the correlations between the initial spatial anisotropies $\\epsilon_n$ and the final \r\nflow coefficients $v_n$ shows that at LHC energies there is more correlation than at RHIC energies. \r\nThe degree of correlation increases from peripheral to central collisions, but only in ultra-central \r\ncollisions at LHC, we find that the linear correlation coefficent $C(n,n) \\approx 1$ for $n=2,3,4$ and $5$. This suggests that \r\nthe final correlations in the ($v_n$,$v_m$) space reflect the initial correlations in the ($\\epsilon_n$,$\\epsilon_m$) space. \r\nMoreover the recent event shape engineering (ESE) [4]  tecnique allows to have a new insight into the initial state fluctuations and $\\epsilon_n$ correlations [5].\r\nFinally, we discuss in ultra-central collisions the structure of the integrated ($v_n,n$) plot and its relation with the \r\nkinetic freeze out dynamics.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

      "Abstract": "In heavy ion collisions, quarkonium is produced in a rapidly thermalized deconfined medium. Quarkonium production can be understood in terms of Langevin dynamics of heavy quarks interacting through medium modified potential [1]. This framework was used sucessfully to understand charmonium production at RHIC [1,2] including recombinant production [2] when realistic values of the heavy quark diffusion constant are used together\r\nwith a lattice QCD inspired potential. It also explains the J/psi production at LHC including its centrality independence [3].\r\n\r\nWe extend this framework to upsilon production by including the thermal dissociation of formed bottomonia.  This is done with a transport (local\r\nrate) equation followed by Langevin dynamics of the correlated $Q\\bar{Q}$ states. The bulk evolution of the medium is treated using MUSIC, a 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulator of heavy ion collisions, while we make use of the latest lattice results on the $Q\\bar{Q}$ potential.

      "Abstract": "Transport + hydrodynamics approach has proved to be successful in describing the particle spectra and elliptic flow in the heavy ion collisions at the collision energy range investigated in RHIC beam energy scan. However, it has been difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the chosen values of input parameters, due to the massive amount of computational resources required for evaluating all possible input parameter combinations. A way to reduce the computational effort is to run a set of simulations for semi-random, space-filling selection of points in parameter space, and then use an emulator trained on this data to predict the output for arbitrary input. Gaussian processes are an attractive choice for the emulator, as they are very flexible and predict probability distributions with quantitative uncertainty.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we investigate the input parameters, including the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\\eta/s$, of the UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model[1]. Focusing on Au+Au collisions at the higher end of the RHIC beam energy scan energy range, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ and $39$ GeV, we determine the most probable parameter values and their uncertainties using the state-of-the-art statistical analysis based on Bayesian statistics. Following the methods described in [2,3], the probability distributions for the parameters are produced by calibrating the model to experimental data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, utilizing Gaussian processes to emulate the hybrid model behavior for uninvestigated input values. The results illustrate how much the input parameters are constrained by a given set of observables and reveal the correlations between the parameters.\r\n\r\n[1] Iu.

      "Abstract": "Studies of the QCD phase diagram at finite temperature and quark chemical potential are currently one of the most discussed topics in theoretical physics and are of great importance to better our understanding of heavy-ion collision experiments. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the detailed structure of the QCD phase diagram at high baryon densities. Models provide some insight into the phase structure but usually rely on various parameters and therefore require validation from the point of view of the fundamental theory. We propose to apply nonperturbative functional Renormalization Group methods (FRG) to QCD in order to determine constraints on the parameters used in low-energy QCD models. In particular, this includes a determination of the dependence of these parameters on temperature and quark chemical potential. We present first results and argue that our findings can be used to improve the predictive power of model calculations.",

Immediately after a collision, which is a crucial stage of the problem, strong gluon field is dominant and quantum fluctuations on the top of the classical configurations (glasma) induce instabilities. It may trigger the chaotic behavior of the gauge field and eventually give rise to entropy production. In this work, we investigate thermalization of glasma by using the Husimi-Wehrl (H-W) entropy defined by Husimi function which is a coarse-grained quantum distribution function. We calculate the semi-classical time evolution of the Husimi function and the H-W entropy in Yang-Mills field theory with two numerical methods based on Monte-Carlo method, and also discuss the time scale of the entropy growth.",

      "Abstract": "As we see expansion of bulk quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions is well described by relativistic hydrodynamics, fluidity is one of the key properties of the QGP. At the same time, the QGP has a large stopping power against propagation of jets: The jets lose a large amount of their energies while traversing the QGP fluid due to strong interactions between them. The deposited energy of the jet induces a shock wave, a.k.a. Mach cone, in the QGP as a hydrodynamic response. Such a hydrodynamic response is also a clear manifestation of the fluidity of the QGP. Since the structure of shock wave is characterized by various properties of the QGP, e.g., sound velocity, stopping power, and viscosity, we have a great opportunity to extract the property of the QGP by analyzing this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWe study the hydrodynamic response to jet propagation in the expanding QGP and investigate how it reflects the particle spectra after the hydrodynamic evolution of the bulk QGP. We perform simulations of the bulk dynamics of the QGP specifically in di-jet and gamma-jet events by solving (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms. Mach cones are formed and largely develops in the QGP fluid. However, the double peak in the azimuthal particle distribution, which is believed to be an intuitive signal of the Mach cone, is smeared out by the diffusion wake, the distortion by the radial flow and freeze-out processes. Instead, we find a novel phenomenon of the interplay between the Mach cone and radial expansion when the jets travel through the off-central trajectories: Propagation of Mach cone pushes back the radial flow. As a result, the particle production is suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation. This is the direct signal of hydrodynamic response to jet propagation and even includes the information about the jet passage in the expanding QGP fluid.",

      "Abstract": "Complete evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied within a coupled Boltzmann and relativistic viscous hydrodynamics approach [1]. For the initial non-equilibrium evolution phase, we employ A MultiPhase Transport model that explicitly includes event-by-event fluctuations in the number and positions of the participating nucleons as well as of the produced partons with subsequent parton transport. The ensuing near-equilibrium evolution of quark-gluon and hadronic matter is modeled within the (2+1)D relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. (1) We probe the role of parton dynamics in generating and maintaining the spatial anisotropy in the pre-equilibrium phase. Substantial spatial eccentricities $\\varepsilon_n$ are found to be generated in the process of parton production from initial NN collisions. (2) For ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, the model is able to explain qualitatively the unexpected hierarchy of the flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-6)$ observed at LHC. (3) We find that the results for $v_n(p_T)$ are rather insensitive to the variation (within a range) of the time of switchover from AMPT parton transport to hydrodynamic evolution. (4) The usual Grad and the recently proposed Chapman-Enskog-like single-particle distribution functions are found to give very similar results for $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-4)$. (5) The model describes well both the RHIC and LHC data for $v_n(p_T)$ at various centralities, with a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio 0.08 and 0.12, respectively. (6) The event-by-event distributions of $v_{2,3}$ are in good agreement with the LHC data for mid-central collisions. The linear response relation $v_n = k_n \\varepsilon_n$ is found to be true for $n=2,3$, except at large values of $\\varepsilon_n$, where a larger value of $k_n$ is required, suggesting a small admixture of positive nonlinear response even for $n=2,3$.\r\n\r\n[1] R.S.

We show that the\r\ninterplay between the interaction of the $K^*$ meson with light\r\nmesons in the hadronic medium and that of the kaon determines the\r\nfinal yield difference of the statistical hadronization model to\r\nthe experimental measurements. For the central Au+Au collision at\r\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, we find that the $K^*/K$ yield ratio at\r\nchemical freeze-out decreases by $32\\%$ during the expansion of\r\nthe hadronic matter, resulting in the final ratio comparable to\r\nSTAR measurements of 0.23 $\\pm0.05$.",

It will also determine multiplicity, centrality, and reaction plane of heavy ion collisions. FIT will consist of two arrays of Cherenkov radiators coupled to MCP-PMT sensors and of a segmented scintillator ring increasing the acceptance, improving the performance, adding sensitivity to detect beam-gas events and providing some degree of redundancy. The arrays will be placed on the opposite sides of the interaction point (IP). Because of the asymmetry imposed by the presence of the hadron absorber, also the placement of the FIT arrays will be asymmetric: ~800 mm from IP on the absorber side and ~3200 mm from IP on the opposite side. Scheduled for installation during the Long Shutdown 2 (from mid 2018 till the end of 2019) FIT is in the midst of an intense R&D and prototyping period. The timing, amplitude and efficiency characteristics are determined with relativistic particles at CERN PS and with fast lasers. The ongoing Monte Carlo studies verify the physics performance and refine the geometry of the FIT arrays. The presentation will give a short description of FIT, summary of the performance, and the outcome of the simulations.</pre>",

We implement this\r\napproach in a Monte Carlo, which supplements the DGLAP shower with the\r\nenergy loss dynamics as dictated by holographic computations, up\r\nto a single free parameter that we fit to data.

We use our model to\r\npredict a broad range of dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables for\r\nthe upcoming LHC Run II, at $\\sqrt{s}=5.02$~ATeV. We then augment\r\nthe model by incorporating the transverse momentum picked up by\r\neach parton in the shower as it propagates through the medium, at\r\nthe expense of adding a second free parameter.

The fireball created in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions will reach kinetic freeze-out stage from the initial ultra-hot-dense state. The temperature, system size and lifetime, and expansion velocity at radial direction may inherit some properties of the QGP phase transition. HBT correlation function can provides the system evolution information, such as system size parameters, system lifetime. By fitting the HBT correlation radii in the blast-wave model, the system size and lifetime are presented with the kinetic temperature and radial flow extracted from transverse momentum distribution measured in experiments. The beam-energy  dependence of HBT radii significantly depends on the range of the system size parameter and system lifetime. And we also find the blast-wave can describe transverse momentum dependence of HBT correlation radii (Rside, Rout and Rlong) at LHC energy with same fixed parameters but it failed to fit Rlong while fitting Rside and Rout successfully at RHIC top energy with the same fixed parameters. This implies the different evolution mechanism for LHC and RHIC energy and suggests a long system lifetime for the fireball created at LHC energy.",

      "Abstract": "The experimental finding that in pA collisions at the LHC, $R_{pA}^{\\rm jet}$ is consistent with unity at high transverse energies, while $R_{pA}^{\\rm hadron}$ exceeds unity above $p_T \\sim 30$ GeV poses a fundamental problem for our understanding of high-$p_T$ processes in nuclear collisions. It can neither be accounted for in a collinear factorized formalism with process-independent fragmentation functions, nor can it be understood as a final state modification of the final state parton shower (on which standard jet quenching models in nucleus-nucleus collisions are based). We argue that these findings, point to a process-dependent element in the high-$p_T$ fragmentation mechanism. We note that the color recombination mechanisms implemented in general purpose event generators like SHERPA provide for such a process-dependent mechanism, since they imply that single inclusive hadron production depends not only on the factorized hard partonic interaction,\r\nbut also on the density of the underlying event within which this hard process color recombines during hadronization. We demonstrate both on the level of qualitative arguments and with Monte Carlo simulations that by simply accounting for the factor 3 higher underlying event activity in pA collisions as compared to pp collisions, this mechanism can account for\r\nthe observed nuclear modification factors of  jet and hadron spectra in pA collisions. We emphasize that if the proposed mechanism is confirmed, it has interesting consequences for the understanding of high-pT hadron spectra in proton-proton collisions, since it allows one to quantify the size of a process-dependent correction to the standard collinearly factorized framework.",

A theorem from Quantitative Finance states that for integer valued Levy processes such as the difference between two Poisson or two Negative Binomial Distributions, the cumulants $\\kappa_j$ of $P(N^+ - N^-)$, the difference of samples from two such distributions, $P(N^{+})$ and $P(N^-)$ which are both Poisson or NBD, with cumulants $\\kappa_j{^+}$ and $\\kappa_j{^-}$ respectively, is the same as if the $P(N^{+})$ and $P(N^-)$ were statistically independent, i.e. $\\kappa_j=\\kappa_j^+ +(-1)^j \\kappa_j^-$, so long as the distributions are not 100\\% correlated.

      "Abstract": "Recent measurements from RHIC and the LHC have shown that the excited charmonium state $\\psi(2s)$ is preferentially suppressed over the more tightly bound $J/\\psi$ in ultrarelativistic $p (d)$ + A collisions.  The exact mechanism behind this difference in suppression is not immediately clear.  Since all primordial charm quark production is subject to similar initial state effects inside the nucleus, and the time the $c \\bar{c}$ pair spends in the nucleus is so short, it may be that interactions outside the nucleus with co-moving particles are partially responsible for the disruption of the charmonium wavefunction.  Therefore it is interesting to study charmonium production at forward and backward rapidity, where the co-moving particle density varies considerably between the Au-going and $p$-going directions.  The introduction of the Forward Silicon Vertex Tracker (FVTX) in front of the PHENIX muons arms has improved the dimuon mass resolution such that the $\\psi(2s)$ peak can now be distinguished from the $J/\\psi$ peak and measured at forward and backward rapidity.  Here, we present the status of measurements of forward and backward $\\psi(2s)$ production in $p+p$ and $p+$Au collisions at 200 GeV/n, from the 2015 PHENIX dataset.",

      "Abstract": "Phase transitions and/or critical phenomena are known to lead to local density fluctuations in the nuclear matter created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In the quark coalescence picture of particle production, the baryon formation probability can be influenced by these local parton density fluctuations that lead to clustering and voids in the distribution of hadrons in the phase space. We propose to use the normalized distribution of produced particles in coarse azimuthal angular bins to study the fluctuations. The shape of the normalized distribution is expected to be sensitive to clustering in the phase space. We use Poisson and Binomial distributions to generate reference comparisons. Clustering of particles is introduced empirically in the Monte Carlo to investigate the sensitivity of various moments of the normalized distribution. We compare our Monte Carlo results with the STAR Beam Energy Scan data to demonstrate deviations from Poisson/Binomial distributions and the sensitivity of our approach to possible clustering and parton density fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.",

The results from the NA49 experiment at CERN have been used to claim that the onset of deconfinement occurs at a collision energy around a center-of-mass energy of 7 GeV, the low end of the BES range [1]. Data from lower energies are needed to test if this onset occurs. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES II with the same detector to energies that are likely below the onset of deconfinement. Currently, STAR has inserted a gold target into the beam pipe and conducted test runs at center-of-mass energies 3.9 and 4.5 GeV. Tests have been done with both Au and Al beams. First physics results from a Coulomb analysis of Au + Au fixed-target collisions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments, will be presented. These results demonstrate that STAR has good particle identification capabilities in this novel detector setup. Furthermore, the Coulomb potential, which is sensitive to the Z of the projectile and degree of baryonic stopping, will be compared with published results from the AGS.

They include an abrupt change of the   \neffective number of degrees of freedom at laboratory energies 8.9\u00ad-11.6   \nAGeV and plateaus in the collision\u00ad energy dependence of the entropy per   \nbaryon, pion number per baryon, and a sharp peak in the dimensionless trace anomaly at at chemical freeze-out laboratory energy 11.6 AGeV [1,2]. On the basis of the generalized shock-adiabat model we demonstrate that these observations give evidence for the anomalous thermodynamic properties of the mixed phase at its boundary to the QGP [2]. We argue that the trace anomaly peak and the local minimum of the generalized specific volume observed   \nat a laboratory energy of 11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of   \na mixed phase between the QGP and the hadron phase. This is also supported by an independent meta-analysis [3]: we compare the quality of hadron spectra and multiplicities description from 10 different models in the range of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from 2.1 GeV to 17.3 GeV and find that at 5-10.8 GeV and above 12 GeV models assuming QGP perform notably better, while at 4.4\u00ad-4.87 GeV and 10.8\u00ad-12 GeV QGP models perform as good as purely hadron ones.   \n  \nBased on these findings, the practical suggestions for the collision energies of the future   \nexperiments on RHIC, NICA and FAIR are formulated.   \n  \n1\\.

Measurements of Non-Photonic Electron (NPE) production from open heavy flavor hadron decays have revealed strong suppression at large transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Such suppression has been attributed to energy losses of heavy flavor quarks within the QGP. Theoretical predictions that are able to describe existing NPE data suggest that bottom quarks lose less energy than charm quarks, but it varies among models how exactly they differ. Therefore it is important to experimentally constrain such model calculations, which can further improve our understanding of parton interactions with the QGP and the QGP properties. Electrons from bottom hadron decays can be statistically separated thanks to the long lifetime of the bottom hadrons by comparison of the impact parameter distributions. \r\nIn this poster, we will present a first attempt to separately measure charm and bottom quark productions through semi-leptonic channels in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{S_{NN}}$=200 GeV at RHIC, utilizing the new Heavy Flavor Tracker of the STAR experiment.",

Studying quarkonium spectral properties at non-zero temperature, directly in lattice QCD, have proven to be difficult and detailed quantitative information on quarkonium in-medium properties is still lacking.\r\n\r\nLattice QCD based effective theories, such as lattice NRQCD, have seen impressive success in the determination of quarkonium properties in vacuum (e.g. their masses and decay widths), with the underlying framework being applicable in principle also at finite temperature.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of heavy quark (charm and bottom) production provide important constraints on the nature of the quark gluon plasma produced in high energy heavy ion collisions, as they are created only during the initial collision and therefore probe the full evolution of the medium. The PHENIX Collaboration has previously measured open heavy flavor production via the yields of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The results indicate a significant suppression of the combined charm and bottom decay electrons for $p_T>5$ GeV/$c$, but by themselves provide little constraint on the modification of the separate parent hadron distributions. The installation of the PHENIX silicon vertex detector in 2011 allowed for the measurement of the displaced vertex of these electrons for the first time at RHIC. In order to separate the contributions from charm and bottom hadrons, Bayesian unfolding techniques can be applied to the $p_T$ and displaced vertex dependence of the yield of electrons from open heavy flavor decays. This separation provides further constraints on energy loss and transport mechanisms in the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. This poster will present the unfolding techniques utilized in separating these contributions, as well as the status of the analysis in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions from PHENIX.",

      "Abstract": "One of the unique points of QCD phase diagram is the existence of QCD critical point (CP), which is the end point of the phase boundary of the first-order chiral transition at low temperature. It is noteworthy that the phase transition turns to a second order at the CP, where fluctuations of some physical quantities should be divergent in the system with infinite degrees of freedom. People are thus interested in identifying such physical quantities which divergent behavior can be nicely detectable in experiment. It has been suggested that the soft modes at the QCD CP are hydrodynamical modes such as the baryon density fluctuation (particle-hole excitation) and entropy fluctuation, using RPA analysis of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory [1, 2]. A notable point is that these modes are coupled to the scalar mode or the fluctuating mode of the chiral order parameter at finite chemical potential off the chiral limit. We examine whether this suggestion remain valid even when the thermodynamic fluctuations are fully taken into account. For this purpose, we calculate the spectral function of the collective modes coupled to the scalar mode using functional renormalization group. We employ the quark-meson model and set spatial momentum finite to investigate particle-hole excitations. On the basis of the numerical calculation of the spectral function around the QCD CP, we explore possible development and softening of the collective modes in the space-like as well as the time-like region.\r\n\r\n[1] H.

The CBM experiment aims at understanding and characterizing nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities but moderate temperatures focussing on the investigation of rare probes as for example electromagnetic radiation.\r\nThe major detector for clean electron identification in the CBM experiment at SIS 100 will be a RICH detector using CO${_2}$ as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors with reflective Al+MgF${_2}$ coating as focusing elements and a photodetector plane consisting of an array of H12700 MAPMTs from Hamamatsu. This detector concept has been tested extensively with a real-size RICH prototype in testbeams and proven to show a high performance. The testbeam evaluations included a detailed study of layers of wavelength-shifting films for enhanced UV sensitivity and the development of MAPMT readout. Several MAPMT sensors were tested in this setup but also for radiation hardness in separate experimental campaigns with thermal neutron and gamma irradiation. As result the H12700 sensor was ordered from Hamamatsu in spring 2015. First delivery is expected for autumn 2015. In order to make use of the early delivery of these photosensors with respect to the CBM time scales and to recuperate performance losses of the HADES RICH detector due to aging of the CsI photocathode, the HADES RICH detector will be upgraded with these photosensors and readout electronics as developed for CBM. This upgrade program will be finished for the next HADES data taking period starting 2017.\r\nIn this contribution we will report on the design and status of the CBM RICH development, on the beamtime results obtained with the RICH prototype and the HADES RICH upgrade plans.",

      "Abstract": "Forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements are used to study the soft component of high energy collisions. The observable is sensitive to the dynamics of the collision and is relatively less affected by the following hadronization processes. In proton-proton collisions, forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements allow one to study the underlying event while, in heavy-ion collisions, they can provide insight into effects such as gluon saturation. \r\n\r\nThe measurement requires one to determine the variances of and covariance between the forward and backward multiplicities. Realistic detector effects such as acceptance and efficiency alter the required measured quantities. Exactly how these quantities are altered is neither straightforward nor intuitive compelling one to use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unaltered values. However, the robustness of using Monte Carlo simulations is difficult to determine as they depend on the initial assumptions.\r\n\r\nA Monte Carlo independent technique to determine multiplicity correlation measurements which accounts for acceptance and efficiency is presented here. The goal is to allow one to perform these measurements while minimizing measurement bias and allowing one to exploit the full capability of their detector (full acceptance and largest pseudorapidity separations), where one may otherwise limit the acceptance with a fiducial cut. Larger separations and highest accuracy provide the maximum ability to distinguish between various models implementing different mechanisms for particle production.",

      "Abstract": "In the last years, some works have explored the thermodynamic properties of softly BRST broken pure gauge theories, as the ones that take into account the effect of Gribov ambiguities in the deep infrared regime.\r\nThe results obtained display clear nonperturbative aspects and indicate\r\nthat this may be a new pathway for QCD model building. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we explore thermodynamic properties of a model of quarks with soft BRST breaking for arbitrary temperatures and quark chemical potentials. This model is expected to describe the infrared properties of confined quarks, while keeping compatibility with ultraviolet QCD properties. Indeed, the analytical propagator of the model displays positivity violation and fits well the available lattice data. The model has been also proven to be renormalizable, reducing to perturbative quarks in the ultraviolet regime. Our goal here is to show not only that confinement in the form of positivity violation in the quark sector implies a well-defined macroscopic behaviour, but also that the tree level model is capable of predicting nontrivial features, being in general qualitatively compatible with the effect of nonperturbative interactions as observed in lattice data.",

Utilizing this tool requires accurate suppression predictions for different experiments, probes and experimental conditions, and their unbiased comparison with experimental data. With this goal, we developed the dynamical energy loss formalism towards generating predictions for non-central collisions; the formalism takes into account both radiative and collisional energy loss computed within the same theoretical framework, dynamical (as opposed to static) scattering centers, finite magnetic mass, running coupling and uses no free parameters in comparison with experimental data. Within this formalism, we will provide predictions, and a systematic comparison with experimental data, for a diverse set  of suppression data: all available light and heavy flavor probes, lower and high momentum ranges, various centrality ranges and various collision energies at RHIC and LHC. We will also provide clear qualitative and quantitative predictions for the upcoming RHIC and LHC experiments. Comprehensive agreement between our predictions and experimental results provides us with a good deal of confidence that our dynamical energy loss formalism can well explain the jet-medium interactions in QGP, which will be further tested by the obtained predictions for the upcoming data. Application of this model, as a novel high-precision tomographic tool of QGP medium, will also be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "High momentum hadron suppression is considered to be an excellent probe of jet-medium interactions in QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The dynamical energy loss formalism is shown to be able to accurately explain suppression measurements at 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [1,2]. With the upcoming LHC measurements at notably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences, with respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. We will concentrate on light and heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb collisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably (\u223c30% ) larger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to the estimated (significant) energy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly, more detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these two energies; note that this prediction is in agreement with the similar suppression patterns observed for light flavor observables at lower beam energies at RHIC and LHC. We will show that this unexpected result is due to interplay of the following two effects [3], which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of the initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii) significantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss. Therefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear (qualitative and quantitative) test of the dynamical energy loss formalism.\r\n[1] M. Djordjevic and M. Djordjevic, Phys. Lett.

      "Institute": "Wayne State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "At the early stages of non-central heavy-ion collisions, a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane is created. In asymmetric Cu+Au collisions, due to the difference in the number of spectators, not only the magnetic field but also a strong electric field (E-field) would be created along the reaction plane and pointing from the Au-nucleus to Cu-nucleus. The lifetime of the E-field would be short, of the order of a fraction of a fm/c. The quarks and antiquarks that have been already produced at this time would experience the Coulomb force, which result in charge separation of directed flow. Thus, the measurement of the charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au provides an opportunity to test different quark (charge) scenarios, e.g Pratt\u2019s two-wave quark production, and shed light on the (anti-)quark production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions in general. Understanding the time evolution of the quark densities in heavy-ion collisions is also very important for detailed theoretical predictions of the Chiral Magnetic Effect and Chiral Magnetic Wave, which various experiments are actively searching for.\r\n\ufffcThe transverse-momentum dependence of the directed (dipole) flow in Cu+Au collision is also very sensitive to the system initial density gradients in the transverse plane, which can only be observed in symmetric systems as a result of density fluctuations. Measurements of the higher-harmonic flow also allows further study of hydrodynamics and the properties of QGP.\r\nIn this talk, the charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au collisions at \u00a5sqrt{s_{NN}} =200 GeV measured in the STAR experiment will be presented. The results are compared with existing model predictions and implications for the dynamics of quarks production and system evolution will be discussed. Higher-harmonic flow will be also presented and compared with A+A collisions.",

In our jet evolution equations, we include all partonic splitting processes in the dense nuclear medium. We also include the collisional energy loss and transverse momentum broadening for both leading and radiated partons of the full jets due to elastic collisions with the medium constituents. We keep track of both the energies and the transverse momenta of all partons within the full jet shower, thus the modification of both jet energy and jet structure due to jet-medium interaction can be studied straightforwardly. Combining with realistic (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculation for the space-time profile of the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in Pb+Pb collisions, we apply our formalism to calculate the nuclear modification of single inclusive jet spectra, and the momentum imbalance of photon-jet and dijet pairs at the LHC. The jet shape function and jet fragmentation function (at the partonic level) are also studied for the quenched/modified jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We further present the detailed studies on the roles of various jet-medium interaction mechanisms on the modification of jet structure.",

      "Abstract": "Elliptic flow $v_2$ of direct photons are found to be larger than those from most hydrodynamic estimations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is recognized as the \"photon $v_2$ puzzle\". The recent discovery of large triangular flow $v_3$ hints that this is at least partially due to the medium properties. Theoretical explanation of the photon data should be essential for understanding the dynamical properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).\r\n\r\nWe discuss enhancement of direct photon flow harmonics due to (i) quark chemical equilibration [1] and (ii) in-medium corrections to phase-space distributions [2], both of which modify the photon emission rate. The former scenario is motivated by the observation that chemical equilibration can be slower than thermalization in the transition from the gluon-rich color glass condensate to the QGP [3]. In the latter scenario, we consider non-ideal gas distributions using a quasi-particle picture so that they reproduce the equation of state from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD. Both mechanisms reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom for the quark distribution. This suppresses early photons with smaller anisotropy, leading to larger anisotropy in total direct photons. \r\n\r\nWe use a hydrodynamic model to numerically estimate thermal photon $v_2$ and $v_3$ with and without the above effects. The calculations show visible enhancement of the photon flow harmonics. Quadrangular ($v_4$) and pentagonal ($v_5$) flow are also estimated as theoretical guides to quantify possible anomalous enhancement of anisotropy. \r\n\r\n[1] A. Monnai, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of direct photon tagged jets, in the form of photon-hadron correlations, are unique as an experimental tool for gaining access to the initial parton kinematics in a hard scattering. Once produced, these photons will not interact strongly with the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions, providing a calibrated measure of the pre-energy loss properties of the opposing parton and giving unique insight into how jets interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). To understand the observed modification to jets opposite a direct photon, it is necessary to make similar base-line measurements within a reference system. Previously this was done using p+p collisions, however cold nuclear matter effects may also play a role, making similar baseline measurements in d(p)$+$A important. Additionally, recent results from d$+$Au and p$+$Pb suggest that there may be medium-like effects present, making clean measurements of the initial parton energy in a hard scattering crucial. We present the most recent results for direct photon-hadron correlations in d$+$Au from PHENIX.",

      "Abstract": "In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions nuclear matter is heated to a temperature exceeding that necessary to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Traditionally, second order viscous hydrodynamics has been used to reproduce the soft collective flow of the QGP and hadronic spectra; however, due to rapid longitudinal expansion in the early stages of evolution, the system may possess substantial pressure anisotropies which are a consequence of large viscous corrections, even for small shear viscosity over entropy ratios.\r\n\r\nThese large corrections violate the viscous hydrodynamics assumption of small deviation from local equilibrium. They may lead to unphysical results, and, comparing to the exact 0+1 solutions of the Boltzmann equation, they often badly reproduce the longitudinal pressure (especially for initial stages) and provide the wrong asymptotic behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to more accurately treat systems possessing large pressure anisotropies, a new approach called anisotropic hydrodynamics was recently developed. In this approach, the pressure anisotropy is treated in a non perturbative manner at the leading order in the hydrodynamic expansion. In previous works simplifying symmetries were considered in order to extract the leading order of of anisotropic hydrodynamics, like longitudinal boost invariance, or cylindrically symmetric radial expansion. The equations have been extended to the 3+1-dimensional expansion, however in the first attempt it were not possible to fully recover the very good agreement with the exact solutions of the Boltzmann equation. We present the very latest prescription, which is lacking any symmetry constraint on the space-time evolution, it is fully consistent with second order hydrodynamics in the close-to-equilibrum limit, and it is providing an unprecedented agreement with the exact solutions in the 0+1 dimensional expansion, comparing to other leading order prescriptions and second order viscous hydrodynamics.",

      "Abstract": "We evaluate open heavy-flavor (HF) transport in relativistic heavy-ion \r\ncollisions utilizing a strong-coupling treatment for both macro- and \r\nmicro-dynamics of the problem [1]. The former is realized through a \r\nhydrodynamic evolution quantitatively constrained by bulk-hadron spectra \r\nand elliptic flow. The HF transport is based on non-perturbative $T$-matrix\r\ncalculations of heavy-light parton scattering in the Quark-Gluon Plasma \r\n(QGP) [2], yielding a diffusion coefficient consistent with lattice QCD, \r\nand on effective interactions of $D$-mesons with light hadrons in hadronic \r\nmatter [3]. The $T$-matrix interactions in the QGP lead to resonance \r\nformation close to $T_c$ which are implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface, providing a seamless treatment of HF interactions throughout the bulk-medium evolution. We deploy this \r\nframework for a comprehensive study of open HF observables from \r\n62-2760 GeV [4,5,6]. A fair description of current experimental data for the \r\nnuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$, $D_s$, $B$ mesons and \r\nHF leptons emerges at low and intermediate transverse momenta $p_T$.

Both elastic processes and number changing inelastic processes are taken into account. The semi-analytical solutions that we obtain complement discussions based on parametric estimates, or purely numerical solutions, and provide new insights on the  interplay of elastic and inelastic collisions during the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. In particular, they confirm the rapid growth at early times of soft modes, mostly due to radiation processes, which leads to the almost immediate emergence of an infrared thermal spectrum. They also illustrate the mechanisms by which the system gets rid of the large excess of gluons that it contains initially.",

      "Abstract": "QCD allows for chirality imbalance as a consequence of the vacuum transition$[1]$.  When coupled with the strong magnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions, the chirality imbalance in local domains can lead to electric charge separation along the magnetic field direction, manifested as the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, an analogous effect, the chiral vortical effect(CVE)$[2]$ was also theorized, in which the vorticity of the collision system replaces the magnetic field, and a baryonic charge separation appears instead of the electric charge separation. This would result in a distinct hierarchy in the particle dependent correlation magnitudes: $proton-K_s^0$ (no CME/CVE), $proton-\\pi^{\\pm}$ (CME only), $proton-\\Lambda$ (dominated by CVE), and $proton-proton$ (both CME and CVE). In order to explore this physics, we report correlation measurements for these identified particle pairs in Au+Au at 200GeV with the STAR detector. The physics backgrounds due to collective flow$[3]$ and resonance decays are evaluated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the measurements to search for the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral magnetic wave will also be presented for Au+Au at 14.5 GeV, which completes the Phase I of the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC.\r\n\r\n$[1]$ D.E.

At RHIC, neutral pions have provided the best measurement of single particle suppression to date.

At PHENIX, the measurement of charged hadrons has been limited to $p_T < 10$ GeV/c by off-vertex background from photon conversions and weak decays mimicking high $p_T$ particles. The silicon vertex tracker upgrade (VTX) will be used to reject this background allowing the measurement of the charged hadron spectrum out to a significantly higher momentum. The VTX is capable of performing  precision tracking measurements of the distance of closest approach of a track to the primary vertex (DCA).  Off-vertex photon conversions and weak decays are vetoed with the VTX by rejecting tracks with large DCA. The status of high-$p_T$ charged tracking and associated high-$p_T$ charged hadron spectrum will be reported.",

      "Abstract": "Theoretical investigations and experimental measurements of jet substructure modifications in heavy ion collisions allow us to disentangle cold nuclear matter effects and jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma, providing a direct probe of the QGP properties. Precision calculations of jet substructure observables will thus become the key to extracting the medium properties. Jet shapes and jet fragmentation functions give the transverse and longitudinal energy profiles inside jets and are sensitive to the jet formation mechanism in the medium. In this talk we will demonstrate the resummation of jet shapes at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. This is the first time phase space logarithms in this observable are resummed using renormalization group techniques. We will then present the calculation of jet shape modification in heavy ion collisions caused by Glauber gluon interactions in the background QGP medium. The study of jet shape modification is closely related to the calculation of jet energy loss. Taken together, these observables provide a comprehensive description of the energy distribution of the in-medium parton shower. We will show first results for the modifications of jets beyond the soft gluon emission limit for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and present predictions for the 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb run.\r\n\r\n[1] Y.-T.

Consistent and analytically verifiable numerical solutions are critical for phenomenological studies of the collective behavior of QGP in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. A novel analytical solution based on the conformal Gubser flow which is a boost-invariant solution with transverse fluid velocity is presented. Due to the non-linear nature of the equation, the analytical solution is non-perturbative and exhibits features that are rather distinct from solutions to usual linear hydrodynamic equations. It is used to verify with high precision the numerical solution with a newly developed state-of-the-art (3+1)-dimensional second-order viscous hydro code (CLVisc). The perfect agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions demonstrates the reliability of the numerical simulations with the second-order viscous corrections. This lays the foundation for future phenomenological studies that allow one to gain access to the second-order transport coefficients.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are valuable probes of the dense nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a comprehensive framework that describes their entire temporal evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadron gas. The dynamics of open heavy quarks in the QGP is described using either an improved Langevin approach [1,2] or a linearized Boltzmann approach [3] that both simultaneously incorporate the quasi-elastic scattering and medium-induced gluon radiation processes. The hadronization of heavy quarks into their mesonic bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid model of fragmentation plus heavy-light quark coalescence [1,2]. And the final rescatterings of heavy hadrons inside the hadron gas are described using the UrQMD model. \r\n\r\nWithin this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; and the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate $p_\\rm{T}$. Our numerical results provide a good description of the $R_\\rm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of both $D$ meson and $B$-decay non-prompt $J/\\psi$ measured at RHIC and LHC. \r\n\r\nIn addition, two-particle correlation functions of heavy flavor are explored [4]. We show that while the nuclear modification of the $p_\\rm{T}$ imbalance of $D-\\bar{D}$ pairs reflects the total energy loss of heavy quarks, their angular correlations are sensitive to the detailed energy loss mechanisms. $D$-hadron correlations are also calculated and shown to be a potential observable quantifying the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

The resulting centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, and flow coefficients from this pQCD + saturation + hydro (\"EKRT\") framework are then compared simultaneously to the LHC and RHIC measurements. We also show that the computed probability distributions of relative event-by-event fluctuations of the flow coefficients, that mostly constrain the initial conditions, match well with the LHC measurements.  With such a systematic multi-energy and multi-observable analysis we can test the initial state calculation and applicability of hydrodynamics, and also constrain the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio of QCD matter in its different phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correlations of two and three event-plane angles provide additional constraints to the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity. As shown in [3], we can describe all these different flow coefficients and correlations remarkably consistently with the shear viscosity that is independent of the collision energy. Using these constraints from the current RHIC and LHC measurements we then predict the charged hadron multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, flow coefficients and event-plane correlations for the forthcoming 5 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

      "Abstract": "One of the major lessons from the field of heavy-ion physics in the past several years has been the significance of the role played by event-by-event fluctuations in the evolution of a heavy-ion collision.  Their important effects on many momentum-space observables (particle yields and spectra, anisotropic flows, etc.) have already been studied systematically, and some of the properties of their event-by-event distributions, and their consequences for the extraction of medium properties such as the specific viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), are already known.\r\n\r\nIn this talk it is pointed out that similar event-by-event fluctuations of spatiotemporal observables provide complementary constraints on our understanding of the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The relation of Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii extracted from ensemble-averaged correlation function measurements to the mean of their event-by-event probability distribution is clarified, and a method to experimentally determine the mean and variance of this distribution is proposed and demonstrated using an ensemble of fluctuating events generated with the viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. The sensitivity of the mean and variance of the HBT radii to the specific QGP shear viscosity $\\eta/s$ is studied using simulations with the same code. We report sensitivity of the mean pion HBT radii and their variances to the temperature dependence of $\\eta/s$ near the quark-hadron transition at a level similar (10-20%) to that which was previously observed for elliptic and quadrangular flow of charged hadrons.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n - Plumberg, C. and Heinz, U.  \"Interferometric signatures of the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity in heavy-ion collisions\", Phys.Rev.

The comparison of the distribution of the jet momentum fraction carried by D mesons in Pb--Pb and pp collisions is a key observable to spot possible modifications of charm-jet properties induced by the presence of the medium.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we report on the prospects for the measurement of D mesons in jets in pp and Pb-Pb collisions using the ALICE detector which have been studied through Monte Carlo simulations. These studies show the unique capability of the ALICE experiment to measure D mesons carrying a small fraction of jet momentum.",

We propose the measurement of forward direct photons in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC as a decisive probe of gluon saturation. Due to the harsh environment of such a measurement, existing detectors are not suitable. In particular an extremely high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeter is required, which we propose as a detector upgrade to the ALICE experiment covering 3.5 < \u03b7 < 5.3, the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal).\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><font color=\"#000000\"><font face=\"Times New Roman, serif\"><font>To facilitate the design of the upgrade and to perform generic R&D necessary for such a novel calorimeter, a compact high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeter prototype has been built. The corresponding R&D studies will be the focus of this presentation. The prototype is a Si/W sampling calorimeter using CMOS sensors of the MIMOSA type with a pixel pitch of 30 \u03bcm and binary readout with a total of ~39 million pixels. We will report on performance studies of the prototype with test beams at DESY and CERN in a broad energy range. The results of the measurements demonstrate a very small Moli\u00e8re radius (~11mm) and good linearity of the response. Unique results on the detailed lateral shower shape, which are crucial for the two-shower separation capabilities, will be presented. We will compare the measurements to GEANT-based MC simulations, which additionally include a modeling of charge diffusion. The studies demonstrate the feasibility of this high-granularity technology for use in the proposed detector upgrade.

      "Abstract": "The CBM experiment aims the study of the QCD phase diagram at low temperatures and high baryonic densities, mainly to find out the order of the phase transition between hadrons and partons under these conditions. Between the many predictions about signals to detect the phase transition point: fluctuations [1], hydrodynamics [2], baryon-baryon correlations [3], etc., in our previous studies [4-5] we found as an interesting tool for the analysis of relativistic nuclear collisions: the \u201cnuclear matter jets\u201d. Having a non- partonic origin, the number of jets indicates the centrality of the collision, i.e. the amount of incident energy pumped into the system, and the jet-kinematic and dynamic properties allowed us to make assumptions about their origin. A liquid-gas nuclear phase transition was indicated by the disappearance of jets. At CBM energies, varying the projectile mass, we intend to study the evolution of the number and characteristics of nuclear matter jets when passing from the small projectile (p+Au) whose energy is converted into thermal energy leading to mutifragmentation, to a symmetric projectile (Au+Au) when flow is unleashed. For this, we made jetology studies on UrQMD and AMPT simulations (performed at the computing system YaPT from \u201cNuclear Matter in Extreme Conditions\u201d Research Center \u2013 Faculty of Physics, Bucharest University)in the 4-25 A GeV incident energies range.

      "Abstract": "A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a general purpose heavy-ion experiment with the main goal of exploring the characteristics of the medium formed in high-energy nuclear collisions, composed of deconfined and strongly-interacting quarks and gluons (Quark-Gluon Plasma, QGP). Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are produced in the initial hard scatterings and interact with the medium constituents throughout its whole evolution. Therefore, they serve as sensitive probes to study the properties of the medium. \r\n\r\nThe study of the angular correlation between D mesons and charged particles can provide relevant information on the processes by which heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and help to spot possible modifications of the charm parton shower and hadronisation induced by the presence of the medium. The measurement of this observable in pp collisions, besides furnishing the necessary reference for future Pb$-$Pb studies, is interesting to study the  fragmentation of charm quarks as well as their production mechanism providing a testing ground for perturbative QCD calculations. Data from p$-$Pb collisions are important to constrain possible modifications of the angular correlation pattern that could be induced by cold nuclear matter effects in the initial and final state of the nuclear collision.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present the results of the measurement of azimuthal correlations between D mesons and charged particles using the data collected with ALICE in p$-$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

      "Abstract": "Recently, a possible appearance of the inhomogeneous chiral phase has been extensionly studied by the use of the effective models of QCD like the NJL models. Here, we study the magnetic properties of the inhomogeneous chiral phase, taking the contribution of \u201cdual chiral density wave (DCDW)\u201d [1], where both scalar and pseudoscalar condensates are spatially modulated. We study the response of quark matter to a tiny external magnetic field to show the spontaneous magnetization in the DCDW phase. In an external magnetic field, the energy spectrum of quarks becomes asymmetric about zero in the lowest Landau level [2], and it gives rise to chiral anomaly [3].\r\n   We find that this spectral asymmetry also gives rise to the spontaneous magnetization, since a new term linearly proportional to the magnetic field is induced in the thermodynamic potential. Furthermore, this spontaneous magnetization includes not only the contribution of chiral anomaly [4] but also one of valence quarks. Such spontaneous magnetization might be a candidate of the origin of the strong magnetic field in neutron stars.\r\n   We also show the peculiar behavior of magnetic susceptibility at the ferromagnetic transition point: it never diverges unlike the usual ferromagnetic transition, which suggested a different mechanism of spontaneous magnetization from spin alignment.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] E.

The existing ALICE data of the $\\pi^{0}$ production in central Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV already showed a clear pattern of strong suppression in a hot QCD medium with respect to $pp$ collisions, at low- to intermediate- $p_{\\rm T}$ range.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will show the new $\\pi^{0}$ measurement at mid-rapidity region in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$=2.76 and 7 TeV. Much higher $p_{\\rm T}$ range, up to 50 GeV/$c$, is reached via merged cluster splitting method at the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters called EMCal. Unlike the traditional invariant mass method of two separate clusters, this merged cluster method focuses on high energy $\\pi^{0}$s, whose decay photon pairs fall into a single large and elongated cluster in EMCal. In order to identify such clusters, several selection criteria are applied including the shower shape of the cluster, the energy balance between the two sub-clusters, and the invariant mass of the two sub-clusters. We will present the current status of this analysis technique in this poster.",

The second order Fourier component of the particle azimuthal distribution is referred as elliptic flow (v2), whose transverse momentum dependence is suggested to be a sensitive probe for different physics processes, like hadron production mechanism and path-length dependence of energy loss in intermediate and high pT range, respectively. Neutral pions are considered to carry more direct information from the early stage of collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present the current status and strategy for the measurement of the elliptic flow of neutral pions in mid and high pT range in Pb + Pb collisions at ALICE with Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal)[1]. Neutral pions are identified by the study of the shape of the overlapping electromagnetic showers developed in the calorimeter by the 2 decaying photons at high pT (>6 GeV) or via invariant mass analysis at low pT. v2 is measured in standard event plane way[2].

      "Abstract": "The ALICE experiment is dedicated to studies of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state, which is created in heavy ion collisions. Both photons and jets are excellent probes of QGP. Photons are produced during the different stages of the expansion of the initial hot matter fireball. They do not interact strongly with the medium and passing through it, they carry information on the properties of the matter at the space-time point of their emission. The direct photons are formed at the early stage of the collision in two processes: annihilation ($q \\bar{q} \\to g \\gamma$) and Compton scattering ($qg \\to q\\gamma$). They enable a test of perturbative QCD constraining parton distributions and fragmentation functions. Moreover, they estimate the energy of correlated back-to-back jet.\r\n\r\nA parton formed in the hard scattering at the early stage of the collision lose the energy when traversing the hot and dense matter and then fragments into a spray of particles called jet. Modification of the jet structure in medium compared to vacuum can provide hints to the properties of QGP.\r\n\r\nBoth direct photons and jets have been measured by the ALICE experiment at LHC. However, back-to-back correlation between photon and reconstructed jet in the ALICE experiment can be observed only with large statistics available in Run 2 due to the relatively small cross-section. Both the algorithm of selection of correlated gamma-jet events and prediction of the expected yield will be shown for both systems $pp$, Pb-Pb and p-Pb for available at LHC energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13 TeV, 5 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively. Additionally, transverse momentum ratio and fragmentation function of jets for binary collisions will be shown. Photons are measured in ALICE directly in the two electro-magnetic calorimeters (PHOS, EMCal). Jets are clusterised from charged tracks reconstructed in the central tracking detectors (TPC and ITS) and neutral constituents reconstructed in EMCal and PHOS.",

The feasibility of the method is demonstrated at the example of the mesonic spectral functions in the quark-meson model at different temperatures and quark chemical potentials, in particular around the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of the model.

Previously neglected terms, exponentially suppressed for large paths, are derived and included in the radiative energy loss formula for the first time; thus our generalization matches onto the usual DGLV formula for large paths but includes additional contributions for small paths. We compute the corrections to R_{AA} at LHC using an energy loss model including the full radiative energy loss formula convolved with collisional energy loss, and we give a first prediction for R_{pA} including final state energy loss.",

In particular, high multiplicity events from such collisions exhibit azimuthal correlations between rapidity separated hadrons, so called ridge. To investigate the ridge phenomena in small colliding systems at RHIC, a new high multiplicity trigger was developed using forward silicon vertex detecor (FVTX) in the PHENIX experiment. FVTX is a new multi-layer silicon endcap in PHENIX at forward/backward rapidities, mainly intended for muon DCA measurements but here being used as a high multiplicity trigger in small colliding systems. The trigger signal is formed based on the coarse online tracking of raw hits processed in the FVTX readout electronics.

The strongly bound $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ and the loosely bound $\\psi(\\mathrm{2S})$ are detected through their decays to muon pairs in two configurations with inverted beam directions, with the following rapidity coverages:$-4.46 < y_{cms} < -2.96$ (Pb-going direction) at backward rapidity and $2.03 < y_{cms} < 3.53$ (p-going direction) at forward rapidity. The $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ production is also studied in the mid-rapidity interval $-1.37 < y_{cms} < 0.43$ in the dielectron decay channel. The $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ and $\\psi(\\mathrm{2S})$ nuclear modification factors, $R_{pA}$, will be presented as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity and collision centrality; the $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ forward-to-backward ratios and the average $p_{T}^2$ values will be also reported.

In this work, we prove that the traditional Poisson distributions in the statistical model are translated into the negative-binomial-like distributions in the event-by-event measurements.  With the modified multiplicity distributions, we suggest how to construct the basic statistical expectations for the high moments of multiplicity distributions in experiment.  Meanwhile, we also calculate the approximate solutions of these high moments and show that this solution can qualitatively or quantitatively describe most of the observables related to multiplicity fluctuations (e.g., the scale variance, the mean value saturation and variance decreasing in most central collisions, the centrality resolution effect, et. al.)",

      "Abstract": "For systems with charged chiral fermions, the imbalance of chirality in the presence of magnetic field generates an electric current - this is the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). We study the dynamical real-time evolution of electromagnetic fields coupled by the anomaly to  the chiral charge density and the CME current by solving the Maxwell-Chern-Simons equations. We show that the CME induces the inverse cascade of magnetic helicity, and that at late times the evolution of magnetic helicity is self-similar and is characterized by universal exponents. We also find that in coordinate space the inverse cascade represents the transition from  linked electric and magnetic fields to the knotted configuration of magnetic field (a visualization of this evolution will be presented). We devise a (possibly unique) experimental signature of this phenomenon in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics has been a fundamental tool to understand the evolution of matter in heavy-ion experiments at RICH and LHC. Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing collective behavior and particle spectra, there are still theoretical shortcomings that may question the validity of the approach in heavy-ion experiments conditions. Large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion produce very large pressure corrections, in contrast to the founding hypothesis of small deviation from local equilibrium and the perturbative treatment viscous corrections. One way to address this problem is anisotropic hydrodynamics. Most of the theoretical investigations about hydrodynamics started from a kinetic underlying substrate of a single species of particles. Unfortunately the striking agreement of anisotropic hydrodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation was not preserved in the case of a mixtures of quarks and gluons.\r\nWe recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics prescription for massless particles in 1+1-dimensions to the case of mixtures of fluids, largely improving the agreement with the exact solutions compared to previous works [1-3]. We allow quarks and gluons to have different momentum scales during the evolution and a non vanishing baryon chemical potential. We take the dynamical equations from the zeroth, the first and the second moment of the Boltzmann equation [4]. We performed a test of the new formulation, comparing the results of anisotropic hydorodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for a mixture of fluid in the Bjorken flow limit, finding a very good agreement [5].\r\n[1] W.Florkowski, R.Maj, R.Ryblewski, M.Strickland, Phys.Rev.C87 (2013) 3, 034914.

      "Abstract": "Hydrodynamics is a low-energy effective theory which describes a long-distance and long-time behavior of many-body systems. It has been recently pointed out that quantum anomalies affect macroscopic transport properties and generate novel anomaly-induced transports. One example is the chiral magnetic effect, which represents the existence of a dissipationless vector current along the magnetic field and is expected to occur in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nFor the description of the anomaly-induced transport in the QGP, we have established formalism, so-called anomalous hydrodynamics, that captures effects of quantum anomalies. Since the QGP consists of electrically charged particles, it is necessary to consider a back reaction to electromagnetic fields in order to describe the space-time evolution of them together with that of the QGP. However, in the conventional anomalous hydrodynamics, electromagnetic fields are treated as external ones and the back reaction is neglected. Moreover, the magnitude of magnetic fields is assumed to be small. Therefore, we need to construct chiral magnetohydrodynamics in the strong magnetic field in order to assess the contribution from anomalous transports.\r\n\r\nIn this study, considering the recent development of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamics under strong magnetic fields from the underlying microscopic theory, that is, the quantum field theory. In order to derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation, we use a solid basis in our previous study on the derivation of the first-order hydrodynamics [1], in which we assume that the local Gibbs distribution is realized at initial time. As a result, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation with the the field theoretical expression of Green-Kubo formulas for the all transport coefficients. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] T.

Another key transport coefficient, but less studied than shear viscosity, is the electric conductivity that represents the response of a system to an applied external electric field.\r\nIn heavy Ion Collisions very high electromagnetic fields are expected to be generated with a decay time depending on the value of the electric conductivity and their impact on pressure isotropization depending on the \\eta/s of the plasma.\r\n\r\nWe discuss the connection between shear viscosity and electric conductivity and explain why the ratio $(\\eta/s)/(\\sigma_{el}/T)$ supplies a measure of the quark to gluon scattering rates whose knowledge would allow to significantly advance in the understanding of the QGP phase.\r\nWe also predict that the ratio should increase near the critical temperature contrary to the flat behaviour predicted by  a conformal theory.\r\nWe show that $(\\eta/s)/(\\sigma_{el}/T)$, independently on the running coupling $\\alpha_s(T)$, \r\nshould increase up to about $\\sim 20$ for $T \\rightarrow T_c$, while it goes down to a nearly flat behavior around $\\simeq 4$ for $T \\geq 4\\, T_c$.\r\nTherefore we in general predict a stronger T dependence of $\\sigma_{el}/T$ with respect to $\\eta/s$ as $T\\to T_c$.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A.

We model the effect of this expansion on the formation time of the charmonium bound states and eventually, the effect of this temperature dependent formation time on the $J/\\psi$ suppression in the QGP medium. The effect of charm quark and anti-charm quark via recombination to form secondary charmonium states is also incorporated in the present work. A set of coupled rate equations is established which incorporates color screening, gluonic dissociation, collisional damping and recombination of uncorrelated $c$ and $\\bar{c}$ pair in the QGP medium. The effect of light quarks is also evaluated. Shadowing as a cold nuclear matter (CNM) effect is also incorporated in the current work. The final $J/\\psi$ suppression, thus determined as a function of centrality, is compared with the ALICE (low $p_T$) experimental data at both, mid rapidity and forward rapidity and CMS (high $p_T$) experimental data at mid rapidity obtained from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at center-of-mass energy, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV. We find that our predicted result on suppression depicts reasonably good agreement with the data.

      "Abstract": "Recent experimental results have revealed a surprisingly rich structure of  multiparticle azimuthal correlations in high energy proton-nucleus collisions. Final state collective effects can be responsible for many of the observed effects, but it has recently been shown that a part of these correlations are present already in the wavefunctions of the colliding particles. A domain structure at length scales of the inverse saturation scale, present in the classical color field of a high energy nucleus, naturally leads to such multiparticle correlations. This talk discusses recent work on azimuthal anisotropy coefficients originating from the initial stage color fields. In particular, we describe a recent calculation [1] of the momentum space 2-particle cumulant azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v_n{2}, n=2,3,4 from fundamental representation Wilson line distributions describing the high energy nucleus. These would correspond to the flow coefficients in very forward proton-nucleus scattering. This calculation finds significant differences between Wilson lines from the MV model and from JIMWLK evolution. The talk also discusses the relation [2] of this calculation to earlier work on the ridge correlation obtained in  the \"glasma graph\" approximation [3], and to the \"field domain model\" [4] where the correlations would originate from a novel nongaussian fluctuation structure in the nuclear color field.\r\n\r\n[1] T.

      "Abstract": "In the intermediate- and low-energy regime, hadrons (instead of quarks and gluons) are the relevant degrees of freedom. Their masses and interactions can be well described by effective approaches to QCD. The extended linear sigma model is an effective model based on chiral and dilatation symmetries (together with their explicit as well as spontaneous breaking). It includes (axial-) vector mesons in addition to (pseudo-) scalar ones, which turns out to be very successful in describing the mass spectrum and decay widths of mesons up to 1.7 GeV [1,2].\r\n\r\nMoreover, including two baryon doublets in the so-called mirror assignment as suggested in [3] allows for introducing a chirally invariant mass term for baryons as well as the interaction with a low-mass four-quark field, related to the resonance $f_0$(500). Thus, the mass of the nucleon arises not solely from the chiral condensate, but also from the four-quark condensate [4,5,6].\r\n\r\nThe model has been used to describe elastic nucleon-nucleon collisions as well as inelastic nucleon-nucleon interactions involving the production of mesons and electromagnetic radiation. A comparison of the theoretical results with experimental data will be shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1. D. Parganlija, F. Giacosa and D. Rischke,  Phys. Rev. D 82, 054024 (2010).\r\n2. D.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are predominantly produced via initial hard parton scatterings in the early stages of hadronic collisions. Thus, they are ideal probes \r\nof the QCD matter since they lose energy by means of elastic scatterings and radiative \r\nprocesses while propagating through the strongly-interacting medium created in \r\nhigh-energy heavy-ion collisions. According to theoretical models, the parton energy \r\nloss is colour charge and parton mass dependent. In particular, it is expected that \r\nbeauty quarks lose less energy than charm and light quarks. These dependencies can be \r\nstudied by comparing the nuclear modification factor of beauty jets with that of charm \r\nor light-parton jets. The measurement of beauty-jet production in p-Pb collisions is \r\nneeded to quantify cold nuclear matter effects, a fundamental step for the \r\ninterpretation of Pb-Pb results.\r\n \r\n  In this poster we present Monte Carlo based performance studies of beauty-jet \r\ntagging via displaced secondary vertex reconstruction, obtained with ALICE for p-Pb \r\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The tagging technique, its \r\nperformance in terms of efficiency and beauty jet selection purity, and the \r\ncorrections required for measuring the cross section of beauty-jet production will \r\nbe described.

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "One of the goals of the ongoing Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC is to look for evidence of the conjectured QCD Critical Point. The feasibility of detecting the critical point however depends on how close the QCD chiral phase transition line is to the freeze-out curve. In the two-flavor chiral limit, this transition is expected to be second-order at zero and  small values of $\\mu$, the quark chemical potential. The critical temperature $T_c$ however, tends to decrease as $\\mu$ is increased; this shift is characterized, for small values of $\\mu$, by the curvature of the transition line $\\kappa$. \r\n\r\nWhile the current lattice QCD results [1-5] on the curvature are significantly smaller than the phenomenological parametrization of the freeze-out line given by Cleymans and Redlich [6], it must be noted that they differ by more than a factor of two among themselves. In this talk, we will present an upper bound for the light and strange curvatures $\\kappa_q$ through extrapolation to the chiral limit. We work in 2+1-flavor QCD and with five different pion masses between 80 MeV $\\leq m_\\pi \\leq$ 160 MeV. Our new results improve on our earlier result [1], both by working at a smaller lattice spacing and through the use of the HISQ action, which has considerably smaller cutoff effects than the actions that were previously used. \r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n[1] O.Kaczmarek, F.Karsch, E.Laermann, C.Miao, S.Mukherjee, P.Petreczky, C.Schmidt and W.Soeldner et al.

The mass spectra of vector mesons are theoretically connected to qbar-q contents of a QCD medium. Even in nucleus matter, modifications of vector mesons are predicted[1].\r\nThe KEK-PS E325 experiment was performed to study mass properties of vector mesons and partial chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear medium. The KEK experiment measure mass spectra of phi mesons using electron-positron decays. The experiment reports significant mass modification in nucleus[2]. New experiment is being prepared at J-PARC to continue this measurement. In this presentation, details of new experiment are presented. \r\nA new beam line is under construction at the Hadron Experimental Facility of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to perform the experiment. A new beam line delivers a primary 30 GeV proton beam and intensities of the beam is 10^10 Hz. \r\nThe first experiment using the beam line is under preparation. The experiment will measure mass spectra of vector mesons in nucleus with 100 times larger statistics than the KEK-PS E325 experiment. The new experiment aims to confirm results of the previous KEK experiment and have a large statistics to discuss more details. The new experiment uses new detector techniques, such as a GEM tracker and a Hadron Blind Detector, to achieve such a large statistics. \r\n\r\n[1] T. Hatsuda and S.H. Lee, Phys. Rev.

With a few parameters, these models are able to reproduce the lattice results of the thermodynamic quantities in the semi-quark gluon plasma(QGP) region. They are also used to compute the behavior of the 't Hooft loop and study the exceptional group G(2) . In this talk, I review the basic ideas of the construction of these models and propose a new form of the non-ideal corrections in the matrix model. In the semi-QGP region, the new model is in good agreement with the lattice simulations as the previous ones, while in higher temperature region, it reproduces the upward trend of the rescaled trace anomaly as found in lattice which, however, can not be obtained from the previous models. In addition, I discuss the perturbative corrections to the thermal effective potential which could be used to systematically improve the matrix models at high temperatures. In particular, I provide, for the first time, an analytical proof of the relation between the one- and two-loop effective potential: two-loop correction is proportional to the one-loop result, independent of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop. This is a very general result, I prove it for all classic groups, including SU(N) , SO(2N+1) , SO(2N)  and Sp(2N) .",

      "Abstract": "In order to bracket the importance of the pre-equilibrium stage on relativistic heavy-ion collision observables at RHIC and LHC energies, we compare simulations in which the pre-equilibrium stage is modeled by free-streaming partons with others where it is modeled fluid dynamically. The first (second) case implements the assumption of extremely weak (strong) coupling in the initial collision stage. We introduce a switching time parameter for the duration of the weakly coupled stage; after this time the system is assumed to stay in the strongly coupled hydrodynamic stage (with a specific shear viscosity that we can vary) until freeze-out. Based on event-by-event simulations of fluctuating initial conditions, we first study observables (radial, elliptic and triangular flow) systematically as a function of the switching time from free-streaming to viscous hydrodynamics (\"thermalization time\"), leaving other parameters fixed. We then perform a three-dimensional simultaneous parameter fit of the switching time, specific shear viscosity and freeze-out temperature by comparing the numerical results with a set of 5 experimental observables, for four different types of initial conditions. We find that the strongest constraint on the thermalization time does not come of anisotropic flow measurements, as previously thought, but from the mean transverse momentum of hadrons with different masses (i.e. radial flow). First results from a campaign that includes bulk viscous effect and a hadronic afterburner to describe the freeze-out stage, with particular focus on the mass-ordering of the elliptic and triangular flow for protons and Lambda hyperons which is incorrectly described by VISHNU without pre-equilibrium flow, will also be shown.\r\n\r\nReferences: Jia Liu, Chun Shen, U.

In a thermodynamical picture of the strongly interacting system formed in heavy-ion collisions, the fluctuations of the mean multiplicity, particle ratios, mean transverse momentum, and net-particle higher moments are related to the fundamental properties of the system and therefore may reveal information about the QCD phase transition. Detailed studies of particle ratio fluctuations and higher moments have been carried out in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV in ALICE. The first results will be shown as a function of collision centrality and pseudorapidity. We will also make comparisons with measurements at lower center-of-mass energies from the SPS and RHIC, and discuss the status and perspectives for future fluctuations measurements at ALICE.",

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy ion collisions, a hot medium with a high density of unscreened color charges is produced. One manifestation of the energy loss of jets propagating through the medium is a lower yield of jets emerging from the medium than \u2028expected in the absence of medium effects. Therefore modifications of the jet yield are directly sensitive to the energy loss mechanism. Furthermore, jets with different \u2028flavor content are expected to be affected by the medium in different ways. Parton showers initiated by quarks tend to have fewer fragments carrying a larger fraction of \u2028the total jet energy than those resulting from gluons. Jets containing heavy quarks may lose less energy as the large quark mass suppresses the amount of medium-induced \u2028radiation. This would lead to different relative contributions of inelastic and elastic energy loss. In this talk, the latest ATLAS results on single jet suppression will \u2028be presented. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor, RAA, for fully reconstructed jets are shown. The rapidity dependence of jet suppression is discussed, which \u2028is sensitive to the relative energy loss between quark and gluon jets. New measurements of single hadron suppression out to pT~150 GeV are also presented, which provide \u2028complementary information to the jet suppression measurements. Finally, a new measurement of the RAA for b-tagged jets is presented. At low b-jet pT, the role of the \u2028heavy quark mass is expected to be maximal and b-jets are dominated by hard scattering processes where the b quark carries most of the momentum. As the jet pT increases, \u2028the flavor dependence of the energy loss is expected to be reduced and a significant contribution to b quark production develops from gluon splitting in the parton shower. \u2028This measurement covers a kinematic range including both regimes and the interplay between the various effects is discussed.",

      "Institute": "Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN)",
      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "The high collision energies available at the LHC allow for an abundant production of hard probes, such as quarkonia, high-$p_{\\rm T}$ jets and vector bosons (W, Z). The latter are produced in initial hard parton scattering processes and they decay before the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is a deconfined phase of QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, their leptonic decay products do not interact strongly with the QGP. The electroweak boson introduces a way for benchmarking in-medium modifications to coloured probes. In Pb--Pb and p--Pb collisions, precise measurements of W and Z-boson production can constrain the Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions (nPDFs), which could be modified with respect to the nucleon due to shadowing or gluon saturation, and they can be used to test the scaling of hard particle production with the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Especially in p--Pb collisions, the measurement of W yields at forward and backward rapidity allows us to probe the modification of nPDFs at small and large Bjorken-$x$, respectively. Such measurements can be benchmarked in pp collisions, where W and Z-boson production is theoretically known with good precision. Also, the charge asymmetry of leptons from W-boson decays is a sensitive probe of up and down quark densities in a nucleon inside a nucleus.\r\n\r\nThe production of W and Z bosons in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV is measured with the ALICE muon spectrometer via the inclusive $p_{\\rm T}$-differential muon yield and the invariant mass of opposite-sign muon pairs, respectively. The rapidity coverage of the muon spectrometer is -4.46 $< y^\\mu_{\\rm cms} <$ -2.96 and 2.03 $< y^\\mu_{\\rm cms} <$ 3.53, which is complementary to the one of ATLAS and CMS. The results are compared with model calculations accounting for the nuclear modification of the PDFs. The W production as a function of the event activity will be discussed as well.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy ion collisions produce direct photons at low transverse momentum, $p_{T}$ from 1-3 GeV/c, in excess of the $p$+$p$ spectra scaled by the nuclear overlap factor, $T_{AA}$.  These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large azimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$, suggesting late-stage production.  Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic models, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct photon excess and $v_{2}$.  This talk investigates increased photon production as the system becomes color neutral from soft-gluon mediated $q$-$\\bar{q}$ interactions in a process analogous to coalescence.  This production mechanism will generate photons that follow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of two for direct photons.  A $\\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published direct photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements and a coalescence-like Monte Carlo is used to test this description.  The $\\chi^{2}$ comparison finds that $n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value $n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.  The coalescence-like Monte Carlo simulation calculates the direct photon $v_{2}$ while describing the shape of the direct photon $p_{T}$ spectra in an internally consistent manner.  The simulation, while systematically low when compared to the data, is in agreement with the 0-20% and 20-40% Au$+$Au PHENIX measurement at $p_{T}$ less than 3 GeV/c.  This model predicts that higher order flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, in direct photons will follow the modified $n_{q}$-scaling laws seen in identified hadron $v_{n}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of approximately two.  Comparisons to preliminary direct photon results, including higher-order anisotropies and the status of simulations at LHC energies, will also be shown.",

Hydrodynamic models predict a decrease of the radii with increasing pair transverse $m_T$ due to radial flow. Correlation measurements of heavy particles extend the range over which the transverse mass dependence of the source radii can be studied and thus can serve, as a tool to learn about the dynamics of he deconfined medium. Particularly, we compare the measured 3D kaon radii with a model where the hydrodynamic phase is succeeded by a hadronic rescattering phase and a purely hydrodynamical calculation. The latter predicts an approximate mT scaling of source radii obtained from pion and kaon correlations. This $m_{\\mathrm{T}}$ scaling appears broken in our data, which indicates strong rescattering in the hadronic phase at LHC energies. The emission duration and the decoupling time of the system are also estimated using the three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis for kaons, and compared with such estimates obtained from pions.",

We present new results on femtoscopic correlations, where the treatment of non-femtoscopic background has been greatly improved. The background is relatively large in smaller systems, therefore a careful treatment is essential.

      "Abstract": "The phenomenon of events containing highly asymmetric dijet pairs is one of the most striking results in heavy ion physics. It has provided the first direct observation of in-medium jet energy loss at the LHC. Detailed measurements of centrality-dependent dijet imbalance in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV PbPb collisions using data collected in the 2011 LHC heavy ion run are presented. The new analysis fully corrects to the particle level. The results show a centrality-dependent modification of the dijet asymmetry distribution accompanied by an unmodified angular correlation between two jets in the dijet system. Detailed studies of the dijet asymmetry as a function of the leading jet transverse momentum and jet radius are presented. The reference measurement of the dijet asymmetry in the pp collisions at the same center of mass energy is also shown. The dijet asymmetry measurements are also done while selecting the leading jet at different angles with respect to the second order event-plane. This effectively probes the path-length dependence of the dijet asymmetry at fixed centrality. The variation of the dijet asymmetry with the soft particle $v_2$, at fixed centrality are also measured.\r\n   To further constrain the energy loss models, the measurement of the correlations between jets that are at small relative angles was performed. The measured neighbouring jet pairs result primarily from hard radiation by the parton that occurs early in the process of the shower formation.\r\n   These dijet and multijet measurements can provide a better understanding of the correlation of the parton energy-loss with the underlying geometry, help elucidating the role of the fluctuations in the energy loss as well as put some constrains to models in which a part of the parton shower radiates coherently in the response of the medium.",

The remaining 1% ion back flow will still give rise to\r\nsignificant space charge distortions that have to be corrected.\r\nIn this poster I will show how these corrections are foreseen to be done\r\nand report the expected performance obtained from simulations studies.\r\nIn order to understand the time dependence of the space charge\r\ndistortions, a dynamic simulation has been developed. Results from this\r\nsimulations will also be presented here.",

      "Country": "Korea",
      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the medium experiences hard and soft scatterings as it expands and a temperature cools down. Therefore the temperature of the medium plays a key role for getting the dynamical information of the medium, such as the energy/momentum distributions of emitting hadrons.\r\nExisting meson types at each stage can provide the temperature information of the medium since each meson has its own melting temperature. These temperatures can be estimated from their masses at those temperatures but the only experimental information is given at zero temperature. At non-zero temperatures, there are several models to estimate the meson masses, where the temperature-dependence of quark-quark interactions is necessary. Most calculations use the free energies from Lattice results or their modifications, for this input.\r\nRecently, AdS/CFT offered the temperature-dependent potentials between quarks by introducing infrared cutoff on the AdS Schwarzschild space, which inhibit the two characteristic features, confinement at long rages and asymptotic freedom at small ranges. We adopted these temperature-dependences on our model potential, which is composed of a screened Coulomb-type strong potential plus a Coulomb potential as a vector potential and the linear plus constant potential as a scalar potential. Here the temperature dependence of the screening radius and tangent of the linear potential is determined based on AdS/CFT. For two quark system, we used the Dirac\u2019s constraint dynamics to get the Schrodinger-type equations with all dynamical and spin-dependent terms expressed by our model potential.\r\nIn this presentation, we calculated the meson mass spectrum, especially for quarkonia and B_{c} meson. Heavy meson masses are almost constant for T=0~0.4T_{c} but decrease after 0.4T_{c} as temperatures increase up to 1.4T_{c}, especially linearly after T=T_{c}. Our results are consistent with others based on the Lattice calculation.",

      "Country": "DK",
      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow is one of the key observables used to probe the properties and evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions. It was recently realized that event-by-event initial fluctuations lead to correlations between different harmonics (correlations of $v_{n}$ and $v_{m}$ when $n\u2260m$), present also in transport model calculations. The strengths of some of these correlations are much more sensitive to QGP transport properties (e.g. $\\eta$/s) compared to standalone $v_{n}$ measurements [1]. In this talk, we report the first ALICE measurements of the correlation strength between various anisotropic flow harmonics. The correlation strength is characterized with multi-particle cumulants of mixed harmonics, which by construction depend only on the fluctuations of magnitudes of the anisotropic flow vectors. A detailed comparison to Monte Carlo models, including AMPT and HIJING, is also presented. These studies further constrain initial conditions, the properties and the evolution of the system in theoretical calculations of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] H. Niemi, G. S. Denicol, H.

      "Abstract": "Event shape engineering (ESE) is a differential technique, which involves selecting events based on their anisotropic flow, and studying other observables with respect to the magnitude of that flow [1]. These studies have been pursued by the ALICE, ATLAS, and PHENIX collaborations, and promise to open up a new paradigm in the era of high statistics heavy-ion data. We will show the latest results from the ALICE collaboration for Pb-Pb 2.76 TeV collisions. In particular, we will show new studies on event by event correlations of radial and anisotropic flow, and discuss how these studies can place extra constraints on the initial conditions. We will demonstrate how the pion, kaon, proton spectra evolve with the event-wise anisotropic flow, and use a blast wave model to determine changes in the radial flow velocity. We will also review the sensitivity of the ESE technique, by comparing results using different ALICE sub-detectors. Finally, we will discuss the feasibility of more statistically demanding ESE studies for the upcoming LHC run 2 and 3 data.\r\n\r\n[1] Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions: Event shape engineering, J.

      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow plays a critical role in establishing the equation of state for the Quark Gluon Plasma. The results at the LHC have demonstrated that the matter created in heavy-ion collisions behaves as a nearly perfect fluid reflected in the low value of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\\eta$/s). The higher flow harmonics are particularly sensitive to the value of $\\eta$/s in hydrodynamic calculations. In this talk, we present the first ALICE results on $p_{\\rm T}$ differential $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, $v_{4}$ and $v_{5}$ for \u03c0$^{\\pm}$, K$^\\pm$, $\\mathrm{p}$($\\overline{\\mathrm{p}}$) from the high statistics 2011 heavy-ion run. We investigate how all $v_{n}$ coefficients evolve with particle mass and centrality for 0-1%, 20-30% and 40-50% centrality percentiles. These new measurements aim at differentiating between models that use different initial conditions, constraining further the value of $\\eta$/s and allowing to decouple the influence of the late hadronic stage from the hydrodynamic evolution of the system.",

      "Abstract": "A double-ridge structure has been observed in two-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions at midrapidity and its origin is actively debated. Measurements at larger relative pseudorapidity can further improve our understanding of this phenomenon. The results on two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward pseudorapidity range (2.5 < |\u03b7| < 4.0) and associated particles at mid-rapidity (|\u03b7| < 1.0) in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV are reported in the talk. The trigger particles are detected by the ALICE muon spectrometer, and the associated particles by the ALICE central barrel tracking detectors. The reconstructed trigger particles mainly originate from weak decays of primary pions and kaons at low transverse momentum ($p_T$), and heavy-flavor particles at high $p_T$. The ridge is found to persist to the pseudorapidity ranges studied here, and the second-order Fourier coefficients for these measured trigger particles are extracted after subtracting the correlations obtained in low-multiplicity events from those in high-multiplicity events. The Fourier coefficients have a similar pT dependence in the p-going and Pb-going directions, and the ratio of Fourier coefficients in the two directions is calculated as a function of $p_T$. The results are compared with calculations from a parton-cascade model.",

Results on the multiplicity and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence measured with ALICE in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at 7 TeV, 5.02 TeV, 2.76 TeV are presented. The balance function in both \u2206\u03b7 and \u2206\u03c6 becomes narrower with increasing multiplicity in all three systems for particles with 0.2 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c. The experimental findings favor models that either incorporate some collective behavior (e.g. AMPT) or mimic this using different mechanisms (e.g. PYTHIA8 with color reconnection). For higher values of transverse momenta the balance function becomes even narrower but exhibits no quantitative difference between the three systems. The results add constraints to models that describe collective effects down to small systems (for low values of $p_T$), and particle production mechanisms such as coalescence and fragmentation processes (for inter- mediate and high values of $p_T$).",
