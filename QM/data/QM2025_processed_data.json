      "Speaker": "KaiJia Sun",
      "Institute": "Institute of Modern Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Understanding the properties of hypernuclei is crucial for constraining the nature of hyperon-nucleon ($Y\\text{-}N$) interactions, which plays a key role in determining the inner structure of compact stars. The lightest (anti-)hypernuclei are the hypertriton ($^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$), which consists  of a pair of nucleons and  a $\\Lambda$ hyperon, and its anti-nucleus (${^3_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}}\\overline{\\rm H}$).  Significant knowledge has recently been acquired regarding the mass, lifetime, and binding energy of $^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$. However, its exact spin, whether $\\frac{1}{2}$ or  $\\frac{3}{2}$, remains undetermined in both experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we present a novel method of using the hypertriton global polarization in heavy-ion collisions to decipher not only  its total spin but also its internal spin  structure.  This method is based on the finding that  its three different  spin structures  exhibit distinct beam energy dependence of its global polarization when it is produced in these collisions from the coalescence of proton, neutron and $\\Lambda$. Future observations of the (anti-)hypertriton global polarization thus provide the opportunity to unveil the spin structure of (anti-)hypertriton and its production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.",

Goethe University, \r\nD-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe investigate the formation of light nuclei and hypernuclei in the \r\nrapidly expanding nuclear matter after relativistic nucleus-nucleus \r\ncollisions. The primary hadronization phase including the strangeness \r\nproduction is described with UrQMD model. It is demonstrated that the \r\nnucleation process can be explained within the statistical approach by \r\napplying the local equilibrium concept. We subdivide the expanding \r\nnuclear system into several parts (clusters) consisting of nucleons and \r\nhyperons which are close in the phase space. The production of nuclei \r\ntakes place inside these clusters, and it can be described as their \r\nstatistical decay in the coexistence region of the nuclear phase \r\ntransition. The local chemical equilibrium concept explain consistently \r\nmany experimental data which was not possible with the statistical \r\nmodels under assumption of global chemical equilibrium [1,2]. This model \r\nwas also successfully applied to describe experimental data on both \r\nnormal nuclei and strange hypernuclei production in the GSI and RHIC-BES \r\nenergy range [3,4]. We predict the production of double hypernuclei up \r\nto $^4_{\\Lambda \\Lambda}$H and further intermediate mass nuclei up to \r\n$^8$Be for Au+Au central collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3 GeV, recently \r\nexplored by the STAR experiments [4]. The production of charmed nuclei \r\nis discussed too. These new nuclei can be identified by the measurement \r\nof the correlated particles. \r\n\r\n[1] A. S. Botvina, N. Buyukcizmeci and M.

      "Speaker": "Volodymyr Vovchenko",
      "Institute": "University of Houston",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We contrast the behavior of ordinary and factorial cumulants of proton number and point out that the latter has numerous advantages over the former, in particular with regards to the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions. The new RHIC BES-II data on factorial cumulants of protons is analyzed, indicating clear deviation of two- and three-particle proton correlations from the non-critical baseline at collision energies below 10 GeV. Multiple scenarios for this deviation are explored, including the possibility of critical fluctuations and the implications for the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\nWe also illustrate that the acceptance dependence of the appropriately scaled factorial cumulants, $\\hat{C}_n/(\\hat{C}_1)^n$, is flat if all correlations are driven by long-range correlations only, making it a clean probe of short-range correlations. Furthermore, global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations predict identical $\\hat C_2/(\\hat C_1)^2$ of proton and antiprotons at given collision energy. However, the analysis of RHIC BES-I data reveals a remarkably strong splitting between scaled factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons, which is at odds with the expectation based on a single-fluid hydrodynamics picture. We argue that such a splitting indicates incomplete equilibration between stopped and produced matter, which can be further probed with upcoming high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II with extended acceptance coverage.",

      "Speaker": "Jamie Karthein",
      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition [1]. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.\r\n\r\n1. J.M. Karthein, V. Koch, C. Ratti, arXiv:2409.13961, PRD (under review)",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Introduction of a nonzero isospin chemical potential in QCD leads to the emergence of a pion condensed phase at sufficiently large $\\mu_I$, bounded by a second order transition line. At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\\mu_I = m_\\pi/2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition the pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\\mu_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.",

      "Speaker": "Chik Him Wong",
      "Institute": "No affiliation",
      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $\\mu_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. The phase diagram is drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. \r\nOur results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that up to $\\mu_B \\approx 400$~MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\\mu_B$.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We study the influence of the QCD critical point on the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the lines of constant specific entropy (entropy per baryon) on the phase diagram are drawn towards a special point on the coexistence (first-order) line where the specific entropy reaches a maximum [1]. We study the interplay between this feature of the isentropic trajectories and the freezeout curve. If the critical point is located near the freezeout curve, a region inaccessible by isentropic expansion appears on the freezeout curve. This behavior of the isentropes could provide a novel, non-fluctuational signature of the critical point requiring significantly lower statistics than the fluctuational signatures. \r\n\r\n[1] Maneesha Sushama Pradeep, Noriyuki Sogabe, Mikhail Stephanov, and Ho-Ung Yee, Phys.

      "Abstract": "Jet substructure measurements in heavy-ion collisions offer vital insights into the dynamics of jet quenching within the hot and dense QCD medium generated in these events. In this talk, we present new results from the ATLAS Collaboration on jet suppression and substructure using the Soft-Drop grooming technique in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02~\\mathrm{TeV}$. The study explores jet splitting across a broad range of angles for large-radius jets $R=1.0$, using charged particles to achieve high precision, providing access to small angular separations. This work unifies two previously published ATLAS analyses on small- and large-$R$ jets, providing a more comprehensive view of jet substructure. The degree of jet suppression is characterized by the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$, presented as a function of jet transverse momentum $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, the opening angle of the hardest internal splitting $r_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and the transverse momentum scale $\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{12}}}$. By comparing these results with theoretical models, we deepen our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms, explore the properties of the QCD medium, and challenge current theoretical frameworks in heavy-ion collisions.",

Jet reconstruction performance is evaluated in terms of jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, jet position resolution, and jet reconstruction efficiency. The difference between the inclusive jet performance and forward jet performance is quantified. An important part of the ability to reconstruct jets is the trigger. We show the evaluation of the high-level trigger performance in the forward region in terms of trigger efficiency and the momentum difference between jets reconstructed using HLT and offline jets. Lastly, we describe the strategy to reconstruct total energy in the forward rapidity region and related performance. Contributions from various sources of background will also be discussed and the strategy to deal with them will be put forward.",

      "Abstract": "LHC Run 4 will provide additional challenges in the already demanding field of charged particle track reconstruction. The Inner Detector of the ATLAS experiment will be replaced by an all-silicon inner tracker (ITk) that will consist of Pixels and Strips providing greater coverage in pseudorapidity spanning up to 8 units. The ACTS Common Tracking Software (ACTS) is the toolkit of choice that will be used to perform track reconstruction, and it is expected to meet the new challenges. The physics of heavy ions (HI) requires a different tracking setup as compared to $pp$ collisions. This is dictated by the difference in experimental conditions, where instead of a huge pile-up of 200 parasitic interactions per crossing in $pp$ collisions, the HI physics expects only one collision per bunch crossing. Despite this, a central lead ion collision produces a comparable number of tracks as to $pp$ collisions. The single vertex of the collision allows for optimizations and in other aspects makes the task more challenging. The poster discusses the progress in setting up the ACTS based track  reconstruction for HI in the ITk, shows a comparison between $pp$ and HI tracking performances, and presents the predicted performance of ACTS compared to the existing tracking algorithms used by ATLAS.",

Measurements of particles produced in photonuclear reactions can shed light on the QCD dynamics of these novel, extremely asymmetric colliding systems, with energies between those available at RHIC and the LHC. Previous studies by ATLAS have characterized photonuclear collisions through inclusive charged hadron measurements, and have observed elliptic and triangular flow coefficients in these events. This talk presents a measurement of charged hadron production and, for the first time, measurements of identified hadron yields in high-multiplicity photonuclear collisions using 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb data collected in 2018 by ATLAS, with a dedicated photo-nuclear event trigger.\r\n\r\nThe yields of charged hadrons and, for the first time, identified strange hadrons ($K^0_S$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Xi$) are shown differentially in rapidity, transverse momentum, and event multiplicity. These new results shed light on potential QGP formation in ultraperipheral collisions via observables sensitive to radial flow, enhanced baryon-to-meson ratios, and strangeness enhancement.  These results are compared to 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb data collected by ATLAS in 2016, at the same event multiplicities. The results are also compared with calculations from DPMJET and hydrodynamic-based models predicting flow even in these ultraperipheral collisions.",

We emphasize the structural similarities with Model G, conjectured to be the dynamic universality class of the chiral phase transition in the limit of two massless quark flavors. Importantly, our formulation of the real-time FRG preserves all relevant symmetries throughout the FRG flow which, e.g., guarantees the non-renormalization of the reversible mode couplings, as but one exact result. We derive non-perturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, Model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H. For Model G, we also extract a novel dynamic scaling function that describes the universal momentum and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of iso-vector and iso-axial charge densities in the symmetric phase.",

We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, L. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\\ln(1/R)$, and $\\ln(R/\\theta_c)$, and powers of $L$. We briefly explore the limit of strong quenching, where analytic treatments are feasible, offering insights into the impact of parton cascades on jet quenching. These results provide guidance for future numerical simulations and analytical investigations.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal fluctuations are a fundamental feature of dissipative systems that are essential for understanding physics near the expected critical point of QCD and in small systems. Such fluctuations can be modeled by including a stochastic source in the standard hydrodynamics equations. However, when this is done naively strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions [1–3]. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem [4], we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional [5]. For divergence type theories [6], the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. This generating current is related to the free energy, which allows for a systematic understanding the stability properties of the system. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques [7].\r\n\r\n[1] N. Mullins, M.

The color glass condensate (CGC) framework has been successfully applied to describe diffractive vector meson production in $e+p$ collisions at HERA.

In this work we perform a combined Bayesian analysis of $J/\\psi$ production data from both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ collisions within the CGC framework based on an impact parameter dependent McLerran-Venugopalan model combined with JIMWLK evolution to describe the center of mass energy dependence. The combined fit confirms the challenges of the framework to describe both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ data simultaneously hinting at shortcomings of the framework. We discuss major sources of uncertainty and suggest possible solutions including model extensions.

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, $J/\\psi$ photoproduction serves as a sensitive probe for studying the gluonic structure in heavy nuclei. Differential measurements of photon-induced $J/\\psi$ production provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations.   The linear polarization of photons involved in these processes enables imaging of the nucleus via spin interference effect in vector meson photoproduction, which  can be quantified by measuring the azimuthal angular modulation between the $J/\\psi$ momentum and its decay daughters' momenta.  Moreover,  the decay daughters of these vector mesons inherit polarization of the photons, which could be used to access the initial collision geometry.  Thus, measurement of differential cross sections of J/$\\psi$ photoproduction and the azimuthal anisotropy of their decay daughters offer a novel and direct probe into both the gluonic structure and the initial collision geometry.\r\n \r\n In this contribution, we will present the diﬀerential cross sections of photon-induced coherent $J/\\psi$  in  Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The study of $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) offers a powerful probe of gluon dynamics in heavy nuclei. In UPCs, photons can interact with the nucleus coherently (involving the entire nucleus) or incoherently (with individual constituents). While coherent processes provide insight into the average gluon density, incoherent photoproduction is uniquely sensitive to the local gluon density fluctuations at both nucleonic or subnucleonic levels. In this talk, we present the first energy-dependent measurement of the incoherent $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ photoproduction cross section in PbPb UPCs at the LHC with the CMS experiment. Employing forward neutron tagging technique, we explore a wide photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy range from 40 to 400 GeV, probing fluctuating gluon fields over a broad Bjorken-$x$ range of $x <10^{-4}$. Furthermore, we report the cross section ratio of incoherent to coherent $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ production and evaluate the nuclear suppression factor for the incoherent production as a function of $x$. By comparing state-of-the-art theoretical predictions, these results offer unique insights into gluon fluctuations and have important implications for understanding nuclear gluon distributions and saturation phenomena.",

We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$ in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies emitted in forward/backward directions. We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment [1] using zero degree calorimeters, for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which $E_{exc} \\neq E_{\\gamma}$ and compare its results with the results of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. We discuss the role of preequilibrium and equilibrium processes. In addition we analyze the role of scattering of high-energy photons for small neutron multiplicities. Emission of the small number of neutrons at high (virtual) photon energies ($E_{\\gamma} >$ 1 GeV) seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section for four- and five-neutron emission is rather difficult. Several open issues will be discussed. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.

Photon-induced processes are the dominant interaction mechanism when the colliding nuclei have an impact parameter larger than the nuclear diameter. In these ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), the photon provides a clean, energetic probe of the partonic structure of the nucleus, analogous to deep inelastic scattering. This talk presents a measurement of jet production in UPCs performed with the ATLAS detector using high-statistics 2018 Pb+Pb data. Events are selected using requirements on jet production, rapidity gaps, and forward neutron emission to identify inclusive photo-nuclear hard-scattering processes. These measurements also include detailed studies of rapidity gap distributions and nuclear break-up effects, allowing for precise comparisons between data and theory for inclusive photo-nuclear processes. The measured cross-sections are compared to theoretical models in phase-space regions where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected but not well constrained by world data, demonstrating the potential of these data to provide a strong new constraint on nPDF effects.",

In Run 3, the ATLAS experiment utilized a low-multiplicity track trigger in heavy ions for the first time, allowing the collection of a large sample of events with a few tracks.

This process has been used in e-p collisions to set stringent limits on the proton gluon distribution at low-$x$.

      "Abstract": "The event-by-event shapes of colliding nuclei are imprinted on flow patterns measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions because of the strong hydrodynamic response to collision geometry. In this work, we perform high-statistics simulations to study the impacts of nuclear structure on the ratios of anisotropic flow observables between different collision systems. We study $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and find the ratios of anisotropic flow in the same centrality class between the two collision systems to be strongly affected by the nuclear structure inputs in the initial state, providing a novel opportunity to probe the deformed nuclear geometry at very high energies [1]. The ratios of $v_2\\{4\\}/v_2\\{2\\}$ in these collisions are sensitive to the nuclear skin thickness of the colliding nuclei, providing indirect constraints on the nuclei’s neutron skin. We will also highlight the unique opportunities at the upcoming fixed-target SMOG2 experiments at the LHCb. With input from ab initio calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. Elliptic flow in Pb+Ne collisions is significantly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling pin geometry [2].

      "Abstract": "The semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and Drell-Yan (DY) processes are primary channels for studying the parton distributions of the proton and the nucleus, and for deducing the properties of cold nuclear matter. However, for nuclear targets, the DY and SIDIS differential cross-sections are modified by multiple interactions between the active parton and spectator nucleons, which we refer to as dynamical nuclear effects. Only recently have theoretical developments allowed us to understand these processes in the nuclear environment from first principles. We present the complete calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) dynamical nuclear corrections to the longitudinal and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) cross-sections in both reactions using the Soft Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons. The main result that this talk focuses on is the first TMD analysis of the nuclear SIDIS and DY data that incorporates these dynamical effects.  We show for the first time medium-induced renormalization group (RG) equations improved to second order in opacity to estimate the truncation uncertainty and a rapidity RG (a Blaitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution) applied in the initial state for DY and the final state for SIDIS. We discuss the implications of the new theoretical analysis for the interpretation of existing data, and for the physics program of the future EIC.",

In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity correlations in nuclear collisions due to the inclusion of event-by-event subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state, by using the 3D resolved McDIPPER for the initial state of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], and for the first time, we connect it to 3D phenomenology by evolving through a full hybrid evolution, including a pre-equilibrium stage, using the novel KøMPøST with charges [3], 3+1D viscous hydrodynamical evolution [4], and hadronic rescattering [5]. We present new results, focusing on the effect of sub-nuclear hotspots and (sub) nuclear thickness fluctuations on the longitudinal structure of observables, such as the flow decorrelations and directed flow.

      "Abstract": "The six-hour Xe-129 run at the LHC has produced a remarkable wealth of physics, among which several studies of its nuclear shape. Previous works indicate that the elliptic flow ratio with Pb-208 collisions determines the quadrupole deformation ($\\beta_2$) of Xe, while the $\\rho_2$ elliptic flow-mean $p_T$ correlator informs us about the so-called triaxiality ($\\gamma$). In this work, we go one step further and perform a global Bayesian analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb data at the LHC varying simultaneously the shapes of Xe, Pb and relevant Trajectum model parameters. This allows us to systematically assess the sensitivity of observables or ratio of observables to the shape of both Pb (in particular its neutron skin) and Xe (in particular $\\beta_2$, its octupole $\\beta_3$, $\\gamma$ and its skin). Our Bayesian extractions lead to a picture for the ground states of these nuclei that is in remarkable agreement with complementary results using methods in low-energy nuclear structure physics. We comment on implications of the analysis of the shapes of other nuclei via future LHC experiments, with particular focus on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.",

      "Abstract": "The shape and orientation of colliding nuclei play a crucial role in determining the initial conditions of the QGP formed in central collisions, which influence key observables such as anisotropic and radial flow. For instance, central collisions of near-spherical Au nuclei create a QGP with a fixed, circular geometry, whereas prolate-shaped uranium nuclei can collide in a variety of orientations, producing QGP droplets of diverse shapes and sizes. Hence, by comparing systems with similar mass numbers, such as $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au, we can map out their shape differences and gain deeper insights into the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_2$, $p_T$ fluctuations, and\r\n$v_2 - p_T$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions. Our results reveal large differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in central events. A comparison with hydrodynamic model calculations indicates a large deformation in uranium nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry in the ground states of the colliding $^{238}$U nuclei [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales.

The study of Xe-Xe collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.44$ TeV opens up a window to study nuclear deformation at LHC. When compared to Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$ TeV, one can explore the dependence of the Fourier flow harmonics ($v_{n}$) on the size and initial-state geometry of the colliding systems. For the first time, correlations between higher-order moments ($\\langle v_{n}^{k}v_{m}^{l}\\rangle$, where $n,m = 2,3,4$ and $k,l = 2,4,6$) between two ($v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ or $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$) or even three flow harmonics ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$) are measured and compared between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions as a function of collision centrality. These new measurements have been calculated with multiparticle mixed harmonic cumulants (upto 8th order) using charged particles in the wide pseudorapidity region of the CMS detector ($|\\mathrm{\\eta}| < 2.4$) and in the transverse momentum range of $0.5 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 3.0$ GeV/c. The results have also been compared to several theoretical model predictions. The observables measured in this analysis have been used to closely probe the non-linearities between $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ and their corresponding eccentricities $\\epsilon_{2}$, $\\epsilon_{3}$ and $\\epsilon_{4}$. This not only helps us to constrain the deformation parameters of Xe nuclei, but can also significantly constrain initial-state model parameters and give us a better understanding of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at LHC.",

By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. This enables us to predict how the initial state evolves when moving from RHIC to LHC energies. [1]\r\n\r\nPreviously, the energy dependence in IP-Glasma was introduced through a Bjorken-$x$ dependent saturation scale extracted from fits to DIS structure data. In contrast, in our work we move beyond this parametrized approximation by providing a method to directly calculate the energy dependence. The energy-dependent initial state description is then coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics in the quark-gluon plasma phase and to the UrQMD hadronic afterburner, enabling us to simulate the full space-time evolution in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate that incorporating the JIMWLK evolution significantly affects various flow observables.\r\n\r\nThe JIMWLK evolution applied in this work is constrained by the available $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ production data from HERA and from Ultra Peripheral Collisions at the LHC [2]. In addition to the JIMWLK-evolved initial state description, we determine an effective energy-dependent parametrization describing the energy-dependent nucleon structure, which can approximate the effect of JIMWLK evolution in IP-Glasma, enabling faster simulations.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] H.

Based on the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, where the gluonic interactions between the large Bjorken-x, static sources localized in the colliding nuclei are described by classical Yang-Mills equations, I will present remarkably simple, analytic solutions for the Glasma field strength tensor by linearizing the Yang-Mills equations for weak sources. I will discuss our results for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC and Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies using a generalized three-dimensional McLerran-Venugopalan nuclear model with parametrized longitudinal correlations inside the nucleus. I will also discuss pA collisions using an advanced nuclear model with individual quark hot spots focusing on rapidity-dependent factorization breakdown and event plane fluctuations.\r\n\r\n[1] Ipp, A., Leuthner, M., Müller, D.

      "Abstract": "It has recently been widely acknowledged that the initial stages are important for correctly describing jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, the initial stages influence the emission spectrum of hard partons traversing the plasma. Such calculations require the knowledge of the momentum-broadening kernel $C$, which describes the probability of a jet parton receiving a momentum kick. While it is often employed in a harmonic approximation using the jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, in this talk, I will present our results for the kernel $C$ from QCD kinetic theory beyond this approximation. We show that the kernel is consistent with previous extractions of $\\hat q$ and find that it is highly anisotropic at early times and that small-momentum exchange processes are more likely than expected from a Landau-matched thermal system. Our results may lead to a better description of jet quenching during the initial stages, which can be particularly significant for the ongoing and upcoming light-ion collision programs.",

      "Abstract": "The second-order shape phase transition of the Xe isotope chain, predicted to lie around $^{128}\\text{Xe}$ to $^{130}$Xe, is challenging to measure in low-energy nuclear experiments. Recently, heavy-ion collisions have demonstrated their potential as an imaging tool for nuclear structure by examining anisotropic flow and its correlations with the mean transverse momentum. Hints of a triaxial structure in $^{129}$Xe have been found experimentally and theoretically using these methods; however, these studies were limited to exploring the first moment of the $\\gamma$ distribution and could not distinguish between a rigid rotor and $\\gamma$-soft nuclei. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, a comprehensive study of the quadrupole deformation, nuclear diffuseness, and triaxial structure of $^{129}$Xe is presented through investigations of various anisotropic flow and mean transverse momentum observables. Additionally, the $\\gamma$-soft structure of the $^{129}$Xe nuclei is investigated experimentally for the first time in heavy-ion collisions using a novel six-particle normalized cumulant, $ NC(v_2^4, \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2) $, which correlates the fourth moment of the elliptic flow, $ v_2^4$, with the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, $ \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2 $. This correlation is measured in Xe–Xe collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV  against the baseline of spherical Pb nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Comparisons with calculations from state-of-the-art models, both with and without fluctuating shape parameters, provide a high-precision probe of the nuclear structure of $^{129}$Xe and facilitate the discovery of the nuclear shape phase transition.",

      "Abstract": "Short-range correlations among hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion experiments are typically regarded as non-hydrodynamic and subtracted from the data. However, the fluid nature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) gives rise to short-range correlations stemming from hydrodynamic fluctuations. These correlations, driven by fluctuation-dissipation relations near local equilibrium, provide key insights into the transport properties of the QGP and can become particularly significant in the vicinity of the QCD critical region.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a theoretical framework for calculating two-particle correlations of charged hadrons. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we first derive an evolution equation for four-point functions of fields in complex scalar field theory. This equation can be interpreted using the Boltzmann-Langevin Equation (BLE), which  predicts the two-particle correlations in momentum space amongst the charges of a conducting fluid.  Our results demonstrate how measuring these short-range charge correlations in heavy ion collisions can constrain the transport properties of the QGP in detail.",

      "Abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of the initial state in heavy-ion collisions have become important topic of interest in the community, since it provides insights into the origins of anisotropic flow, the breaking of boost invariance, longitudinal de-correlation, and particle correlations observed after kinetic freeze-out. One of the important properties of the 3D initial state is the tilt of the particle-emitting source away from the beam direction—a phenomenon particularly pronounced at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This tilt, rooted in the initial collision geometry’s three-dimensional structure, is relevant for understanding phenomena such as directed flow and particle polarization. However, a direct extraction of tilt from such measurements remains challenging.\r\n\r\nBy employing azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT), we explore the relationship between the tilt parameter measured experimentally and the predicted tilt of freeze-out coordinates from UrQMD model  [1]. This approach allows us to investigate the tilt of the pion-emitting source in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.5, and 27 GeV using asHBT techniques. \r\n\r\nWhile tilt might naively be expected to correlate strongly only with collision centrality, our findings indicate a more pronounced dependence on the momentum of particle pairs. This momentum dependence invites a reevaluation of directed flow: rather than attributing it to a uniform tilt of the emission source, we propose that distinct regions of homogeneity with varying orientations may underlie these observations.\r\n\r\nOur approach offers a framework that the STAR experiment can employ to perform a precision extraction of tilt using the high-statistics BES-II data—measurements of which are currently underway and whose prospects we discuss here. By accurately determining tilt angles across different particle types and momenta, we aim to provide a more precise description of directed flow across species and momenta. This method offers a potentially clearer and more detailed framework for understanding directed flow and other phenomena influenced by the three-dimensional initial state.\r\n\r\n[1] Yevheniia Khyzhniak and Michael Annan Lisa. “Pair momentum depen-\r\ndence of tilted source in heavy ion collisions”.

This approach allows us to investigate the tilt of the pion-emitting source in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.5, and 27 GeV using asHBT techniques. \r\n\r\nWhile tilt might naively be expected to correlate strongly only with collision centrality, our findings indicate a more pronounced dependence on the momentum of particle pairs. This momentum dependence invites a reevaluation of directed flow: rather than attributing it to a uniform tilt of the emission source, we propose that distinct regions of homogeneity with varying orientations may underlie these observations.\r\n\r\nOur approach offers a framework that the STAR experiment can employ to perform a precision extraction of tilt using the high-statistics BES-II data—measurements of which are currently underway and whose prospects we discuss here. By accurately determining tilt angles across different particle types and momenta, we aim to provide a more precise description of directed flow across species and momenta. This method offers a potentially clearer and more detailed framework for understanding directed flow and other phenomena influenced by the three-dimensional initial state.\r\n\r\n[1] Yevheniia Khyzhniak and Michael Annan Lisa. “Pair momentum depen-\r\ndence of tilted source in heavy ion collisions”.

The measurements of correlations between light nuclei ($d$, $t$, $^{3}He$) and $\\Lambda$ can shed light on internal structure and binding energy of hypernuclei as well as the many-body interactions among hyperon and nucleons which are important for understanding the inner structure and equation of state of neutron stars.\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurement of $\\it d$-$\\Lambda$, $\\it t$-$\\Lambda$ and $^{3}He$-$\\Lambda$ correlations with high statistics data of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions from the STAR Beam Energy Scan II. The correlation functions are analyzed within the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism in order to characterize the emission source size, the scattering length, and the effective range of light nuclei-$\\Lambda$ interactions. The extracted parameters will be compared to those from other baryon correlations and various effective theory model calculations.

Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios, the conclusion has been elusive. \r\n\r\nHere, we employ a recently developed formalism of density correlations to incorporate the effects of resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematical cuts to perform quantitative calculations of charge fluctuations in central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced. On the other hand, the QGP scenario predictions show small sensitivity to the range of local charge conservation and yield excellent agreement with experimental data. We present predictions for LHC Run 2 as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

Unlike anisotropic flow coefficients $ v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T}) $, which are influenced by both shear and bulk viscosity, $v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T}) $ is sensitive solely to the bulk properties of the QGP medium, making it a valuable probe for studying bulk viscosity and the hydrodynamic evolution of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of $ v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T})$ is reported across various centrality classes for inclusive charged particles and identified particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector. To minimize short-range non-flow correlations, a rapidity gap technique similar to that used in anisotropic flow measurements is employed. At low $p_{\\rm T}$, characteristic mass ordering, typically associated with collective flow in $v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T})$, is observed. At higher $ p_{\\rm T} $, where hydrodynamic descriptions fail, a baryon-meson splitting indicative of quark coalescence is observed.

Yet the physical mechanism is identical for both phenomena: A long-range correlation in the initial stages, followed by collective expansion. While the origin of anisotropic flow is a fluctuation in the shape of the fireball, that of $[p_T]$ fluctuations is a fluctuation in the initial temperature. It generates a fluctuation in the fluid velocity, which is carried over to the $p_T$ spectrum of outgoing particles. The same fluctuation is present at all rapidities and generates a long-range correlation. \r\n\r\nWe make hydrodynamic predictions for the fluctuation of the spectrum, which is a new observable $v_0(p_T)$ introduced by Schenke, Shen and Teaney [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00690] which has not yet been measured, and for which first experimental results will hopefully be shown at this conference. Like anisotropic flow $v_n(p_T)$, $v_0(p_T)$ is predicted to have a strong mass ordering in the $p_T$ range where hydrodymamics applies. We show that our hydrodynamic calculation reproduces precisely the observed dependence of $[p_T]$ fluctuations on $p_T$ cuts which has previously been observed by PHENIX and ATLAS.

      "Abstract": "Experimental information on the strong interaction between $\\Sigma$ hyperons and protons is a crucial input for both the description of the equation of state of neutron stars with hyperon content and theoretical predictions regarding potential $\\Sigma$-hypernuclei. Data on this interaction are scarce, solely based on scattering experiments. Since data points are only available at rather high relative momenta and their uncertainties are sizeable, theory calculations are not well constrained. Particularly the characteristics of the interaction in the triplet channel spin configuration are highly uncertain, and it is not yet clear if the interaction in this channel is attractive or repulsive. In this regard, two-particle intensity interferometry (femtoscopy) of $\\Sigma$ baryons and nucleons can provide valuable information. \r\nThe reconstruction of the weak decay of $\\Sigma^+$ baryons is very challenging. Its decay into a proton and a neutral pion via the weak interaction has a branching ratio of around 50%, with the neutral pion decaying electromagnetically almost exclusively into two photons. In this talk, a novel reconstruction method will be shown which makes use of sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve the reconstruction efficiency and purity of the $\\Sigma^+$ baryons, enabling the measurement of their correlation function with protons for the first time. The obtained correlation function will be discussed and related to latest theoretical calculations using Chiral Effective Field Theories, providing new constraints on the $\\Sigma$–nucleon interaction.",

In this study, we perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using simulations of Au-Au and $d$-Au collisions and a broad range of measurements from the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS Collaborations spanning nearly two decades of RHIC operations. In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner [1]. We calibrate on rapidity- and pT-differential observables–examining the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties–and highlight the tension between them within our model. We quantify the additional constraints provided by rapidity dependent measurements and we emphasize the similarity in posteriors from separate calibrations of large and small systems. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in additional smaller systems in $p$-Au and $^3$He-Au, as well as statistically-sensitive or proposed measurements in the calibrated systems. Furthermore, we predict longitudinal de-correlations, highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference.\r\n\r\n[1] C. Shen and B.

This paradox raises an intriguing question: How can a medium that exhibits hydrodynamic-like behavior and substantially modifies the distribution of final-state hadrons have little to no effect on high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles? To explore this, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$) as a function of particle transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) and event multiplicity in pp and pPb collisions, recorded by CMS at 13 TeV and 8.16 TeV, respectively. In particular, first measurements of $p_\\mathrm{T}$-differential multiparticle cumulants using the subevent method are reported, probing an extended phase space region up to high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ values. Furthermore, we compare the results across pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions within similar multiplicity ranges.

Two-particle correlations in the “jet frame” show a surprising rise in elliptic flow harmonics, v2*, at large pseudorapidity separations (Δη* > 2), in jets with high charged-particle multiplicities, a trend not reproduced by event generators like Pythia and Sherpa. In this talk, we present the transverse momentum and ∆η* dependence of elliptic and triangular flow, across a wide range of jet multiplicity and transverse momentum. We further explore the role of jet substructure in driving the observed long-range azimuthal correlations, examining its potential connection to the geometry of the initial-state jet system. Recent LHC studies also show signs of collectivity in high-multiplicity photonuclear collisions, where a quasi-real photon from one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus. In this talk, we also present new CMS measurements of two- and multi-particle correlations from photonuclear collisions using PbPb data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3. By leveraging the full detector acceptance, we explore wide pseudorapidity gaps up to 7–8 units, which significantly reduces non-collective contributions and enhances the search for long-range near-side ridge effects.

      "Country": "Russia",
      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow characterizes the shape and direction of expansion of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. The Fourier coefficients in the expansion of particle azimuthal distribution describe the collective response of the medium to the shape of the initial collision geometry, \r\nand are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS). A non-monotonic slope in the first-order flow coefficient $v_1$ (directed flow) is proposed as a potential signature of a first-order phase transition between the QGP and hadronic phase. The second-order coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow) exhibits NCQ scaling at top RHIC and LHC energies, reflecting partonic collectivity, but this scaling vanishes at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV. The third-order coefficient $v_3$ (triangular flow) is typically driven by initial-state fluctuations and is uncorrelated with the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies reveal a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\\Psi_{1}$), attributed to collision geometry and the potential in the responsive medium.\\\\\r\n\\indent In this talk, we will report the measurements of $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3\\{\\Psi_{1}\\}$ for light, strange, multi-strange, net-particles, and light nuclei in Au+Au collisions.

We will present the precise measurements of $v_2$ for $\\phi$ mesons and multi-strange hadrons, along with the energy dependence of NCQ scaling. The presented results aim to shed light on the onset of partonic interactions. Additionally, atomic mass number (A) scaled $v_1$ slope of light nuclei will be presented to understand their production mechanism. The experimental measurements will be compared with transport model calculations to explore the underlying physics mechanisms in the high baryon density region of the QCD phase diagram.",

      "Abstract": "The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor, as well initial conserved charge densities. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations\r\n of large and small systems. \r\n With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.\r\n\r\nIn very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken.  Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.\r\n\r\nBased on:  arXiv:2405.13600 and work in progress",

Differential results for selected observables are also provided as a function of kinematic variables, alongside standard centrality dependence. In particular, $p_{\\rm T}$-differential flow is further extended to extremely high-$p_{\\rm T}$ regions, providing new inputs for hard processes.

We then develop a framework that interpolates these two limits to calculate shear viscosity across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. The pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence, leading to a non-trivial shear viscosity at finite densities. In addition, we extend the next-to-leading order weak-coupling shear viscosity of QCD to finite baryon chemical potential μ, and we show that the convergence is better at μ > T than at μ = 0. Finally, we present leading order calculations of flavor diffusion for weak-coupling QCD at finite baryon chemical potential μ for three flavors.",

      "Abstract": "It was recently discovered that Israel-Stewart theory is not as causal as we thought [1]. When a fluid expands too fast, as in heavy ion simulations at early times, the large viscous stresses modify the propagation speeds, leading to superluminal signaling [2]. Since we would not trust hydrodynamic information speeds anyway, this may not sound like such disconcerting news, were it not for some recent theorems that link causality violations to instabilities due to time-reversed dissipation [3]. In this talk, I will discuss the physical implications of early-time causality violations in heavy-ion simulations, and how current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic solvers such as MUSIC deal with the expected early-time pathologies [4]. Particular attention will be devoted to the following pressing question: How can hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions be seemingly stable when theory indicates they should not be?\r\n\r\n[1] Bemfica, Disconzi, Hoang, Noronha, Radosz; Phys.

To study this soft-hard correlation, measurements of two-particle correlations in with two different particle-pair selections are studied. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. In the second, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. In $pp$ collisions, excluding jet-associated particles does not affect the ridge, and no significant azimuthal correlations are found between jet-associated particles and the underlying event, ruling out hard-process contributions to the $pp$ ridge. New measurements extending this analysis to $p$+Pb collisions are also presented. Prior $p$+Pb flow measurements have indicated a small but significant high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ up to a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of 50 GeV. This is in contrast to suppression measurements which indicate no clear suppression of high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons.

We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio %\\eta/s% in the early stages of the collision.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We present a selection of recent measurements of electromagnetic probes conducted by CMS to probe initial-state aspects of the heavy ion collision. The Z boson has a very short lifetime and can decay to dimuon final states that can be precisely measured. These properties make it a valuable tool for studying the initial state of heavy ion collisions. It has been proposed that the momentum of muons resulting from a Z decay, and therefore the experimentally observed mass and width of the Z boson, may be modified by the presence of the immense initial-state electromagnetic fields that are thought to be created in heavy ion collisions. Using the CMS experiment, we report the first search for a modification of the observed Z boson mass and width in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV relative to those observed in pp collisions. In addition, measurements of Z boson yields and azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, will be discussed. The centrality and rapidity dependence of the measurements are compared to theoretical models. Taken together, these measurements provide new insights into the role of initial electromagnetic fields, nuclear parton distribution functions, and initial-state geometry in heavy ion collisions. The production of top quarks in heavy ion collisions serves as a novel tool for investigating nuclear parton distribution functions at high Bjorken-x. Although being a quark, the top has a short lifetime, decaying predominantly to a W boson and b quark pair, before hadronizing. Leptonic final states from the subsequent W boson decay are thus effectively electroweak probes of the medium they traverse before reaching the detector. The CMS collaboration has reported evidence of top quark pair ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) production using data from lead-lead (PbPb) collisions during Run 2.

The electric conductivity can be accessed via the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function's low-energy transport peak, which can be measured via thermal dilepton emission. Several facilities including the Schwer-Ionen Synchrotron (SIS), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have potential to probe low energy dilepton signals in ongoing and future experiments.\r\nIn this contribution, we present our recently published study on the electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter. We implement the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\\rho$ meson. Therefore, hadronic many-body theory is utilized to calculate the $\\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\\pi$-$\\rho$, $\\pi$-$\\sigma$, $\\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\\Delta$-hole loops. Vertex corrections are then introduced to maintain gauge invariance. In particular, we examine the transport peak and electric conductivity along a proposed phase transition line, and under conditions comparable to those expected in future heavy-ion experiments. We compare the transport properties for hadronic matter and a pion gas, in order to examine the individual contributions of various particles to the electric conductivity. In addition, we calculate the transport peak along a proposed phase transition line, and find that the electric conductivity shows a decreasing tendency from high to low collision energies.",

At which beam energy is hydrodynamics *necessary*? How should it be initialized? The electromagnetic radiation in a HIC is heavily dependent on the cumulative emission throughout the expansion, so these questions can be resolved by comparing dilepton observables in different model calculations. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a dynamic approach to fluidizing hadrons in state-of-the-art evolutions of intermediate beam energy HICs, based on the local energy density.

In the presence of a first-order phase transition, the dilepton yield is greatly enhanced, which can be seen in the dilepton  excitation function.

Additionally, prompt photons from initial hard scattering are estimated using model calculations and the effective temperature is extracted from non-prompt direct photons at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 14.6 - 54.4 GeV. The physics implications of direct virtual photon yields and effective temperature will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Despite decades of theoretical and experimental achievements, a coherent picture of the evolution in colliding heavy ion systems is still missing, particularly in the non-perturbative regime.  Since photons are penetrating probes, the combined information of direct photon yields at low transverse momenta ($p_T$) and their azimuthally asymmetric emission (flow) provides important constraints on theories.  Simultaneous observation of high yields and significant (almost hadron-like) flow of low $p_T$ direct photons in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX, dubbed the \"direct photon puzzle\" still eludes a coherent explanation.  A closely related issue is the apparent universality of photon production, that depends only on charged particle multiplicity, but not on the size of the colliding ions, except for the most asymmetric systems.  In this talk, we will present new results on direct photon flow in Au+Au and yields in Au+Au, Cu+Au and $^3$He+Au at low $p_T$. Also, we will discuss their impact on our current understanding of the various phases of heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The fermion damping rates of quarks and the electrical conductivity of a strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are derived at leading order in the coupling constant using first-principles field-theoretical techniques. The quark damping arises from one-to-two and two-to-one scattering processes, with their rates calculated by incorporating full kinematic details and exact amplitudes. This approximation holds for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and high temperatures. Utilizing the damping rates, we investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the mechanisms governing these conductivities, leading to a pronounced suppression of the transverse conductivity compared to the longitudinal one. While the approximation may break down in the regime of strong coupling, our study offers valuable insights into the charge transport properties of strongly magnetized plasmas.",

In RHIC\r\nRun-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-pT photon trigger. This dataset represents a nearly-tenfold increase of the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous EMCal-based high-pT neutral meson measurements for this collision energy at RHIC. This talk presents the first sPHENIX EMCal measurements in p+p collisions, including neutral pion and eta meson production over a  significantly extended kinematic range, where the eta decay photons remain well-separated in the granular EMCal out to very high pT, and isolated photon production, with an isolation   requirement based on the full calorimeter system for the first time at RHIC. These provide  important pQCD baselines for future measurements of single hadron suppression at very high pT in Au+Au collisions. Additionally, the transverse single spin asymmetry for neutral mesons  serves as a foundational measurement for the sPHENIX Cold QCD physics program.",

      "Speaker": "Xoán Mayo López",
      "Institute": "Universidade de Santiago de Compostela - IGFAE",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "One of the most striking modifications induced by the QGP on a QCD parton shower is the breaking of angular-ordering. This was established in a series of pioneering papers almost 15 years ago by studying the radiation pattern off a QCD antenna in the presence of a medium [1,2]. These effects were captured by a single critical angle solely depending on the medium properties. Constraining the values of $\\theta_c$, and more generally the physics of colour decoherence, is one of the targets of the heavy-ion experimental program at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate that the notion of a critical angle that exclusively depends on the medium properties no longer holds after accounting for medium effects during the formation of the antenna. This generalisation of the results of Refs. [1,2] shows that each splitting in an in-medium parton shower experiences colour decoherence in a different fashion. In addition, the total rate of emissions is enhanced with respect to previous calculations. This result has important implications for the experimental quest of determining medium modifications to parton evolution, as well as in the formulation of in-medium parton showers.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

We demonstrate how these correlators open up important new avenues in phenomenology. The interplay between the quark mass and medium effects gives the correlator a distinct formation time-dependent medium modification at small angles, while the clean access to the splitting has the potential to unveil effects from an anisotropic, flowing medium.",

This observable is sensitive to both multiple scattering and large-angle scattering effects in the QGP. The pp and PbPb data samples were recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to integrated luminosities of 1.69 nb−1 and 302 pb−1 respectively.

This study utilizes PbPb collision data recorded in 2018 with an integrated luminosity of $1.67 \\pm 0.03$ nb$^{-1}$, as well as pp collision data acquired in 2017 with an integrated luminosity of $301 \\pm 6$ pb$^{-1}$. For the first time in PbPb collisions, the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons relative to $Z$ bosons are measured in bins of charged hadron $p_\\mathrm{T}$ to search for in-medium parton shower modifications and medium recoil effects. The analysis focuses on events containing at least one $Z$ boson with $40 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 350$ GeV. A significant modification in the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions for charged hadrons in the low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range, around 1 to 2 GeV, is observed compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The results are consistent with expectations from phenomenological models, including medium recoil and the medium response to hard probes traversing the quark-gluon plasma. The data provide significant new information about the correlation between hard and soft particles in heavy ion collisions, which can be used to test predictions of various jet quenching models. In PbPb data comparisons with pp reference and theoretical models, the first evidence for medium recoil and hole effects caused by a hard probe is found.",

By selecting muonic decays of Z bosons, we can isolate the effect of the recoiling process without potential bias from requiring isolation, as is the case for photons. Di-hadron correlations can naturally separate effects from different angular scales and enable jet substructure measurements without jet reconstruction bias. Similar to the energy-energy correlator (EE) in jets where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes are separated, by studying analogous correlation in the full event, one can unravel potential larger-scale structures that may arise from the interaction of high-energy recoiling particles with the quark-gluon plasma. This talk will present the first measurement of the energy-weighted di-hadron correlation with the CMS collaboration using events tagged with a Z boson. A significant modification of EEC is observed not only in small to intermediate angular scale but also extended to the phase space that is far away from the typical range covered by jet based EEC.

The effect is not due only to a broader angular distribution of partons, because angular ordering also affects the energy sharing.

Our approach utilizes the multi-stage jet energy loss description, which includes suppression of jet-medium interaction at high virtuality, reflecting the virtuality dependence of the process. The parameters used in our simulations are tuned to reproduce hadron RAA and inclusive jet RAA, particularly in the high-pT region at 5.02 TeV. Using these simulations, we analyze key observables such as Soft Drop observables, jet mass, and fragmentation functions. Our results show good agreement with current experimental data, highlighting the model’s reliability. This study provides a solid baseline for further detailed investigations of jet structures in heavy-ion collisions, offering insights into jet-medium interactions and their effects on jet evolution.",

This enhancement is attributed to strong hydrodynamic flow and parton recombination in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). \r\nJet probes have been used extensively to gain insights into QGP properties, with substantial modifications to jet yields and internal structures seen across multiple measurements. Despite apparent medium-induced changes to jet fragmentation patterns, modification of in-jet hadro-chemistry has not yet been found.

      "Abstract": "Jet quenching — modifications to the energy and substructure of high-energy parton showers in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) — serves as a key experimental tool to probe properties of QGP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. On one hand, the quenching effect, often quantified through the nuclear modification factor (e.g., $R_{AA}$), is well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, it is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the observation of collectivity in these collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon. And O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurements of the following three observables related to the jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$), inclusive jet $R_{cp}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{cp}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding. These measurements provide a valuable opportunity to explore possible jet quenching effects in O+O collisions. The $p_{T}$ and centrality differential results will be presented and compared to similar measurements in collision systems of various sizes. Such comparisons will also help disentangle the effects of system size and collision geometry.",

      "Abstract": "Jet substructure provides precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offers more differential ways to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of single hadrons. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as to the mass of partons through the dead-cone effect.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present three key charm-tagged jet measurements, using jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson. The first are measurements of the differences between three different axis definitions inside the jets. These different definitions vary in their sensitivity to wide-angle soft radiation and systematically probe the radiation pattern off of charm quarks. Next are the jet angularities, which characterise the weighted angular distribution of the jet constituents. These powerful observables probe the parton shower, with sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects that can be tuned by adjusting the importance of wide-angle radiation. Finally, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator for $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson tagged jets. This observable is defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs within jets and reveals the detailed structure of QCD radiation from heavy quarks, allowing for a distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative effects in charm showers. Comparisons of all these results to measurements of dominantly gluon-initiated jets, as well as to various event generators, are sensitive to flavor-dependent effects in both the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms. Moreover, comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations emphasize the need for improved theoretical modelling of heavy-quark jets and provide critical insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.",

      "Abstract": "The flavour dependence of parton showers presents a unique opportunity to explore fundamental properties of QCD interactions. In particular, the substructure of low-energy jets containing heavy-flavour hadrons provides experimental access to both mass effects as well as the impact of Casimir colour factors. Using novel tracing methods, splittings of charm quarks are isolated to measure fundamental properties such as the dead-cone effect and the charm-quark splitting function. By using the new high statistics data samples of Run 3, we present new measurements of the dead-cone effect and splitting function of charm quarks, differentially in the energy of the emitter, through measurements of jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. At the low energies uniquely accessible to the ALICE experiment, comparisons of these measurements to an inclusive-jet baseline probe the evolution of the dead-cone of charm quarks with unprecedented accuracy. With increasing energy of the emitting charm quark, the dead-cone angle is predicted to get smaller, allowing for the isolation of the impact of Casimir colour factors. Such differential measurements in the charm sector not only illuminate the role of mass and Casimir colour factors when compared to inclusive jets, but also provide a lower mass heavy quark-enriched sample which is crucial for comparisons to measurements in the beauty sector, in order to isolate the mass dependence of the dead-cone effect.",

We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by γ-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The diffusion wake valley is found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the γ-jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to the equation of state and shear viscosity is also studied.",

In this talk, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state and compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, that appear as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ experimented by a jet at approximately mid-rapidity. We then pay special attention to the anisotropies in the momentum broadening between the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the collision axis.

      "Speaker": "Arjun Srinivasan Kudinoor",
      "Institute": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, jets formed from hard-scattered partons experience an overall energy loss and have a modified internal structure compared to vacuum jets. These modifications are a result of the interactions between the energetic partons in a jet shower and the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). As the jet traverses the QGP, it loses momentum to the medium, which in turn responds to the presence of the jet. This “medium response” modifies the momentum distribution of the (soft) hadrons produced when the QGP freezes out. Since these hadrons carry the momentum lost by the parton shower, they and the modified shower both contribute to the energy flow in jets. The quantitative description of the medium response is an open question under active investigation. Recently, the projected N-point energy correlators (ENCs) have seen a resurgence of interest to probe vacuum QCD. For the first time [1], we will present a computation of the full three point energy-energy-energy correlation function in heavy-ion collisions and demonstrate its use for studying the shape of the energy flow originating from medium response. For this study, we utilize the Hybrid Model that implements a hydrodynamical medium response via the wake. We will show that measuring three-point correlation functions offer a promising experimental avenue for imaging the wake of the jet as when the three angles are well-separated the three-point correlator is dominated by the medium response.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] arXiv:2407.13818v2",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A subset of heavy-ion collisions are ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), where the ions collide with a large impact parameter, causing them to interact primarily through their intense electromagnetic fields. These interactions allow for the study of various photon-induced processes at high energies. The products of exclusive UPC interactions are typically characterized by very low transverse momenta products, which present several challenges to efficiently select with a trigger. In Run 3, the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) FastOR trigger provided a novel tool to trigger on these processes at Level 1. The TRT trigger was, for the first time, adapted for use in heavy-ion collisions, allowing it to trigger on low-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles ($p_\\mathrm{T} > 200$ MeV), including muons from coherent J/Psi decays. Another feature of many UPC collisions is single-sided nuclear breakup or multiple photon exchange, which causes one or both of the colliding ions to emit forward neutrons.  \r\nThe Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detects these neutrons and provides a fully digital trigger. This tool allows for triggering on many distinct neutron topologies within the Level 1 system. In Run 4, the new joint ATLAS-CMS HL-ZDC will be installed, providing similar triggering capabilities in the more challenging environment of the HL-LHC. The combination of the ZDC and TRT along with other calorimeter systems allows for the efficient collection of data for many distinct UPC processes.",

In ATLAS, the absolute luminosity calibration and its uncertainty is derived from a set of dedicated van-der-Meer (vdM) scans, which the LHC delivers for every collision dataset (p+p, p+Pb, Pb+Pb etc.) and at every centre-of-mass energy. The absolute calibration is monitored during the full data-taking period regarding its stability. During Pb+Pb running in the autumn of 2023, the ATLAS experiment recorded seven vdM scan pairs in different configurations, which are used to extract the absolute luminosity calibration. The stability of this calibration is monitored through a set of independent luminometers. This presentation discusses the procedure of the ATLAS luminosity measurement, and the results obtained for the 2023 Pb+Pb dataset.",

      "Abstract": "Ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions have revealed the existence of a hot, dense medium exhibiting collective flow with minimal viscous dissipation, indicative of a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. The CMS Collaboration previously measured the speed of sound in this medium, determining a value of approximately 0.241 at an effective temperature of 219 MeV in ultracentral 5.02 TeV PbPb collisions at the LHC, in excellent agreement with lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predictions for a deconfined QCD matter. In this talk, we present new results from measurements using 5.36 TeV PbPb data collected during LHC Run 3 (2023) and 8.16 TeV pPb data from Run 2. The new larger data samples significantly improve precision, enabling more detailed differential studies. We explore the temperature dependence of the speed of sound by analyzing data at different collision energies and the mean transverse momentum at various rapidities. Additionally, the impact of different centrality estimators on the extraction of the speed of sound is examined in detail. These new results provide critical insights into the thermal properties of the quark-gluon plasma and offer stringent tests of lattice QCD predictions.",

      "Abstract": "A key question about the QCD phase diagram is whether there is a critical point somewhere on the boundary between the hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma phases, and if so where. Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The unknown Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD. We use maximum entropy freeze-out of fluctuations to make estimates for the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoSs with a 3D Ising-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the location and strength of the critical point. We quantify the effect of the non-universal mapping parameters, the distance between the critical point and the freeze-out curve, and the contribution of decay protons on the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Fluctuations of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions are expected to be sensitive to a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD matter [1, 2]. Such a critical point is increasingly predicted to be located in the high baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) region around $\\mu_B$ = 500 - 650 MeV [3–8]. In 2018, the STAR Experiment started collecting data in a fixed-target configuration in order to map the high baryon chemical potential region of the phase diagram ($\\mu_B$ = 420 - 720 MeV). Critical fluctuations may be observed by measuring various orders of cumulants, $C_n$, of the distributions of baryon number. The collision-energy dependence of net-proton $C_4$/$C_2$ from STAR’s measurements in Beam Energy Scan I hinted at a possible non-monotonic deviation from the non-critical baseline in Au+Au collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 19.6 GeV, and the first published result from the fixed-target program, in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV is consistent with the non-critical baseline [9–13]. We report here new results on proton-number high-order cumulants from STAR’s Fixed-Target Program. Implications for the QCD phase diagram and critical-point search will be discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] M. A.

      "Abstract": "Non-monotonic behavior in the RHIC net proton number fluctuation data could signal the presence of a QCD critical point if they probe thermal conditions at the time of freeze-out. However, the connection between higher-order baryon number cumulants calculated in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics and higher-order net proton number cumulants may not be straightforward. Moreover, correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number have been suggested as sensitive probes for detecting changes in the degrees of freedom that carry strangeness at low temperatures (hadrons) and high temperatures (quarks) [1]. A non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model can explain baryon-strangeness correlations calculated in QCD at low temperatures and small chemical potentials, especially when additional strange hadrons are included (QMHRG2020).\r\nIn this presentation, we will show the ratio of first-order to second-order baryon number fluctuations and compare them with the RHIC BES-II results for proton number fluctuations. We will argue that a simple non-interacting HRG model cannot explain the RHIC BES-II results at higher densities, particularly at lower beam energies. Additionally, we will compare higher-order baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD results and argue that these results rule out the possibility of a QCD critical point in the BES-II collider mode. We will also discuss the potential influence of corrections arising from global charge conservation in heavy-ion collisions [2]. Finally, we will compare our results on correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number at finite chemical potential [3] with preliminary results from RHIC BES-II.\r\n[1] V.

We apply both cumulative and differential scans to explore long-range correlations and examine the behaviors of cumulants within localized rapidity ($y$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$) bins. The results from 0-5% most central collisions are compared with non-critical model calculations and with data from 70-80% peripheral collisions, both of which are used as references.",

By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \\pm 6.9$ MeV and $\\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \\pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively, at expansion order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^2)$ [1].

      "Abstract": "The chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD is expected to be of second order if the breaking of axial anomaly remains sufficiently strong at the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ [1]. This is supported by lattice QCD calculations [2]. However, FRG model calculations suggest that the scaling window, in which universal scaling relations hold, may be small [3]. Furthermore, whether or not the $U_A(1)$ symmetry gets effectively restored at $T_c$ remains to be controversial. This suggest that a more detailed analysis of universal critical behavior close to $T_c$ , as well as a direct determination of the relevant universality class for the chiral phase transition [1,4] in (2+1)-flavor QCD are needed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present new results from a study of the scaling behavior\r\nof an improved order parameter $M = M_\\ell - H \\chi_\\ell$ for chiral symmetry restoration in the light 2-flavor sector of (2+1)-flavor QCD. Here $M_\\ell$ and $\\chi_\\ell$ are multiplicatively renormalized light quark chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, respectively. Furthermore, $H = m_l/m_s$ is the light-to-strange quark mass ratio.\r\n\r\nWe construct ratios of $M$ for two different values of the light quark mass, $m_l$ (or $H$ equivalently), and $T$ close to $T_c$ . In the scaling region we find a unique intersection point for these ratios at $T=T_c$, which allows us to determine $T_c$ and the underlying universality class of the chiral phase transition, from the knowledge of critical exponent $\\delta$.\r\n\r\nThe approach followed here will allow to further constrain the influence of axial anomaly on universal critical behavior in (2+1)-flavor QCD. It also provides a new way of determining the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ , which strengthens the upper bound on the temperature range within which a critical end point in QCD for non-vanishing values of  chemical potential can possibly be found in heavy ion experiments.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

In this regime, the net-baryon number cumulants computed  using the HRG and lattice QCD partition functions are in good agreement up to third order. However, starting with the fourth-order cumulants, the LQCD results are significantly lower than the corresponding HRG results. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally verify the full QCD partition function by measuring the fourth-order cumulants of the net-proton number distributions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, ALICE data for net-proton number cumulants up to sixth order in proton-proton collisions at top LHC energy are presented to search for effects of a possible chiral phase transition in this small system. An extension of the net-proton measurements in Pb-Pb collisions to fourth order is also presented. In addition to providing experimental access to the full QCD partition function, these measurements will, for the first time, allow to distinguish between different mechanisms of baryon production.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions create a hot, dense state of QCD matter called Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP). In ultra-central collisions, the QGP volume saturates and remains constant; instead, entropy fluctuations cause temperature variations in the system. This property can be probed by measuring the correlation between the average transverse momentum (⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩) and the multiplicity of charged hadrons. This contribution shows the latest ALICE measurements\r\nof charged-hadron ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ and its higher-order cumulants in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions. Results are in close agreement with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, by fitting the relative increase of ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ to the relative change in the average charged-particle density at midrapidity, it is possible to extract the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the QGP, which indicates how fast compression waves propagate through the QGP medium. The extracted cs shows a strong dependence on the choice of the centrality estimators used to select ultra-central collisions, highlighting the sensitivity of this measurement to experimental biases. This observation suggests a need for careful reassessment of methods for determining cs from heavy-ion data. The measurements are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art models in ultra-central events.",

This phase transition is expected to proceed via spinodal decomposition as the system explores the metastable and unstable areas of the equation of state. To conclusively claim the discovery of the first-order phase transition curve, it is crucial to include spinodal effects in phenomenological simulations of these collisions and identify their experimental signatures. For the first time, we present a covariant formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics including spinodal decomposition [1]. These equations account for surface effects between the two phases and can be used in hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions.

      "Abstract": "Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons. The measurement of the production of hypernuclei with mass number A=3 and 4 in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful tool to investigate the hyper-nucleosynthesis mechanism. In the coalescence model, the production yields are sensitive to the interplay between the spatial extension of the nucleus wavefunction and the baryon-emitting source size, whereas, in the statistical hadronization model, the nuclear structure does not come into play in the production. Hypernuclei span over a wide range of wavefunction radii, from about 2 fm for A=4 hypernuclei to about 10 fm for the hypertriton, making them ideal probes to test such models. In addition, the study of hypernuclei properties provides information on the nucleon-hyperon interactions, complementing the results obtained through femtoscopy correlation measurements. The strength of such interactions is a fundamental input to calculate the equation-of-state of the high-density nuclear matter found inside neutron stars.\r\nThis contribution presents recent measurements of ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$He based on the data samples collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Besides the yield measurement, the production mechanisms can be investigated via anisotropic flow and global spin polarization measurements, comparing the behaviour of hypernuclei with their non-strange counterpart. In this contribution, we present recent flow measurements of ${}^{3}$He, ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}$He, obtained from the large Pb-Pb data sample collected by ALICE at the LHC in Run 3.

      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By contrasting the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the ϕ-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^{*}$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution will present new results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^{*}$(892) and ϕ(1020) in Pb–Pb collisions obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results will be compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret which underlying mechanism can describe the experimental observations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. Proposed Glueball candidates like the f$_2$(1270), f$^{′}_2$(1525), and f$_0$(1710) also provide opportunities to explore the gluonic bound states predicted by lattice QCD. Utilizing its excellent particle identification capabilities ALICE has recently conducted detailed studies of the exotic resonance production in pp collisions data at √s = 13 and 13.6 TeV.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The study of exotic hadrons has long been a topic of great interest for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As one of the light exotic hadrons, the structure and constituent quark content of $f_0(980)$ have been debated for decades, with theories suggesting it could be a tetraquark state ($s\\bar sq\\bar q$) or a hadronic molecule ($K\\bar K$). Recently, the CMS experiment has measured the elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$ of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions and concluded that  $f_0(980)$ is an ordinary $s\\bar s$ meson, based on the number-of-constituent-quarks (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow [1]. Assuming that loosely bound light exotic hadrons can only survive at the kinetic freeze-out of the expanding hadronic matter, we have implemented the first $K\\bar K$ coalescence model to a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic and hadronic transport model to calculate the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV.  Using the well tuned phase-space distributions of kaons in this collision, our coalescence model results agree well with the CMS flow measurements,  providing thus a strong evidence for the $K\\bar K$ molecular nature of $f_0(980)$. Our study also indicates that the CMS Collaboration may have unjustifiably ruled out the $K\\bar K$ molecular state of $f_0(980)$ by not considering the different $v_2$ scalings in  the coalescence of hadrons and the coalescence of quarks[2].\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] A.

In particular, the results for Lambda hyperons and charged and neutral K mesons will be shown. The energy and system size dependencies of Lambda-to-pion and strangeness-to-pion ratios are also explored. Moreover, an unexpected excess of charged over neutral meson production in Ar+Sc and pi-+C interactions will be presented. The obtained results will be compared with predictions from selected particle production models, as well as with existing world data from proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions.",

      "Institute": "Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "One of the unresolved issues in hadron–hadron collisions is the microscopic understanding of how light (anti)(hyper)nuclei are created. Several differential measurements of (anti)(hyper)nuclei yields, momentum distributions, and fluctuations have been carried out in pp, p–A, and A–A collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Comparisons to models based on statistical hadronization or nucleon coalescence generally provide a good fit to the data. However, these models are grounded in different underlying scenarios, leading to a highly model dependent interpretation of the results.\r\nIn this work, new results based on femtoscopy correlations of deuteron proton and deuteron–pion pairs measured in pp and Pb–Pb collisions by ALICE at collision energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, respectively, are presented. Deuteron–proton correlations allow for studying the particle-emitting source size of deuterons compared to other hadrons. The deuteron source aligns with the proton source across all colliding systems. In pp collisions, the deuteron–pion correlation reveals the residual interaction between pions and nucleons from short lived Δ decays, followed by nucleon coalescence into deuterons. This effect is not observed in Pb–Pb collisions due to the large pion  multiplicities.\r\nThese results demonstrate, in a model-independent manner, that coalescence is a viable mechanism for (anti)deuteron production in ultra-relativistic hadron–hadron collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Understanding strangeness enhancement in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC remains a challenge for hadronization models. Recent observations of the $\\Omega_\\mathrm{c}^0$ baryon indicate that a substantial fraction of the detected Ω baryons may originate from the decay of charm hadrons, e.g. from $\\Omega_\\mathrm{c}^0 \\rightarrow \\Omega^- + \\pi^+$. However, the unknown absolute branching ratios prevent an exact estimation of the contribution of $\\Omega$ baryons coming from charm-hadron decays.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurement of the fraction of Ω baryons originating from charm-hadron decays in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, performed by the ALICE collaboration. This result is enabled by ALICE's new silicon Inner Tracking System, which allows the direct tracking of the Ω baryon prior to its decay. By studying the evolution of the fraction of Ω coming from charm hadrons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity, we will explore the role of charm-hadron production as a driver of strangeness enhancement.",

However, the challenges of robustly isolating the formation time of a splitting phenomenologically has prevented formation time-dependent modification effects from being accessed experimentally. We address these challenges using heavy flavour, which offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium. We demonstrate how modified and groomed versions of the Cambridge/Aachen or FlavourCone jet finding algorithms applied on $g \\to c\\bar{c}$ splittings can be used to reconstruct the kinematics of such splittings with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons. We construct the parton formation time distribution, which has characteristic distortions arising from medium effects. This effect can be used to construct ratios of $\\tau_f$-distributions in which the sensitivity of parton branching to the QCD formation time becomes experimentally accessible.",

In particular, they can carry signals from the pre-equilibrium stage since the very high energy density of this stage can result in significant charm-medium interaction. Using a hybrid simulation framework that combines the IP-Glasma model for initial-state with viscous hydrodynamic evolution MUSIC to model the medium, we study charm quark propagation through different stages of the collision, from pre-equilibrium to hadronization. Heavy quark initial production is generated using PYTHIA and their interactions within the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic medium are modeled through Langevin dynamics in MARTINI. Our results reveal that both the nuclear modification factor and anisotropic flow coefficients of D-mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are sensitive to the momentum-dependent energy loss of charm quarks in the initial stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hadronization mechanisms—specifically fragmentation and coalescence—play a crucial role in shaping the final-state charm observables.",

We can gain insights into the interactions between the charm quark and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium by studying the production and the flow of $D^{0}$ meson in heavy-ion collisions. We study the effect of the initial shape of the collision system on the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of promptly produced $D^{0}$ using event-shape engineering (ESE) in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV, at CMS. A correlation between the initial shape anisotropy with the $D^{0}$ $v_{2}$ would suggest that the flow gets driven by the interactions between the charm quark and the QGP and comparison with theoretical predictions allow us to unravel the mechanism behind the generation of $v_{2}$. We also study the anisotropic flow of nonprompt $D^{0}$ produced due to the decay of the bottom quarks and the nuclear modification factor ($\\mathrm{R_{AA}}$) for prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$. These studies provide further insights into the QGP interactions of heavy quarks like charm and bottom in heavy-ion collisions in different $p_{T}$ regions ranging from 1--40 GeV/c, the widest ever performed with ESE, and centralities between 0--50\\%.",

In fact, the early production of heavy quarks ($c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$) make charmonia an ideal tool to investigate the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, at LHC energies the recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks pairs, namely (re)generation, was found to significantly affect charmonium observables, in contraposition to the well known suppression mechanism. This aspect makes the production measurements of ground and excited states more and more relevant to discriminate among the scenarios foreseen by the different theoretical models. In addition, the possibility to isolate the non-prompt charmonia, i.e. originating from beauty hadron decays, provides an insight into the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP.

In this talk, wwe present a generalization of this code that incorporates the regime where $rT \\sim 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation. In its new version, QTRAJ implements new jump operators connecting different states, which are then expanded in plane waves, giving rise to a variation of the algorithm present in QTRAJ 1.0 where jumps with $\\Delta \\ell > 1$ are allowed.

      "Abstract": "The strong interaction in the non-perturbative regime typical of the system created in Heavy-Ion collision has been studied in the past years through an effective Quasi-Particle Model ($QPM$): we present an extension to a more realistic model, named $QPMp$, incorporating momentum-dependent parton masses as entailed by QCD asymptotic free dynamics. This model naturally improves the description of quark susceptibilities previously underestimated in the simple $QPM$. Coupling the $QPMp$ modeling to an event-by-event transport approach based on Langevin equations, we evaluate the heavy-flavour $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{n}(p_T)$ for $D$, $\\Lambda_c$, $B$, $\\Lambda_b$ hadrons in $PbPb$ as well as for $OO$ at $5$ $ATeV$. In $PbPb$ we find a quite good prediction for both $D$ meson and leptons from $B$ decays at least within current experimental uncertainties; we also discuss the additional information that can be carried by collisions of light $OO$ system. \r\nA main general result is that for charm quark the extracted space diffusion Ds(T) appears to be significantly larger (about $30-40\\%$) wrt the recent lQCD/NREFT results at momentum $p=0$. We propose a novel analysis that point out the crucial role of the momentum dependence of the interaction to draw solid conclusions about the agreement between the phenomenological approach and lQCD calculation as well as to determine the thermalization time of HQ and in particular its mass dependence from charm to bottom quark. We will point out that $\\Lambda_c$ production and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of D meson at very low momenta ($p_T<1.5$ $GeV$) will allow for a novel and more solid determination of the space diffusion coefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.L.Sambataro, V.

      "Abstract": "Screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part. We determine the complex potential in QGP using lattice calculations on lattices with large temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=16-36$. The complex potential is extracted from the Wilson line correlators and physically motivated forms of the corresponding spectral functions [1,2]. We find that the real part of the complex potential is not screened in QGP independently of the detailed form of the spectral functions. We also estimate the imaginary part of the potential using prior information from various theoretical calculations [2].\r\n\r\nLattice calculations also find that the wave function of bottomonium states does not change much across the QCD transition [3]. This is consistent with the observation of the unscreened potential. Therefore, we use the vacuum wave function of different quarkonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\chi_c(1P)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\chi_b(1P)$ and $\\chi_b(2P)$ states\r\nin QGP [2] and compare to lattice NRQCD results [3].\r\n\r\n[1] Alexei Bazavov, Daniel Hoying, Rasmus N.

      "Abstract": "Charm-baryon production measurements in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC are fundamental to investigate the charm-quark hadronization, and to test perturbative QCD-based calculations. Recent measurements in pp collisions show baryon-to-meson ratios significantly higher than those in $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions, challenging the validity of theoretical calculations based on the factorisation approach and assuming universal fragmentation functions across collision systems. Several QCD-inspired effective models (e.g. Catania, POWLANG, QCM) and Monte Carlo generators (e.g. PYTHIA 8, EPOS 4) take different approaches to describe the charm-quark hadronization, and to explain the observed baryon production at the LHC. However, most of them do not manage to describe simultaneously the production of strange and non-strange charm baryons. Precise measurements of strange and non-strange charm-baryon production are crucial to put constraints on model calculations, and to understand the mechanisms governing the charm-quark hadronization in pp collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of strange ($\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0,+}$) and non-strange ($\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2455)$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2520)$) charm-baryon production utilising the large data sample of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV harvested from the start of LHC Run 3 are presented, and the comparison with model predictions are discussed.",

Charmonium cross section can be split into prompt and non-prompt components, the first corresponding to directly produced  charm-anticharm pairs, the second originating from the decay of beauty hadrons. Both components are relevant for the investigation of the properties of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP), with the latter allowing a study the mass dependence of heavy-quarks in-medium energy-loss mechanism. In this contribution the recent measurement of prompt and non-prompt $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ carried out by the ALICE Collaboration in pp and Pb–Pb collisions at midrapidity (|y| < 0.8) will be shown, including the newest results from LHC Run 3. Moreover, thanks to the installation of the new muon forward tracker (MFT), prompt/non-prompt charmonium separation is now possible in LHC Run 3 at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 3.6).

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks serve as a clean probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. They are primarily generated from early-stage hard scatterings and retain information about the entire evolution of the QGP fireball. We have developed a state-of-the-art model to provide a comprehensive description of the heavy quark evolution in a realistic QGP medium from the heavy quark's production in the initial stages of the collision all the way to hadronic freeze-out. \r\n\r\nThe transport of heavy quarks in the QGP medium is described by a Langevin-based transport model that has been augmented to incorporate medium-induced radiation. This transport model is coupled to a bulk evolution model based on 2+1D relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. The heavy quark transport coefficients are derived from non-perturbative T-matrix calculations, which account for resonant correlations near the QGP transition temperature.  Hadronization of the heavy quark is described by a fragmentation plus coalescence model. We utilize the resonance recombination model that satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions. The recombination probabilities are derived from resonant heavy-quark scattering rates. \r\n\r\nWe report on key observables in open heavy flavor physics, including the nuclear modification factor, elliptic flow, baryon-to-meson ratio, as well as D-Dbar angular correlations and compare our results to experimental data from the ALICE collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at 5 TeV.",

      "Abstract": "A  heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\\bar Q$) pair can be produced in several pQCD processes, which impose different correlations between the $Q$ and $\\bar Q$. Employing  the recently advanced EPOS4HQ event generator, which contains these processes,  we show  that they explain the measured $D$$\\bar D$  and $DD$ correlations and how they influence the $p_T$ distributions of open heavy flavor mesons in pp and AA collisions. It turns out that this influence is different for D and B mesons.  \r\n\r\nThese correlations have also an influence on hidden heavy flavour mesons produced in pp collisions. To explore them we present a model of quarkonia formation based on the convolution between the Wigner densities, associated to the quarkonia eigenstates (excited states up to 3S states),  and the Wigner density of  the two-body $Q \\bar Q$  pairs produced those collisions. This model allows to predict quantitatively the rapidity and $p_T$ distribution of ground states and excited states of charmonia as well as of bottomonia in pp collisions. We compare the results with experiments and identify the influence of the correlations. Finally, we  extend the density matrix approach to study the production of $B_c$ mesons and compare our results with experimental data.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mainly produced in hard-scattering processes among partons in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions at the LHC. In heavy-ion collisions, where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state is produced, charm and beauty quarks are produced on a timescale shorter than the medium formation time, being sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the fireball and to the magnetic field produced perpendicularly to the reaction plane in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large angular momentum and initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised, and the quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron during the hadronization process. Experimentally, heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring either the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ of spin-1 bosons (as the D$^{*+}$ meson) or the longitudinal polarization $P_{\\rm z}$ of spin ½ fermions (as the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryon). Measurements in pp collisions provide a crucial baseline to disentangle the amount of charm-hadron polarization induced by the charm-quark polarization inherited from the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of the $\\rho_{00}$ parameter of D$^{*+}$ meson in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=5.02~$TeV, exploiting the data sample collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the LHC Run 2, is shown.

In this case, the measurements are performed also for charm hadrons originating from b-hadron decays, for which the helicity conservation in weak decays should imply a non-zero polarization of the produced charm hadrons.",

      "Abstract": "Due to their large mass, beauty quarks are always produced in hard-scattering processes, and hence their production can be computed with perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. The production cross section of beauty hadrons can be theoretically described with the factorisation approach as a convolution of the parton distribution functions of the incoming projectiles, the perturbative partonic cross section, and the fragmentation functions describing the transition from quarks to hadrons. Measurements of the production cross section of beauty hadrons in proton–proton (pp) collisions are therefore excellent tests of pQCD calculations.

      "Abstract": "Recent observations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have revealed a significant enhancement in baryon production in hadronic collisions compared to e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, challenging the long-held assumption of fragmentation universality. This phenomenon, initially observed in the charm sector, has also been observed in the beauty sector, indicating a broader implication for heavy-flavor hadronization processes. This observation has led to the development of several models attempting to explain these observations, by implementing modified hadronization approaches with respect to the in-vacuum fragmentation process. Proposed mechanisms include color reconnection beyond leading-color approximation, hadronisation via coalescence, and feed-down from unobserved resonant states in a statistical hadronization approach.\r\n\r\nTo further elucidate this phenomenon, recent studies have focused on baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of event multiplicity. Intriguingly, evidence of a multiplicity dependence, with increased ratios in high-multiplicity events, has been observed in both the charm and beauty sectors, suggesting a possible connection between baryon enhancement and the local parton density. These investigations have significant implications also for heavy-ion physics, potentially bridging the gap between phenomena observed in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive understanding of these effects is essential for refining our theoretical models of heavy-quark hadronisation in hadronic environments.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, new ALICE measurements of prompt and non-prompt $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$-baryon and ${\\rm D}^0$-meson production cross sections, evaluated on the dataset of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3, will be reported.

We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy [1]. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$).

Compared to previous lattice calculations with unphysical light quark masses, we consider near-physical values and a much wider temperature range. Our results for the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient near the crossover temperature are considerably smaller than the estimates obtained by comparing phenomenological models with experimental data and by T-matrix calculations, and are close to the AdS/CFT limit. At high temperatures, however, the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient increases and approaches the NLO weak coupling prediction within the estimated errors. We also find that the dependence of the spatial heavy quark diffusion coefficient on the heavy quark mass $M_Q$ on the lattice is weaker compared to the model calculations.",

In this talk, I will derive the dissipative, out-of-equilibrium contributions to spin polarization at first order in gradients using the Zubarev method for spin hydrodynamics. I will prove that the thermal shear can not give rise to dissipative corrections to spin polarization.

Additionally, anisotropic flow can produce local vorticities in both in-plane (z) and out-of-plane (y) directions, leading to local polarization. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program, including the Fixed-Target (FXT) mode at STAR, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hyperon ($\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$,  $\\Xi^{\\pm}$, $\\Omega^{\\pm}$) global polarization over a wide range of baryon chemical potential. This study probes the vortical characteristics of the medium and can serve as a tool for exploring the nuclear matter equation of state. Also, the second harmonic of local spin polarization ($P_{2y}$ and $P_{2z}$) for $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ and their difference, are predicted to be a sensitive probe for the spin Hall effect driven by gradients in baryon chemical potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present measurements of the global polarization of $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi^{\\pm}$ and $\\Omega^{\\pm}$ at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ - $27$\\;GeV in BES-II Au+Au collisions, and the global $\\Lambda$ polarization at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0$ - $6.2$\\;GeV in FXT Au+Au collisions.

      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) in heavy-ion collisions probes the topological sector of quantum chromodynamics, where parity and charge-parity symmetries are locally violated. Unlike the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), where the induced dipole moment fluctuates randomly from event to event, the CMW generates an electric quadrupole moment with a same sign for a given net charge state of the system, thus CMW can be observed even when CME is not detected. The CMW leads to charge-dependent elliptic flow ($v_2$) which correlates with charge asymmetry ($A_{ch}$) of the system. \r\nExperimental searches for the CMW, however, face challenges from background contributions related to elliptic flow and nonflow. \r\nThe correlation between triangular flow $v_3$ and $A_{ch}$ will be discussed as a background indicator.\r\nSimilar to the CME search, we use RHIC isobar collisions ($^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}\\rm Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$) at STAR for the CMW search, anticipating a stronger signal in $^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru$ due to its larger magnetic field. \r\nIn addition, we compare with Au+Au to study the system dependence at the top RHIC energy, examining the magnetic field effects from isobar to Au+Au. \r\nThe prerequisite of the CMW is expected to change with collision energy. \r\nWe present the measurement of slope $ r_2$ of $v_2$ vs. $A_{ch}$ correlation in isobar collisions and Au+Au collisions with BES-II data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 19, 27 and 200 GeV.\r\nWe use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions. \r\nWe will also explore the feasibility of the event-shape selection scheme to subtract the flow-related background in CMW search.",

      "Speaker": "Enrico Speranza",
      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of spin-polarization effects in heavy-ion collisions. Most approaches assume that final-state particles become polarized only if the thermal vorticity and shear are non-zero at freeze-out. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different polarization mechanism. For the first time, spin density is introduced in the initial state in a similar way as one introduces energy density. We argue that the collision of two nuclei, which occurs among participant nucleons carrying spin, deposits in the transverse plane a spin density that polarizes the produced QCD fireball along some random direction. If the subsequent evolution (e.g., kinetic or hydrodynamic) of the fireball does not alter this effect, the spins of the particles emitted at freeze-out will be polarized along the same direction. Using a simple model, we estimate that the polarization induced by initial-state fluctuations is on the order of 1% in central collisions, increasing to over 10% in noncentral collisions. At high energies, it is thus much larger than the polarization due to event-by-event fluctuations of the thermal vorticity. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable able to reveal net-spin fluctuations in the initial states, for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons. This new effect depends little on beam energy and could be promptly studied at both the LHC and RHIC. Finally, besides introducing new tools to probe spin effects in nuclear collisions, this work provides a framework to define spin initial conditions suitable for extensions of hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom.",

These effects have been actively studied by several experiments for over a decade as they could shed light on the topological structure of vacuum gauge fields and reveal potential local violations of P and/or CP symmetries in strong interactions. Although recent developments have shown that the signals are small, various underlying mechanisms remain unclear, including the quark flavor dependence and its contributions to both the signal and the background.\r\nIn this talk, we extend the ALICE measurements of charge-dependent two particle correlations from inclusive hadrons to identified hadrons (pions, kaons, and protons) in Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV. Together with previous results of Λ–proton correlations aimed at searching for the CVE, we discuss several possible background mechanisms, including local charge conservation, coalescence, and flow.

      "Abstract": "Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of particles of interest (POI's). Event-shape engineering (ESE) [1] and event-shape selection (ESS) [2] are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\\Delta\\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. The former groups events according to the elliptic anisotropy vector $\\vec{q}_2$ of particles in phase space different from that of POI's, thus to the dynamical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$, whereas the latter groups events according to $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$ of pairs of POI's themselves, thus to the statistical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$. In this talk, we conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations [3]. \r\nIt is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept, because of the limited dynamical fluctuation range of $v_2$ than that of  statistical fluctuations.\r\nIt is found that the ESE method can faithfully probe the CME when the $\\vec{q}_2$ phase space is distanced from the POI's, while nonflow effect cannot be neglected when the $\\vec{q}_2$ and POI's phase spaces are close. The ESS method, on the other hand, is obscured because of the intertwining $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$, $v_2$, and $\\Delta\\gamma$, all of which are computed from the same POI's. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the  event content, such as the relative mixtures of background-contributing sources, and thus is not a robust measure of the CME.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

In this work, we designed a simple parametric model for the equation of state and the bulk viscosity that satisfies all the thermodynamics (causality and stability) and observational constraints from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. This parametric model explicitly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters and is ideal for studying their effects on equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties.

The thermodynamics of this rigidly rotating system induces, kinematically, an infinite local temperature state at the light cylinder, where the velocity of the system equals the speed of light. We show that the infinite-temperature cylinder serves as a barrier (literally, a ``firewall'') characterized by emerging boundary conditions that protect the system from artifacts of superluminal motion outside of the cylinder. In particular, the local (differential) formulation of the gap equation naturally imposes that chiral symmetry is always restored at the light-cylinder. As a consequence, the rigidly rotating system cannot host a single chirally broken phase in the whole space. On the contrary, the system in a thermodynamic ground state resides in a mixed phase that comprises dynamically broken and dynamically restored phases located at different distances from the rotation axis. The existence of such mixed inhomogeneous phases is demonstrated explicitly.",

      "Abstract": "One of the main physics goals of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC is to study the QCD phase diagram, especially around the phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and  hadronic matter. BES Phase-I studied Au+Au collisions from center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm{NN}}}} $) of 7.7 to 62.4 GeV. BES Phase-II extended these measurements in several important ways, one of which was the addition of a fixed-target program that pushed the collision energy down to 3.0  GeV  (or baryon chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\rm{B}},$ up to  720 MeV). \r\n\r\nFixed-target (FXT) collisions at STAR allow for a more extensive scanning of the QCD phase diagram to an important region where the QCD critical point may lie, and to a region dominated by dense baryonic matter. One key measurement in both FXT and collider modes is the spectrum of the light hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}, \\ \\rm{K^{\\pm}}$, p$(\\bar{p})$) as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity, and collision centrality. Such measurements enable the empirical determination of the colliding system's location on the phase diagram at chemical freeze-out. Moreover, certain observables involving the production of hadrons have been proposed as a signature of a first order phase transition between hadronic matter and QGP. Specifically, studying the rapidity density distribution ($dN/dy$) of protons as a function of center-of-mass energy has been suggested as a way to probe the nature of the QCD phase transition from hadron gas to QGP. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, the transverse momentum spectra and rapidity density distributions of pions, kaons, and (anti-)protons are presented in an energy range of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm{NN}}}} = 3.2 - 27$ GeV, which includes measurements from both FXT and collider configurations. Implications of these measurements on the QCD phase diagram are then discussed.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "It is known from earlier studies that the hadronic interaction affects the measured yield of short lived resonance e.g. $K^{*0}$.  Recent studies [1] show that the directed flow ($v_{1}$) of $K^{*0}$ is strongly affected during the hadronic stage due to asymmetric loss in different sides of the $p_{x}$ axis in momentum space caused by the tilted fireball and density dependent rescattering. Therefore the $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ can be a good probe to study the late-stage hadronic interaction and provide more information (e.g rescattering affected by variations in matter density across phase-space) compared to the yield measurement integrated over full azimuth and rapidity. \r\n\r\nWe present the first measurement of directed flow of $K^{*0}$ resonances in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV. Centrality-dependent difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $K^{*0}$ resonances will be presented.  The difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $\\phi$  mesons will be also shown. The results will be compared with a hydrodynamic model that incorporates a hadronic afterburner [1].  The measured $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ resonances can provide more insights into hadronic rescattering and regeneration processes in heavy-ion collisions and can constrain transport-based models of QCD matter.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

      "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, research has shown that various observables measured in heavy-ion collisions can be effectively described using relativistic fluid dynamics across different collision systems and energies. However, a common challenge in these studies is the modeling of the transition from the initial state to the fluid-dynamic phase. While the collision likely involves complex, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is possible that a second-order fluid theory can adequately capture its softer features. If successfully completed, this approach could lead to a comprehensive dynamical description of a heavy-ion collision, where the only free parameters are related to the thermodynamics and the transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.\r\nIn our work (arXiv:2410.08169), we investigate this possibility. We discuss how to characterize the state prior to the collision within this framework, the implications of relativistic causality on the equations of motion, the entropy production from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how this can inform sensible initial conditions for subsequent transverse expansion.",

To meet the challenges of HL-LHC, the CMS experiment is undergoing significant Phase-2 upgrades, including the MIP Timing Detector (MTD), which provides 30 ps timing resolution for minimum ionizing particles (MIPs). With its large pseudorapidity coverage up to $|\\eta|<3$, the MTD enables particle identification (PID) via time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, offering new opportunities for probing QCD matter. Coupled with an upgraded wide-acceptance tracker ($|\\eta|<4$) and high-granularity calorimetry ($|\\eta|<5$), these upgrades will allow for more detailed investigations of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the (3+1)-dimensional evolution of heavy flavor quark dynamics and particle composition inside jets over a wide angular range. Additionally, the improved detector capabilities will significantly expand opportunities in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), enabling precise measurements of photon-induced processes, which are crucial for studying the gluonic structure of nuclei. This talk will discuss new physics opportunities enabled by the Phase-2 upgrades covering a wide range of topics.

Track pointing resolution of better than 10 micron for $p_{\\rm T} > 200$ MeV/$c$ can be achieved by placing the vertex detector on a retractable structure inside the beam pipe. ALICE 3 will, on the one hand, enable novel studies of the quark-gluon plasma and, on the other hand, open up important physics opportunities in other areas of QCD and beyond. The main new studies in the QGP sector focus on low-$p_{\\rm T}$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons and charm-charm correlations, as as well as on precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission to probe the mechanism of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of the QGP temperature. Besides QGP studies, ALICE 3 can uniquely contribute to hadronic physics, with femtoscopic studies of the interaction potentials between charm mesons and searches for nuclei with charm, and to fundamental physics, with tests of the Low theorem for ultra-soft photon emission.

      "Abstract": "Spin hydrodynamics is the extension of standard relativistic hydrodynamics with the total angular momentum considered as an independent conserved charge, where the total angular momentum is often expressed as a surface integral of a rank-3 tensor.\r\nThis rank-3 tensor is then decomposed into orbital and spin parts, which, by using the definition of orbital angular momentum in Cartesian coordinates and the energy-momentum tensor conservation, leads to the equation of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nThis treatment is not covariant under coordinate transformations, even in flat spacetime.\r\nWe address this issue by redefining the orbital and total angular momentum in a covariant way, which can also be extended to curved spacetime in cases where the Belinfante and Hilbert definitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent.\r\nThen, we review the constitutive equations of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics developed from a systematic expansion in the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\r\nThis formulation is inspired by, but not necessarily based on, quantum kinetic theory.\r\nUp to the first order in $\\hbar$, there is no back-reaction from the spin sector to fluid dynamics, and, therefore, solutions to standard hydrodynamics act as an input for the equations of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nWe consider three simple solutions to the fluid’s equation of motion: hydrostatic, linearized hydrodynamics, and conformal Bjorken flow.\r\nWe demonstrate that, up to first-order in $\\hbar$, the spin waves are not affected by the fluid waves, and therefore, the results from the hydrostatic case and linearized hydrodynamics are the same.\r\nThis shows that our results for the damping of spin waves are not modified by slight fluid perturbations.\r\nFor the case of conformal Bjorken flow, we first review the consequences of conformal invariance in spin hydrodynamics and, in particular, show that conformal invariance should be considered only in the limit where $\\hbar$ vanishes.\r\nThen, we use the attractor solution to find the evolution of the spin potential.\r\nWe show that the spin potential in this nonlinear regime is damped in a similar fashion to the linear regime.\r\nThese results strengthen our previous findings on the possible long equilibration time for spin, and support a dynamical treatment of spin degrees of freedom.",

      "Abstract": "In the past years, different observables related to the spin polarization of hadrons such as $\\Lambda$-Baryons have attracted much attention and continue to find new applications. \r\nWhile some measurements (such as the global polarization) are straightforwardly reproduced by assuming the spins of the particles to be in equilibrium, the explanation of more differential observables (such as the local polarization) remains a subject of active discussion.\r\n\r\nA crucial ingredient in a more thorough description of spin dynamics is a formulation of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that accounts for the finite (and possibly long [1]) timescale of spin relaxation, i.e., of the approach of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$ to the thermal vorticity $\\varpi^{\\mu\\nu}$. In such a theory, the spin potential remains a dynamical quantity that follows certain evolution equations, akin to the Bloch equations for the magnetization in the (nonrelativistic) description of spin dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe main result to be presented are the equations of motion for such a theory, derived from first principles based on quantum kinetic theory [2]. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach [3], a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. \r\nIt is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor $\\mathfrak{t}^{\\mu\\nu}$.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The unexpected pattern of global spin alignment of vector mesons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for different particle species have posed a strong challenge to theoretical interpretation, as it cannot be explained solely through conventional polarization sources such as vorticity and electromagnetic fields. We argue that fluctuations of strong-force fields with short correlation length may be the key to solve the puzzle. We derive a relativistic spin Boltzmann equation for vector mesons from Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporating an effective quark-meson model for interaction and the quark coalescence process for hadronization. Our calculations of the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ for unflavored vector mesons reveal that all field contributions appear in squared terms. This finding indicates that anisotropies in local field correlations, relative to the spin quantization axis, lead to the spin alignment of unflavored vector mesons. We propose that the large spin alignment observed for $\\phi$ mesons at lower energies arises from effective $\\phi$ fields that  polarize the strange quarks and antiquarks, which in turn form polarized $\\phi$ mesons via coalescence during the hadronization stage.  The strength of the $\\phi$ field can be inferred from the experimental data on $\\phi$-meson spin alignment as functions of collision energy reported by STAR Collaboration. Our findings show a transverse momentum dependence of $\\rho_{00}$ in fair agreement with STAR data, and we also predict the azimuthal angle dependence of $\\rho_{00}$. The proposed polarization mechanism driven by fluctuating strong-force fields may open a new window into a hitherto unknown behaviour of QCD interaction.\r\n[X.-L. Sheng, L. Oliva, Z.-T. Liang, Q.

As heavy-ion collision physics enters a high-precision era, theoretical modeling needs to evolve to meet growing computational demands.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we introduce DiffHIC, a generative diffusion model designed to bridge this gap. The model simulates ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end, taking initial entropy density profiles as input and producding two-dimensional final particle spectra. By comparing observables derived from particle spectra generated by both traditional numerical simulations and our trained generative model, we demonstrate that DiffHIC not only accurately replicates integrated and differential observables but also effectively captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These results indicate that DiffHIC successfully learns the intricate mapping from initial entropy density profiles to final particle spectra, governed by a set of nonlinear hydrodynamic and Boltzmann transport equations. While preserving the fine  details of the underlying physical processes, DiffHIC significantly accelerates end-to-end heavy-ion collision simulations. For example, DiffHIC can simulate a single central collision event in just 0.1 seconds on a GeForce GTX 4090 GPU.\r\n \r\nThe code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.\r\n \r\n \r\n[1]arxiv:2410.13069",

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the transverse momentum broadening coefficient, $\\hat{q}$ plays an integral role in characterising how a high-energy parton loses energy to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it passes. Over the last few years, it has been shown [1,2] that $\\hat{q}$ starts to receive radiative corrections at $\\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, featuring potentially large logarithms. Indeed, better understanding the nature of these logarithmic corrections is extremely relevant for the goal of obtaining a precise theoretical description of parton energy loss.\r\nDuring this talk, I will begin by presenting our results from [3], where we investigate how the inclusion of thermal effects impacts these radiative corrections. I will then report on our progress in understanding how the logarithmic phase space is deformed, once one relaxes the so-called harmonic oscillator approximation. In this direction, we make use of the improved opacity expansion [4], which has recently found success in analytically describing, at leading order, the interface of the single and multiple-scattering regimes.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] T.Liou, A.Mueller, B.Wu, arxiv:1304.7677\r\n[2] J.P.Blaizot, F.Dominguez, E.Iancu, Y.Mehtar-Tani, arxiv: 1311.5823\r\n[3] J.Ghiglieri, E.Weitz, arxiv: 2207.08842\r\n[4]J.Barata, Y.Mehtar-Tani, A.Soto-Ontoso, K.Tywoniuk, arxiv: 2106.07402",

      "Abstract": "Intermediate to low energy heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to the finite temperature ($T$), high baryon number density ($n_B$) QCD equation of state (EoS) at a ratio between charged and total number of baryons that is fixed by the colliding species. For typical nuclei used in collisions, like gold and lead, this ratio, also known as the charge fraction ($Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$), is around 0.4. On the other hand, studies of isolated neutron stars and the dynamics of their birth and mergers require $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ as low as 0.01. We propose a new finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter EoS [1] that can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point observations of isolated neutron stars and nuclear experiments. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data from low to intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. With our new method, we can separately quantify the uncertainty in the $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ and finite $T$ components of the EoS without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We check the accuracy of our framework using a microscopic equation of state up to T = 100 MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B \\geq$ 1100 MeV (∼ 1 − 2 $n_{\\rm sat}$) and find that the error introduced is less than 5%, with even better results for larger $\\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

We discuss that the model calculations with the $\\Lambda$ potential are consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1] and the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2].\r\n\r\nA unified approach integrating heavy-ion collisions, other nuclear experiments, and neutron stars with the modern nuclear force from chiral EFT has provided valuable insights into the properties of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter (e.g. Ref. [3]). This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of both nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. For a microscopic description of dense matter, such an approach must be performed also for the hyperon sector. A precise understanding of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter is essential for addressing the long-standing hyperon puzzle of neutron star physics. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we consider the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2] at RHIC-BES energies to verify the $\\Lambda$ potential based on chiral EFT [4]. This potential is sufficiently repulsive at high densities to solve the hyperon puzzle and has proven by us to be consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1]. We employ a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) implemented into the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2. We show that the model with the $\\Lambda$ potential from chiral EFT can reproduce the experimental data [2], while a more attractive $\\Lambda$ potential also reproduces the data.

      "Abstract": "We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\\mu = 2.6~\\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\\Delta$ of $457~\\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and \r\n$216~\\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions. This constraint may be strengthened by future astrophysical measurements as well as by future advances in high density QCD calculations.",

      "Abstract": "We generalize the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory recently derived in Ref. [1] to describe the dissipative dynamics occurring in accretion disks in presence of large magnetic fields. For this purpose we consider a relativistic dilute gas composed of electrons and ions described by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and simplify it using the 14-moment approximation. This procedure leads to an extended version of the MHD theory traditionally employed in astrophysics simulations [2,3] which typically considers only the parallel component of the shear-stress tensor aligned with magnetic field, B. In our framework, we consider all three distinct, non-degenerate components of the shear-stress tensor relative to B, each governed by unique dynamical equations. We demonstrate that this novel framework exhibits oscillatory behavior in strong magnetic fields that cannot be captured by the conventional MHD formulation, similar to what was observed in Ref. [1]. We finally compare both frameworks in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In particular, we analyze the equations in conditions that lead to firehose instability [4], which is usually observed in simulation-based frameworks. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] K.

However, the exact mechanisms behind jet quenching are not yet fully understood, particularly the relative contributions from medium response and medium-induced radiation, which are difficult to disentangle. Moreover, the momentum dependence of the medium response signal, especially across a range of parton momenta, remains largely unexplored. In this presentation, we utilize high-momentum partons produced over a wide range of parton momentum in lead-lead collisions, to probe the QGP created in heavy ion collisions. By studying the underlying event in the opposite direction of the high-momentum parton, we can gain deeper insights into the QGP's response to hard probes. We present the first measurement of low-momentum hadron spectra over a wide acceptance with respect to the high-momentum parton direction, using lead-lead data recorded by the CMS detector at 5.02 TeV. This new result provides a clear signal of the correlation between medium-recoil and jet axis as well as the parton momentum.

Studies of the system size dependence of various observables also shed light on the role of initial conditions, such as the nuclear-overlap size and shape, nuclear modification of parton distribution functions, etc.  In this talk, we present recently finalized PHENIX measurements of the production of $\\phi$-mesons and identified charged hadrons in $p$+Al and $p/d/^3$He/Cu+Au at 200 GeV and U+U collisions at 193 GeV. The tests of various empirical scalings and comparisons to previous measurements of light hadron production to different model calculations are discussed.",

Measuring their properties and production provides insights into the force that binds strange hadrons to ordinary nucleons, which is poorly known. Additionally, measuring hypernuclei production in high-energy hadronic collisions offers a critical test for nucleosynthesis models, such as statistical hadronization and coalescence approaches. The difference between these two models is expected to be significant in pp and p–Pb collisions, as the wave function radii of the hypernuclei are larger than the size of the colliding systems. Therefore, the system size is crucial in yield determination within the two pictures. This contribution presents the new results on A=3 and A=4 hypernuclei measured in pp collisions collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 3. The results are consistent with the expectations from state-of-the-art coalescence models, warranting the comparison with measurements of heavier states.

      "Abstract": "Machine learning models have previously been utilized to address the challenge of subtracting combinatorial backgrounds from jets in heavy-ion collisions, with most earlier efforts focusing on supervised regression models. In this talk, we introduce the first self-supervised application of a generative AI model for jet background subtraction. We utilize UVCGAN [1], a Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN), to perform unpaired translations of full detector calorimeter data between heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions. This approach effectively isolates jets from combinatorial backgrounds in heavy-ion collisions while preserving both global jet kinematics and jet substructure.\r\nAdditionally, we present the effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as AI-based generative surrogate models for full-detector, whole-event, and high-fidelity simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments [2]. Trained on HIJING minimum-bias data simulated with Geant4 in the sPHENIX geometry, DDPMs achieve speedups of approximately 100 times over Geant4 simulations. This allows for the rapid generation of large datasets for applications requiring high statistics heavy ion simulation, such as the background events for jet embedding. Both methods were trained and benchmarked with simulated sPHENIX data, which will be discussed in this talk.\r\n \r\n[1] D.

      "Abstract": "Jet substructure measurements at the LHC produce precision tests of jet formation and fragmentation in vacuum as well as at the high temperatures and densities formed in heavy-ion collisions. Jets containing a heavy-flavor hadron drive these QCD measurements into a regime where parton mass and colour factors are critical, pushing the limits of theoretical calculations both in-vacuum and in-medium. Mapping out individual emissions in the Lund jet plane for heavy-flavour jets and comparing to light-quark-enriched jets tagged by a Z boson reveals significant mass-dependence to jet fragmentation, offering a decisive channel to decipher in-medium modification to jet fragmentation across different kinematics. At the same time, measuring heavy-flavour jet mass with a theoretically-safe flavour tagging algorithm for the first time tests perturbative QCD at unprecedented theoretical precision and probes the gluon splitting contribution to heavy-flavour production, a yet-unobserved probe of how the medium resolves quark entanglement. The LHCb collaboration presents recent jet substructure results at forward rapidity in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. These measurements are compared to theoretical predictions, providing new insight on QCD fragmentation at forward rapidity and at low and moderate values of jet transverse momentum.

      "Abstract": "The nonperturbative process of hadronization has recently been the subject of intense experimental investigation at the LHC. Since heavy quark production is suppressed at the hadronization scale, heavy-flavour hadrons offer an insightful probe into this effect, connecting perturbative parton-level calculations with experimental final states. Jets produced in conjunction with heavy hadrons offer additional information about hadronic formation at various mass scales and how hadronization depends on the partonic final states. In particular, recent measurements of in-jet quarkonium production suggest significant parton shower production, where gluons split into heavy quark-antiquark pairs. This further complicates the interpretation of charmonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions as evidence of QGP formation. Jet substructure can also be used to probe the formation of exotic hadrons, whose structure is still not well understood. This talk presents recent studies of hadronization using heavy-flavour jets with the LHCb detector, including inclusive hadron production in heavy-flavor jets, as well as quarkonium and tetraquark production in jets.\r\nResults are compared to various models of hadronization, providing strong new constraints on theoretical predictions, and offering insight into interpretations of future measurements in PbPb collisions.",

The study of strange hadrons across various collision systems and sizes has received renewed interest, particularly in understanding hadronization models. Systematic studies of baryons with varying strangeness content has served to distinguish cold nuclear matter effects from those associated with the quark–gluon plasma. Photoproduction of strangeness on proton targets has been studied at HERA, including measurements of non-diffractive $\\rm \\rho^{0}$(770), $\\rm K^{∗}$(892), and φ(1020) mesons at an average photon-proton center-of-mass energy of 210 GeV. By analyzing data from inelastic photonuclear reactions in Run 3, ALICE can probe even higher energies with nuclear targets and thereby provide new constraints on cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-ion collisions. In this talk, we will present the first studies on the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of strange hadrons in inelastic photonuclear interactions.

From a theoretical point of view, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by the available theoretical models. In this context, quarkonium polarization measurements represent a powerful tool to discriminate among the different theoretical predictions. In particular, the study of the anisotropies in the angular distribution of the decay production with respect to a given quantization axis is sensitive to the quarkonium hadronization mechanism, even if the very small values measured at the LHC have been challenging the commonly-used theoretical models. Moreover,  the possibility to investigate effects related to the formation of a strongly interacting medium in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions requires a precise determination of the proton-proton reference cross section and polarization.

Charmonia states, which are bound states of charm and anti-charm quarks, are produced via a process that can be factorized into two distinct stages: the generation of heavy quarks, followed by the formation of the bound state. The initial stage, governed by hard parton-parton scatterings at substantial momentum transfer, is effectively described by perturbative QCD. In contrast, the second stage, which involves large spatial separations and low momentum scales, is intrinsically non-perturbative. Precise measurements of quarkonium production cross sections in pp collisions are essential for enhancing the understanding of charmonium production mechanisms and for testing various theoretical models. Moreover, these measurements provide fundamental benchmarks for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and for evaluating cold nuclear matter effects in proton-nucleus collisions.

      "Abstract": "In high-energy hadron-hadron collisions at the LHC, Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI), where multiple hard-parton scatterings occur in a single collision, play a significant role. Among these, Double Parton Scattering (DPS) represents the simplest case, where two independent scatterings take place simultaneously. The DPS contribution to processes involving two final states, A and B, can be described as the product of the cross-sections for the independent production of A and B, divided by an effective cross section. This effective cross section is a phenomenological parameter linked to the transverse spatial overlap between partons in the proton. Studying DPS helps to improve our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), particularly in the context of multi-parton distribution functions and potential correlations in parton color and spin. Heavy quark production arises from hard-parton scatterings due to their significant masses, making these processes ideal for studying DPS. One way to explore DPS is by measuring the production cross sections of charm-hadron pairs. In this contribution, we present the latest results on the production of charm-hadron and quarkonium pairs, specifically $\\rm{D}^{0}\\rm{D}^{0}$, $\\rm{D}^{0}\\rm{J}/\\psi$, and $\\rm{J}/\\psi\\rm{J}/\\psi$, at midrapidity and forward rapidity in proton-proton (pp) collisions.

Exploration of this phenomenon is most controlled in the heavy-flavour sector, where the large mass of charm or beauty quarks allows us to experimentally relate a heavy-flavour parton to the resulting hadron. This allows for well defined measurements of heavy-flavour jet fragmentation, enabling us to take steps beyond the traditional hadronic measurements in order to unveil the microscopic details of this non-universality. In this talk we present the first measurement of the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets carried by the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons, as a function of both the jet and event multiplicities in pp collisions. We also present corresponding first measurements of these quantities for jets containing $\\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons, where comparisons to the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets test the impact of local colour density on the modification of the baryon fragmentation functions. Using the new high statistics Run 3 data sample will allow for differential measurements not only in multiplicity, but also in jet transverse momentum, probing the partonic scales at which non-universal behaviour emerges. Additionally, we report the first measurements of the energy energy correlators (EECs) of jets containing $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons compared to those containing $\\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons. The power of the EECs lies in separating the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes in the evolution of partons and provide a discriminating ingredient with which to pinpoint the scale at which the non-universality arises.",

This smooth evolution connects different collision systems almost independently of the collision energy. This extends to the strangeness sector, where the enhanced production of strange hadrons in high-multiplicity pp events is reminiscent of heavy-ion phenomenology in the case of quark-gluon plasma formation. With the wealth of data collected in Run 2 and Run 3 with the ALICE experiment, it is possible to bridge the gap in multiplicity between small and large systems, exploring for the first time the systems size dependence of light-flavour particle production at the same multiplicity values for pp and AA. This contribution presents new results on the production of light flavour hadrons in pp collisions up to a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions up to an energy of 5.36 TeV. A dedicated high multiplicity trigger is used in pp collisions to reach values up to those of peripheral Pb–Pb collisions. At the same time, exploiting the large statistics sample of Pb-Pb collisions collected in Run 3, the production of (multi-)strange hadrons is studied in low-multiplicity heavy-ion collisions, accessing for the first time with good sensitivity peripheral collision events. Moreover, for the first time at the LHC, the system size dependence is explored down to values smaller than in pp collisions using ultra-peripheral $\\gamma$--Pb reactions. The system size dependence in light-flavour production is probed from the smallest system ($\\gamma$--Pb) to the largest one (Pb--Pb) at the LHC, enabling testing the statistical hadronization picture at its limits. This contribution will present new light-flavour hadron measurements covering three orders of magnitude in multiplicity.

      "Abstract": "The ALICE Collaboration observed that the production of light-flavoured hadrons relative to pions increases with the charged-particle multiplicity evolving smoothly across interaction systems and energies, from pp collisions to nucleus-nucleus collisions. Notably, this observation extends to the strange hadron sector, where an enhanced production in heavy-ion collisions with respect to minimum bias pp collisions is expected in the case of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. Concurrent models attempt to explain such an increase. Some invoke the thermalisation of the system with a gradual release of the local conservation of the quantum charges; others describe the microscopic mechanism of hadronisation. In both cases, models are asking experiments to disentangle the effect of local and global properties of the system with more differential measurements. This contribution presents new results on the production of light-flavour hadrons using the pp data samples collected by ALICE during LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Strange particle production is correlated to global properties of the event exploiting the concept of effective available energy, estimated through the anti-correlated energy deposited in the ALICE Zero Degree Calorimeters. The production of (multi-)strange hadrons is further correlated to local properties of the collision, exploring the association with the production inside of jets and in the underlying event as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. This can be done using event shape observables such as spherocity or exploiting a full jet reconstruction. Both cases will be discussed in this contribution, presenting new results. Additionally, the production of strange hadrons is further studied by exploiting a new event classifier based on the charged particle flattenicity, which proves to be more sensitive to multiple parton interactions (MPI) while being less sensitive to final-state hard processes compared to traditional event shape methods. All the results are discussed in light of predictions from QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In proton-proton (pp) collisions, the ratio of strange to non-strange hadron yields is observed to increase smoothly with the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the event. In high multiplicity pp collisions, such ratios are comparable to those measured in Pb–Pb interactions at similar multiplicities. The microscopic origin of this phenomenon in pp collisions has yet to be understood. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between the EPOS4 model, based on core-corona separation between a vacuum phase and a thermalised QGP phase with global strangeness conservation, and the PYTHIA 8.3 implementation, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally. In particular, correlations between a ϕ meson and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be excellent discriminators between the two types of models. This contribution presents the first measurement of such correlated production as a function of the event multiplicity in $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV pp collisions collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the Run 3 of the LHC. Results are compared with predictions from the EPOS4 and PYTHIA 8.3 models with improved hadronisation mechanisms (Rope hadronisation and Close Packing), as well as with predictions from the thermal statistical model.",

      "Abstract": "The anisotropic flow of identified hadrons is sensitive to the early dynamics of heavy-ion collisions and to the equation of state (EoS) of the medium. In particular, strange and (multi-)strange baryons have small hadronic cross-sections, thus being clean probes of the early stages of the collision system evolution. As such, they constitute the perfect observable to test the hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball. Additionally, strange and multi-strange baryons are sensitive to the vorticity of the produced medium and to the magnetic field that it experiences at collision time. The effect of vorticity and magnetic field can be examined experimentally by studying the polarization of strange and (multi-)strange baryons. This talk will present the $v_2$ and the longitudinal polarization of strange baryons measured with the high statistics sample of Pb–Pb collisions collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the Run 3 of the LHC. The measurements will be discussed in comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art QCD-inspired models.",

      "Abstract": "Angular (ΔηΔφ) correlations of identified particles in ultrarelativistic proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions exhibit features dependent on collision systems and particle types. These characteristics stem from mechanisms such as (mini-)jets, elliptic flow, resonance decays, and conservation laws, with quantum statistics and final-state interactions influencing each particle pair’s unique correlation function.\r\nALICE [1] and STAR [2] measurements of ΔηΔφ correlations show distinctions in baryon versus meson production. While meson correlation functions display an expected near-side peak attributed to mini-jet fragmentation, which is well reproduced by general-purpose Monte Carlo (MC) models, baryon-baryon correlations reveal a surprising near-side anti-correlation structure. This effect has not been reproduced by the MC models until recently [3, 4, 5, 6], posing fundamental questions about the production mechanism of baryons.\r\nThis talk presents new insights into this “baryon correlation puzzle”. Using Run 2 data from ALICE, a comprehensive study of multiplicity centrality dependent angular correlation functions for pairs of pions, kaons, and protons in pp, p–Pb, and Pb–Pb collisions, along with new Run 3 results for pp collisions at 13.6 TeV, are provided.

The results track the balancing of electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness by measuring how the widths and integrals of the charge, baryon number, and strangeness balance functions evolve across multiplicity classes. Results from pp collisions provide a reference for the Pb–Pb results, while the evolution with multiplicity allows us to glimpse the behavior toward high multiplicity scenarios in small systems.

The study provides cross section and correlation studies of the double J/psi and D mesons. The results are compared with theories to explain both single $c\\bar{c}$ pair production and DPS cross section in perturbative QCD framework.",

These measurements for electrons and muons are among the most precisely measured quantities in physics. However, due to the short lifetime of the tau lepton, it is impossible to measure its anomalous magnetic moment through traditional methods, such as spin precession measurements. The CMS experiment follows a comprehensive approach to measure this quantity in complementary phase spaces of ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. We will report the latest measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton using ultraperipheral PbPb collisions recorded by the CMS experiment during Run 2. In addition, the luminosity for PbPb running has been measured using the photo-production of muon pairs. This offers the promise of reducing systematic uncertainties on future measurements",

      "Institute": "Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IN)",
      "Country": "India",
      "Abstract": "The interactions between jets and the longitudinal-boosted quark-gluon plasma (QGP) lead to softer particles drifting away from the jet core, where high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles remain concentrated, resulting in an intra-jet asymmetry. Investigating this asymmetry, particularly at forward rapidities, offers a novel avenue to probe jet-medium dynamics. Using the PbPb and pp data at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV collected by the CMS detector, the near-side jet peak of two-particle correlation functions have been examined to explore jet modifications and novel boost invariance phenomena in forward rapidity. The peak exhibits substantial broadening along the longitudinal ($\\Delta\\eta$) axis from peripheral to central PbPb collisions, indicating energy loss by the progenitor parton. A significant rapidity-dependent asymmetry in associated particle yields has been observed for the first time, with a pronounced difference between $\\Delta\\eta > 0$ and $\\Delta\\eta < 0$ that increases at forward rapidity and in central PbPb collisions. This finding, particularly evident for high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles, points to a potential violation of boost invariance at forward rapidity. Comparisons with different theoretical models will be discussed to understand the influence of jet-medium interactions on jet structure.",

      "Country": "HU",
      "Abstract": "It has been proposed to search for thermal and collective properties arising from parton-fragmentation processes by examining high jet charged-constituent multiplicities ($N_{j,ch}$) in proton-proton (pp) collisions [1]. Initial studies that tested this proposal using the PYTHIA 8 event generator with the Monash tune, incorporating multiparton interactions (MPI) and the MPI-based colour reconnection (CR) model, did not reveal any strangeness enhancement, nor provide conclusive evidence for the presence of radial flow. In this contribution, we expand upon the proposed Monte Carlo study by eliminating selection biases associated with triggering on charged particle multiplicities. We disable MPI to focus exclusively on jet fragments. We analyse pp collisions at √s=13 TeV simulated with PYTHIA 8, exploring different implementations of the generator: thermodynamical string fragmentation and the standard Lund fragmentation model, considering various CR models. Surprisingly, the thermodynamical string fragmentation model predicts a hint of strangeness enhancement in jets. Additionally, the light-flavor baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of $j_T$ exhibit similarities across all PYTHIA 8 implementations, and hint at radial flow-like effects. In contrast, the ratio of heavy-flavor hadrons (Λ$^+_c$/D$^0$) at low $j_T$ as a function of $N_{j,ch}$ shows a similar trend to that observed as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in soft data, suggesting that colour string junctions may play an important role in jet development [2].\r\n\r\n[1] A.

      "Abstract": "Momentum transport in a medium is characterized quantitatively by its shear and bulk viscosities. The shear viscous coefficient ($\\eta$) governs the momentum transport transverse to the hydrodynamic flow while its bulk counterpart ($\\zeta$) does the same along the flow. In the context of quark gluon plasma (QGP), both $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ are very important transport coefficients, controlling phenomenologically important quantities such as the QGP thermalization time, sound attenuation length, elliptic flow, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that large initial magnetic fields (which subsequently decay) are produced in the heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, which have been shown to influence the evolution of the QGP medium. However, most studies in the literature are made with the assumption of a constant magnetic field.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation type collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time and conversely decrease with the strength of the magnetic field.  To connect these observations with the experiment we have obtained the thermalization time, the sound attenuation length and other various phenomenologically significant quantities, using our results of $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$.",

The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the core tracking detector of CBM, tasked with achieving high-precision measurements of particle tracks and momentum. Currently, a prototype system, comprising several detector subsystems, including a scaled version of the STS called mSTS is undergoing extensive testing and data taking in the miniCBM (mCBM) experiment using the existing SIS-18 accelerator of the GSI, Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt. This testing initiative is critical for validating hardware and software in realistic experimental conditions and ensures their performance in online data read-out, processing, and analysis of complex event topologies detected by the mCBM's subsystems.\r\n\r\nWe will present our comprehensive study of data rates achievable with the mSTS detector system, emphasizing results from simulations and experimental runs taken during the year 2024. Using UrQMD-based minimum bias events for Ni-Ni collisions at a beam momentum of 1.93 AGeV/c, we simulate the expected detector performance in a realistic free-streaming readout with an additional beam background simulated with GEANT4. We will present in a poster a comparative analysis of the simulations with data collected during the experimental campaign in 2024. The study will provide insights into the scaling and optimization required for full-scale implementation in CBM.",

Their decay daughters may undergo various in-medium effects, such as rescattering and regeneration. The resonance to non-resonance yield ratio, $K^{*0}$/K, can help shed light on these in-medium effects. Study of the properties of $K^{*0}$ can help us understand the lifetime and particle interactions during the hadronic phase.\r\n\r\n  In this poster, we will present measurements of $K^{*0}$ production in Au+Au collisions at  = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR BES-II experiment. The transverse momentum spectra, rapidity densities, and average transverse momentum of $K^{*0}$ will be presented as functions of collision centrality and beam energy.

      "Abstract": "In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction has been recognized as one of the most sensitive probes of the gluon structure in nucleons and nuclei. Recently, STAR published differential measurements on photoproduced J/$\\psi$ in ultra-peripheral d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. These results provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations in both light and heavy nuclei. Compared to d+Au and Au+Au collisions, the collision system size in isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}Ru$ + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}Zr$ + $^{96}_{40}Zr$) lies in between. Therefore, the measurement of coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction in isobaric UPCs offers a unique opportunity to study the system size dependence of gluon evolution.\r\n\r\n In this poster, we present the differential cross sections of photoproduced coherent J/$\\psi$ as a function of rapidity (y) in $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) UPCs at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results will also be shown for different combinations of neutron emission, where neutrons are detected by zero degree calorimeters, which help resolve the photon-gluon emitter ambiguity. More importantly, these data provide crucial constraints on the system size dependence of the gluon structure within nuclei in the kinematic range x$_{parton}$, the momentum fraction carried by the gluon, $\\sim 0.015-0.03 $.

      "Abstract": "Investigating collective behavior due to the formation of a fluid-like medium in small collision systems has been a significant focus in the field. A tell-tale signature of this would be the medium's response to the initial state in small collision systems, as predicted by fluid-dynamic models.\r\n\r\nRecent RHIC studies of small systems have shown a hierarchy of elliptic anisotropy coefficients ($v_2$($^{3}$He+Au) $\\sim$ $v_2$(d+Au) $>$ $v_2$($p$+Au)) suggesting fluid-dynamic behavior even in the smallest systems. This raises the question: could a photo-nuclear collision, such as $\\gamma$+Au also exhibit signatures of collectivity? Notably, signatures of collectivity have been investigated in high-multiplicity, high energy $\\gamma$+$p$/Pb collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nThis poster explores anisotropic flow in $\\gamma$+Au processes at RHIC by triggering ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. At this collision energy, the maximum photon-nucleon center of mass energy $W_{\\gamma N}^{\\rm max}$ $\\approx$ 34.7 GeV [1], an energy between d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19 GeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 GeV, previously performed at RHIC. For both $\\gamma$+Au and d+Au, the exact multiplicity range is accessible at STAR, making d+Au a suitable baseline system for comparison. Furthermore, the STAR detector’s extended rapidity coverage, with mid and forward rapidity upgrades ($|\\eta| < 1.5$ and $2.1 < |\\eta| < 5.1$) enables the triggering and analysis of photo-nuclear processes. Preliminary results will present $v_2$ and $v_3$ in $\\gamma$+Au collisions at multiplicities and energy comparable to those of d+Au, where collectivity has already been observed. These results will provide new insights into collectivity in small collision systems, emphasizing the role of initial-state effects and collective behavior in understanding the evolution of the fluid-like medium created in various collision systems at RHIC. \r\n\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] A.J.

      "Abstract": "A new observable, ST , is introduced in terms of the sum of the transverse momentum of charged particles (Sum pT i ) produced in proton proton (p−p) collisions at LHC energies to probe the underlying events (UE). The UE are defined as those aspects of p−p collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest\r\nof the proton. The conventional approach of studying underlying events is usually carried out by defining topological regions with respect to the leading particle in an event. The transverse region\r\nis generally sensitive to UE and various classifiers have been used to discriminate the extent of UE activity regions. The production of identified particles like π±, K±, p, K0S , and Λ0 are studied\r\nin different ranges of transverse activity classifier in p−p collisions at √s = 13 TeV using pQCD inspired PYTHIA 8 event generator. A comparative analysis of the identified particle spectra, mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum has been carried out with respect to ST and the performance of this new observable is gauged by comparing the results with previously defined RT\r\nobservable",

Using calorimetric jets constructed from the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the hadronic being first of its kind at midrapidity at RHIC, we can study the jet's structure to learn more about the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced during heavy ion collisions. This poster will outline the method used to construct purely calorimetric jets from underlying event subtracted calorimeter towers, by first clustering calorimeter towers into anti-kT R = 0.2 “constituent” jets and then clustering the constituent jets into larger R jets for substructure study. We will show the performance on a set of simulated Pythia8 simulations and present the status of the analysis of the p+p collisions dataset recently collected by sPHENIX in Run-24.",

Study of the interference in peripheral collisions provides novel information on the impact parameter dependence, the entanglement criteria, and wavefunction decoherence. On one hand, the medium created in such collisions can act as a semi-opaque screen and decohere or weaken the interference effect. On the other hand, the interference is expected to be stronger as the impact parameter decreases.

      "Abstract": "The centrality estimation in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC is typically based on measuring charged-particle multiplicity or zero-degree energy. The former, however, induces a bias on the hardness of the proton-nucleon collisions, resulting in deviations from the binary nucleon-nucleon scaling of hard processes. In contrast, the energy deposited at zero degrees, i.e. at forward rapidities, by slow nucleons is shown to be insensitive to such a multiplicity bias.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, an alternative centrality estimator based on a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, is proposed to study proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision 5.02 TeV using PYTHIA 8 Angantyr. According to studies performed in pp collisions with PYTHIA 8, the flattenicity classifier shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions. It is less affected by selection biases towards larger transverse momenta than the multiplicity-based estimators. The results are compared with those obtained using other centrality estimators based on charged-particle multiplicity, at both mid and forward pseudorapidity. The identified particle production for the different estimators is also presented to explore the effects of multiparton interactions and colour reconnection.",

      "Abstract": "Conservation of energy and momentum leads to interesting signatures in small systems such as $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collisions at the LHC, and $d$-Au collisions at RHIC. For large systems, such as those created in heavy-ion collisions, the production of rare high-$p_T$ probes is a small perturbation. But for small systems, hard probes can both infuse or extract a significant fraction of the energy and momentum from mid to forward rapidities. Depending on the energy and exchanged transverse momentum in the hard process, there may be an excess or a depletion of the energy available for both bulk evolution and other hard/semi-hard processes.\r\nWe investigate correlations between hard probes and bulk dynamics in small systems at LHC energies. We use a multi-stage approach where the hard scatterings are sampled first, followed by an initial state shower, yielding the energy and momenta of the originating hard partons, which are then subtracted from the incoming nucleons. The remaining energy is used for soft-particle production, modeled by 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics. We present results for the nuclear modification factor as a function of event activity, and the collision event activity dependence on the high $p_T$ trigger. Comparisons are presented to data from the ATLAS and ALICE experiments. Our results indicate that hard-soft correlations are crucial to understand the dynamics in small systems. We further demonstrate the lack of any energy loss given the small size of the bulk media created in events with hard jets.\r\nThe presence of hard scatterings at sufficiently high energy, for a given $\\sqrt{s}$, will lead to a depletion of the energy available for further hard interactions in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$, or even $d$-$A$ collisions. We explore how this depletion can lead to an anti-correlation of the high-$p_T$ pion and photon yields at RHIC energies, as observed by the PHENIX collaboration.\r\nPartially based on I.

The core of the framework is a time-like parton shower, modelled using the recently developed SUBA-Jet framework [1], along with the vHLLE code for the relativistic viscous fluid dynamic evolution of the medium. High-$Q^2$ jet seeds are generated by PYTHIA/Angantyr, while the initial state of the medium is modelled using the $\\mathrm{T_{R}ENTo}$ model. Jet partons lose energy in the medium and hadronize via fragmentation implemented in PYTHIA. At the particlization hypersurface, the medium decouples into hadrons, with final-state hadronic rescatterings simulated by SMASH hadronic transport. In our simulation jet hadrons interact with hadrons produced by particlization of the medium.\r\nWith this framework, called J-PHASE Generator, we examine modifications induced by QGP using SUBA-Jet, while also examining how the hadronic phase affects jet properties. Conventionally, jet modification is attributed solely to the QGP phase, supported by assumptions about formation proper time of jet hadrons and the low value of jet transport coefficient in the hadronic phase. However, we argue that these assumptions are $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-dependent, and thus, the full jet structure may undergo observable modifications even in the hadronic phase.

This approach is useful for probing the Dead Cone phenomenon, a predicted suppression of soft gluon radiation in a conical region around the forward axis of a radiating massive quark. We present preliminary findings from analyzing the emission density within the LJP of bottom jets generated in PYTHIA8 simulations. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities for extensions to heavy-ion collisions where medium-induced radiation is expected to fill the Dead Cone, providing a tool to characterize the high temperature phase of the Quark Gluon Plasma.",

      "Speaker": "Zachary Akridge",
      "Institute": "Indiana University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The spin polarization of hadrons emitted from heavy-ion collisions can serve as a probe of the angular momentum contained within the colliding system. Recent measurements of hyperon global spin polarization at midrapidity from ALICE, STAR, and HADES, spanning a collisional beam energy range from O(1000) to O(1) GeV, have shown a monotonic trend of continually increasing signal with decreasing energy even in the region extremely close to the two-nucleon-mass threshold. This appears surprising, as the angular momentum stopped at midrapidity depends on two competing factors: with decreasing beam energy, the total angular momentum drops quickly while a bigger fraction of the total angular momentum gets stopped in midrapidity. As such, a non-monotonic dependence on beam energy is expected for midrapidity angular momentum, which should first increase with decreasing beam energy and then decrease, approaching zero when beam energy comes down to the threshold.\r\nIn this work, we present a quantitative model (dubbed “Glauber+”) of initial nucleon stopping based on general requirements of energy-momentum conservation in binary collisions. We further use measurements of midrapidity net proton numbers to constrain the key model parameter that characterizes the inelasticity of binary collisions. This allows us to predict the initial angular momentum at midrapidity across a wide range of beam energies, which indeed shows a non-monotonic behavior with a peak around 5 GeV. The discord in the beam energy dependence between initial angular momentum and the observed global spin polarization casts intriguing questions on conventional interpretations assuming a strong positive correlation between them, especially in the very low energy region. The corresponding rapidity distributions of initial angular momentum are also obtained across beam energies, which could provide valuable initial conditions for spin hydrodynamics simulations.",

      "Abstract": "In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets traverse the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and deposit energy into the medium, leading to jet-induced medium response. The medium response takes the form of Mach-cone-like excitations and can modify the internal structure of the jet, affecting many observables, such as jet shape and jet fragmentation function and so on. However, Simulation of jet-induced medium response requires not only a complete model that can accurately describe the evolution of hard and soft partons concurrently, but also substantial computational resources for full-scale simulations. In this study, we trained a generative neural network using a flow model with gamma jet events from Pb $+$ Pb collisions of centrality $0-10\\%$ at 5.02 TeV to estimate the final-state effects of jet-induced medium response. Our findings indicate that with only the initial jet information—namely, the energy-momentum of gamma and the jet, along with their initial positions—the network can accurately predict the positions of the front wake and diffusion wake, and maintain the particle spectrum within the same order of magnitude as the actual data.",

The best agreement with the experimentally known deuteron yield is obtained if the freeze-out temperature is relatively high and, accordingly, the system size at freeze-out is rather small. In addition, the standard Gaussian distribution of the relative distance between nucleons is replaced by the distribution resulting from their independent and approximately uniform production inside the initial thermal system.",

At high energies the system is boost-invariant such that 2+1D simulations using hyperbolic coordinates can reasonably capture most of the dynamical behavior for symmetric collisions, but as one lowers the beam energies the Lorentz contraction decreases (the radius along the beam is comparable to the transverse radius) such that the system requires 3+1D simulations and a later start time to wait for the two nuclei to pass through each other. If one applies hyperbolic coordinates at low energies, the initialization time for hydrodynamics is either extremely late or one needs to dynamically initialize the hydrodynamics using source terms. However, using cartesian coordinates rather than the traditional hyperbolic coordinates would avoid this issue. In this work, we rewrite the 3+1 relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code CCAKE with a generic coordinate system such that we can compare hyperbolic to cartesian coordinates across beam energies.

In this work, we use a hybrid simulation chain, to investigate the effects that the electromagnetic field generated by the charged participants (and the currents induced by it) on the final state observables and on the hydrodynamic evolution itself. The initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and net electric charge 4-current are constructed using AMPT [2,3] and the evolution of the fluid is solved using a newly developed 3+1D hydrodynamic code. The effects of the magnetic field produced by the fluid are studied using a relativistic magnetohydrodynamics approach, neglecting any effects of the shear viscosity.\r\n\r\n 1. D. E. Kharzeev, L. D.

The theoretical model simulates event-by-event (3+1)D dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions with the state-of-the-art hybrid hydrodynamics and hadronic transport theory. We analyze the model's 20-dimensional posterior distributions obtained using three Gaussian Process emulators with different accuracy and demonstrate the essential role of training an accurate model emulator in the Bayesian analysis [1]. Our analysis provides robust constraints on the Quark-Gluon Plasma's transport properties and various aspects of (3+1)D relativistic nuclear dynamics using heavy-ion measurements from 7.7 to 200 GeV [2]. By running full model simulations with a few parameter sets sampled from the posterior distribution, we make timely predictions for $p_T$-differential observables, anisotropic flow rapidity decorrelation, and flow observables in O+O collisions with systematic theory uncertainties, which can be compared with the upcoming measurements from the STAR Collaboration. Finally, we highlight a detailed experimental design analysis to elucidate how individual experimental observables constrain different model parameters, providing valuable physics insights into the phenomenological model for heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for advancing our understanding of high-energy nuclear physics. We employ DL methods to probe two crucial phenomena: collective flow in small colliding systems and the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nCollective flow is similar between small colliding systems ($p$ $+$ $p$ and $p$ $+$ A collisions) and large colliding systems (peripheral A+A collisions) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  for events with similar multiplicity. To study the differences in collective flow generation mechanism between small and large colliding systems, we employ a point cloud network to identify $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV generated from a multiphase transport model (AMPT). After removing the discrepancies in the pseudorapidity distribution and the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra, we capture the discrepancy in collective flow, revealing an increased distinction with higher final hadron multiplicity and parton scattering cross sections.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the search for chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions has attracted long-term attention. Multiple observables are proposed, but all suffer large background contaminations, especially from collective flow, generating with quark gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. We design a U-Net architecture based on deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the CME signal by reversing the evolution of the CME signal inside the QGP. Trained on AMPT-generated datasets, our model effectively reconstructs the charge separation in phase space, providing a strong AI technique for future experimental search for the CME.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] S.Guo, H.S.Wang, K.Zhou and G.L.Ma, Machine learning study to identify collective flow in small and large colliding systems, Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024), 2305.09937 \r\n[2] S.Guo, L.X.

      "Abstract": "The process of Lévy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, play a role in many different phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this talk, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to Lévy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric Lévy-stable distribution. We also discuss a possible generalization of this approach to interaction femtoscopy.",

By performing a high statistics study of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, $\\chi_{disc}$, we extract a pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{pc}=158.9(-2.1)(+2.6)$ MeV. This is in very good agreement with the pseudo-critical temperature estimated after performing a careful continuum extrapolation of different chiral observables using highly improved staggered quarks [1]. More remarkably the continuum extrapolated data for $\\chi_{disc}$ obtained using highly improved staggered quarks are in excellent agreement with those obtained with MDWF on a finite lattice, highlighting the importance of the role of exact chiral symmetry of lattice fermion operators for the study of crossover transition. We also show our new results on the topological susceptibility in 2+1 flavor QCD with MDWF in the temperature range between $T_{pc}$-$1.2~T_{pc}$, and from its temperature dependence and comparison with $\\chi_{disc}$ we discuss about the effective restoration of the singlet $U_A(1)$ and the non-singlet parts of chiral symmetry corresponding to the two light quark flavors [2].\r\nReferences\r\n1.

Jets are evolving objects with complex structures, offering various observables for studying the quenching effects. However, the extent of jet modification by QGP varies due to multiple factors, including the initial jet creation point within the QGP and the types of parton energy loss. In this study, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure that includes the parton shower history. The LSTM output provides a jet-by-jet quenching level prediction. Using photon-jet samples from Monte Carlo simulations, we confirmed that these predictions strongly correlate with jet energy loss. Various detector limitations and their impacts on the training results are examined in simulation. Additionally, our ML tool identifies “fake quenching” modifications in pp reference, providing insights into fragmentation bias when studying modifications to jet observables. This study may help disentangle the complex mechanisms of jet quenching and enhance our understanding of the unique QGP system.",

As a result of the latter, the physics involved in the Hagedorn function can be understood under the string fragmentation scheme. Consequently, the system created in the collision departs from the thermal description, which is corroborated by deriving the temperature fluctuations of these approaches.

Combining target jet charge and leading jet charge significantly improves the identification of the hard scattering flavor structure in electron-proton collisions. Furthermore, forward neutron tagging allows an isolation of an almost pure up-quark jet sample, which could be used to enhance sensitivities to flavor-dependent effects such as Sivers asymmetry. We demonstrate the connections between target jet energy flow observables and parton distributions, as well as the mapping between forward nuclei tagging and details of nuclear breakup process such as the location of the DIS nucleon.",

By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish thermal sum rules of quark spectral function for strongly-coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to weakly-coupled theories, whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (singularities) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. This reflects the breaking and restoration of Lorentz symmetry in these regimes. The thermal mass vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides new insights into the emergence and mechanism of the QCD transition.",

For both models, we first study the elliptic flow response to initial geometrical deformations in a simplified setup using toy models. This allows us to examine the dynamical origin of the negative sign of elliptic flow through its dependence on the ratio of system size to interaction length. We then proceed to look at more realistic scenarios, using the Angantyr model [2] in PYTHIA [3] for the case of string shoving, as well as the parton cascade ALPACA [4] based on the effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe [5]. Both models show a clear transition between negative and positive elliptic flow as a function of system size for the examined small collision systems.\r\n\r\nThe negative sign of elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.\r\n\r\n[1] C.

The possible sources of these oscillations and their impact on our understanding of the multiparticle production mechanism were discussed [1-5]. The set of combinants, Cj provides a similar measure of fluctuations as the set of cumulant factorial moments, Kq, which are very sensitive to the details of the multiplicity distribution and were frequently used in phenomenological analyses of data. However, while cumulants are best suited to the study of the densely populated region of phase space, combinants are better suited for the study of sparsely populated regions because the calculation of Cj requires only a finite number of probabilities P(N<j). The observed oscillations of the modified combinants are of physical origin and are not experimental artifacts. Modified combinants evaluated from models exhibit oscillatory behavior, though the oscillation period differs from experimental data [6].\r\nIn this presentation, we discuss how this approach can be used in nuclear collisions. We demonstrate how correlation functions can be related to combinants and illustrate how the information about just the sign of these correlation functions can be used in analyses of multiplicity distributions in nuclear collisions. It is argued that measuring couplings of the genuine multi-particle correlation functions could provide cleaner information on possible non-trivial dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n[1] M.

This method enabled us to uncover multiple components of the longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$) [1] and to develop a novel technique for extracting flow decorrelations across the entire rapidity range [2]. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach using full 3D hydrodynamic and transport models. We reveal that while deformation enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it leaves the long-range component of its longitudinal profile unchanged. Additionally, we discovered two distinct components of the longitudinal structure: a global twisted geometry and localized rapidity fluctuations contributing to short- and medium-range flow decorrelations. This study presents a new way to disentangle long- and short-range flow decorrelations from non-flow backgrounds, providing a concrete example of how leveraging the structure differences between isobar nuclei can help us gain new insights into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] Sources of longitudinal flow decorrelations in high-energy nuclear collisions, https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15006\r\n\r\n[2] Longitudinal Structure of Quark-Gluon Plasma Unveiled Through Nuclear Deformations, https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08749",

      "Abstract": "Much has been learned about the quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, but one of the most challenging issues that still needs to be addressed is that it reaches thermal equilibrium much earlier than theoretically expected. Color glass condensation (CGC) is a strong candidate for the mechanism by which this occurs, but experimental verification has not yet been successful. In the ALICE experiment, with the aim of experimentally confirming CGC, we are developing Forward Calorimeter (FoCal), which consists of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadron calorimeter, to precisely measure the position and energy of direct photons and photons from $\\pi^0$ decay, which can be the signals of CGC, in the forward region with small x. The FoCal electromagnetic calorimeter consists of low-granularity pad types and high-granularity pixel types, and we are developing a pad type electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E pad). Since FoCal will be installed at forward region of the beam axis where many neutrons will be irradiated, a p-type silicon sensor which has high neutron tolerance is used. To evaluate the performance of the sensor, a neutron irradiation test was conducted at RIKEN-RANS and a beam test experiment was conducted at TOHOKU-ELPH with positrons of various energies injected. In the ALICE experiment, a maximum neutron irradiation amount of about $10^{14} n_{eq}/cm^2$ is expected at the location where FoCal will be installed. In the RANS test, the dose to the silicon sensor was estimated by analyzing the indium foil dose, which has high sensitivity to neutron irradiation, placing around the silicon sensor. The results of the estimation indicate that the neutron dose to the sensor was about $6 × 10^{13} n_{eq}/cm$. The MIP (Minimum Ionizing Particle) signal of neutron-irradiated and of non-irradiated sensors were detected in the beam test data to evaluate the performance change of the sensors. In this poster, we will report on the development status of FoCal-E and discuss the results of the performance evaluation of the silicon sensor using these tests.",

Their final-state dynamics, therefore, encode information about the evolution of the system, making them effective probes to the properties of the hot QCD medium. Charmonia, bound states of a charm and an anti-charm quark, are of particular interest. In high-energy hadronic collisions, inclusive $J/\\psi$ production consists of both prompt and non-prompt components. The prompt component includes $J/\\psi$ produced directly or from the decays of higher-mass charmonium states (e.g., $\\psi$(2S) or $\\chi_c$), while the non-prompt component originates from the weak decays of bottom hadrons. Therefore, the study of the production and properties of non-prompt $J/\\psi$ would provide valuable insights into those of the beauty hadrons.\r\n\r\nThe Time Projection Chamber and Inner Tracking System of the ALICE detector were recently upgraded, allowing a $\\sim50$ times increase in read-out rate in Run3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

Some of these signatures, such as strangeness enhancement and collective flow, suggest that light-flavor hadron production arises from complex mechanisms whose relative contributions evolve smoothly from low to high multiplicity collisions. In this context, pp collisions cannot only be seen as a simple incoherent sum of parton-parton scatterings, contrary to the modelization in most Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA. Moreover, these signatures have historically been attributed to the strongly interacting medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. However, creating a medium in smaller collision systems challenges the current theoretical frameworks.\r\n\r\nStudies on multi-differential strange particle production in small systems can be utilized to disentangle the various final state effects at play and represent an essential baseline for heavy-ion studies. This poster presents new results from ALICE on light-flavor particle production and exotic resonances as a function of the transverse spherocity in pp collisions measured at center-of-mass energies of  13 TeV. Events that are either \"isotropic\" (dominated by multiple soft processes) or \"jet-like\" (dominated by one or few hard scatterings) can be selected utilizing narrow selections in multiplicity and spherocity.

They are valuable probes to study jet fragmentation and nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF).\r\n\r\nAngular correlations between trigger hadrons, which serve as proxies for the jets, and their associated photons are extracted from ALICE simulations. The photons are reconstructed from conversions in the ALICE material into electrons and positrons using the Photon Conversion Method (PCM). Since direct photons cannot be distinguished individually, their spectra are derived using a statistical approach. The decay photon spectra are derived from neutral hadron measurements, and subtracted from the inclusive measurements to extract the direct photon spectra. In this analysis, proton-proton collisions are simulated in Monte Carlo, using stand-alone PYTHIA at leading order (LO), and PYTHIA in combination with POWHEG at next-to-leading order (NLO), and compared with each other. While prompt photons are well defined at LO, ambiguities are introduced at NLO.

The sensor chip will be based on Monolithic Active Pixels and fabricated in $65~\\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS technology exploiting stitching. During R&D, two stitched sensor prototypes, MOSS and MOST, were designed, where the first is less densely designed and the latter follows a more densely integrated in-pixel layout combined with a less dense power grid and power switches in the matrix. In the case of in-pixel short circuits, small regions of the matrix can be detached from the power grid restoring the retaining part of the overall functionality. The MOST readout is based on global high-speed lines spanning the entire approximately $25~\\mathrm{cm}$ long chip, which have successfully been operated. Procedures have been designed to select detector-grade ITS3 chips on wafer level using impedance measurements, powering tests, and functional tests. For MOSS, above $95\\%$ of the chip area can be operated. The majority of faults can be traced down to anomalous cross-connections in the topmost metal layers by correlating the grid design with thermal hotspots during power ramping. Several beam tests have proven efficient operation of MOSS prototypes, also under radiation load. The full size and full functionality  prototype for the final production sensor, MOSAIX is currently under development, heavily profiting from studies done on MOSS and MOST prototypes.

The combinatorial background was evaluated using two methods: the like-sign method and the event-mixing method. By fitting the like-sign distribution with the event-mixing distribution and simulated correlated sources, a more precise subtraction of the combinatorial background was achieved. To identify the sources of the dimuons, the decay vertex measurement was employed.

Using the ALICE detector, data from Run 3 Pb--Pb collisions at 5.36 TeV are used to construct two-particle balance functions, which show where particles carrying a conserved charge are most likely to be formed relative to each other. For this analysis specifically, $\\Lambda$ - K and $\\Lambda$ - p balance functions are used to study strangeness and baryon number production, respectively. These balance functions are complemented by $\\Lambda$ - $\\pi$ balance functions, which lack both strangeness and baryon number correlations and serve as a baseline.",

FoCal has a front face of approximately 90 $\\times$ 90 cm$^2$ and is placed at *z* = 7 m from the nominal interaction point. It covers the pseudo-rapidity range of 3.2 < η < 5.8. FoCal has unique capabilities to measure the direct photon production at the forward rapidity that probes the gluon distribution in protons and nuclei at small-*x*. Furthermore, FoCal will enable to carry out inclusive and correlation measurements of photons, neutral mesons, and jets in hadronic pp and p-Pb collisions as well as J/ψ production in the ultra-peripheral p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions.\r\n\r\nThe key component for FoCal-E is the large-size Silicon pad sensor with the high radiation tolerance.

      "Abstract": "The production cross sections and polarization measurements are essential to understand the heavy quarkonium production mechanism and to enhance our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in vacuum as well as in medium. Theoretical models like non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), which include a color octet contribution, remain quite successful in explaining the charmonium production cross section at large transverse momenta and obtained in the past years a fair agreement with the data provided by experimental measurements on quarkonium polarization. Due to its higher mass, bottomonia satisfy better a non-relativistic theoretical treatment. Therefore, the corresponding polarization measurements in pp collisions provide a good testing ground for NRQCD. In particular, the large feed-down contribution to the observed bottomonia yield may dilute the expected polarization. This contribution can be further understood with more precise and differential measurements of $\\Upsilon$ (nS) polarization. Finally, this measurement in pp will be an important baseline for a similar measurement in heavy-ion collisions. Indeed, in PbPb collisions, the presence of a strong magnetic field in the initial stage or a modification of the relative contribution between direct and feed-down bottomonium production may lead to a different measured polarization. The Run 3 upgrade to the ALICE detector with higher luminosity and interaction rate opens new opportunities to study the polarization of $\\Upsilon$ states with good precision.

In heavy-ion collisions, jets traverse the colored medium and lose energy via induced gluon radiation and elastic scattering, which modify jet yields and structure. When the overlap of the colliding nuclei is small, the transverse profile of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is expected to become more elliptical in shape. This geometrical shape results in different QGP path lengths for partons emitted at different angles, resulting in an azimuthal anisotropy of the energy loss. This anisotropy alters the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ differential yield of jets and is quantified by the second-order flow coefficient, $v_2$, of the jets. Therefore, measurements of jet $v_2$ are expected to be sensitive to QGP properties and to the path length dependence of energy loss. Based on the high statistics data samples collected during Run 3, using ALICE upgraded detectors, we present the first analysis of inclusive charged-particle jet $v_2$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm(NN)}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The low $p_{\\rm{T}}$ reach of this measurement, which is unique to ALICE, is especially important in constraining theoretical models and elucidating the mechanisms which generate jet $v_2$.

A well-known characteristic of the critical behaviour of the system undergoing phase transition is that it shows fluctuations of all scales. Local multiplicity fluctuations are analyzed using normalized factorial moments (NFM) $F_{\\rm{q}}$ for $q={\\rm2,\\,3,\\,4\\,and\\,5}$.  For the systems with dynamical fluctuations $F_{\\rm{q}}$ shows scaling behaviour with increasing  numbers of bins $M$ whereas scaling is also characteristic of the systems with self-similar and fractal nature. $F_{\\rm{q}}$ moments show scaling behaviour as the binning in the phase space region increases.\r\n\r\nFor the second-order phase transition in the Ginzburg-Landau formalism  $F_{\\rm{q}}$ for $q > $ 2 shows a linear dependence on the second-order normalized factorial moments ($F_{\\rm{2}}$), termed as F-scaling.  The scaling exponent $\\nu$, which quantifies the fluctuations in the particle density  distributions, was determined for various $p_{\\rm{T}}$ intervals  and bin widths in the soft-$p_{\\rm{T}}$ region.

Datataking is planned for LHC Run 4, starting from 2030.\r\nOne of the central and novel features of the FoCal detector are the two high-granularity pixel layers in the electromagnetic calorimeter. These layers, located at layer 5 and 10, are used to identify two photon showers with narrow opening angle from decays of neutral mesons, and thus to enhance the signal of isolated photons. In order to achieve this, two electromagnetic showers need to be resolved on the mm-scale. Nearly 2000 ALPIDE MAPS chips with a pixel size of ~29 x 27 µm² will be installed per layer, organized in aluminum carriers which house so-called strings with 15 chips in a row (i.e. transversal length of 45cm). These strings will be produced with flexible printed-circuit boards, to which the ALPIDEs will be assembled and connected with Single-Point TAB bonding technology.\r\nThis poster will give a comprehensive overview of the FoCal pixel layer project. We will present the expected performance for the two-shower discrimination power, its contribution to the detector's physics performance and put prototype results from testbeams into context.

These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quark production and their thermalization within the QGP. While the suppression of loosely bound quarkonia in QGP was already observed in the first measurements at the SPS, the $J/\\psi$ flow has been studied at the LHCusing Run1 and Run 2 data. These measurements shed new light on quarkonium production and confirm the existence of regeneration mechanisms. Thanks to the new ALICE data-taking strategy in LHC Run 3, new opportunities for more precise and refined measurements are now possible. In particular, multiparticle cumulant analysis can be carried out to extract $J/\\psi$ flow enabling access to flow fluctuations.

However, QCD predicts the existence of several exotic yet unseen states. These include two-quark, four-quark, molecular, hybrid states, and glueballs.

Lattice QCD calculations predict that the lightest scalar glueballs have a mass range between 1500 and 1700 MeV/c$^2$, with quantum numbers J$^{PC}$ = $0^{++}$. However, their experimental search is challenging due to their mixing with scalar mesonic states in the nearby mass range that share the same quantum numbers. The excellent particle identification capabilities of the ALICE detector and the unprecedented amount of data collected with pp collisions in Run 3 provide a unique opportunity to explore the experimental search for glueballs and learn about their internal structure, testing QCD predictions in the process.

      "Abstract": "Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. An important final state observable for understanding these late-stage effects is the measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), which originates from the anisotropic expansion of the system driven by the initial spatial asymmetry in the collision geometry. Late-stage hadronic rescattering can alter the momentum distributions of resonances, thereby influencing their elliptic flow. Measuring the elliptic flow of resonances like $K^{*0}$ and $\\phi$, and comparing them to the elliptic flow of the other hadrons, provides deeper insights into the impact of final state effects.

Charm hadronization can be investigated by measuring charm-baryon production in pp collisions over a wide range of transverse momenta, rapidities, and energies.

Higher-order cumulants ($\\kappa_n$) of net-baryon distributions provide a more sensitive probe for the nature of thermalization in such collisions.

We present the multiplicity dependence of cumulants of the net-proton number distributions up to the 6th order in pp collisions at top LHC energies, where the net-proton number serves as a proxy for the net-baryon number.

      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow is one of the key signatures of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. This phenomenon is generally quantified by the different harmonics, $v_n$, of the Fourier expansion measured through the azimuthal distribution of final-state particles. In this poster contribution, we report on the first results of $v_n\\{m\\}$ measurements of charged hadrons from multi-particle correlations $(m)$ evaluated with the Generic Framework in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.36$ TeV recorded in 2023 with ALICE. These results are compared to both ALICE results from the previous LHC run at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and state-of-the-art hydrodynamical calculations to provide new input for future models and further constrain the properties of the QGP. We will also highlight the prospects for the first Run 3 measurements of charge-dependent flow relative to the spectator plane, which can be used to probe the strong early-stage electromagnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Charm-quark hadronization is not completely understood in proton--proton (pp) and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. In recent years, measurements of charm-baryon production at the LHC have raised  questions on the modeling of heavy-quark hadronization. The relative abundances of charm baryons and mesons, assessed via measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios, represent an important tool to understand the charm hadronization process from pp to heavy-ion collisions. While qualitatively in agreement with recent measurements of $\\Xi_{c}^{0,+}$/D$^0$ production ratio performed in pp collisions, models based on string fragmentation beyond leading colour approximation, statistical hadronization, or hadronization via coalescence are not able to quantitatively describe the data. Moreover, the comparison of measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios performed at midrapidity by ALICE and forward rapidity by LHCb seems to suggest a rapidity dependence, not predicted by model calculations or Monte Carlo generators. However, the significant uncertainties in the branching ratios of the various decay channels employed, particularly the $\\Xi_{c}^+ \\rightarrow {\\rm p K}^- \\pi^+$ channel used by LHCb, prevent drawing definitive conclusions.\r\nIn this contribution, the measurement of the $\\Xi_{c}^+$ baryon production relative to one of the D mesons and $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ baryon obtained by exploiting the large datasets of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 3 will be presented.

In this contribution, the production mechanisms of light (anti)nuclei are investigated exploring nuclei-proton azimuthal correlations. ALICE measures, for baryon–baryon and anti-baryon–anti-baryon pairs, a near-side anti-correlation structure, which is not reproduced by commonly used Monte Carlo models like PYTHIA or EPOS, indicating a fundamental flaw in the production mechanism of baryons in these models. The results presented in this contribution further test this paradigm by exploring deuteron-proton azimuthal correlations using Run 3 pp collisions and employing event generators such as PYTHIA, specifically tuned to model the production of light bound states through a coalescence afterburner.",

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia, which are bound states of heavy-flavor quark-antiquark pairs, have long been considered crucial probes for studying the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). In a simplified picture, the production of quarkonium is suppressed due to color screening within the QGP, formed during nucleus–nucleus collisions. A key observable in this context is the azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonia, providing valuable insights into the collective dynamics of particles in a strongly interacting medium. The measurement of this anisotropy is achieved through harmonic coefficients derived from the Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distribution. In non-central collisions, the coefficient $v_2$ of the second harmonic measures the strength of the so-called elliptic flow and is the most important source of information on the degree of thermalization of the medium.\r\nDue to the large mass of the beauty quark that may prevent its thermalization, the $\\Upsilon(\\mathrm{1S})$, a bound $b\\overline{b}$ state, is expected to exhibit a lower $v_2$ with respect to the $J/\\psi$, a $c\\overline{c}$ bound state.\r\nFor these reasons, a study of the $\\Upsilon(\\mathrm{1S})$ flow with the latest data collected in ALICE from the recent LHC data-taking period may provide interesting insights on the degree of thermalization of the beauty quark.

Following their production, charm quarks undergo a fragmentation process which results in a spray of charged hadrons after hadronization, typically collinear to the charm quark. This process can be characterized by studying the near-side peak of the aforementioned azimuthal-correlation distributions. The measurement of the peak yield and width offers insights into the amount of particles produced from the charm fragmentation and their radial displacement with respect to the charm quark, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we present $p_{\\rm{T}}$-differential measurements of the azimuthal-correlation distribution between $\\rm{D^{0}}$ mesons and charged particles in pp collisions at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 13.6 TeV using the ALICE detector. Furthermore, comparisons with previous studies at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 5.02 TeV, $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 7 TeV, and $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 13 TeV suggest that the PYTHIA8 and POWHEG+PYTHIA8 models provide the best description of the data.

The study is motivated by the idea that non-monotonic changes in $p_{\\rm T}$ correlations with varying energy, if observed, may be taken as an indicator for the QGP formation. The mean $p_{\\rm T}$ fluctuations are studied in terms of the two-particle correlator, $\\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\\rm T})_m$, which measures the strength of such fluctuations in units of mean $p_{\\rm T}$. The dependence of $\\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\\rm T})_m$ on particle multiplicity in varying $p_{\\rm T}$ window widths and positions has been analyzed. A study of soft, intermediate and hard $p_{\\rm T}$ would significantly impact on understanding of equilibrium and thermal (radial flow), as well as non-thermal (jets/minijets) sources for $p_{\\rm T}$ fluctuations.\r\n\r\nA decreasing trend in correlator values with increasing charged particle multiplicity has been observed, following a power-law pattern.

The anisotropic flow of light and strange particles scales approximately with the number of constituent quarks. The scaling behavior is interpreted as the collective flow developing in the partonic phase. Resonance particles, whose quark contents are the same as their ground state particles but have different mass and spin, may not follow the scaling behavior because of interactions of their daughter particles during the hadronic phase. Previous measurements in ALICE show that the relative yield of $\\mathrm{K^\\pm(892)}$ to $\\mathrm{K}$ gradually decreases as a function of particle multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, if flow coefficients between resonance and stable particles are compared, we can study the impact of interactions at the hadronic phase on the collective flow.

The current data-taking period, called Run 3, features much higher statistics in its measurements. The analysis focuses on the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ decay channel, where the J/ψ decays into electron-positron pairs. To improve the significance of the X(3872) signal, machine learning techniques have been applied, specifically through a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier. This poster presents the invariant mass spectrum of the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ channel, along with the distribution of key kinematic variables, using both real data and Monte Carlo simulations generated with Pythia and EvtGen. Measuring the X(3872) with the ALICE Experiment is particularly valuable because it provides access to data at low transverse momentum, a region that other experiments have not extensively explored. This low-momentum analysis is crucial, as it may help determine whether the X(3872) is a compact tetraquark state or a loosely bound molecule of mesons.",

Among the aforementioned upgrades, the installation of the new muon forward tracker (MFT) enriches the study of quarkonium production previously carried out with the ALICE muon spectrometer at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4). In particular, thanks to its high spatial resolution, the MFT allows to identify the quarkonia directly produced at the collision (prompt) from those coming from beauty hadron decays (non-prompt). This separation is critical to enlarge our knowledge of heavy-quark production both in pp and heavy-ion collisions, including access to charmonia decaying from b-hadrons and clearer analysis of the quarkonia regeneration mechanism. Experimentally, the prompt/non-prompt separation performance relies on highly efficient track matching between the MFT and the muon spectrometer, together with the precise determination of the secondary vertex.

However, at LHC energies, the thermal dielectrons emitted in the early stages of the collision from the quark-gluon-plasma are outnumbered by a large contribution of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$-pairs from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour (HF) hadrons.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade of the ALICE detector installed during the Long Shutdown 2 is crucial to boost the precision of thermal radiation measurement. The continuous readout of the TPC allows for higher data acquisition rate of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions. Moreover, the new ITS with its higher granularity and closer location to the interaction point improves the pointing resolution by a factor of 2 compared to that in Run 2, leading to a better topological separation of prompt thermal radiation and e$^{+}$e$^{-}$-pairs from HF hadron decays, and to smaller background from photon conversions in the detector material.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the status of the analysis of a large data set of Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV, recorded with the upgraded ALICE detector in Run 3, is presented. The electron and positron identification capabilities are evaluated and the impact of the detector upgrades on the dielectron analysis will be shown.",

To distinguish between the elliptic flow of direct photons and photons originating from hadronic decays, primarily from π0 mesons, a precise measurement of the π0 flow is crucial. Furthermore, measurements of elliptic flow of different baryons and mesons can help to better understand underlying production mechanisms. During LHC Run 3, the ALICE experiment collected more than 100x more Pb–Pb collisions compared to Run 2, opening up new opportunities to study all these effects in greater detail.\r\n\r\nIn ALICE, the π0 can be reconstructed using various methods. For high transverse momentum π0 mesons, these methods rely on measuring decay photons with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal). In this poster the current status of the measurement of elliptic flow of π0 mesons in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.36 TeV will be presented.",

Nonetheless, in recent studies it has been shown that SiPMs can directly detect charged particles due to the emission of Cherenkov light in the standard protection layer placed on top of the SiPM.\r\n\r\nNUV-HD-LFv2 SiPMs, produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler with 3.20 x 3.12 mm$^2$ area and with different thickness of protection layers, have been tested in a beam-test setup at CERN PS.  The telescope is made of four sensors: two SiPMs under test and two LGAD detectors (1x1 mm$^2$ 25 um and 35 um thick sensors). The latter are used as timing reference and the coincidence of the two defines the trigger for the beam particles. The main results, obtained with a 4 GHz digital oscilloscope, confirm a very high efficiency above 99% and a noise below 1% for a threshold over 6-10 photoelectrons.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the performances after irradiation in terms of timing response and Dark Count Rate will be presented. They have been evaluated for NUV-HD-RH SiPMs of 1 x 1 mm$^2$ area, proving the possibility to maintain excellent timing performance close to 20 ps and low level of dark counts once an appropriate threshold is applied to the signal.\r\n\r\nIn the last beam test, SiPMs were also studied in a new and complete front-end and readout electronics chain made by a LIROC discriminator and a picoTDC with 3.05 ps bin size. In this poster, the efficiency with this setup will be reported for matrices made of 9 SiPMs, confirming to be above 95% at the lowest threshold achievable.",

This production is sensitive to the electromagnetic field distributions from the heavily Lorentz-contracted nuclei, which are directly dependent on the charge radius and shape of the atomic nucleus sourcing the photons. This can result in a non-isotropic azimuthal production, as well as shifts in the momentum-dependent production cross sections between different sourcing nuclei. Additionally, Sudakov radiation can result in an azimuthal modulation at higher pair momentum, so nuclear shape effects and constraints on the angular effects of soft photon radiation can both be measured for the first time.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, results will be presented of the first Breit-Wheeler measurement in U+U ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV, with comparisons to Au+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, to explore both nuclear shape effects on the cross sections, and the effects of both nuclear shape and Sudakov radiation on the azimuthal modulation strengths. Comparisons between gold and uranium show a sensitivity to nuclear shape differences at pair $p_{T}$ less than 60 MeV/c in both the cross sections and the angular modulations. Similarly, by measuring these modulations at pair $p_{T}$ above 60 MeV/c, qualitative results are observed that are in agreement with theory predictions for the effects of Sudakov radiation (Shao, et al. 2023).",

The resonance and continuum  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production originate from distinct  $\\gamma A$  and  $\\gamma \\gamma$  processes offering unique opportunities to investigate production mechanisms and interference dynamics. The continuum $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production is dominated by single virtual $\\pi^+ / \\pi^-$  nucleus scattering in the Drell-Söding process, which has never been precisely measured. Due to the absence of the intermediate $\\rho^0$  and its unique production mechanism, the Drell-Söding measurement could provide a new and unprecedented insight into the entanglement purity and interference dynamics. The $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ process also contributes to the continuum  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production. EESI between the $\\gamma \\gamma $ and $\\gamma A$ pathways produces a clean  $A_{1\\Delta \\phi}$ signal that can be used to isolate the hadronic light-by-light process from the dominant Drell-Söding process for the first time: a result that may provide new theoretical constraints on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.

Our measurement indicates that there is a correlation between the amount of early-stage non-perturbative radiation and the time at which the first hard splitting happens. \r\n\r\nWe also present the $r_c$ measurement that probes the contributions of string-like hadronization, by distinguishing the charge signs of leading and subleading charged particles within jets.

A path-length asymmetry along impact parameter direction ($x$) exists for hard probes in heavy-ion collisions at finite rapidity, as the QGP bulk is tilted in reaction plane, while the hard scattering profile is not [2]. Previous measurements of $v_1$ (= $\\langle p_x/p_T \\rangle$) of $D^0$-mesons have demonstrated sensitivity of hard produced partons to this path-length asymmetry [2,3]. Measurements of jet $v_1$ will provide access to path-length dependent energy loss of partons in the QGP. The jet $v_1$ measurements do not get contributions from event-by-event geometry fluctuations, unlike measurements relative to the second order event plane. Measurements therefore of in- and out-of-plane yield ratios of hard probes in events with different second-order eccentricities offer complementary information on this effect in the QGP. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the first measurement of inclusive charged jet and high-$p_T$ charged hadron $v_1$ in Au+Au and Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr (isobar) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR.

      "Abstract": "Studying heavy-flavor quarks can enhance our understanding of parton interactions with the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Due to their significant mass, heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are primarily produced during the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, where hard scatterings dominate, allowing them to experience the entire evolution of the QGP. One approach to investigate heavy-quark transport properties in QGP is through the measurement of heavy-flavor electrons (HFE), which are electrons emitted from the semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present measurements of HFE yield and central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factor as functions of transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV by the STAR experiment - making this the first such result at this energy. Strong HFE suppression has been observed in central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. This measurement at energies below the RHIC top energy provides new insights into the heavy-quark transport coefficient dependence on QGP temperature and collision system baryon chemical potential, and complements existing results at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and the recent HFE elliptic flow measurements at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV. The obtained results will also be compared with available model predictions.",

      "Abstract": "Strangeness production serves as a sensitive probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, it is proposed that the $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios in different colliding systems may reveal the minimum colliding system size required to produce the QGP. In Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV significant $\\Omega$ enhancement over $\\phi$ has been observed at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_T$) in central collisions, which can be explained by their production through the coalescence of strange quarks in the QGP. In addition, an intriguingly smooth increase in (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity was first reported at LHC energies, and it is critical to investigate this ratio at RHIC energies. Finally, strange hadron to strange anti-hadron ratio can be used to constrain the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at chemical freeze-out temperature. The versatility of RHIC to change the size of the colliding ions provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate strangeness production as a function of system size. In 2021, STAR collected a large O+O dataset at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. O+O is a unique symmetric small system allowing for a more straightforward geometry mapping with centrality than with asymmetric small systems. In addition, the high-quality O+O dataset will allow us to precisely map the (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, measurements on strange hadrons ($K^0_s$,$\\phi$, $\\Lambda$,$\\overline{\\Lambda}$,$\\Xi$,$\\overline{\\Xi}$,$\\Omega$,$\\overline{\\Omega}$) in O+O and Au+Au collisions will be presented, including their $p_T$ spectra, nuclear modification factors $R_{CP}$ and antibaryon-to-baryon ratios. Additionally, we will compare the centrality dependence of the $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios in five different collisions systems at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV : Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru, $d$+Au. Finally, we will investigate the (multi)strange hadron to pion yield ratio as a function of multiplicity for these aforementioned collision systems.",

      "Abstract": "In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the initial strong magnetic (B) field can give rise to a broad range of phenomena, such as the splitting of Landau levels under strong B-fields, which has significant implications in QCD [1]. The neutral ($K^{*0}$) and charged ($K^{*\\pm}$) vector mesons have similar masses and isospin; however, their quark magnetic moments differ by a factor of five, making them ideal probes for studying Landau level splitting and potential isospin symmetry breaking in the presence of B-fields [2]. The recent observation of isospin violation in neutral and charged kaons by NA61/SHINE challenges the assumption of isospin symmetry in QCD, though the cause remains unknown [3]. A difference in $K^{*0,\\pm}$ yields due to B-field can feeddown  ($K^{*0} \\rightarrow K^{\\pm} + \\pi^{\\mp}$, $K^{*\\pm} \\rightarrow K_{S}^{0} +\\pi^{\\pm}$) into the inclusive neutral and charged kaon yields, and contribute to the above apparent isospin violation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the invariant mass peak position and its width, transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra, yields ($dN/dy$), and $\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$ of $K^{*0,\\pm}$ mesons near mid-rapidity, utilizing collisions involving isospin-asymmetric nuclei (Au+Au, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and isospin-symmetric nuclei (O+O), as well as p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We report on particle ratios, including $K^{*\\pm}/K^{*0}$ and $K^{\\pm}/K_{S}^{0}$, as a function of $p_{T}$ and centrality in various heavy-ion collision systems.

Unexpectedly large global spin alignment ($\\rho_{00}$) values for ${\\phi}$(1020) mesons have been reported in the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) in Au+Au collisions [1]. These values exceed conventional expectations based on global hyperon polarization induced by orbital angular momentum, suggesting the possible presence of a strong force field for $\\phi$ mesons [2].\r\n\r\nPrevious $\\rho_{00}$ measurements use a 1D angular distribution in $\\theta^*$ (polar angle of a daughter kaon in the $\\phi$ meson's rest frame with respect to the orthogonal of the harmonic event plane). We will use both angular dimensions $\\theta^*$ and $\\beta$ of a daughter kaon in the $\\phi$ meson's rest frame, where $\\beta$ is the azimuthal angle within the harmonic event plane, measured relative to the positive beam axis. This technique enables off-diagonal element extraction with fewer assumptions regarding the decay daughter distributions. We will present differential measurements of $\\phi$-meson $\\rho_{00}$ and off-diagonal spin density matrix elements, using data from the second phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-19.6$ GeV collected by STAR.

      "Abstract": "Bayesian inference in heavy-ion physics often produces varying estimates of model parameters when varying the physics model and/or the prior assumptions, reflecting a lack of accounting for theoretical uncertainties. Traditionally, a good model-to-data fit is seen as success, with inferred parameters assumed to reflect underlying physics. However, theories have limitations and extending a theory beyond its scope without including model uncertainties not only leads to incorrect parameter estimates, rendering them as mere fitting variables, but also reduces the utility of the data. To address this we propose a statistical framework that accounts for theoretical uncertainties in multistage heavy-ion models. We test this framework using \"measurements\" of $p_T$-differential observables obtained from a \"true\" theory - a $2+1$d hydrodynamic simulation with a known fixed value for the specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$ that employs a Grad 14-moment particlization prescription. We use these observables to calibrate via Bayesian inference a different hydrodynamic simulation model that uses a parametrization of $(\\eta/s)(T)$ as a function of the temperature and applies a different particlization ansatz. Our Bayesian inference framework allows for theoretical uncertainties by including model discrepancy in its statistical modeling. We compare the inferred values for the specific shear viscosity with and without the uncertainty model, demonstrating its impact on posterior inference of $\\eta/s$.",

The physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (RHIC's), but this approach could be of interest also for astrophysical and cosmological problems, since our formulation is valid for a general coordinate system with a non-trivial metric tensor. Our method is based on a generalization of the well-known Müller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory to explicitly include electromagnetic effects in the constitutive relations, by requiring that the new contributions to the entropy current locally satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The latter condition allows us to retrieve some of the terms appearing in the evolution equations for the dissipative fields derived from more microscopic methods, which rely on kinetic theory, such as the relaxation-time (RTA) or the 14-moment approximations for a single quark flavour. Finally, we extend our treatment to the more general situation of multiple conserved charges, which in RHIC's can be identified with the baryon number, the electric charge and the strangeness of the system and which arise from the independent conservation of the three light-quark flavours $u$, $d$ and $s$. In this case other possible tensorial structures appear in the non-ideal component of the entropy four-current, leading to a non-negative rate of entropy production.",

      "Abstract": "In this contribution we present preliminary results on the dielectron production in p+p interactions at 1.58 GeV beam energy measured with the High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES). The HADES RICH detector has been upgraded with a new photon detection camera which strongly enhances the electron efficiency and conversion pair rejection. With this upgrade, a signal-to-background ratio above 1 is achieved over the entire dielectron spectrum. For this work, 0.5 billion collisions have been analyzed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by analyzing elastic p+p collisions, a normalization procedure for differential cross sections has been established. Additionally, collisions with an empty target and thereby the target vessel provide a p+Mylar spectrum and allow the extraction of a p+n spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe p+p and p+n dielectron spectra can serve as a reference for the understanding and interpretation of Ag+Ag collisions which have been measured in HADES at the same energy. A precise understanding of the dielectron production in elementary reactions is needed to disentangle the various contributions to the measured dielectron yield in Ag+Ag collisions. This NN baseline enables the determination of the medium temperature and the excess ratio.",

      "Abstract": "The High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) [1] installed at the GSI institute in Darmstadt  registers  products  of  heavy  ion  collisions  at  energies  of  a  few  GeV  per  nucleon.   The nuclear  matter  produced  in  such  collisions  reaches  extreme  densities  and  temperatures  [2,  3,  4], comparable to those found in neutron stars, especially during their mergers [5].  By measuring the kinematic distributions of emitted particles and comparing them to transport model calculations – many aspects of the nuclear matter can be understood.\r\n\r\nParticles  containing  the  (anti)strange  quark  are  of  particular  interest,  as  they  are  produced sparsely in this energy regime and act as good probes of their interaction with the medium.  For charged K mesons it is predicted that due to their interaction in nuclear matter, their effective mass and decay constant should change [6].  This phenomenon was investigated by other experiments, but so far without a definitive conclusion [7].  Another interesting particle species is the Λ baryon, due to its predicted role in the so-called hyperon puzzle [8], where its interaction potential with nucleonic matter is an important piece of the “puzzle”.\r\n\r\nIt is predicted that the transverse flow – anisotropies in particle emission in the azimuthal angle (around the beam axis) – of strange hadrons should be sensitive to their interaction with the nuclear medium surrounding them during the collision [7, 9].  As such, studying the transverse flow of these particles may bring a significant advantage in our understanding of hadronic matter in the studied energy range.\r\n\r\nThis contribution will contain preliminary maps of $v_n$ coefficients in the momentum phase space of strange hadrons – K$^\\pm$ mesons and Λ baryons – emitted from Ag+Ag collisions at a beam energy of 1.58 GeV/nucleon. The work is in progress, however, the results may already provide insight into the kaon-nucleon interaction.  The transverse flow of Λ baryons is the first such result in this energy regime.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]  G. Agakichievet al., Eur. Phys. J. A41, 243-277 (2009)\r\n[2]  C. Hartnacket al., Phys.

By measuring changes in particle yields as a function of energy, one can explore the properties of matter at the phase transition. The NA61/SHINE experiment, a fixed-target project at the SPS facility at CERN, conducted a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by varying both the beam momentum (from 13 to 150/158 GeV/c) and the size of the colliding ions (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This approach offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of the phase transition.\r\nA key objective of the NA61/SHINE program is to investigate the properties at the onset of deconfinement (specifically, the energy threshold for the transition from a hadron gas to quark-gluon plasma) by measuring the strangeness-to-entropy ratio in the produced system. This presentation will discuss the latest results on charged hadron production, focusing on kaons, pions, and their ratios in Pb+Pb interactions.

      "Abstract": "We investigate the event multiplicity dependence of heavy-flavor jet production in p+p collisions at RHIC, focusing on the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI). Due to differences in mass and color charge, heavy-flavor jets are expected to fragment differently from jets originating from light partons. While jet quenching, a key signature of the quark-gluon plasma in AA collisions, is unlikely in small systems due to limited volume, MPI in high-multiplicity events in p+p collisions could still modify jet characteristics. Thus, studying heavy-flavor jet modification in high-multiplicity p+p collisions is of significant interest. In 2024, the sPHENIX experiment at RHIC achieved high-statistics p+p data collection, equipped with full hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters and precision silicon pixel and strip detectors near the interaction point. This setup enables, for the first time, a detailed investigation of heavy-flavor jet modifications due to MPI in p+p collisions. The latest progress from this study will be presented.",

The INTT was operated in extended trigger mode and streaming mode.

This approach could increase the measurable $J/\\psi$ sample by up to a factor 5, compared to traditional techniques effective for electrons with energies above 2GeV.

      "Abstract": "The sPHENIX experiment operating at RHIC aims to make high precision measurements of jets and heavy flavor observables for a wide selection of nuclear collision systems. Its tracking system is composed primarily of 4 subsystems that work in tandem to reconstruct the path of ionizing radiation through the detector geometry. Starting with the innermost detector and moving radially outward, the MVTX yields precise vertexing information and the finest position resolution, the INTT provides precise timing resolution on the order of tens of nanoseconds to associate tracks with the bunch crossing which produced them, the TPC works as the primary tracker which gives the majority of track clusters and is the foundation of the momentum resolution obtained, and the TPOT helps correct for static and dynamic space charge distortions in the TPC. It is crucial that we are able to understand the acceptance and efficiency of this tracking system as a whole in order to produce meaningful physics results. We employ a tag-and-probe scheme applied to several decay modes as a means of using data to determine the efficiency of the sPHENIX tracking system. Additionally, we compare the results of this measurement with a large truth-associated simulated sample of the same decay modes in order to validate our observations.",

      "Abstract": "sPHENIX, located at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, is a multipurpose proton and ion collider detector, and a central piece of its physics program is the measurement of open heavy flavor production in both pp and AuAu collision systems. Production of D mesons, both prompt and as cascade decays from B mesons, provide clean probes of the Quark Gluon Plasma. In sPEHNIX, these charm hadrons will be reconstructed via their decays to charged particles and their associated reconstructed tracks originating from a secondary vertex. The reconstruction of these secondary vertices is required to distinguish open heavy flavor events from background processes, and in sPHENIX this is achieved with the MAPS Vertex Detector (MVTX). The MVTX is a Monolithic Activated Pixel Sensor (MAPS) detector consisting of three layers of 48 staves total, each with 9 sensor chips providing coverage of |η| < 1. To ensure the track reconstruction and vertexing achieves optimum performance, it is necessary to ensure the MAPS chips, staves, layers, and half detector components are aligned to a precision of O(10 μm). The relative alignment of the MVTX is thus performed using a combination of collision data from sPHENIX run 24 with 200 GeV pp collisions for high statistics and cosmic ray events to constrain bulk transformations and weak modes. The alignment is performed iteratively through a combination of 3D Distance of Closest Approach minimization and use of global alignment fit package, Millepede II. The results of the MVTX alignment is shown, including representative event displays, and residual distributions demonstrating the achieved precision of the MVTX alignment.",

Searching for charm and bottom jets is one of most challenging measurements in collider experiments due to their rare production rate and extensive backgrounds. The sPHENIX experiment has collected $13.3~pb^{-1}$ of triggered full-system (i.e, tracking+calorimeter) data with 1.5~mrad crossing angle and $|z_{vertex}|<10~$cm in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions of Run~2024. We will present the heavy flavor jet studies using both the traditional selection methods and new Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in sPHENIX 200 GeV $p$+$p$ simulation. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to tag the jet flavor, and is expected to significantly enhance the jet identification performance especially for bottom and charm jets. We will also discuss the ongoing studies of sPHENIX Run~2024 data quality assurance (QA) and calibration such as tracking qualities related with the heavy flavor jet measurements.",

      "Abstract": "The directed flow ($v_1$) is a sensitive probe of the initial state conditions in heavy-ion collisions. One key initial condition is the presence of a strong electromagnetic field, which induces charge splitting between particles and antiparticles and has important implications for the QCD phase transition and the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Another crucial aspect of the initial state is the deposition of baryon charge, which can be specifically probed through the directed flow of baryons, offering insights into baryon transport within the QGP [2].\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we shall present measurements of directed flow $(v_1)$ for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, and $p(\\bar{p})$ in Au+Au, isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, and U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV, as recorded by the STAR experiment at RHIC. For the first time, we observe a clear system size dependence in the slope, $dv_1/dy$, for $p (\\bar{p})$ and the difference in slope between particle and antiparticle, $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$, while the sum of the slopes for baryons ($p+\\bar{p}$) shows no such dependence. In contrast, neither the difference nor the sum of the $v_1$ slopes for mesons ($\\pi^\\pm$ and $K^\\pm$) shows system size dependence [3]. This behavior is qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic model, providing insights into baryon deposition and transport. Additionally, the observed $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ pattern across different systems may also help constrain the strength of electromagnetic fields and the conductivity of the medium. \r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, Phys.

      "Abstract": "A significant $\\phi$-meson global spin alignment ($\\rho_{00}$) signal was measured in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\le62$ GeV [1]. Conventional physics mechanisms such as $s(\\bar{s})$ spin polarization fail to accommodate this $\\rho_{00}$ signal, motivating further exploration into its origin. Recently, studies from a general framework using the gauge/gravity duality predict that in heavy ion collisions, there could be non-zero helicity-frame spin alignment generated by the relative motion of $s\\bar{s}$ pairs to the thermal background. This helicity frame spin alignment could lead to significant global $\\rho_{00}$ [2]. It has also been shown that both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of a vector meson's spin density matrix are sensitive to local spin correlations between the quark and anti-quark [3]. In this talk, we explore the relationships between $\\phi$-meson global and helicity-frame spin density matrix elements through Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a new method to extract $\\rho_{00}$ simultaneously with the off-diagonal elements from the 2-dimensional angular dimensions, i.e., the polar and azimuthal angles of the direction of a daughter kaon's momentum in the $\\phi$-meson's rest frame with respect to the chosen spin-quantization axis. This 2-dimensional method allows us to consider possible effects from finite geometric acceptance and detector efficiencies, which could couple to the spin density matrix elements and non-trivially influence the extraction of these elements. The effects of finite elliptic flow and various kinematic selections are also examined.

Investigating collective signals in these small systems can provide critical insights into the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma.\r\nTo explore this, we compare several models: the hadronic transport model SMASH, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid approach, and Angantyr, which serves as a baseline without collective effects. Our setup allows to compare calculations with and without hydrodynamic evolution on equal footing. We calculate the elliptic and triangular flow coefficients as a function of centrality and multiplicity in O-O collisions at sqrt(s)=7TeV, using both Woods-Saxon and alpha-clustered nuclear configurations.

These processes are implemented approximately after the PYTHIA8 shower, with careful modeling of spacetime structure and tracking of color flow in the final-state interactions.

      "Abstract": "Based on a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to thermodynamics of QCD we explain why the abundances of hadrons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model with a sudden chemical freeze-out at a well-defined hadronization temperature despite the fact that state of the art results of lattice QCD indicate a smooth chiral crossover. The hadrons are treated as color singlet multiquark clusters in medium with a background gluon field in the Polyakov gauge coupled to the underlying chiral quark dynamics. The confining aspect of QCD is accounted for by a large vacuum quark mass motivated by a confining density functional approach. At low temperatures the HRG phase appears as a statistical ensemble of the multiquark clusters. Restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperatures triggers their Mott dissociation and deconfinement of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While perfectly reproducing the smooth behavior of entropy density [1] and chiral condensate of lattice QCD [2], the approach indicates an abrupt switching between the hadrons and partons. This is manifested by a rapid change of the ratio of baryon number susceptibilities $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ from the value of HRG to the one of QGP [2]. We report for the first time that $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ shall not be mistaken for a measure of the fraction of hadrons in the system. Its deviation from unity below the chiral restoration temperature can actually quantify a repulsive residual interactions in the HRG. We associate it with the effects of Pauli blocking and model by a temperature dependent correction to the phase shift of baryons, in accordance with lattice QCD results on $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ [2]. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

Various measurements for different quarkonium species at RHIC and the LHC indicate that their suppression levels follow the ordering of their binding energies. Additionally, recombination effects are substantial in nucleus-nucleus collisions, particularly charmonium states. However, questions still remain about disentangling the various in-medium effects and how they contribute to the final observables.\r\nOn the other hand, quarkonium production in small systems is another complex topic, with recent unexpected experimental results. \r\nSHINCHON (Simulation for Heavy IoN Collision with Heavy-quark and ONia) is a simulation framework that tries to address these challenges with tracking the quarkonium survival probabilities during the space-time evolution of the medium. The interaction mechanisms are based on theoretical calculations of gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering.

      "Abstract": "The CBM experiment at the future FAIR facility is a multipurpose forward spectrometer designed to operate at high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, implementing a triggerless, free-streaming readout system. CBM aims to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at high baryon net density, where phenomena such as a first-order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter and a chiral phase transition are anticipated.\r\nAs the primary tracking detector of the CBM experiment, the Silicon Tracking System (STS) is engineered to efficiently reconstruct trajectories of charged particles, achieving a momentum resolution better than 2% within a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to be capable of identifying complex decay topologies. The STS consists of 876 modules arranged in eight tracking stations, keeping a low material budget of less than 10% X₀. The core component of STS is the detector module, which integrates double-sided, double-metal silicon microstrip sensors connected via low-mass microcables to custom-developed readout ASICs mounted on two front-end electronics boards.\r\nCurrently, the STS project is focused on the series production of modules and ladders for the final detector. This phase involves precise assembly and rigorous quality control procedures at every fabrication step. Comprehensive functional and thermal stress testing is conducted on fully assembled modules to ensure their reliability before integration onto carbon-fiber ladders. Simultaneously, the operational capabilities of the STS modules are assessed in various application scenarios, including high-intensity nucleus-nucleus collisions at GSI facilities and the E16 experiment at J-PARC, which serve as platforms for performance evaluation.\r\nThis report offers an overview of the CBM STS module and ladder production process, presents results from functional testing, and shares insights gained from operational deployments across different experimental setups.",

      "Speaker": "Liuyao Zhang",
      "Institute": "Fudan University (CN)",
      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "We extensively investigate the mean transverse momentum fluctuations concerning centrality and energy dependences in Au–Au collisions at 3.0–19.6 GeV using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. Inspired by prior research, we have adjusted the key parameter, the Lund string fragmentation parameter bL, to manifest an approximately linear dependence on the impact parameter. Consequently, the mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩ appropriately demonstrates a dependence on centrality classes. In addition, the dependence of bL on the impact parameter systematically increases with rising beam energy. This adjustment enables the AMPT model to reasonably describe the energy dependence of mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩. The improved AMPT provides a reliable platform to calculate pT fluctuations by qualitatively describing the data production of pion^± in 0–5% centrality around midrapidity (|y|< 0.1) at available incident energies. In line with previous findings, power-law dependences of pT cumulants of all orders on collision centrality N_{part} are observed at higher energies. Furthermore, the scaled cumulants normalized by the mean ⟨pT⟩ are computed, and the corresponding variances align well with the trends observed in experimental measurements. Then, the scaled cumulants also are applied using two subevent methods, where the component of short-range correlation is suppressed compared to the calculations performed using the standard method. Our cumulant method exhibits a robust framework for investigating high-order transverse momentum fluctuations.",

      "Abstract": "Neutron Stars (NSs) make a unique physical laboratory with extreme physical conditions that are irreproducible in experiments and capable of inducing a hadron-to-quark deconfinement phase transition in their interior. Given the high densities reached by the cold nuclear matter in NSs, it is speculated that NS cores may contain deconfined quark matter (QM). State-of-the-art inputs from multi-disciplinary physics (like the chiral effective field theory, astrophysical observations, and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)) can constrain QM in NSs. We show this by imposing new constraints on the widely accepted phenomenological MIT Bag model for QM, allowing for a mixed phase, and further using them to comment on the phase of matter in NS cores. We also find that the pQCD constraint is crucial in constraining the strong interaction coupling at NS energies. If the deconfined QM is more stable than ordinary nuclear matter, such a phase transition is known to form exotic compact objects known as Strange Stars (SSs) made of strange quark matter. We discuss various observational signatures and how the future gravitational wave detectors and the upcoming electromagnetic telescopes can be used to probe quark matter in neutron stars. This is also important from the point of view of fundamental physics as it holds the potential to settle the long-standing problem of the true ground state of matter in the universe.",

Their natural separation of physical effects at different scales have made them very attractive for studying a wide range of phenomena in high energy particle physics.

Recently, we introduced a new parameterization that features a simpler phase space and preserves the information on orientation of the particles. Concretely, our new parameterization reduces the computational cost of computing an N-point correlator on a jet with M particles to M^2 log(M), independent of the value of N. This computational speed up would be very beneficial in aiding the ongoing studies of energy correlators in the medium where M is typically very large.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a novel transport phenomenon that offers the unique opportunity for experimental observation of transitions between different vacuum topological sectors of QCD. A measurement of the CME signal also helps probe the dynamical magnetic field as well as chiral symmetry restoration, which are key ingredients of the phenomenon. Significant efforts have been made to search for the CME in heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. Very recently (2024) the STAR Collaboration reported interesting new measurements from Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) data and extracted CME signals over a broad energy range. The results show a strong signal (~3 sigma) around the intermediate energy range which approaches zero at both low and high energy. Such a highly nontrivial pattern calls for theoretical understanding. This talk presents much-needed calculations aimed at deciphering the interpretations of these new data, based on an improved event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD) framework that is suitable for BES-II energies and well-calibrated with experimental data on bulk properties. At each specific beam energy, we then generate a large sample of EBE-AVFD simulation events and compute the inclusive correlation observables as well as the background-removed signal contributions. We further utilize Bayesian analysis to extract the key parameters, such as magnetic field lifetime and initial axial charge, from the latest experimental measurements. This allows us to map out the beam energy dependence of those key parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for how the dynamical magnetic field lifetime as well as the chiral symmetry restoration evolve with beam energy in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Shear and bulk viscosities are two key transport coefficients that characterize the fundamental properties of quark-gluon plasma. They quantify the response of the energy-momentum tensor to the shear flow and divergent flow, serving as crucial input parameters for the phenomenological and transport models that interpret experimental data, e.g. the elliptic flow $v_2$. \r\n\r\n  However, calculating these inherently non-perturbative viscosities within lattice QCD presents challenges due to strong ultraviolet fluctuations in the relevant operators. The traditional approach using the multi-level algorithm has the limitation that it applies only in the quenched approximation, as done in [1, 2]. Recently, the gradient flow method was introduced to address this issue [3], opening the path to studies in full QCD. However, [3] examined only a single temperature, $1.5T_c$. \r\n\r\n  In this talk, we present results extending [3] to a wide temperature range from $0.76T_c $ to $2.25T_c $,  with particular focus on the phase transition region and high-temperature regime. The former helps us to understand how the system behaves under the critical change, a topic of wide concern in the community. The latter allows us to compare against the NLO perturbative estimate, which becomes more reliable at high temperature.

First, we study diffractive vector meson production at small-x in the collision of electrons and polarized deuterons as anticipated at the Electron Ion Collider. We consider the polarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which results in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when the deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section exhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized deuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius provides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave function at small-x. We further study anisotropic flow with respect to the polarization axis in Pb+d collisions which will be possible at SMOGII at the LHC. This measurement is sensitive to the spatial structure of the deuteron via the conversion of initial geometry to observable momentum distributions by final state effects. Both measurements will provide new independent insight into the spatial structure of polarized deuterons. The same methods can be applied to other light ions, such as $^3$He, $^7$Li, or $^{7,9}$Be.\r\n\r\nRef: H. Mäntysaari, F. Salazar, B. Schenke, C. Shen, W.

      "Abstract": "Although calculations of QCD thermodynamics from first-principle lattice simulations are limited to zero net-density due to the fermion sign problem, it is possible to extend the equation of state (EoS) to finite values of the $B$, $Q$, $S$ chemical potentials via expansions around zero chemical potentials. Taylor expansion around $μ_i = 0$ with $i = B, Q, S$ enables to cover with confidence the region up to $\\frac{μ_i}{T} < 2.5$, and is usually limited at 450 MeV in any chemical potential. Thanks to a new method based on a T'-expansion scheme, it was however possible to extend the reach of the extrapolation in the $(T, μ_B)$ plane, up to a baryo-chemical potential around $\\frac{μ_B}{T} = 3.5$. We present here a generalization of this scheme in which all three chemical potentials can be varied independently. We base our construction on continuum-estimated susceptibilities, obtained with the 4stout action on lattices with up to Nτ = 16, 20 and 24 time slices, depending on the quantity considered. As a result, we are able to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four dimensional QCD phase diagram compared to extrapolations based on the Taylor expansion.",

      "Abstract": "We use a potential model to investigate the phenomenology of quarkonium in a thermal rotating medium, where vorticity and spin density are not necessarily in equilibrium. We find that the quarkonium spin density matrix, as well as the binding energy and melting temperature, are sensitive to both the vorticity and the lack of equilibrium between vorticity and spin. This means that quarkonium spin alignment is a sensitive probe for vorticity and spin within the hydrodynamic phase.\r\nFurthermore the melting temperature dependence provides a potential new mechanism, ``distillation``, to polarize specifically quarkonium states (including the phi, if it can be considered as such) and potentially explain the dependence of quarkonium suppression in rapidity.\r\nInformation unequivocably pointing to spin-orbit non-equilibrium dynamics can be obtained from a combined study of quarkonium relative abundance and spin alignment, as well as experimentally obtainable off-diagonal density matrix elements. \r\n\r\nBased on\r\n\r\n[1] Kayman J.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "It has recently been realized that in the ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, mean transverse momentum of hadrons contains the information of the fundamental thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, in nucleus-nucleus collisions the linear correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the charged multiplicity is attributed to the QCD speed of sound,  which promotes theoretical and experimental investigations. However, these studies suffer from the contamination of fluctuations, either physical or non-physical. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we focus on the ultra-central collisions of small colliding system, such as proton-lead, where effects of fluctuations are more pronounced in comparison to the nucleus-nucleus collision systems. Following the standard strategy, via event-by-event hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the QCD speed of sound by analyzing the variation of the mean transverse momentum with particle multiplicity in the mid-rapidity region. Although a linear correlations is realized in our results, between the mean transverse momentum and the effective temperature as well as between the charged particle multiplicity and the total entropy, the extracted speed of sound is significantly suppressed due to the presence of fluctuations. To remove such suppression from fluctuations, we propose a systematic subtraction scheme via the corrections captured by the measured variance of the mean transverse momentum (or the effective temperature), etc. \r\n\r\nGiven the consistent extraction of the speed of sound in small colliding systems, our results support the correlation between mean transverse momentum and charged multiplicity from QCD thermodynamics, which further provides an alternative and direct signature of QGP thermalization.",

Due to time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment—defined as the 00-component of tensor polarization—appears at second order in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We analyze the physical implications of the various contributions to vector and tensor polarization, identifying that spin alignment can arise from the curl of the rotational component of thermal vorticity and the gradient of the acceleration component, contributions previously unexplored. These formulae predict a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions via numerical simulations.",

We then lay the theoretical foundations for the analytic evaluation of the small system corrections to the NLO $\\phi^4$ theory equation of state: we introduce a new regularization scheme appropriate for systems without the symmetries necessary for dimensional regularization, and then apply this regularization scheme to determine the finite system size corrections to the running of the coupling.  An estimate of the effect of small system corrections on the equation state are again large, order 50%. These small system corrections to thermodynamic quantities therefore must be taken into account when comparing hydrodynamics calculations to collective observables in small systems such as central pA and high-multiplicity pp collisions.",

Various theoretical predictions and experimental results indicate spectral changes of vector mesons in medium. Precise measurements of the mass spectrum of vector mesons at finite density are very informative. The J-PARC E16 experiment aims to measure the mass spectra of $\\rho$, $\\omega$, and $\\phi$ mesons at normal nuclear density. Vector mesons are produced in 30 GeV proton-nucleus reactions and their invariant mass spectra are reconstructed via electron-positron decays with a mass resolution of 5.8 MeV/c$^{2}$. Several types of experimental targets, carbon, copper, and lead, are used to measure the nuclear mass-number dependence. To obtain extremely high statistics, we use a high intensity beam of 1 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ proton/spill (2-sec spill length and 4.24-sec cycle) supplied at the J-PARC high momentum beamline. \r\nWe started the first commissioning run of the newly constructed beamline and spectrometer in 2020. As reported in QM2023, the detectors were successfully operated in the high-rate environment with sufficient performance. However, the time microstructure of the beam was observed deteriorating DAQ efficiency and increasing fake triggers. To address this issue, we developed the DAQ with reduced busy time and re-optimized the trigger condition with the new beam optics in the beamtime performed from April to June 2024. Concurrently, we collected the preliminary data of vector mesons with the improved beam/trigger/DAQ conditions, ahead of the first physics run planned in 2025. The successful operation of the overall system was confirmed, observing the mass spectrum of $\\omega$ mesons for the first time with the J-PARC E16 experiment. In this presentation, the commissioning results will be summarized and detailed spectra of the $\\omega$ mesons on copper/carbon targets will be discussed.

Recent lattice QCD studies using imaginary chemical potentials, based on simulations at temperatures above 120 MeV and utilizing Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, suggest that the critical temperature at the CEP, $ T_c^{CEP}$, should be around 110 MeV [\\[1\\]][1].

This enables us to apply multi-point Padé approximants and compute Fourier coefficients of the baryon number density in the complex chemical potential plane.

      "Abstract": "Recent heavy-ion collision experiments at intermediate energies are intensively focused on probing the QCD phase diagram to reveal critical behavior associated with the possible critical point. In these collisions, the produced fireball exhibits significant inhomogeneity along the rapidity direction, covering a broad region of the QCD phase diagram. This spatial variation offers a unique opportunity to study critical phenomena in greater detail. **To capitalize on this opportunity, we focus on studying higher-order cumulants of conserved charges beyond mid-rapidity region—the rapidity scan method that complements the traditional beam energy scan approach.**\r\n\r\nHowever, to accurately identify critical signals, it is essential to establish a complete baseline that accounts for non-critical background effects. **In this talk, we present our work on establishing such a baseline for rapidity scans.** Our studies reveal that conservation effects of baryon number can cause cumulant measurements to mimic critical behavior, potentially leading to false positives [1]. To overcome this challenge, **we introduce a novel observable—the cross-cumulant—for rapidity scans, designed to be sensitive to critical fluctuations while being less affected by conservation effects.** Using hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate how cross-cumulants can effectively distinguish genuine critical signals from background effects. Our results indicate that cross-cumulants provide a powerful tool for future experiments aiming to explore the QCD critical point through rapidity scans. We discuss the implications of our findings for ongoing and upcoming heavy-ion collision programs, and outline how this method can enhance the search for critical phenomena in the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

      "Abstract": "A key physical target of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to understand the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and search for the critical endpoint (CEP). The primary experimental approach to locating the CEP is measuring the baryon number fluctuations. In the energy region currently being studied, the baryon number is primarily carried by protons and neutrons. Due to experimental limitations, we cannot measure the uncharged neutrons directly. Thus, in experiments, baryon number fluctuations are approximated by measuring proton number fluctuations. We have discovered a method to extract the missing neutron information from the bound states of protons and neutrons, i.e., from light nuclei. This allows us to accurately reconstruct baryon number fluctuations by measuring light nuclei and protons. We analytically calculated the relationship between light nuclei number fluctuations and baryon number fluctuations. Furthermore, we validated it using transport models. This result is vital in the search for CEP. Additionally, it inspires us how to reconstruct the losing neutron information through light nuclei.",

We explore its applicability across the entire spectrum of available collision systems, including p+p, p+Pb, p+Au, d+Au, $^3$He+Au, O+O, Xe+Xe, Au+Au, and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and/or the LHC. We show that for systems smaller than O+O the pressure anisotropy never becomes small enough to be reliably described by standard viscous fluid dynamics.

      "Abstract": "We study the dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma. Concretely, we calculate the complete momentum broadening probability distribution due to interactions with the plasma. This calculation includes and goes beyond the classic results for the drag coefficient $\\eta_D$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\\kappa_T$, $\\kappa_L$, and also allows one to read off the value of $\\hat{q}$ for light-like particles. We use this probability distribution to derive the Kolmogorov equation (a generalized Fokker-Planck equation) that determines how the momentum distribution of heavy quarks evolves as they propagate through a thermal plasma. Our results display previously unquantified features about the dynamics of heavy quarks, such as the correlation between momentum broadening and energy loss, along with all of the higher order moments of the momentum broadening distribution. Most strikingly, we show that even though $\\kappa_L$ and $\\eta_D$ do not satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation, the stationary solution to the aforementioned Kolmogorov equation is, in fact, a Boltzmann distribution. All of the higher order moments of the broadening distribution contribute in an essential fashion to achieving kinetic equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the many similarities between QCD at temperatures around $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, not least in the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$ as evidenced by recent lattice QCD calculations, we expect that this calculation in strongly coupled SYM plasma will serve as a useful reference point from which to gain intuition into the strongly coupled dynamics of QCD.",

The CMS Collaboration has used this approach to extract values of the speed of sound remarkably consistent with lattice QCD calculations [2]. We use a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions based inviscid relativistic hydrodynamics to study the relation between the speed of sound and the hadronic multiplicity and average energy.  We derive an analytical expression for the speed of sound in terms of the total particle multiplicity and average energy, which we relate to the original proposal. We discuss the role of rapidity and $p_T$ cuts in breaking the relation between the true speed of sound and the one obtained from multiplicity and $p_T$ measurements, finding corrections that depends on the system's lifetime and initial conditions [3].\r\n\r\n[1] F.

      "Abstract": "We explore the thermodynamic geometry in the context of the chiral phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics. In particular the thermodynamic curvature, $R$, provides insights into the system's fluctuations and critical behavior and thus can be considered as an alternative way to approach the study of critical phenomena. Building upon previous studies, we incorporate bosonic fluctuations through the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique, a non-perturbative approach suitable for investigating critical phenomena, reformulating the flow equation into an advection-diffusion type equation within the local potential approximation for the effective average action.\r\nWe study how the sign of $R$ changes near the chiral crossover and the critical point, providing insights into the underlying dynamics of the phase transition. The results indicate that $R$ exhibits a peak close to the chiral crossover and that the inclusion of fluctuations generally lowers the  magnitude peak these peaks. At low chemical potential, $R$ remains negative, showing that the inclusion of bosonic fluctuations prevents the system from overcoming the  fermionic repulsion among quarks. We further explore the low-Chemical potential regime by artificially lowering the pion mass, approaching the chiral limit where the crossover transitions to a second-order phase change.\r\nAs the baryion Chemical potential increases towards the critical point, R develops shaprer peaks and undergoes a sign change, consistent with findings from mean-field theory. Thus, our analysis supports the idea that the thermodynamic curvature R is sensitive to the chiral crossovers and chiral phase transition, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior near criticality.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of heavy baryon production in pp, pA and AA collisions from RHIC to top LHC energies have recently attracted more and more attention, currently representing a challenge for the heavy-quark hadronization theoretical understanding. \r\nAn hybrid coalescence plus fragmentation approach has been able to correctly predict the large baryon over meson ratio $\\Lambda_c/D^0\\sim O(1)$ \r\nobserved in both AA collisions at RHIC and LHC [2] as well as in pp collisions at $5.02$ and $13 \\rm \\;TeV$. The ratio obtained is, in general, quite larger than the one measured and expected in $e^+e^-$, $ep$ collisions.\r\nFurthermore, with the same approach, also a quite large $\\Xi_c/D^0\\sim 0.15$ and $\\Omega_c/D^0\\sim 0.05$ has been predicted in $pp$ collisions at $5.02 \\rm \\;TeV$, and appears to be in quite good agreement with the early ALICE measurements [3]. \r\nGiven such successful predictions, we present here a critical assessment of the elements of the hadronization modeling that are mainly driving heavy baryon enhancement, moreover we discuss the extensions of the approach applied in order to supply the prediction for the multi-charmed baryon production, i.e. $\\Xi_{cc}$, $\\Omega_{cc}$ and $\\Omega_{ccc}$, over a wide system size scan from $PbPb$ to $KrKr$, $ArAr$ and $OO$ [4], and the bottomed hadron production in $pp$ and $PbPb$ collisions [5][6]. Furthermore we present a new extension of the same approach for charm and bottom quarkonia in $pp$ collisions, i.e. $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$[7]. \r\nWe can compare the coalescence prediction with the SHM one and on the other hand we can  investigate the impact on the production coming from non-equilibrium features in the heavy quark distribution.\r\nIn fact, the model can acquire the heavy quark distribution from a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach or from a Langevin one with a space transport coefficient $D_s$ in agreement with lattice QCD data.\r\n\r\n[1] V.

      "Abstract": "In this presentation, we investigate femtoscopy correlation functions to access the interactions of protons across various hadrons with different baryon numbers. Beginning with the proton-pion system, we apply the results of the unitarized chiral effective theory into the TROY (T-matrix-based Routine for HAdrOn FemtoscopY) framework to predict measurable correlation functions in high-multiplicity p+p collisions. Next, we explore the proton-omega baryon correlation (B=2) employing an effective theory that incorporates both the baryon octet and decuplet in combination with the Schrödinger equation. In this case we incorporate the $^3S_1$ channel, not included in the recent ALICE analysis, and leading to a potential impact of additional inelastic channels. Finally, we address the proton-deuteron (B=3) correlation function using an effective potential in higher partial waves to model correlation functions for both p+p (ALICE) and Au+Au (STAR) collisions. We obtain a reasonable description of the experimental data with a two-body dynamics challenging previous claims in the literature about the nature of the proton-deuteron interaction at low energies.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n 1.

We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.\r\n\r\nRef.

Two different Woods-Saxon parametrizations per U and Au are used, allowing for comparisons within our model.

We also present our prediction for the $v_2-\\langle p_T \\rangle$ correlation [arXiv:2308.09816], which were later found to match very well the experimental result by STAR [arXiv:2401.06625], thus demonstrating that momentum-flow correlations are sensitive probes of nuclear deformation.

      "Abstract": "The states of matter produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions can be highly anisotropic. If such a feature is sufficiently pronounced, one should expect the final particle distribution inside jets to reflect it in the form of non-trivial angle correlations. In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\\bar q$ state branching from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. \r\nWe find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution, from azimuthally dependent energy-energy correlators and from final state transverse spin polarization measures. We further discuss how to incorporate these effects into the description of other hard probes of the medium.",

To model the plasma formed in central high-energy nuclear collisions, we consider a system that expands boost-invariantly along the longitudinal (beam) direction and develops azimuthally symmetric transverse flow. Using the Boltzmann equation and a special set of moments of the kinetic distribution function, we analyze the interplay between longitudinal and transverse dynamics of the matter, describing the transition from early-time far-off-equilibrium regime to near equilibrium hydrodynamic regime. We show that, while the rapid longitudinal expansion of the system strongly hinders the approach to hydrodynamic regime, only a few scatterings among particles can reproduce hydrodynamic-like behavior in the transverse plane. We discuss the implications of this behavior for understanding collective phenomena in heavy-ion collisions and also in small systems.",

Special emphasis is given to the phase structure at zero temperature and large baryon densities. The model includes the nucleon and its chiral partner. It also accommodates a nucleon mass that is compatible with the chiral symmetry of QCD, in contrast to many other relativistic model calculations. This residual nucleon mass delays the chiral symmetry restoration to densities typically greater than ten times the saturation density. We consider isospin-symmetric and isospin-asymmetric matter, continuously increasing the neutron excess all the way to pure neutron matter. We eventually compute the equation of state of neutron matter and the speed of sound, and confront the results in a semi-quantitative analysis to neutron-star observations and microscopic many-body calculations.

      "Abstract": "To understand the surprising accuracy of hydrodynamic predictions for the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions, many have turned to studying attractor solutions in the underlying kinetic theory. Aside from experimentally motivated assumptions such as Bjorken flow, ignoring the presence of spatial gradients has often been helpful to facilitate theoretical calculations. We challenge this simplification by introducing spatial transverse gradients in the system, thereby extending the approach of [1], and show how these facilitate the thermalisation of the system by coupling different spherical harmonic modes in momentum space on a new timescale inversely related to the strength of the gradients. We further demonstrate the influence of the gradients on the attractor solutions and relate the dynamics of the system to the eigenspectrum of an effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian.\r\n \r\nReferences: [1] Brewer, Jasmine, Weiyao Ke, Li Yan, and Yi Yin. \"Far-from-equilibrium slow modes and momentum anisotropy in an expanding plasma.\" Physical Review D 109, no. 9 (2024): L091504.",

Being loosely bound systems via residual strong interactions, their existence in the hot and dense medium, is very unlikely and possess interesting questions on their production mechanism in these energetic collisions. In the present contribution we will describe a ``thermo-coalescence'' model, a hybrid mechanism to describe the light nuclei production at ultra-relativistic energies. In this approach the transverse momentum distribution of protons are first fitted following a hydro-inspired boost-invariant blast-wave model. The extracted parameters are then used to describe the spectra of light nuclei using a coalescence prescription. Analysis of the measured yield and spectra of the deuterons  and tritons produced in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions at LHC for various centralities will be discussed in detail",

This arises in models of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions and cold atomic gases, for the latter this has been experimentally realized. Nonthermal fixed points are characterized by a universal scaling function and power law exponents. Using QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle approximation, we study how these systems approach the universal regime. Simulations of isotropic, homogeneous gluon gases show that perturbations on top of the scaling function decay following power laws while oscillating, i.e. damped oscillations characterized by complex frequencies. Similar to how quasinormal modes in black hole spacetimes dictate thermalization in strongly coupled quantum field theories via AdS/CFT, we refer to these frequencies as the quasinormal modes of a nonthermal fixed point. We calculate the spectrum of quasinormal modes and find qualitative agreements with the results of time evolution in kinetic theory. This research indicates the first evidence of new physical phenomena around nonthermal fixed points. We expect these to appear in weak coupling models of nuclear collisions at very early times and to be observable in existing cold atom experiments.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are formed in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions and hence carry comprehensive information about the entire evolution of the initial non-equilibrium glasma phase to a quark-gluon plasma phase, its subsequent hydrodynamic evolution and hadronization at later stages. One of the quantities of interest to model this evolution and to compare with experimental observations is the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$, which determines how strongly these interact with the medium. We estimate $\\kappa$ relevant for the pre-thermalization stage in a highly occupied state of SU(2) gauge fields inspired from the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. For this we implement for the the first time, relativistic evolution of heavy quarks in the mass range of charm and bottom quarks in a background of over-populated SU(2) gauge fields which are evolved using classical-statistical real-time lattice techniques. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, in out-of-equilibrium conditions, we find that the momentum distribution of heavy quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features at initial times eventually going over to a diffusive regime, where we extract the momentum diffusion coefficient [1]. We find a sizeable discrepancy between the results, calculated earlier in the static limit. We further discuss our results to provide an estimate of kinetic equilibration times for charm and bottom quarks relevant for heavy-ion experiments.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Harshit Pandey, Soeren Schlichting, and Sayantan Sharma.

In this work, we employ a linearized approach, allowing us to separately simulate the background energy-momentum evolution of a charge-neutral fluid and the stochastic baryon fluctuation/diffusion processes, which largely reduces computation cost while maintaining sufficient precision.\r\nWe implement this linearized stochastic charge evolution in the viscous hydrodynamic code MUSIC, and find that it nicely describes the two-point correlation of 1+1-d analytical solutions for various EoS and transport coefficients.

Heavy ion collision with $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ <$\\sim$5 GeV is expected to be most advantageous to generate and study such ultra-high densities($\\rho>3\\rho_{0}$).\r\nJ-PARC Heavy Ion Project(J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project aimed at studying the ultra-high density matter by using a heavy ion beam with the most suitable energy(1-12 AGeV). While the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, the J-PARC HI will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible with only adding the injector. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme at the latter stage of the injector are being studied in detail by the J-PARC facility.\r\nWe have the staging plan of the project divided into two stages. The main difference between each stage is whether the booster ring is a reuse of the KEK-Proton Synchrotron or newly constructed. Even in the early stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of 10$^{8}$Hz. In the final stage, the world’s highest intensity heavy ion beam of 10$^{11}$Hz is expected. \r\nThe primary goal of the first stage is considered to observe non-confined phases in high-density regions by temperature measurement via di-electron radiation. To achieve this, we have already proposed an upgrade plan for the J-PARC E16 experiment. As an additional step, we believe it is important to discover an anomalous increase in low-mass electron pairs, which is expected to be a sign of the onset of CSC. To observe this effect, we are considering a detector system with emphasis on wide acceptance and measurement of soft processes. By emphasizing measurement of soft processes with wide acceptance, it becomes possible to access important themes such as fluctuations and multi-particle correlations for not only di-electron, and it will also be complementary to CBM.

While jets were originally proposed to circumvent non-perturbative effects and probe QCD at perturbative scales, we show that their substructure can be a powerful tool to investigate hadronization. In this study, we employ the charge correlation ratio, which evaluates the probability of jet production with same-sign or opposite-sign leading charged particles charges, already shown to be sensitive to hadronization effects. We find that this sensitivity can be enhanced by selections on jet substructure, particularly by analysing the relative placement of splittings that resolve the leading charged particles within the clustering tree. Our findings reveal remarkable differences between widely used hadronization models (Lund string and cluster fragmentation), contributing to a better understanding of the hadronization process and opening new avenues for exploring non-perturbative QCD.",

Recent data from the STAR experiment in Au+Au collisions at 3 GeV, particularly on the transverse momentum, rapidity distributions, and collective flow of light nuclei and hypernuclei, provide a valuable opportunity to further explore properties of high baryon density matter.\r\n\r\nWe employ the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) model to investigate the sensitivity of various observables to different equation-of-state scenarios. We consider two static EoS models, labeled \"soft\" and \"hard\", which differ in compressibility modulus, as well as a momentum-dependent soft EoS model. In PHQMD, (hyper)nuclei are formed dynamically throughout the entire heavy-ion collision by the potential interaction between nucleons, which is sensitive to the EoS. In this talk, by comparing PHQMD simulations with STAR experimental data on particle spectra and flow at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 3 GeV, we find that the production of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as well as their collective flow, are sensitive to the choice of the EoS. By analyzing these observables, we can gain valuable information about the underlying nuclear interactions and the properties of dense matter. Our results demonstrate the potential of hypernuclei as powerful probes of the high-density EoS and provide important insights for future experiments like CBM at FAIR.",

      "Abstract": "Progress in the theoretical understanding of parton branching dynamics within an expanding QGP relies on detailed and fair comparisons with experimental data for reconstructed jets. Such validation is only meaningful when the computed object, whether derived analytically or through event generation, accounts for the complexity of experimentally reconstructed jets. The reconstruction of jets in heavy ion collisions requires an inherently imperfect subtraction, of the large and fluctuating Underlying Event (UE), meaning reconstructed jets inevitably retain some level of UE contamination. To accurately identify jet quenching effects, that is, modifications of the branching dynamics by interaction with QGP leading to changes on jet observables, comparisons should be made against a baseline that incorporates UE contamination in unmodified, vacuum-like jets. In practical terms, jet quenching effects are defined as effects absent in vacuum jet samples embedded within a realistic heavy-ion background, where subtraction is carried out analogously to that in the heavy-ion case and aligned as closely as possible to what is done experimentally. Using the extensively validated JEWEL event generator, we present selected results from a broad survey examining the sensitivity of commonly used jet observables to UE effects in jet quenching studies. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of Machine Learning studies aimed at classifying significantly modified jets against a vacuum-like jet reference, where UE contamination is accounted for. Additionally we present Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) distributions in Pb-Pb jets, first in the signal-only case, and then with medium response and UE contamination effects both separately and combined. Finally, we analyze the EEC observable based on a supervised analysis cut, evaluating whether the model effectively targets jets most distinct from vacuum-like jets, and thus most likely to be quenched.",

      "Abstract": "The spectral functions of chiral partners should become degenerate when the QCD chiral symmetry is restored. The axial-vector spectra are experimentally more challenging to construct than those of vector mesons that directly couple to virtual photons and then to dileptons. Chiral mixing of the vector with axial-vector mesons is thus a key phenomenon to probe in-medium modifications of vector spectrum due to the onset of chiral symmetry restoration carried by the axial-vector counterpart. The mixing effect is expected to be stronger at higher density due to a mechanism driven by chiral anomalies [1, 2], in striking contrast to the vanishing mixing at chiral crossover driven by thermal pions [3]. This feature encourages us to perform the experimental search in the high-density regime, where the recent experimental trend has begun to shift toward.  \r\n\r\nWe propose that experiments at medium energies with paying attention to the new mixing mechanism, may provide a direct evidence of the chiral symmetry restoration. In this presentation, we focus on the density-induced mixing and the spectral functions of $\\phi$ and its chiral partner $f_1(1420)$. We present the invariant mass distribution of dileptons using a transport approach developed in [4, 5] under the conditions of the J-PARC E16 experiment as a prime example.\r\n\r\nWe find that the $f_1(1420)$ meson is visible with about 2 $\\sigma$ credibility in dilepton production in a range of mixing strength in our study when the expected statistics at E16 Run-2 are utilized [6]. We advocate that the E16 experiment at J-PARC has discovery potential for the mass degeneracy of chiral partners at finite density as a signature of chiral symmetry restoration.\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\n[1] C.

In this presentation, we study the impact of a free-streaming phase on observables and point out some for which it is relevant. The discussion in terms of geometrical estimators follows arXiv:2305.03703v3.

Similar excesses were also present in previous experiments, even if with larger errors. Models for hadron productions in heavy ion collisions systematically underestimate the measured charge-to-neutral kaon ratio. In fact, using well-established models for hadron production, we demonstrate that known isospin-symmetry breaking effects and the initial nuclei containing more neutrons than protons lead only to a small (few percent) deviation of the charged-to-neutral kaon ratio from unity at high energies. The significance of the isospin-symmetry violation beyond the known effects is 4.7σ when the compilation of world data with uncertainties quoted by the experiments is used. New systematic, high-precision measurements and theoretical efforts are needed to establish the origin of the observed large isospin-symmetry breaking.",

      "Speaker": "Nick Abboud",
      "Institute": "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The quark-gluon plasmas produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions can have large vorticities, leading to spin polarization in a manner analogous to the Barnett effect. Such spin polarization has been observed in $\\Lambda$ hyperons [1], spurring rapid development in the area of spin physics in heavy-ion collisions. However, tension remains between experimental data and theories that assume no dynamics for spin. Building on the success of hydrodynamics in describing the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma, relativistic theories of spin hydrodynamics have been developed to assess whether spin dynamics is relevant to heavy-ion phenomenology. These theories treat spin as a dynamical degree of freedom that evolves through the conservation of total angular momentum. Despite significant progress in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, our understanding of relativistic causality and the stability of thermal equilibria--both of which are crucial for numerical simulations--remains limited. As a step toward addressing this issue in a unified framework, we demonstrate that non-dissipative relativistic spin fluids fit naturally into the framework of so-called divergence-type hydrodynamic theories [2], which have desirable mathematical properties. In particular, a perfect spin fluid can be fully specified by a scalar generating function. This formulation makes it straightforward to assess whether a given theory is compatible with causality and stability. When the generating function is based on a generalized Boltzmann distribution, we show that the theory is both causal and stable and is therefore suitable for numerical implementation. Furthermore, it reproduces existing results when expanded up to second order in $\\hbar$. Finally, retaining all orders in $\\hbar$, we calculate the relevant components of the stress-energy and spin tensors, such as spin-induced pressure anistropy.\r\n\r\n[1] L.

      "Abstract": "In this work, we study the localization properties of the eigenstates of non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory both with and without dynamical quark flavors in a gauge invariant manner, using first-principles lattice gauge theory techniques. We use the eigenspectrum of a probe (overlap) Dirac operator to understand the properties of thermal gauge ensembles of 2+1 flavor QCD generated using domain wall fermions as well as pure SU(3) gauge theory. Focusing on the infrared part of eigenspectrum that lie within the non-perturbative magnetic scale, we propose suitable observables that allow us to unambiguously categorize  different regions of the eigenspectrum. While most of these so-called magnetic modes are completely delocalized and chaotic, with nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations similar to random matrices of a Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), few eigenmodes with fractal-like properties start to appear at temperatures just near and above the chiral crossover temperature. We show that their fractal dimensions carry information about the universality class of the chiral transition in QCD. \r\n\r\nHaving demonstrated that at sufficiently high temperatures, the non-Abelian plasma is gluon dominated with large occupation numbers in the infra-red and exhibits properties similar to a chaotic system, we discuss its consequences for heavy-ion experiments. Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state of SU(3) gluons inspired by the Color \r\nGlass Condensate effective theory, a real-time classical-statistical evolution leads to a self-similar scaling regime where we show that infrared magnetic modes are also over-occupied and chaotic. Thus by matching the evolving magnetic scale in this non-equilibrium scaling regime with that of a typical thermal state of QCD, we estimate a thermalization time of $\\sim  1.44$ fm/c.\r\n\r\nReference: Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories, Harshit Pandey, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, arXiv:2407.09253 [hep-lat]",

The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is composed of the quasiparticle excitations with dynamically generated masses that are linked to the lattice QCD equation of state. \r\n\r\nUtilizing the kinetic rate equation, we study the thermal production of charm quark pairs $(c\\bar{c})$ in hot QCD matter with various quark content and distinct evolution scenarios. The QGP with $N_f=2+1$ quark flavors contains the charm-quark \"impurities\", while in the $N_f=2+1+1$ case, the charm quarks contribute to the QCD equation of state above $T=300$ MeV.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the system with $N_f=2+1$ is described by hydrodynamic simulations of viscous fluid in 2+1 dimensions [2], with temperature-dependent shear viscosity computed in the quasiparticle approach [1]. To illustrate how the kinetics of charm quarks depends on the evolution and transport properties of hot QCD matter, we additionally study the production of the $c\\bar{c}$  pairs in perfect fluid propagating longitudinally [3].\r\n\r\nOur systematic study reveals that within the statistical errors, the number of the $c\\bar{c}$ pairs remains unchanged through the entire evolution of perfect QGP propagating in one dimension. This observation agrees with the prediction of the Statistical Hadronization Model [4]. In viscous QGP expanding in 2+1 dimensions, a slight decrease in the number of charm quarks is observed as the system approaches the pseudocritical temperature. This indicates the influence of the dissipative phenomena on the production of heavy flavors in hot QCD [5].\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n[1] V. Mykhaylova, C.

The identification of muon pairs coming from the decay of J/ψ mesons is recognized as a crucial physics observable for analyzing the hot and dense matter formed during collisions. The Muon Chamber (MuCh)[2] detector system is being built to identify the muon pairs in a background mostly populated by muons from weak decay of pions and kaons produced in the collisions.\r\n\r\n Simulation results on the physics performance of reconstructing for J/ψ mesons through the di-muon decay channel will be presented for p+Au collisions at 29 GeV and Au+Au collisions at 10 A GeV using various machine learning models. These results will then be compared with those obtained from traditional di-muon cut-based analysis method. The traditional cut-based approach for distinguishing signal from background relies on track selection criteria such as number of hits associated with a reconstructed global track in the Silicon Tracking System (STS), Muon Chamber (MuCh), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), and Time of Flight (TOF) detector, along with χ² values for the Vertex, STS, and MuCh, and a 2σ TOF mass cut.

In this talk, we leverage well-trained feedback neural networks (FNNs), combined with phenomenological models and reliable nuclear mass data from AME2020 and AME2016, to predict atomic masses with exceptional accuracy and extrapolation capabilities, surpassing traditional theoretical predictions. Using this framework, we accurately determine the masses of superheavy nuclei. Additionally, we also employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can handle noisy input data by training the generator and discriminator against each other, to obtain the relationship between the initial condition features ($\\epsilon_n$) of quark-gluon plasma and final-state momentum distribution ($v_n$) under ultra-central collisions of identical heavy ions, as derived from transport and/or hydrodynamic model simulations and low-energy deformation data. Accounting for initial state fluctuations and hadronic evolution, we use $\\epsilon_n$ and $v_n$ as independent variables to infer the deformation characteristics of the two colliding nuclei. Our GAN model effectively recovers physical information lost during blinded process, providing a novel approach to learn heavy-ion collisions.",

This work presents an open quantum systems approach for studying the suppression of quarkonia [1], which has been considered for many decades a crucial probe for unraveling the main features of hot and dense QCD matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We describe the dissociation and regeneration of quarkonia bound states by means of the quantum Lindblad master equation, which is solved numerically through the so-called MonteCarlo Wave Function (MCWF) method [2]. For a realistic environment evolution we couple the Lindblad equation to a full relativistic Boltzmann transport approach for the description of the QGP [3]. Within this unified framework we study the impact of different medium evolution on the dissociation of quarkonia with the aim to identify the main physical characteristics which enhance the quantum decoherence of QCD bound states. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transport coefficients on the Lindblad evolution, with the purpose to merge the state-of-the-art knowledge of heavy quark spatial diffusion coefficient estimated by lattice QCD and phenomenological models to open quantum systems approach for quarkonia [4]. Finally, we present our results for the nuclear modification factor of quarkonia and compare to experimental measurements at RHIC and LHC.",

I will present results of a study with the UrQMD transport model supplied with a density dependent equation of state including a first-order phase transition. These results include the time evolution of the cumulants up to third order of the baryon number, proton number, and light nuclei number at $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=2-3A$ GeV. While a significant deviation from Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number is observed in coordinate space, no significant measurable signal is seen in a finite rapidity window. Relative to the baryon number fluctuations, the proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. In addition, the coordinate space fluctuations and strong correlations lead to an enhancement of cluster production for a phase transition compared to a crossover scenario. This enhancement, however, is small and limited to the dense stage of the collision before the system actually freezes out.\r\n\r\nRef.: arXiv:2411.08444 [hep-ph]",

      "Abstract": "The collision of a proton and a lead nucleus is asymmetric in nature, leading to an asymmetric rapidity distribution (more particles produced in the Pb-going side) of the produced particles at ultrarelativistic energies. We study multiplicity in such collision as a function of pseudorapidity, and centrality defined from the energy deposited in a calorimeter. In particular, we focus on the ultracentral regime (high-multiplicity collisions), where the asymmetry is more pronounced. We show that in this region, fluctuations of the multiplicity and the centrality estimator are predominantly due to quantum fluctuations, with impact parameter fluctuations playing negligible role. The joint probability distribution of multiplicity and the centrality estimator can be well approximated by a correlated gamma distribution. We show that this simple model can reproduce existing ATLAS data, and we make quantitative predictions for two more centrality bins in the ultracentral regime, namely $0-0.1\\%$ and $0-0.01\\%$, which could be verified experimentally. Predictions for more central events (e.g. $0-0.001\\%$) are also possible by the same model. We also argue that by repeating the same analysis with a different centrality estimator, direct information can be obtained about the rapidity decorrelation in particle production. \r\n\r\nBased on Samanta, Ollitrault, Phys.

      "Abstract": "This study presents the first application of Bayesian inference to a hybrid model that combines hadronic transport as an initial state with a shear and bulk viscosity dependent on both temperature and baryochemical potential. Typically, the extraction of nuclear matter properties, such as viscosities, from experimental data involves Bayesian inference on theoretical models with parametric initial conditions, which leads to high-dimensional priors and reduces the strength of constraints. By integrating the SMASH transport code with the vHLLE hydrodynamic framework and a chiral mean field model equation of state in the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid \\textsuperscript{1} model, applied within the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200, we reduce reliance on parametric assumptions, while leveraging a physically motivated initial state.\r\n\r\nDespite the use of hadronic transport for initial conditions, some parametric uncertainty remains. This study offers new insights into the impact of initial state smearing and the lifetime of the pre-equilibrium state on observables. In particular, we provide updated constraints on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependencies of the shear and bulk viscosity. We also investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic phase's lifetime on observables and the role of cross-sections in the final state rescattering. Our analysis covers a diverse range of experimental data, including both midrapidity and rapidity-dependent measurements, to assess the impact of model parameters on the robustness of the inferred results.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] https://github.com/smash-transport/smash-vhlle-hybrid",

      "Abstract": "To date, holographic calculations have provided separate descriptions for the rates of energy loss for either ultrarelativistic massless quarks and gluons or infinitely massive quarks in strongly coupled N=4 SYM plasma. We present a unified description of heavy quark energy loss by combining the limits of zero mass $M \\to 0$ and infinite mass $M \\rightarrow \\infty$ in such a way that ensures continuity in both the energy $E(x)$ and its derivative $E'(x)$ with respect to the distance traveled. At early times, when the heavy quark is relativistic, our model aligns with the $ M \\to 0 $ limit, while at late times, when the quark is being dragged by the medium, it approaches the $ M \\to \\infty $ limit. We implement this unified description within the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model and incorporate a local color-neutralization mechanism occurring through the recombination of the heavy quark with a nearby opposite color charge (either a light antiquark or a diquark) from the surrounding flowing medium—a process that contributes significantly to the transverse momentum $p_T$ at low $p_T$. By turning recombination off and on we isolate the effect of transverse flow on the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons; we compare these observables as well as the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of b- and c-jets to available experimental data. We also investigate the mass dependence of heavy quark energy loss. Furthermore, we explore jet substructure observables and angular distributions of heavy quarks within jets, offering new probes into heavy quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma.",

Near a critical point, this correlation length becomes significant, even diverging in an infinite system, making fluctuation measurements a powerful tool in the search for the QCD critical point. The non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis times variance, $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ (or $C_{4}/C_{2}$) of the net-proton (serving as a proxy for net-baryon) distribution on collision energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) is proposed as an indicator of the QCD critical point, due to its connection with the system's correlation length and susceptibilities. In this work, we present the results on net-proton fluctuations for Au+Au collisions in the range of collision energy 3.5-19.6 GeV using the newly developed Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (PHQMD) model [1]. This study provides novel insights into fluctuation behavior within the CBM energy range. The results have been compared with those obtained using the acceptance of Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment. Additionally, we calculate the cumulant ratios of net-kaon multiplicity distributions, as net-kaon fluctuations serve as effective indicators of net- strangeness fluctuations. PHQMD is a versatile model for studying heavy-ion collisions and cluster formation across diverse energies, integrating Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) for QGP interactions and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) for baryon dynamics.\r\nOur results tried to establish a baseline for understanding the fluctuations, aiding in the search for potential critical behaviors near the critical endpoint on the phase diagram in the CBM energy range.\r\nRef: 1.

      "Abstract": "We investigate the dynamics of heavy quarks during the initial stages of relativistic nuclear collisions. The initial pre-equilibrium stage of heavy-ion collisions, commonly known as Glasma, evolves according to the classical Yang-Mills (CYM) equations. Heavy quarks are coupled to the evolving Glasma fields via relativistic kinetic theory. We compute the momentum broadening as well as the angular momentum fluctuations of charm and beauty quarks in the early stage, which turn out to be anisotropic due to the anisotropy of the background gluon fields. We observe that transverse momentum broadening for heavy quarks evolves as  $\\sigma_p \\propto t^2$  in the presence of background Glasma fields. This non-Markovian diffusion of heavy quarks in the early stages is explained by the memory effect present in the gluon fields. Furthermore, we also estimate the HQ spatial diffusion coefficient  $2 \\pi T D_x$  in the pre-equilibrium phase.    The    $D_x$  obtained in the pre-equilibrium phase is quite close to the value obtained within pQCD in the QGP phase.

      "Abstract": "The global spin alignment of $\\phi$ meson has been observed by the STAR collaboration in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. However, the measured positive deviation from 1/3 of the spin alignment is orders of magnitude larger than contributions of traditional mechanisms like vorticity or magnetic fields. We proposed that the anisotropy of local strong field fluctuation in meson's rest frame is a new mechanism that can incorporate the observed spin alignment. In heavy-ion collisions, such an anisotropy may arise from a faster longitudinal expansion of the QGP than transverse expansion, and from motion of the meson relative to the QGP. Our discussions are based on a relativistic spin kinetic theory derived from Kadanoff-Baym equations, with an effective quark-meson model for the strong interaction. The vector meson in our model is generated from quark-antiquark coalescence, where quark and antiquark are polarized by the local strong field. We calculated the spin alignment of the $\\phi$ meson and showed its relation to the anisotropy of field fluctuations with respect to the spin quantization direction, while the strength of fluctuation can be extracted from experimental data as functions of collision energies. The transverse momentum dependence of $\\phi$ meson's spin alignment is then calculated with our model, which agrees with the STAR's data.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (HQ) are considered to be excellent probes of the hot QCD matter produced in the high-energy heavy-ion collisions. HQ diffusion coefficient is one of the fundamental transport properties of the hot QCD matter. In this work, we have calculated the HQ momentum ($\\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients in an ambient background weak magnetic field via evaluating the scattering rate of HQ's with light thermal partons. To that end, we calculate the HQ self-energy in the presence of a weak magnetic field by using the HQ potential as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator. The information about the magnetic field comes in via the HQ potential, wherein, the light thermal partons are assumed to occupy all Landau levels. In this potential formulation, one can consider a non-perturbative ansatz for the gluon propagator which produces a string-like confining effect in coordinate space, thus allowing for the calculation of non-perturbative contribution to the HQ transport coefficients.  We have computed the heavy quark diffusion coefficients at both zero and finite momentum, observing that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low momentum and low temperature. Our spatial diffusion coefficient, $2\\pi T D_s$, shows good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be used to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy-Quarkonia evolution in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) can be studied using the framework of open quantum systems. The density matrix of the quarkonia satisfies a simple Lindblad-type equation if one assumes that the binding energy $E_b$ is much smaller than the medium temperature $T$. This approximation does not hold for a significant part of the QGP evolution. We study the evolution of quarkonia in the regime when $E_b \\sim T$ by solving general master equations for the density matrix, which include the effects of memory. We calculate suppression of $\\Upsilon$ states at CMS and RHIC energies. For the background medium, we use results from a realistic viscous 2+1 hydrodynamic simulation, which gives a good description of the phenomenology of the soft particles.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic kinetic theory has been used to describe many aspects of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. To provide smooth initial condition for the hydrodynamic phase from the early stages. To take into account the interaction in the final stage of the evolution, before the chemical and kinetic freeze-out, or directly to replace hydrodynamics in the description of the strongly interacting medium produced in the collision. It has also been used extensively to obtain the transport coefficients of second order hydrodynamics and its generalizations. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is a limiting case for the evolution the Wigner distribution, the quantum precursor of the distribution function. Relativistic kinetic theory is supposed to work for asymptotically weak interactions and small quantum corrections. If the weak interaction assumption is already debatable for a strongly interacting liquid (close to a perfect fluid), more recently it has been shown that the quantum corrections are not small for a free gas[1]. The action scale of the system (compared to the Plank constant) sets the size of these corrections, and a semiclassical expansion is a safe approximation for cold and dilute systems. This is not the case for a hotter and smaller system, like at the beginning of the expansion of the medium. Besides significantly changing the energy density and pressure, hence showing that the quantum corrections are not relevant only for the polarization of spinning particles, the analytic structure of the integrands seem to preclude a semiclassical series to recover the exact results.\r\nThese off-shell effects, though, can be taken into account with a generalization of the hydrodynamic expansion [2], recovering second order hydrodynamics (and its transport coefficients), and providing an quantum generalization of the evolution of the non-hydrodynamic modes.\r\n\r\n[1] LT, Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 7, 076022\r\n[2] LT, Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 3, 036015",

The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in non-equilibrium processes.

In this classical approach, heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents. The heavy-quark dynamics are modelled by a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then implemented through relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential, enabling the formation of charmonium states. These bound states may dissociate due to screening effects of the potential and through scatterings with plasma particles. Using box simulations at fixed temperature and volume, we demonstrate the full equilibration of the system with equilibrium charmonium yields consistent with the Statistical Hadronization Model. In order to model the phenomenology of a heavy-ion collision, we then implement a dynamical description, where the evolution of the expanding medium is parametrized by a boost invariant fireball. This allows us to study the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of the charm and anticharm quarks, as well as of charmonia, at RHIC and LHC energy, and compare the results to experimental data.",

In particular, it is not clear to what degree this *hydrodynamization* process requires proximity to a local equilibrium state. In this contribution, we study this problem in kinetic theory considering an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing strong longitudinal expansion, assuming Bjorken flow. We solve the Boltzmann equation using a relativistic generalization of the method of moments [1], where the single-particle distribution is reconstructed via a moment expansion. We first demonstrate that this traditional moment expansion actually diverges for this system and that this series must be resummed [2]. We then compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium, even though the energy-momentum tensor is well described by fluid dynamics. We further show the 14-moment approximation [3], widely employed in simulations of heavy ion collisions, does not provide a good approximation for the momentum distribution of this system. We quantity this effect computing the emission of photons in the quark-gluon plasma [4] and verify if this deviation from equilibrium can be observed.\r\n\r\n[1] G. S. Denicol, H. Niemi, E.

      "Abstract": "Elecromagnetic probes, such as dileptons, can provide a clear information about the properties of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions since they are undisturbed by the strong final state  interaction. The dileptons are emitted during the whole evolution of the expanding system from many different sources -  from hadron decays to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) thermal radiation, so the consistent description of dilepton production requires an application of dynamical models. \r\n\r\nIn this work we investigate the dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions as well as in proton-proton and proton-nucleus reactions from low invariant energies of a one GeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies of a few TeV (LHC). Our study is based on the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach - a microscopic, non-equilibrium transport approach that incorporates both hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom and provides a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, covering the entire process from the initial out-of-equilibrium nucleon-nucleon collisions, through the formation and interactions of the quark-gluon plasma, and extending to the hadronization and final-state off-shell interactions of the produced hadrons. \r\n\r\nThe main dilepton sources  in the PHSD are  the hadronic decays and bremstrahlung, thermal QGP radiation (including $q+\\bar q \\to e^+e^-$,  $q+\\bar q \\to g+ e^+e^-$,  $q+g \\to q+ e^+e^-$ processes), primary Drell-Yan production (computed here dynamically in the PHSD framework)  and semileptonic decays from correlated charm and bottom pairs. We find that the PHSD provides a good description of the dilepton data of the HADES, STAR and ALICE experiments. We investigate the influence of in-medium effects such as a collisional broadening of the vector meson spectral functions  and present the excitation function of the dilepton \"excess\" in invariant mass range $0.4<M<0.75$ GeV  as well as it's centrality dependence for different energies.\r\n\r\nFor the 1st time we report on the $\\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP thermal radiation - calculated in the PHSD within the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) used for the description of the non-perturbative QGP -  and show that its influence increases with decreasing bombarding energy, where  $\\mu_B$ becomes larger. We present the excitation function of dileptons produced from  thermal QGP - including the $\\mu_B$ dependence of quasiparticle thermal masses and widths and their interactions - versus correlated charm  that  the QGP overshines the correlated charm at invariant energies $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 30$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions. This  gives an access to the thermal QGP dileptons at BES-RHIC and future FAIR experiments. Furthermore, we study the contribution of the QGP to the dilepton spectra for p+p reactions at LHC energies and find that it increases with increasing collision energy. Thus, after subtracting the contributions of correlated charm and bottom pairs from dilepton experimental data it might become accessible, too.",

      "Abstract": "This work aims to shed light on the puzzle of small systems constituted by the absence of jet quenching but the\r\npresence of a non-zero v$_2$ of high pt particles. This is done using the JEWEL event generator with a brick-like medium\r\ndefinition mimicking a small collision system. We concentrate on two observables: R$_AA$, which measures the energy loss of jets, and v$_2$ of high p$_\\perp$ particles, which quantifies the azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles. By extracting R$_{AA}$ and v$_2$ as a function of number of scatterings (N$_{scat}$) in the brick-like medium, we obtain answers that\r\nare largely independent of any assumptions about the medium evolution and expansion.\r\n\r\nWhat we have found is that the observables do not depend only on the number of interactions but also on the screening mass ($m_D$), which controls  how much energy and momentum are transferred at each interaction. In fact, R$_AA$ and v$_2$ scale with $m_D^2 \\cdot N_{scat}$. The results also strongly indicate that more interactions\r\n(and thus more energy/momentum transfer) are required to create a visible R$_AA$ signal than a v$_2$ signal. This in turn\r\nhelps appease the years long debate on how it is possible that no jet quenching signs have been seen in collisions of\r\nsmall systems while an azimuthal anisotropy of hard particles is observed and thus allows the community\r\nto move on to study the modification of jets in small systems using more suitable observables.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions in the energy regime of $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2 - 20 GeV, are relevant for the study of dense baryonic matter and the hunt for the critical end point of QCD. In this energy regime the well established hybrids of single-fluid hydrodynamics coupled to transport afterburners are reaching their limitation due to long interpenetration times and an intricate time evolution.\r\n\r\nTo address this shortcoming we present Frisco3, a novel 3-fluid hydrodynamical simulation model of relativistic heavy-ion reactions with a continuous transition from the fluid phase to the regime of free streaming hadrons, applicable at RHIC-FXT, GSI and FAIR energies. The time evolution of the reaction is consistently described in terms of three coupled ideal fluids, resembling the two nuclei, which couple to the third fluid, the fireball, via a local friction rate, and a continuous drain term, which is determined by the local thermal emissivity and the survival probability of produced hadrons given by their momentum differential, temperature and density dependent scattering rate in the medium. The model thus overcomes the conventional issues of i) single-fluid hydrodynamics loosing applicability at lower energies due to small Lorentz-contraction, long interpenetration times and an intricate geometry. Instead the fireball fluid is continuously generated by friction of the projectile and target fluids, thus capturing the time dependent equilibration of the system. (ii) The model avoids the common Cooper-Frye decoupling. Instead of an ad-hoc freeze-out hyper-surface the freeze-out is dynamically determined by local scattering and expansion rates and thus avoids common issues of Cooper-Frye regarding conservation laws, feedback to the fluid phase or reheating. Frisco3 moreover conserves energy, momenta and charges exactly on an event-by-event basis at any time in the evolution.\r\n\r\nWe will present first benchmarking results on hadron multiplicities, rapidity and transverse momentum spectra for Au+Au collisions ranging from 2.4 GeV to 20 GeV center of mass energy, in comparison to recently measured data by HADES and STAR.

Its research program includes studies of strong interactions as well as reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. A significant advantage of NA61/SHINE over collider experiments is its extended coverage of phase space available for particle production. This includes the entire projectile hemisphere of the collision, with no low-$p_T$ cut-off.\r\n\r\nThe energy and system-size dependence of strangeness production plays an essential role in studies of the transition from confined to deconfined matter. At the same time, resonance production is a key observable to study the dynamics of colliding systems at high density. With its zero net strangeness and its valence structure composed predominantly of $s$ and $\\bar{s}$ valence quarks, the $\\phi$(1020) meson will not be sensitive to strangeness-related effects in a purely hadronic scenario, but will behave like a doubly-strange particle in a partonic system.

      "Abstract": "An understanding of the energy loss of fast partons passing through the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is important for the interpretation of experimental data on jet attenuation in the QGP created in heavy-ion collisions, as well as for the study of the modification of the QGP itself. However, gaining this knowledge is a challenging task, since it is related to the non-perturbative regime of QCD, for which only limited information from lattice QCD is currently available.\r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, we employ the dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). The DQPM describes the non-perturbative nature of the strongly-interacting QGP at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential based on a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons), whose properties are adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. Using the DQPM propagators, we can explicitly derive the scattering amplitudes for the elastic ($2\\to 2$) and inelastic ($2\\to 3$) radiative interactions without approximations, allowing us to study both the transport properties of the QGP and jet energy loss in the medium.\r\n\r\nWe report the following findings:\r\n1. We have obtained energy and temperature dependencies of the total elastic and radiative cross sections. We have found that, while elastic cross sections dominate at low energies and high temperatures, radiative cross sections increase at low temperatures and high energies, becoming comparable or even dominant.\r\n2. We have found that the interaction rate and relaxation time in the QGP are primarily governed by elastic scattering, suggesting that inelastic processes are suppressed in the non-perturbative thermalized thermal medium.\r\n3. We have obtained the jet transport coefficients, such as the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length $\\hat{q}$ and the energy loss per unit length $dE/dx$, and found their strong dependencies on the medium temperature, jet momentum and the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.\r\n4. We have examined the ratio of $\\hat{q}$ to shear viscosity $\\eta$ and shown that the scaling $\\eta/s \\approx 1.25 T^3/\\hat{q}$ is valid in the weak coupling regime at high temperatures, but is violated in the strong coupling regime at low temperatures.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

      "Abstract": "Bayesian statistical analysis is nowadays a well-established method for performing global fits of QCD matter properties and initial conditions to experimental data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. However, even when surrogate models such as Gaussian process emulators are used to reduce the number of simulations, the computational costs can still remain prohibitively large for producing sufficient training data for observables, such as rare flow correlators, which require a very large sample of events. These costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude by using neural networks to predict simulated event-by-event observables, whose event averages are then used in the training of the Gaussian process emulators. Here, we present results [1] of a Bayesian global analysis of four collision systems using EbyE-EKRT initial conditions and (2+1)D viscous fluid dynamical model with dynamical freeze-out [2]. The investigated systems are 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb, 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb, and 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. The statistical analysis is enhanced with deep convolutional neural networks, which are trained to predict the model output event-by-event for a given initial state profile [3], QCD matter properties and freeze-out conditions [4]. This combination of neural networks and Gaussian process emulators allows us to account for the statistics-expensive flow observables that provide further constraints for the temperature dependencies of shear and bulk viscosity, and for Knudsen number and system size -based freeze-out conditions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] J.

To achieve this, it is crucial to identify observables under circumstances that are minimally affected by the process that leads to the initial state of heavy-ion collisions from nuclear wave function. In this talk, we demonstrate that when assuming scale invariance, the effect of this stage on the initial energy or entropy density moments in ultracentral symmetric collisions is negligible for nucleon sizes of approximately 0.7 fm or larger for large nuclei. By borrowing cluster expansion method from statistical physics and using scale-invariance assumption, we calculate the average ellipticity of initial density at the presence of short-range correlation. We compare our calculations to Monte Carlo studies and assess the accuracy of various methods of short-range correlation sampling. Additionally, we find that the isobar ratio can constrain the initial-state parameters, in addition to deformation. Our study indicates that the isobar ratios in ultracentral collisions are especially sensitive to the fluctuation in the weight of the nuclei constituents and the two-body correlation among nucleons. This insight is crucial for drawing conclusions about nuclear deformations based on isobar ratios.\r\n\r\nBased on: S. M. A. Tabatabaee Mehr and S. F. Taghavi, Phys. Rev. C 110, 054901",

One of the parameters, the Lévy exponent, is of particular importance. The exponent not only describes the shape of the source, but also may be related to the critical point of the phase diagram. Its measurement, hence, may contribute to the search for and characterization of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram and the shape of the particle emitting source.\r\n\r\nMoreover, one of the most important goals of NA61/SHINE is to investigate and understand the phase structures of this strongly interacting matter. The investigation of the phase diagram can be achieved by varying the beam momentum (13A-150(8)A GeV/c) or by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Measuring the correlation functions in different systems at different energies enables us to perform a two-dimensional scan of the QCD phase diagram.

In this talk, I will show how the real-time dynamics of the quark-meson model can be studied non-perturbatively using a formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour. As a particular application, we consider dissipative dynamics for the chiral order parameter and study the corresponding effects on static observables such as the phase diagram. We find that, unlike in classical systems, dissipation can potentially affect static observables through the contributions of non-zero Matsubara modes. We investigate these effects quantitatively within two phenomenological models for the temperature dependence of the pion damping.",

      "Abstract": "Higher-order moments of conserved charge fluctuations, such as net-charge, net-baryon, and net-strangeness, are sensitive experimental probes for investigating the critical fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We calculate the cumulants and correlation functions of proton, antiproton, and net-proton multiplicity distributions in Au + Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7 GeV using a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The AMPT model can basically describe the trends of cumulants, cumulant ratios, (normalized) correlation functions of the proton and net-proton measured by the STAR experiment. The multiproton (baryon) correlations in the AMPT model are consistent with the expectation from baryon number conservation.  Since the physics of the QCD critical fluctuations is not included in the AMPT model, our results are expected to only provide a baseline for searching for the possible critical behaviors at the CEP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions[1]. Then, we incorporate critical fluctuations from the functional renormalization group (FRG) into the AMPT model in order to reveal the important effect of hadronic rescatterings on critical fluctuations. We observed apparent influences of hadronic rescatterings on the cumulant ratios of the net-baryon number fluctuations. The results demonstrate that hadronic rescatterings decrease C4/C2 in central collisions and increase C4/C2 in peripheral collisions, thereby bringing the model results with FRG closer to the STAR measurements. The effect of hadronic rescatterings is more significant for critical fluctuations than dynamical fluctuations.

In this study, we investigate the role of nuclear clustering, in particular the alpha-cluster structure in $\\rm ^{16}O$, using anisotropic flow observations from $\\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at RHIC energy. Through systematic simulations with an improved AMPT model, we show that a longer effective parton formation time is essential to match recent STAR experimental data. Importantly, the anisotropic flow coefficients serve as sensitive probes for distinguishing alpha-clustering configurations in $\\rm ^{16}O$ nuclei [1].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we extend this investigation to $\\rm ^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$ and $\\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at LHC energies, where we compare the results from the AMPT transport model with those from hydrodynamic models. The AMPT model, which accurately simulates non-equilibrium dynamics, shows significant deviations from hydrodynamic predictions, especially in key observables such as elliptic flow $v_{2}$, Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho (v_{2}^{2}\\{2\\},\\left \\langle p_{T} \\right \\rangle)$, and , symmetric cumulants SC(3,2), and four-particle cumulant $c_{2}\\{4\\}$.

      "Abstract": "Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter has become one of the important research areas for both theoretical and experimental high-energy physics community. In the QCD phase diagram, which is characterised by temperature ($T$) and baryochemical potential ($\\mu_B$), a first-order phase transition is expected at high $\\mu_B$ and low T, which ends at a possible critical point. This is followed by a crossover transition from hadron to quark matter as predicted by lattice QCD calculations. In addition to the magnetic field, a huge amount of vorticity is expected to be produced in a non-central heavy ion collision. This vorticity or rotation ($\\omega$) can affect the evolution of the system and, hence, the phase diagram of the QCD matter. In this work, we study the effect of rotation on the phase diagram of hadronic matter. We find that rotation plays a similar role to baryochemical potential on the thermodynamic properties of hadron gas. The rotation adds a new kind of chemical potential called rotational chemical potential. Therefore, the phase transition can occur not only in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane but also in the $T-\\omega$ plane. We use an interacting hadron resonance gas model with van der Waals kind of attractive and repulsive interaction among the hadrons. We observe a liquid-gas phase transition under the effect of rotation, even at zero baryochemical potential. These results allow us to reinvestigate the QCD matter properties under the effect of rotation and study the phase diagram in the $T-\\mu_B-\\omega$ plane.",

Additionally, we will explore potential methods for integrating medium-dependent string tension into SMASH.\r\n\r\nWhile past efforts have incorporated a constant in-medium string tension in transport models, this study is the first to evaluate string tension dynamically based on local conditions.

      "Abstract": "The Wiedemann-Franz law, a hallmark of non-relativistic electron transport, relates the thermal and electrical conductivities through a constant Lorenz ratio. This ratio remains fixed in conventional metals, consistent with Fermi gas and Fermi liquid theory. Interestingly, quarks or hadrons in the matter produced in RHIC or LHC experiments don't follow this law. This high-energy nuclear physics-based many-body system (QCD phase diagram) is expected in the temperature and (baryon) chemical potential within the order of MeV-GeV scales. In contrast, a condensed matter physics-based many-body system is expected within meV-eV temperature scales and Fermi energy(chemical potential). Though metals, having Fermi energy from 2eV to 10 eV, follow the WF law but graphene can reach the WF law violation domain by lowering its Fermi energy via the doping reduction technique. By drawing a parallel between graphene's Dirac fluid and hot quark matter, we aim to explore the transport behavior that emerges in strongly interacting, relativistic fluids across vastly different energy scales. We employed the Boltzmann transport theory to determine the thermal and electrical conductivities in graphene and ultra-relativistic quark matter. We observed a striking violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in both systems. The present work highlights the universal nature of transport phenomena in Dirac fluid and relativistic fluids, from the milli-electron volt (meV) scale in graphene to the mega-electron volt (MeV) scale in quark matter, providing insight into the fundamental physics governing both condensed matter and high-energy systems.",

Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. The chiral effective model, based on the principles of chiral symmetry breaking and broken scale invariance, is employed to incorporate the in-medium effects of constituent quarks within hadrons. The classical and quantized versions of electrical conductivity and resistivity are studied in the relaxation time approximation framework of kinetic theory. Anisotropic electrical conductivity and resistivity tensors are investigated by considering cyclotron motion and Landau quantization. In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the Landau quantization of perpendicular momenta results in quantized anisotropic transport coefficients of the system. Two interesting macroscopic manifestations of Landau quantization are the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) [1]. In this work, we explore the possibility of SdH/QHE type oscillations in low temperature and high magnetic field conditions present in the interior of the dense neutron stars, as well as in future facilities of CBM/NICA experiments. Finally, we also present a quantitative estimate of the same in the interior of a neutron star where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] Dey, J., Bandyopadhyay, A., Gupta, A., Pujari, N., & Ghosh, S.

      "Abstract": "The equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon chemical potential remains an elusive target for direct lattice QCD calculations, constituting a highly challenging topic. To address this issue, we have developed a novel Deep-learning quasi-parton model, which is constructed using three deep neural networks, to capture the fundamental properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Each neural network represents three distinct quasi-particle masses that are contingent upon the temperature (T) and baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$). The resulting EoS derived from the quasi-particle model demonstrates strong agreement with lattice QCD results using Taylor expansion techniques. This provides a robust framework for approximating the EoS of QCD matter at finite baryon chemical potentials, thereby enhancing our theoretical understanding of QCD matter under extreme conditions.",

      "Abstract": "This study is the first investigation of the intricate phenomenon of shape coexistence in atomic nuclei, particularly within ultra-relativistic ion collisions. Recent findings challenge the traditional view of nuclei as fixed configurations, revealing that nuclear deformation—characterized by shape parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$—can lead to multiple configurations. We distinguish between three scenarios: type A, where two distinct separate shapes correspond to specific states, and type B, where differently deformed shapes mix into a given state, and other extreme cases (EC) where the potential well is low such that we cannot distinguish between type A and B. Utilizing a two-state mixing model and observables such as electric quadrupole $B(E2)$ and monopole $\\rho(E0)$ transitions, we analyze the relationship between low- and high-energy nuclear structure transitions. For this means, we use a mixture distribution highlighting the role of shape coexistence in nuclear dynamics. We show that shape coexistence observables are a linear combination of canonical observables  $\\alpha_i\\mathcal{O}(\\beta_2^{(i)})$, with $\\alpha_i$ being the different state level possibilities measured by two mixing model. We find that the mixing interaction of bound states leads to an enhancement in the observables such that $\\mathcal{O}_{A}<\\mathcal{O}_{EC}<\\mathcal{O}_{B}$. Furthermore, we show that the shape fluctuation is a spacial case where we either have only one minimum or a maximally mixing of bound states. Consequently, this work enhances our understanding of nuclear structure and its evolution across energy regimes, providing a coherent framework for interpreting experimental results in high-energy nuclear physics.",

      "Abstract": "Despite the success of hydrodynamic models in describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions, questions persist about their regime of validity. Non-linear causality conditions provide a clear criterion for assessing the applicability of models. If the evolution of a system violates causality, it cannot reliably represent the underlying relativistic theory. It is now known that state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations enter an acausal regime, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological consequences of enforcing causality constraints in modern Bayesian parameter estimations of heavy-ion collisions. We find that, while only a small fraction of the system’s energy typically enters an acausal regime at the onset of hydrodynamic evolution, strictly limiting this fraction impacts the inferred initial conditions of the system. This leads to notable shifts in the preferred parameters for QGP properties, including a substantial reduction in the favored values of bulk viscosity. These results underscore the importance of refining theoretical models of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions to ensure more accurate representations of QGP properties.\r\nBased on: arXiv:2409.17127",

      "Abstract": "In recent years, analyses using RHIC-BES data have been actively conducted to explore the high baryon number density region in the QCD phase diagram. Meanwhile, even in high-energy collisions, such as RHIC and LHC energies, the presence of high baryon number density matter in the forward rapidity region has been suggested [1]. This implies that, in addition to the analysis of BES data, a rapidity scan—analyzing data along the collision axis in such high-energy collisions—could serve as complementary ways to explore the high baryon number density region in the phase diagram. However, a model that provides a comprehensive description of the collision, from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ and from midrapidity to forward rapidity, is essential for precise studies of the rapidity scan. Furthermore, since it is not at all trivial whether the produced matter has reached equilibrium in the forward rapidity region, a model capable of describing the dynamical evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components is required.\r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI) model [2] is a novel framework that dynamically describes the space-time evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components including their interactions. Consequently, it has a great success in comprehensively describing experimental data of high-energy collisions from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ at midrapidity. Thus, the DCCI model would be a strong candidate for rapidity scan studies. In this study, we extended the DCCI model by including baryon number current within the ideal hydrodynamics and modeled the dynamical deposition of baryon number into the fluid, enabling us to describe a gradual thermalization process of baryon number alongside the fluid formation through the dynamical initialization. Using this model, we aimed to clarify the baryon number distribution of each core (equilibrium) and corona (non-equilibrium) component across the entire system at the LHC energy. Specifically, we determined which regions of the QCD phase diagram are accessible with the rapidity scan at the LHC energy and showed which rapidity regions of high-energy collisions are comparable to the baryon number densities achieved in low-energy collisions. This study strongly supports the existence of high baryon number density as equilibrated matter in the forward rapidity region at the LHC energy.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Li and J. I. Kapusta, Phys. Rev.

As a result, the local polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons exhibits an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the azimuthal angle, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the collision system. In contrast, in non-central collisions, the directed flow significantly alters this pattern, preventing full cancellation of the opposing contributions to the polarization and resulting in a non-zero global polarization, highlighting the polarization sensitivity to the collision geometry and collective flow. We propose the measurement of the azimuthal-angle dependence of local polarization with respect to the reaction plane as a novel probe to investigate the internal structure and evolution of the fireball in central and semi-central heavy-ion collisions.",

In the first part, various existing experimental measurements are used in a Bayesian framework [1] to constrain the density dependent potentials in UrQMD [2] for densities from 2 to 6 times saturation densities ($n_0$). It is shown that while the observables used in the study tightly constrain the EoS from 2- 4.5 $n_0$, the constraints on the EoS beyond 3 $n_0$ are highly sensitive to the choice of observations, highlighting the importance of future experiments.\r\nThe second part discusses novel AI based analysis techniques for next generation experiments. We show that DL based models can accurately identify different types of QCD transitions, directly using experimental information such as hits/tracks of particles in the detectors [3]. These methods outperform conventional methods and can be used in experiments for online event characterisation or analysis. We also present a more robust approach using generative models. A point cloud diffusion model capable of ultra fast generation of event-by-event collision output is presented [4]. The model is able to generate realistic collision events with 26 distinct hadron types. The model can be used as a versatile alternative to conventional surrogate models such as the Gaussian process, for a comprehensive Bayesian inference. By being differentiable, such methods can also be directly used for various inverse problems or parameter estimation tasks in experiments. The point cloud representation also makes the model easily adaptable not only to other model calculations or for detector simulations but also in other fields such as cosmic ray air shower simulations.\r\n\r\n[1] Omana Kuttan, M., Steinheimer, J., Zhou, K., & Stoecker, H., QCD Equation of State of Dense Nuclear Matter from a Bayesian Analysis of Heavy-Ion Collision Data.

To this end we employ Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) in a 2+1 flavor scenario that has been tested successfully elsewhere in the QCD phase diagram. The equation of state for quark-gluon matter can be used as input for the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of cold neutron stars. Two paths were explored for the calculations. First, employing an effective action expansion derived by functional methods, the pressure at finite and zero chemical potential can be compared or, second, the number density can be calculated and further integrated to yield the pressure. The latter option has already been proved useful in computing quark and baryon number fluctuations at finite temperature. Both methods are compared and some physical consequences are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Two-particle correlation functions of hadrons are sensitive to mechanisms of particle production and transport in elementary particle collisions. The production of quarks is determined by coupling terms of the QCD Lagrangian. These nominally conserves  quark flavors in addition to  energy, momentum, and electric charge:  flavor  currents are conserved  at the level of quarks and gluons. The production of quarks with flavor $\\rm f$ must then be balanced by the production of anti-quarks with anti-flavor $\\rm \\bar f$. Given flavor conversion $\\rm f\\rightarrow f'$ is governed by \\emph{weak} interaction processes, one can expect that the hadrons produced in the final state of A-A collisions is also flavor balanced. Indeed, one expects that the breaking of flavor balancing should be approximately limited to weak processes occurring on  a time scale longer than the lifetime of the QGP produced in A--A collisions. That implies that one can study competing processes of particle production and their subsequent transport based flavor correlation functions. Charge and strangeness  balance functions have been measured at SPS, RHIC, and LHC. In  this phenomenological study, the usefulness of flavor balancing measurements based on  two-particle correlation functions is explored based on simulations of  proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV with the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator. Flavor  balancing is studied with a broad  variety of hadron pairs, such as $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}-\\mathrm{K}^{-}$, $\\Lambda-\\bar{p}$, $\\Lambda-\\bar{\\Lambda}$, etc, to explore dependencies, in particular, on the number of balanced flavors in produced hadrons. \r\n\r\nPYTHIA describes the phenomenology of particle production in nuclear collisions with   2-to-2 parton scattering, multiple partonic interactions (MPI) and Lund String Fragmentation. Additional processes involving  Color Reconnection and Rope Hadronization have also been incorporated to better explain the experimental data observed in collider experiments. This work explores the effects of the MONASH tune with MPI Color Reconnection  on the the normalized two-particle number cumulant $R_{2}$, computed for several hadron pairs,  as a function of the multiplicity of $\\rm pp$ collisions. It is found that the amplitudes of the $R_{2}$ hadron correlation functions   increases monotonically with the number of balanced flavors in both minimum bias and multiplicity dependent analyses.  Mapping Pythia particle production mechanisms to the results of this study will shed light on the actual mechanisms in place in nuclear collision.",

      "Abstract": "For cold, ultra-dense matter, color superconductivity is characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs of quarks through gluon exchange, yielding a frequency-dependent superconducting gap on the order of 100 MeV. Conversely, the phenomenon of confinement is characterized by the fundamental particles confined within hadrons at low to intermediate energies. In this regime, lattice QCD has shown that gluon two-point correlation functions in Landau gauge display a finite zero-momentum value, suggesting the dynamical generation of an infrared mass scale for the gluon and a nontrivial spectral structure.\r\nIn this work, we investigate how an infrared massive gluon might affect color superconductivity and use this phenomenon as a testing ground for confining models. In particular, we analyze superconductivity using a Yukawa model in which we replace the conventional bosonic propagator of the mediator with a confining propagator. This propagator has a structure similar to those found in Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ), Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ), and Curci-Ferrari models. In these models, the gluon includes an explicit mass parameter linked to nonperturbative effects and may exhibit nonstandard analytical structures, such as complex-conjugated poles. Considering low temperature and high chemical potentials, we derive the superconducting gap with frequency dependence. Our results reveal two phases in the system concerning the mass parameter: one phase exhibits superconductivity with a low-frequency peak, consistent with literature on color superconductivity (low-mass regime), while the other phase without superconductivity, displaying a \"plateau\" characteristic of BCS superconductivity in the point-like approximation (high-mass regime). Solving the integral gap equation we further observe a reduction in the superconducting gap across all confining models as the mass parameter increases. We also obtain results with renormalization group improvement in an infrared-safe scheme specifically for a massive Curci-Ferrari version of the gluon. Finally, we discuss the extension of this analysis to the gauge theory case.",

      "Abstract": "When the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) forms during high-energy collisions, the dimensions of the produced droplet are dependent on the overlap region of the colliding nuclei, enabling the QGP to encode information about the initial conditions of nuclear collisions and even the structure of the colliding nuclei. The system of particles produced in the final state exhibit collective behavior, and studying these dynamics can provide unique insight into such initial conditions of the collision. The collective azimuthal flow, quantified as $v_n$, can be used to study the shape of the overlap region. The mean transverse momentum, $\\left[ p_T \\right]$, additionally provides information about the initial size and energy of the system. The joint analysis of these two observables, characterized by the multi-particle cumulant $C(v_n^m, \\left[ p_T^k \\right])$, provides further information on the relationship between the initial size and shape, and therefore on the nuclear structure. Thus far, the focus has been on three-particle cumulants of this type, but this has proven limited in recent studies and the need for higher order cumulants has emerged, especially in the case of nuclear isotopes that lie within the region of a potential second-order shape phase transition such as $^{128-132}$Xe. In this poster, the algorithms required to calculate such higher order, multi-particle cumulants between $v_n$ and $\\left[ p_T \\right]$ are presented explicitly for the first time, formulated using an advanced framework.

      "Institute": "Wayne State University (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In high energy nuclear collisions, the majority of the charm and beauty quark production occurs via perturbative hard scattering on a short timescales and undergoes transport through a medium (which depends on the system), experiencing drag, diffusion, scattering, or recombination into bound states. Investigating these processes requires methods sensitive to both the production cross section and transport effects. Balance functions, first developed at RHIC and now used at the LHC, are statistical observables that measure correlations between particle pairs,  capturing the final snapshot of accumulated charge-dependent interactions. Early-stage quarks have more time to separate, leading to a broader balance function, while late emission allows less time for separation, resulting in narrower correlations. Shifts in the \\( \\Delta \\phi \\) offers insights into the medium's expansion rate relative to particle initial momentum. \r\n\\newline\r\n\\newline\r\nHeavy-flavor hadrons can provide insights into pre{-}hadronization effects, while light hadrons tend to have their initial parton-level correlations diluted. We propose exploring the possibility of measuring balance functions for particle pairs, including charm particles, in pp collisions with PYTHIA, with the particle pairs to be studied including $ \\mathrm{p}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\Lambda}_c^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\Lambda}^0 $, $ \\mathrm{\\Omega}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{D}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\pi}^{\\pm} $, and $ \\mathrm{K}^{\\pm} $, to distinguish baryon number transport from electric charge effects. With Run 3 data, studying these observables in small systems is  feasible. PYTHIA simulates both perturbative and non perturbative QCD effects in pp collisions, including  multiparton interaction, color reconnection, and junction formation, impacting baryon transport through color line rearrangements. Mechanisms like shoving and ropes further modify balance functions by affecting final-state correlations.

      "Abstract": "In high-energy physics, accurately predicting cross sections of reaction processes relies heavily on the parton fragmentation functions (FFs). Conventional methods often require parameterized forms and additional calculations to ensure the FFs conform to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations, which can be cumbersome and may not fully capture the complexity of FFs across varying energy scales. Here, we introduce a novel approach to determining parton fragmentation functions using a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not require prior parameterized forms and directly integrates the DGLAP evolution equations into the neural network architecture, allowing the FFs to automatically satisfy these equations without additional calculations. We present new sets of parton FFs obtained for hadrons in electron-positron annihilation processes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in pQCD using this innovative technique. To validate our approach, we calculate proton-(anti)proton hadron spectra using the extracted FFs and demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align well with experimental data across various energy scales ($\\sqrt{s}$ = 130, 200, 500, 630, 900, 1800, 2760, 5020, 5440, 7000 GeV). Our findings indicate that the PINN method not only simplifies the extraction process but also enhances the universal applicability of FFs across different energy scales. By eliminating the need for parameterized forms and additional DGLAP evolution, our approach represents a significant step forward in the field, paving the way for more robust and versatile predictions in high-energy physics, including the potential exploration of new research avenues in heavy ion collisions.",

Using the nuclear shell model (NSM) as a proof of concept model, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method algorithm was implemented in order to generate nucleon positions, according to the full $N$-nucleon probability distribution. We benchmark it by comparing our numerical results to the analytic one- and two-body densities. By using this algorithm, quantum correlations in the nucleus are then imprinted into the positions. Additionally, the usage of the NSM permits the extension of this algorithm to large systems, such as Au and Pb, which are still prohibitively expensive for full $\\textit{ab-initio}$ computations.\r\nWe explore the impact of these new sources of fluctuation on the creation of long-range correlations by exploring initial state observables sensitive to the $N$-body densities, such as the initial eccentricities, extracted from the novel McDIPPER model [2].",

      "Abstract": "The Silicon Tracking System (STS) in the upcoming heavy-ion CBM experiment is tailored for an unprecedented 10 MHz beam-target interaction rate. A unique integration strategy was employed to maintain a material budget within 2 - 8\\% $X_0$ while ensuring ample granularity, spatial precision, and timing accuracy. The read-out electronics sit external to the sensitive volume, connected to double-sided double-metal silicon sensors through ultra-thin micro cables. Each double-sided silicon strip sensor is connected to two Front-End Boards (FEBs), featuring eight custom-designed STS-XYTER ASICs (SMX) per FEB.\r\n\r\nPost-assembly, rigorous quality control tests, including time and amplitude calibration of all module ASICs, ensure reliable performance, operational refinement, and accurate data interpretation. Operating at room temperature to -20 °C (coolant) and -10 °C (effective), FEBs undergo mechanical stress due to temperature fluctuations. The burn-in test exposes modules to varying temperatures and power cycles, identifying weaknesses and evaluating electronics robustness and module functionality.\r\n\r\nPost-testing, modules are affixed to carbon fiber ladders, hosting up to 10 modules each, and undergo further assessments to verify sustained functionality and performance. This study outlines the status and outcomes of tests on the modules and ladders of the STS detector's series production, providing valuable insights into its development and performance capabilities.",

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "The nucleon density distribution within colliding nuclei is typically modeled using the two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. This conventional approach overlooks the fine radial structures arising from the quantal shell filling patterns of protons and neutrons. In this study, we incorporate these fine radial variations by utilizing density profiles from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional theory. We extensively compare the WS parametrization with detailed radial profiles across nuclei possessing qualitatively different density distributions. Our analysis reveals consistent deviations in heavy-ion observables—such as initial eccentricity and participant distributions—that cannot be captured by simply readjusting WS parameters. These deviations exhibit similar behaviors across different nuclei and depend on collision centrality and specific observables. The exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to initial state variations offers a promising avenue to detect these fine radial effects. Our findings complement studies on nuclear deformation effects and highlight the necessity of incorporating realistic nuclear density profiles in advanced hydrodynamic simulations and in the extraction of the quark-gluon plasma's transport properties.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Z.

      "Abstract": "Virtual photons emitted from heavy-ion collisions preserve essential information about the fireball, where high baryon densities induce significant medium effects on the spectral function of vector mesons.\r\nWhile short-lived $\\rho$ mesons predominantly decay within the fireball, radiating thermal dileptons, a substantial fraction of $\\omega$ mesons decay outside the fireball due to their longer lifetime. These decays contribute to the freeze-out cocktail with the vacuum line shape of the vector mesons. High-statistics data from Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.55$ GeV, measured by the HADES collaboration, may allow for the isolation of these two different contributions and enable studies of in-medium modifications of the $\\omega$ meson spectral function in the experimental data.\r\nThis poster presents a framework that describes the vector meson freeze-out contributions using the shining method, while the thermal dilepton spectrum is determined via the coarse-graining model. By combining these two approaches, we aim to achieve a precise theoretical description of the invariant mass spectrum of thermal dileptons in heavy-ion collisions within the few GeV energy range.

The unexpected observation of significant Lambda hyperon polarization in inclusive p+p and p+A collisions using unpolarized beams triggered theoretical efforts to describe this effect. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the origin of hyperon polarization. Several models have successfully explained the behavior of some hyperons, but none have been able to account for the behavior of the entire hyperon family.\r\n\r\nNA61/SHINE is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS with large acceptance and high particle identification capabilities. The first feasibility studies have shown that the properties of the magnetic field used by NA61/SHINE, together with high statistics of collected p+p collisions at beam momentum 158 GeV/c, offer possibilities to study Lambda polarization in several bins of pT and xF. Current studies concentrate on the extraction of Lambda yields based on an invariant mass distribution of selected pairs of proton and negatively charged pion. These yields are corrected by the MC simulations using EPOS and Fritiof model and two different methods. The poster will contain a description of the methodology of our studies and will present Lambda distributions with predictions of selected theoretical models.",

The production of strange hadrons is enhanced in heavy-ion collisions due to thermal gluon saturation, while it is suppressed in small systems due to canonical suppression, as supported by canonical models. Despite being one of the earliest signatures of quark-gluon plasma formation, the strangeness enhancement is in debate till today. Hadronic resonances like \\(\\rho(770)^0\\), \\(K^*(890)^0\\), \\(\\phi(1020)\\), \\(\\Lambda(1520)\\), and \\(\\Xi(1530)^0\\) are sensitive probes of the hadronic phase, the stage between chemical and kinetic freeze-out.

Moreover, baryon-to-meson ratios provide valuable information on different production mechanisms involved in their formation, which further requires theoretical exploration.

Hypernuclei measurements provide insights into the equation-of-state of hadronic matter at high net-baryon densities, as well as into hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-interactions. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt offers the ideal conditions to explore the production of hypernuclei. The excitation function of hypernuclei production is predicted to exhibit a maximum in the FAIR energy range. In combination with the foreseen high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, an exceptionally high statistics of hypernuclei will be collected and even very rare double hypernuclei like ${}^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}He$ are expected with sizeable statistics. \r\n\r\nFor the evaluation of the CBM performance with respect to hypernuclei measurements their reconstruction in the 3-body decay channels is especially important as, e.g., it is assumed that the rare ${}^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}He$ can decay into three daughters. To evaluate performance indicators like efficiency and signal-to-background ratio as well as the systematic uncertainties of this type of decay, $^{3}_{\\Lambda}H\\rightarrow d+p+\\pi^-$, which is abundant enough to provide robust results, was studied in detail. Systematical uncertainties were estimated based on simulations with different transport models (e.g. PHQMD), taking into account the extrapolation of the measurements to the full rapidity and transverse momentum range, as well as possible systematic effects of the reconstruction procedures. The experimental sensitivity to properties of hypernuclei, such as their lifetime, was evaluated.

      "Abstract": "Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars.  Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm.  This large $\\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights into the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.",

The production of dileptons in the Au+Au and U+U collision systems is studied at relativistic heavy-ion collisions with different initial nuclear deformation profiles. Moreover, the contributions of dileptons from both quark-antiquark pairs in the partonic phase and $\\rho^0$-meson decay in the hadronic phase are considered. We compare the dilepton production with the STAR data in Au+Au collision system at 200 GeV and use these results as a baseline for the U+U systems. The difference in multiplicity distributions resulting from the different deformation factor $\\beta_2$, leads to a greater suppression of dilepton production in systems with a larger $|\\beta_2|$, especially in the most central collisions.

      "Abstract": "The study of heavy quark (HQ) dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions at facilities like RHIC and LHC has provided crucial insights into QGP properties. Due to their large masses, HQs evolve over the QGP’s short lifetime while retaining information about their interaction with the medium. Typically, HQ evolution is studied using the Langevin equation under the assumption of normal diffusion, where mean-square displacement (MSD) increases linearly with time [1]. However, this approach fails to fully capture the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) simultaneously—a challenge known as the $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle [2].\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address heavy flavor $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle employing the anomalous (super-) diffusion of HQs in the QGP through a fractional Langevin equation (FLE) approach [3], considering a hydrodynamically expanding medium. Unlike the standard Langevin equation, the FLE replaces integer-order derivatives with Caputo fractional derivatives [4], allowing for a broader range of diffusion behaviours, including super-diffusion, where the MSD of HQs increases faster than linearly with time. This model is highly relevant for heavy particles moving through a complex medium like the QGP, where strong correlations and long-range interactions lead to memory effects in particle motion. Our results demonstrate that due to super-diffusion, the HQ energy loss is significantly enhanced in the QGP medium, captures the $R_{AA}$ correctly and contributes to higher values of elliptic flow as the strong interactions with the medium induce greater momentum anisotropy.\r\n\r\n\r\n1: M.

      "Abstract": "We investigate the flavor dependence of parton splitting inside a color-deconfined medium by examining the suppression factor, substructures, and jet axis decorrelation of inclusive jets, $c$-jets and $b$-jets. Utilizing the linear Boltzmann transport model that treats light and heavy flavor parton scatterings with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) on an equal basis, we provide a simultaneous description of the suppression factors of inclusive jets and heavy-flavor tagged jets observed at the LHC. We find that while the suppression factor of jets does not explicitly reveal flavor dependence due to significant gluon contributions in both inclusive and heavy-flavor jets, jet flavor does influence their substructures, such as the longitudinal and transverse distributions of energetic particles within jets. Additionally, we explore the jet axis decorrelation, defined as the angle between the standard jet axis and the winner-take-all (WTA) axis, which is expected to be sensitive to interactions between the hardest particle inside a jet and the QGP. The observed differences in the jet axis decorrelation between light and heavy flavor jets highlight not only the mass dependent diffusion of hard partons in a thermal medium, but also provide a valuable opportunity to investigate the distinct broadening effects experienced by quarks and gluons inside the QGP.",

In this presentation, I focus on a Renormalization Group (RG) treatment that successfully eliminates these artifacts(arXiv number: [2408.06704][1]). Our study reveals a substantial change in the previously established phase diagram of neutral CSC matter. The RG-consistent treatment not only eliminates cut-off artifacts but also aligns with an earlier Ginzburg-Landau analysis, suggesting the appearance of a so-called dSC phase in the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) melting pattern. The new model offers improved phenomenological aspects of speed of sound, demonstrating reliability at higher densities, which is crucial for investigating potential CSC phases in neutron star mergers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://%20https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06704",

      "Abstract": "The studies of heavy flavor (charm or bottom) hadrons in relativistic collisions provide an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). As the majority of the heavy flavor particles are produced in the initial stages of the heavy-ion collisions, they experience the whole QCD medium evolution. The lightest open charm meson, $D^{0}$, and hidden charm vector meson, J/$\\psi$, are particularly useful as they are abundantly produced as compared to other open and hidden charm hadrons, respectively. The $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons that are either directly formed during initial scattering or as the decay products of higher charm stages are referred to as the prompt production, which is essential to probe the QCD medium. On the other hand, the non-prompt $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons are usually formed as the decay products of beauty hadrons and can provide a key understanding of beauty hadrons.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) models to segregate the prompt and non-prompt productions of $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the\r\ntrack-level information of the particles like an experimental environment. We have used the PYTHIA8 event generator to simulate the events for the study, which provides a good qualitative description of experimental measurements. We have considered the $D^{0}\\rightarrow\\pi^{+}K^{-}$ and J/$\\psi\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay channels for our study. To separate prompt from non-prompt sector of charmonia and open charm mesons, topological production of $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ are considered.  We have used XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest models for $D^{0}$ related studies, whereas for  J/$\\psi$, we have used XGBoost and LighGBM models. For $D^{0}$, we have used invariant mass ($m_{\\pi K}$ ), pseudoproper time ($t_z$ ), pseudoproper decay length ($c_{\\tau}$ ), and distance of closest approach ($\\rm{DCA}_{D_{0}}$ )  as the training inputs. For J/$\\psi$ meson, the input sample is chosen keeping ALICE Run 3 muon forward tracker upgrade in mind, which includes, invariant mass ($m_{\\mu\\mu}$ ), transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and $c_{\\tau}$. The machine learning models provide up to 99\\% accuracy to dissect the prompt and non-prompt production of both $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$. Transverse momentum, rapidity and multiplicity differential comparisons between the true and predicted values are compared to evaluate the performance of the models. Experimental comparisons are also made wherever applicable. The ML methods used in the present study can replace the traditionally used fitting method with the added advantage of track label identification. The present ML-based identification of prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons can be useful in experiments that require precise measurements.",

We demonstrate that in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results.

In mid-central collisions, the $v_n$ values are also influenced by half-height radius  $R_0$ and nuclear skin $a_0$. These influences can be well revealed by ratios of observables between two isobaric collision systems, $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions, which have different structures. While compared to isobar collisions, isobar+large nuclei, such as $^{96}$Ru+$^{197}$Au and $^{96}$Zr+$^{197}$Au collisions, provide a clearer approach to studying nuclear structure, as they involve a single elliptical or triangular shape rather than a superposition of two elliptic or triangular patterns. The results suggest even larger $v_2$ and $v_3$ difference between the two isobar+Au collisions. The infulence on flow fluctuation will also be discussed.

The emergence of the first two terms, $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $q_\\mu$, is attributed to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, we also treat the spin density ($S^{\\mu \\nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable alongside energy density and particle density, leading to two additional transport coefficients characterized by the correlation between $S^{\\mu \\nu}$ and $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ and vice-versa.

Using kinetic theory in the (momentum dependent) relaxation time approximation I show how one can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with quasi-particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, I introduce the *non-analytic area density* that describes the properties of this region. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, I will identify two specific choices called *pictures* with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.",

      "Speaker": "Shubhalaxmi Rath",
      "Institute": "Universidad de Tarapacá",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "This work focuses on the effects of rotation on the transport coefficients and observables of the QGP medium. Since the noncentral heavy ion collisions possess finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, the rotation gets incited in the produced medium. The rotation could significantly alter the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the trace anomaly and the isothermal compressibility. We have determined the transport coefficients using a novel relaxation time approximation method within the kinetic theory approach in association with the finite angular velocity. We have compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation and with their counterparts in the nonrotating medium. It is observed that the introduction of angular velocity enhances the transport of both charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the novel relaxation time approximation estimates smaller values of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Additionally, the aforesaid observables get conspicuously modulated by the rotation of the medium. Our observation shows a decrease in the Knudsen number and an increase in the elliptic flow when rotation is incorporated into the medium. This suggests an enhancement in the interactions among the produced particles in heavy ion collisions, leading to faster thermalization of the medium. Thus, as angular velocity increases, the medium moves closer to equilibrium. Further, we have found an increasing trend of the trace anomaly with the rising angular velocity and its slope decreases as the temperature increases. Thus, at high temperatures, the rotation has a paltry impact on the trace anomaly. Overall, the rotation makes the constituents of the medium more interactive and as a result, the medium gets deviated away from the conformal symmetry. We have further observed that the introduction of rotation into the medium reduces the isothermal compressibility and allows the medium to exhibit nearly perfect fluid behavior. This suggests that, with the increasing angular velocity, it is difficult to compress the system. Consequently, the matter becomes stiffer as the rotation becomes more rapid.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In this work, we analyze the impact of open-heavy-flavor-production data in proton-lead collisions on the nCTEQ nuclear PDFs. For the theoretical predictions of this process, we use an existing next-to-leading-order calculation in a general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (GM-VFNS), which, as a pQCD alternative, we compare to the data-driven approach for open heavy-flavor production used in the most recent nCTEQ global nuclear PDF analyses. The latter uses a \"crystal-ball\" function, an effective hard-scattering matrix element that is fitted to data from proton-proton collisions and then used as the theoretical prediction in the proton-lead case. Since the crystal-ball function is given by an analytical formula, it provides the required performance for PDF fits out of the box.\r\nConversely, pQCD calculations are usually given as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which can take multiple CPU hours to reach a viable precision. Thus, a significant speedup of the evaluation of the pQCD predictions is required to make the direct MC calculation feasible for global PDF analyses. This is achieved by \"gridding\" the hard-scattering cross sections, i.e., calculating them once and storing their interpolated values in look-up tables (grids). The physical predictions can then be obtained by convolving the grids with a PDF of choice, only taking up a small fraction of the runtime of the full calculation. One library providing this functionality is PineAPPL, which we use to grid the predictions for open heavy-flavor production in the GM-VFNS.",

Our large-system-constrained results are validated by their consistency with the light-flavor photon-normalized $R_{AB} \\sim 0.75$ measured in central $d + \\mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX; however, they are inconsistent with the $R_{AB} \\sim 1.2$ measured in central $p + \\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS.   We show that, independent of a variety of energy loss models, one expects similar suppression in central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, underscoring the challenges in interpreting the measured enhancement in central $p+A$ collisions.  To better understand the theory expectation, we account for several theoretical uncertainties, resulting in a 50% uncertainty in the extracted value of the jet transport coefficient $\\hat{q}$ and highlighting concerns about the reliability of using hard probes to measure quark-gluon plasma properties.  We further show that using both heavy- and light-flavor observables to constrain the model can significantly decrease the impact of these uncertainties.

Today these phenomena are not completely understood: it is an important question whether the presence of the QGP is necessary for the observed collectivity or not. Moreover, the connection between the experimental observables and theories is not trivial. In our phenomenological study we introduce the ‘Tsallis-thermometer’ as an indicator of quark-gluon plasma, that aims to describe the smooth transition from small to large collisional systems.\r\n\r\nThe Tsallis-thermometer is an excellent measure for locating collective effects in high-energy collisions from small to large system sizes.

Thermodynamical consistency helps us to measure EoS more accurately.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applications of the Tsallis-thermometer cover the fileds: \r\n\r\n(i) analysis of the transverse momentum distribution of identified hadrons within the thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-extensive statistics. A wide range of center-of-mass energies and average event multiplicities are studied for various hadron species. We demonstrate that the average event multiplicity is a key variable in the study of high-energy collisions. For this purpose the non-extensive statistical approach is more than appropriate.

      "Abstract": "The equation of state of nuclear matter at 2-4 times nuclear saturation density is not very well determined by first principle methods. Heavy-ion collisions offer the opportunity to reach those high densities and collective flow measurements are sensitive to the properties of the medium. At 1-2 AGeV per nucleon beam energy transport approaches are the best choice for the theoretical description of the dynamic evolution of the system. In this work, we aim to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter by comparing calculations within the SMASH transport approach to directed and elliptic flow measurements for protons and deuterons performed by the FOPI and HADES collaboration in a systematic way. \r\n\r\nA momentum-dependent term is included in the potential for which we show that it is needed to describe flow data. We further incorporate a simple symmetry potential in the transport model and present constraints on the stiffness of the equation of state of nuclear matter at saturation density and on the symmetry potential. For the FOPI data, Z=1 nuclei are considered and differential directed and elliptic flow measurements are compared with the calculations using a chi-square analysis. For Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV, the HADES measurements, the constraints are obtained by performing a Bayesian analysis such that we can also provide an uncertainty for the estimated parameters. The posterior distribution is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for which we emulate the transport model with a Gaussian process to lower computational costs. We find that a relatively stiff equation of state is favoured in our analysis with a small uncertainty whereas the constraints obtained for the symmetry potential are rather loose. For the lower FOPI energy of Au+Au collisions at 0.4 AGeV a softer equation of state yields a better description of the collective flow data. This potential discrepancy can be attributed to the role of resonance excitations that effectively soften the equation of state of the formed medium in higher energy collisions. \r\n\r\nSee https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09889 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16927",

This system is characterized by large values of the baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) at chemical freeze-out, as determined through statistical-chemical analysis of hadron yields. However, at these lower energies, the freeze-out parameters are less constrained compared to higher-energy collisions, due to the rare production of certain hadron states. This imposes stringent requirements on experiments to gather sufficient data.\r\nFurthermore, at lower collision energies, additional parameters beyond temperature ($T$), fireball volume ($V$), and baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) as well as the treatment of light nuclei become increasingly important.\r\nIn this study, we employ updated methods that account for higher-order efficiency corrections from HADES experiments at GSI. This approach allows for a systematic and unprecedented precision analysis of baryon stopping and the global properties of matter at freeze-out, based on Au+Au and Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.42 and  2.55\r\nGeV, respectively.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy range provide an opportunity to investigate the properties of nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities, similar to the conditions in Neutron Stars (NS) and Neutron Star mergers. In recent decades, significant attention has been given to the presence of hyperons in NS and their influence on the Equation of State (EoS), which describes the dense nuclear matter, lies at the core of the so-called “hyperon puzzle.” The absence of precise measurements of nucleon-nucleon (NN), nucleon-hyperon (NY), and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions has hindered progress in resolving this enigmatic contradiction and constructing the universal EoS.\r\nThe femtoscopy technique is a method used to study interparticle interactions. It also provides a way to extract the space-time properties of the expanding fireball created in heavy-ion collisions. The interaction between two particles can be described using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz equation, which constrains two essential parameters: the scattering length ($f_0$) and the effective range ($d_0$). The definitive knowledge about those parameters for NN, NY, and YY systems may be the missing piece of the “hyperon puzzle.”\r\nIn this talk, the preliminary HADES results on femtoscopic observables of proton-proton (in Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.4 GeV), proton-lambda, and deuteron-lambda (in Ag-Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.55 GeV) will be presented. We introduce the one-dimensional femtoscopic radii dependence on pair transverse momentum and collision centrality. Additionally, the parameters describing the strong interaction for the femtoscopic systems (proton-proton, deuteron-lambda) under study will be outlined for the first time using the data collected by the HADES collaboration. We intend to compare the obtained values with past studies, including the spin-separated proton-lambda results shown at QM2023.",

We present recent high statistics results on collective flow phenomena of protons and light nuclei in Au+Au and Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.42 and 2.55 GeV. In addition to the commonly discussed directed and elliptic flow, coefficients vn up to the 6th order are investigated for the first time in this energy regime. Their combined information allows to construct a full 3D-picture of the angular particle emission in momentum space and can provide more stringent constraints on the EoS. Furthermore, the event-by-event correlations between the different flow coefficients can be exploited for this purpose and will also be presented.\r\nAdditional sensitivity to the EoS is provided by a measurement of charged kaon flow, as K+ and K− are predicted to interact differently with dense nuclear matter. First results on a multi-differential analysis of their directed and elliptic flow will be discussed.\r\nThe multi-differential HADES flow data are confronted with various transport model approaches relevant for this energy region and current constraints e.g. derived via a Bayesian analysis on the EoS are discussed.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In off-central heavy ion collisions (HIC), an appreciable amount of initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the colliding heavy nuclei can be transferred to the participants and subsequently to the nuclear medium formed [1]. This transferred OAM can give rise to local vorticity in the created matter. The transport coefficients of the matter formed in HIC give ample information about the medium formed and the underlying interactions. The transport properties, such as electrical conductivity, viscosities, and thermal conductivity of quantum chromodynamic (QCD) medium modifies in a rotating frame. By breaking the rotational symmetry of the medium, transport coefficients become anisotropic in a rotating frame. Similar to the Lorentz force in the presence of magnetic fields, the Coriolis force plays the equivalent role in a system with finite angular momentum. In a non-relativistic formulation, we have to introduce the Coriolis force in the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) as an external force. However, considering the relativistic equation of motion in a rotating frame, Coriolis force comes naturally in BTE at leading order in angular velocity. Here, we discuss how electrical conductivity [2,3] and the shear viscosity [4] of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic gas are modified in a rotating frame due to the influence of Coriolis force. The transport coefficients are evaluated with the help of covariant BTE in the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The QGP is modeled with a massless gas of light quarks and gluons rotating with a constant angular velocity Ω. Similarly, the hadronic gas is modeled by the ideal hadron resonance gas (IHRG) in a rotating frame, with the relaxation time calculated in a hard sphere-type scattering, treating the hard sphere scattering length as a tuning parameter. At first, we tune the relaxation time for electrical conductivity and shear viscosity in the QGP and hadronic phases without rotation (Ω=0). After the calibration of relaxation time, we show the variation of perpendicular, parallel, and Hall-type components of viscosity and conductivity as a function of angular velocity and temperature for both rotating QGP and IHRG.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

Using variational methods, we numerically investigate matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$ in the limit of ultra-strong Yang-Mills coupling ($g_{YM} =\\infty$). The spectrum of the model has superselection sectors labelled by baryon number $B$ and spin $J$. We study sectors with $B=0,1,2$ and $J=0,1$, which may be organised as mesons, (anti-)diquarks and (anti-)tetraquarks. For each of these sectors, we study the properties of the respective ground states in both chiral and heavy quark limits, and uncover a rich quantum phase transition (QPT) structure.  We also investigate the division of the total spin between the glue and the quark and show that glue contribution is significant for several of these sectors.  For the $(B,J)=(0,0)$ sector, we find that the dominant glue contribution to the ground state comes from reducible connections. Finally, in the presence of non-trivial baryon chemical potential $\\mu$, we construct the phase diagram of the model. For sufficiently large $\\mu$, we find that the ground state of the theory may have non-zero spin, indicating a phase reminiscent of the LOFF phase in two-color QCD.",

However, in a particular case—the boost-invariant flow—the STS condition is automatically satisfied.

For this purpose, the experiment will use modules constructed using the same technology and procedures as the modules of the Silicon Tracking System (STS) of the CBM experiment.\r\n\r\nA total of 10 modules were assembled, tested, characterized and then installed in the E16 detector setup. The detector was commissioned in a beam test experiment at Tsukuba, where the detector modules could be exposed to a 3 GeV electron beam. In preparation for the beam test the detector were characterized and calibrated and performance studies were accomplished to asses the quality of the setup.\r\n\r\nThis work will show the results of the commissioning and operation of the E16 modules, as well as the status of the data analysis.",

      "Country": "Korea",
      "Abstract": "Recent experimental results on two-particle correlations within jets with extremely high multiplicities in pp collisions highlight a strong flow-like correlation among constituents. One of the hypotheses to describe this effect suggests the formation of a hot and dense QCD medium within the jet cone, a phenomenon previously thought to occur exclusively in heavy-ion collisions. One notable characteristic of such medium formation is the altered production ratio among different particle species. This is particularly relevant for short-lived, strongly decaying resonances, since their decay products can experience (pseudo-)elastic interactions with the formed hadrons after chemical freeze-out. In turn, this drastically alters the final-state yields of such particles. This contribution investigates this phenomenon by analyzing the yields of K* and Φ mesons within high-multiplicity jets in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV with LHC Run 3 data collected with ALICE. The measurement utilizes charged-particle jets, and per-jet yields of K* and Φ are investigated in and out of such jets. The focus on resonances is expected to provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of QCD medium creation and its influence on particle production patterns.",

The novel method proposed in this poster uses the Hough transform to estimate the interaction vertex position without the necessity to reconstruct the tracks first. While it does not replace the traditional tracks-based vertex reconstruction, it offers an admissible resolution that is usable for seed filtering. Moreover, numerical complexity of the algorithm scales linearly with the track multiplicity, making it ideal for high-multiplicity events.",

We review EM calorimeter based meson measurements and several calibrations methods used for calibrating both hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters at RHIC, LHC, and elsewhere, and also explore some possibilities for use at the upcoming EIC Facility.

      "Abstract": "Relativistic viscous hydrodynamics has been widely used as an effective theory of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) stage in high energy collisions. The analytical structure of hydrodynamics consists of a hydrodynamic and a non-hydrodynamic mode. The hydrodynamic mode is associated with an attractor solution and is considered to be the reason for the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics in explaining the soft sector observables. The non-hydrodynamic mode manifests as dissipative effects in the system. The shear relaxation time acts as a regulator of non-hydrodynamic mode. We exploit this feature to find the smallest size of QGP in peripheral proton-nucleus collisions using the state-of-the-art framework of JETSCAPE. As predicted by Paul Romatschke in Ref. [Eur. Phys. J. C (2017) 77:21], an abrupt increase in the second anisotropic flow coefficient in peripheral collisions for extreme values of shear relaxation time is a signature of breakdown of hydrodynamics. We find the threshold peripheral collisional centrality up to which we can safely employ hydrodynamics. We make a semi-quantitative estimate of the smallest volume and lifetime of QGP for the collision system of p+Pb at 5.02 TeV and p+Au at 200 GeV.",

      "Abstract": "Jets are collimated bunches of hadrons, and they serve as a useful tool for studying QCD. Jets are generated from the hard scattering processes of quarks and gluons in particle collisions, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These processes can be theoretically described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) and are well-modeled by Monte Carlo simulations such as PYTHIA and HERWIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavy-flavor quarks are produced in the early stages of collisions, before the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed. These quarks interact with the medium and undergo hadronization. Therefore, heavy-flavor jets, which originate from heavy-flavor quarks, are a unique tool for studying the properties of the QGP. Furthermore, due to the dead-cone effect, heavy-flavor jets are relatively less contaminated by gluons compared to light-flavor jets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the properties of jets, studying the substructure within jets is essential. The Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) is a correlation function of the energy flow within a jet and is known as a robust observable against soft emissions or collinear splittings. Experimentally, the EEC is defined as the energy-weighted two-particle correlation as a function of the angular distance between pairs of particles. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulations, such as PYTHIA and HERWIG, to investigate the flavor dependence of the EEC in proton-proton collisions.

To achieve this aim, we used Monte Carlo simulations using PYTHIA and PYTHIA+POWHEG event generators.

Specifically, gluon antishadowing plays a crucial role in high-energy nuclear collisions, as gluons are key contributors to high-energy particle and jet production.\r\nThe $R_{pA}$ results from our simulations show a slight enhancement in the dijet spectrum, reflecting the contribution from the antishadowing region in the lead nPDF. Both PYTHIA and PYTHIA+POWEHG models demonstrate consistent results. These findings provide an important benchmark for comparison with LHC experimental data.

We find for the neutrino-trapped cases higher minimal masses than for the cases when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron stars. Thermal effects, in this work a given constant entropy per baryon, also increase the minimal mass.  Calculations of core-collapse supernovae impose a lower limit of approximately $1.2M_{\\odot}$ for neutron stars. Our determined values for the first evolution stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ is $M_{min} \\sim 0.62M_{\\odot}$ and for the stage after that with $Y_{\\nu} = 0$ and $s = 2$ we find $M_{min} \\sim 0.22M_{\\odot}$. We also study the case of an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf with a lepton fraction of $Y_L = 0.5$ and find large discrepancies in the results of different nuclear models studied. We furthermore examine the minimal mass dependence on the lepton fraction, which follows a similar relation for all equations of state studied.\r\nOur focus lies on incorporating color superconducting phases at higher densities.",

Our study uncovers that the local thermodynamic relations, which have been conventionally used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin based on global thermodynamic equilibrium, are generally inadequate. We will present two specific examples to illustrate this: a system of massless and massive free fermions under rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Our findings reveal that the traditional local thermodynamic relations are incomplete when the spin tensor is considered. Notably, we show that the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential deviates from the spin density, acquiring corrections due to acceleration and rotation. These results suggest that for an accurate derivation of constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional thermodynamic relations must be extended.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Azimuthal anisotropy is by now a standard observation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, believed to primarily result from hydrodynamic expansion of the created hot and dense quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Ubiquitous observations of azimuthal anisotropy have also been made in small-system (proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and deuteron/$^{3}$He-nucleus) collisions. These observations, while prompting the exciting possibility of QGP droplet formation in those small systems, provoke skepticism on the belief that those anisotropies must stem from hydrodynamic origins. Unfortunately, the interaction strength cannot be arbitrarily tuned in nuclear collisions, which would elucidate the physics mechanisms of azimuthal anisotropy. We report an experimental research [1] on the anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in a harmonic potential of an elliptic shape, where the interactions can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. We also explore higher-order harmonic anisotropies, such as triangular anisotropy by preparing an initial triangular shape of the harmonic potential. It is found that the expansion anisotropy of cold atoms builds up quickly at small interaction strength, indicating that strong hydrodynamic interactions are not a prerequisite. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy as a function of the interaction strength is observed, quantitatively comparable between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics [1]. This observation suggests a universality in the expansion dynamics in interacting systems, independent of the physics nature of those interactions. The universality potentially unifies a variety of disciplines in nature, spanning from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting QGP of the early universe.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n[1] Li K., Song H-F., Sun Y-L., Xu H-J., Wang F-Q., Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma, arXiv:2405.02847.",

To do so we study dark matter-admixed neutron stars and try to classify the differences and similarities. We are including bosonic, self-interacting dark matter with a sufficiently stiff self-interaction potential in the form of $V \\propto \\phi^n$ and find that these neutron stars become ultra-compact ($C \\geq 1/3$).  We furthermore study the stability of these configurations by investigating the onset of unstable radial modes. With their unique properties they could account for unusual mass-radius measurements, however the same is valid for quark stars, i.e. stars made off entirely quark matter.

      "Abstract": "Quarkonium production can be used to probe the matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, for theoretical understanding of the experimental results on quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions it is necessary to know if and which quarkonium states exist above the crossover temperature, $T_c$ and what are the in-medium masses and widths of different quarkonium states. In this talk we will focus on the lattice QCD study of in-medium bottomonium properties [1].\r\n\r\nIn-medium bottomonium properties are encoded in the spectral functions, which are related to the Euclidean time correlators calculable on the lattice. We will present lattice QCD studies of 1S, 2S, 3S, 1P, 2P and 3P bottomonium correlators for $T \\simeq 133-250$ MeV [1], where the 3P state is explored for the first time. These calculations are performed with non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for the bottom quark and on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds using highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near physical point. In our study we use correlators of extended bottomonium operators [2, 3] to gain optimized overlaps with specific states and to be more sensitive to thermal effects. Compared to the previous studies that are based on a single lattice spacing per temperature value and temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=12$, we use two lattice spacings and lattices with the temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=16-30$.\r\n\r\nWe find that all bottomonia states below the open beauty threshold exist above $T_c$, including 3P state. We will show the temperature dependence of the thermal widths and in-medium masses extracted from the bottomonium correlators with physically-motivated ansatzes for the spectral function. We find that, within estimated errors, the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration, while non-zero widths for different bottomonium states can be observed. These observations suggest excited bottomonium states still exist above $T_c$ and screening is not the likely source of bottomonium dissociation.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] H.-T. Ding, W.-P. Huang, R.

We analyzed how variations in the vector interaction coupling ($\\eta_V$) and diquark coupling ($\\eta_D$) affect the equation of state (EoS), gap parameters, the 2SC and CFL phases, and the speed of sound. Our results show that stronger diquark and vector couplings stiffen the EoS, leading to higher maximum masses for compact stars, satisfying the 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ constraint from heavy neutron star observations. We found that the CFL phase is stable within our RG-consistent approach and that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal limit for non-vanishing vector couplings. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the mass-radius relationship of quark stars varies from self-bound configurations to gravitationally bound ones, with no absolutely stable configurations across the entire parameter space. Based on the observation that in a possible hybrid construction to our model,  2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ can be mostly reached if the pure quark branch can already support  2.0 $M_{\\odot}$,  we find the parameter range that satisfies this condition. We found that within all our studied parameters, the maximum mass configurations always have a CFL core.",

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a challenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on the phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the order of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of massless quark flavors. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out the chiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the crossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge coupling, the number of quark flavors, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Lattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for $N_f \\lesssim 8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^{tric}(N_f)$, at which the chiral transition changes from first order ($a>a_{tric}$) to second order ($a<a_{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is a lattice artifact, and in the continuum limit, the transition is of second order for all $N_f \\lesssim 8$. By determining the associated temperatures  $T(N_f^{tric},a ^{tric})$ at these tricritical points, we confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of flavors increases. The location of the tricritical point in the continuum limit $T(N_f^{tric},a=0)$ is still under investigation. Current simulations on finer lattices suggest that in the continuum limit, the transition temperature approaches $T(N_f^*,a=0)=0$ at $N_f^*  \\approx 8$. This implies that, on the one hand, $N_f=8$ marks the onset of the conformal window, and, on the other hand, for all $N_f<8$ the chiral transition is of second order.",

We will demonstrate how flow of the ambient medium in a direction transverse to the jet can introduce both dipole and quadrupole defomations. We analyze the corresponding n=1 and n=2 harmonic deformations of the transverse structure of jets using the method of Q-vectors. We discuss how the harmonic coefficients and their preferred angles evolve when the ambient environment of jets changes from the vacuum to a parton medium without flow and finally to a medium with various rates of transverse flow. We have conducted a systematic study using both partonic and hadronization effects of the medium on jets. While quadrupole deformations are naturally present even in the vacuum, we find that the existence of sizable dipole deformations, and a correlation of the angles of dipole and quadrupole deformations could constitute clear experimental signals for the presence and size of transverse flow.",

      "Abstract": "We present a new coherent jet energy loss model for heavy-ion collisions. It is implemented as a Monte Carlo perturbative final-state parton shower followed by elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. The model has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z and GLV predictions for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium, as well as the Improved Opacity Expansion. The realistic case for LHC energy with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. The model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind, and we present implementations within the EPOS4 and Pythia 8 Monte Carlo frameworks. These comes with an interface with full simulations of the quark-gluon-plasma with hydrodynamic evolution, such as vHLLE, along with subsequent hadronisation of the jet partons in order to produce realistic distributions that can be directly compared to LHC and RHIC data.

Our main finding is that the effect of glasma on the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for the heavy quark transverse momentum spectrum is moderate, while $c\\overline{c}$ angular correlations are strongly affected by the glasma [1]. Such correlations are relevant for the experimentally measurable $D\\overline{D}$ angular correlations.   \r\n\r\nWe numerically evaluate the classical transport equations for heavy quarks in the glasma fields, which in turn are obtained from a numerical solution of the classical field equations of motion [2]. Within this approach, we simulate the transport of $Q\\overline{Q}$ pairs produced back-to-back in the glasma fields and extract their two particle correlations $\\mathcal{C}(\\Delta\\phi,\\Delta\\eta)$. We focus on the azimuthal correlations  $\\mathcal{C}(\\Delta\\phi)$ and evaluate the decorrelation width $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\phi}$ as a function of the initial quark $p_T$ and Glasma saturation momentum $Q_s$. We find that pairs with moderate $p_T$ in a glasma with sufficiently large $Q_s$ values exhibit a noticeable decorrelation already during the glasma stage. Further, we investigate how heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, initialized according to the FONLL heavy quark production cross section, are affected by the glasma fields. The strong glasma fields cause a shift in the initial spectra from low to higher $p_T$. Nevertheless, this effect on $R_{AA}$ is moderate in comparison with the nPDF contribution to the input FONLL spectra. \r\n\r\n[1] D. Avramescu, V. Greco, T. Lappi, H. Mäntysaari, D.

The models are driven by a large number of parameters that quantify the properties of the medium and the initial stage of the heavy-ion collision. The need to find model parameters which give the best description of the experimental data imposes a multidimensional optimization problem. The Bayesian analysis has shown to be successful in constraining the parameter values, and the combined inclusion of LHC Pb$-$Pb 5.02 and 2.76 TeV data with additional flow observables has greatly narrowed down the uncertainties [1].\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present our latest study in inferring the transport properties of QGP by including the RHIC Au$-$Au collision data in addition to the LHC data used in the previous studies [1]. Additionally, we now define the centrality separately for all parametrisations instead of using a singular definition for all of them. With the added Au$-$Au data and exclusive centrality calibration, the data now favour smaller values for nucleon width and minimum distance between nucleons.

      "Abstract": "We propose a novel set of flow observables designed to probe event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges in relativistic high-energy collisions. We find that, in $\\rm Pb\\texttt{+}Pb$ collisions at the LHC $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, our observables are sensitive to local fluctuations in baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q), which in turn lead to measurable effects in the anisotropic flow of identified hadrons when two particles of interest (2POI) are considered. Using a newly developed framework, we demonstrate that the observables reduce to 0 or 1 in the absence of BSQ fluctuations but deviate from these values by up to 10\\% when such fluctuations are present. Future high luminosity runs at the LHC will provide the necessary statistics to conduct experimental analyses with multiple particles of interest. Experimental validation of our findings will therefore offer an opportunity to place additional constraints on the charge fluctuations produced in the initial states of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://inspirehep.net/literature/2787415",

Despite these challenges, spectator production reveals rich physics that includes the neutron skin of Pb-208, event shape engineering of QGP droplets and an independent centrality estimator for ultracentral collisions. In this talk we present Trajectum results that include a sophisticated Bayesian analysis of a clustering model, cluster decay using the Gemini code and matched to recent ALICE data that include neutron and proton ZDC signals as well as the event-by-event spectator asymmetry.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "We formulate an efficient covariant method for interacting N-body systems with correct density-dependent potential and consistent mass-shell constraints.  We implement it in the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2 and calculate anisotropic flows for RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic transport approaches such as Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) have proven to be effective for simulating the space-time propagation of systems in heavy-ion collisions and for extracting the properties of dense nuclear matter. While BUU is a one-body theory, QMD and its relativistic version, RQMD, approaches evolve an N-body distribution function capable of capturing event-by-event fluctuations and correlations, which are crucial for understanding nuclear cluster formation and fluctuations of conserved charges. However, certain approximations for density-dependent potentials in the conventional QMD and RQMD hinder their accurate reproduction of the equation of state. Explicit three-dimensional integration is needed to obtain the exact density dependence, which is numerically expensive. Furthermore, the traditional RQMD models use mass-shell constraints inconsistent with the underlying theory.\r\n\r\nThis work addresses these limitations by formulating a covariant approach to interacting Gaussian wave packets that achieves accurate density-dependent potentials under correct mass-shell constraints. Our method introduces a novel approximation scheme for computing the density-dependent potential within the RQMD framework, yielding precise solutions with a reduced computational cost. Starting with an action for interacting wave packets, we derive equations of motion for Gaussian packets consistent with constrained Hamiltonian dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis new RQMD formulation is implemented in JAM2 together with the covariant collision term [1] and applied to Skyrme-type density-dependent potentials [2], the Walecka model [3], and the parity-doublet model [4].

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Hybrid numerical models based on relativistic hydrodynamics have successfully described key aspects of the evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. At the end of the hydrodynamical stage, the continuous fluid degrees of freedom are translated to the discrete components of a hadron resonance gas described by kinetic theory. This process is based on the Cooper-Frye formalism and is typically called particlization. Viscous corrections to the Cooper-Frye formula are encoded in a linear correction to the equilibrium probability distribution function. Such corrections at particlization remain a major source of theoretical uncertainty in Bayesian inference of the QGP properties from heavy-ion data.\r\n\r\nWe introduce and evaluate viscous corrections based on the recently presented novel relaxation time approximation, designed to uphold conservation laws without relying on specific matching conditions or relaxation time parametrization. This new viscous correction also introduces a phenomenological parameter $\\gamma$ related to the microscopic interactions between particles. We investigate the performance of this new correction in the particlization process and systematically compare it to traditional viscous corrections to demonstrate its effects and the $\\gamma$ dependence on final state observables. The findings provide insights into the particlization process, advancing our understanding of how viscous corrections impact phenomenological analyses of anisotropic flow and hadronic chemistry and offering a pathway for more systematic models of heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Hadronisation is the complex process by which hadrons form from partons. Due to its non-perturbative nature, an exact theoretical description is unavailable, making phenomenological assumptions necessary. Currently, various hadronisation models are implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator PYTHIA 8.311. In this poster, we discuss tuning these hadronisation models using Professor [1] to better reproduce data on strange hadron production relative to pions as a function of multiplicity, as measured by the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions [2].\r\nThe first model considered is the Rope Hadronisation model, based on the idea that in high-density string environments, increased string tension enhances strange hadron production [3]. This model has not previously been tuned with ALICE strangeness data. The second model is the more recent Close Packing model, which modifies string tension similarly but does not require space-time modelling of string breaking [4].\r\nResults using the Rope Hadronisation model reproduce strange mesons and multi-strange baryons as a function of multiplicity with $5-10\\%$ precision. This new tuning significantly improves the $\\Lambda/K^{0}_{S}$ and $\\Lambda/\\pi$ ratios, reducing previous discrepancies with ALICE data from $15-40\\%$ to more acceptable ranges. However, the $p/\\pi$ ratio remains inconsistent with the data despite tuning.\r\nA first complete tuning of the Close Packing model is also presented. This model reproduces nearly all particle ratios as a function of multiplicity within one standard deviation, with improved agreement for the $p/\\pi$ ratio compared to the Rope Hadronisation model, though some deviations persist.\r\nThese results demonstrate the ongoing challenges of accurately modelling both strange and non-strange light-flavour hadrons, highlighting limitations in current hadronisation models.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n[1] Andy Buckley, Hendrik Hoeth, Heiko Lacker, Holger Schulz, and Jan Eike von Seggern.

To get gauge independent analytic form factors valid through all Landau levels, we apply the hard thermal loop technique for the resummed effective gluon propagator. The derived effective hard thermal loop gluon propagator and the generalized version of Schwinger quark propagator subsequently allow us to analytically evaluate the longitudinal and transverse momentum diffusion coefficients for charm and bottom quarks beyond the static limit. Within the static limit we also explore another way of incorporating the effect of the magnetic field, i.e. through the magnetized medium modified Debye mass and compare the results to justify the need for structural changes.\r\n\r\nBased on : Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 3, 034013",

SMASH constitutes an effective solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and is suitable for the dynamical description of collisions at low beam energies. The SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid approach mainly combines SMASH, which is used to describe the non-equilibrium phases of a collision, with vHLLE, a software for the simulation of relativistic hydrodynamics. The latter is employed to describe the fluid phase of the hot and dense fireball. This approach is suitable for collisions at higher beam energies.

      "Abstract": "Understanding the properties of hypernuclei is crucial for constraining the nature of hyperon-nucleon ($Y\\text{-}N$) interactions, which plays a key role in determining the inner structure of compact stars. The lightest (anti-)hypernuclei are the hypertriton ($^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$), which consists  of a pair of nucleons and  a $\\Lambda$ hyperon, and its anti-nucleus (${^3_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}}\\overline{\\rm H}$).  Significant knowledge has recently been acquired regarding the mass, lifetime, and binding energy of $^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$. However, its exact spin, whether $\\frac{1}{2}$ or  $\\frac{3}{2}$, remains undetermined in both experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we present a novel method of using the hypertriton global polarization in heavy-ion collisions to decipher not only  its total spin but also its internal spin  structure.  This method is based on the finding that  its three different  spin structures  exhibit distinct beam energy dependence of its global polarization when it is produced in these collisions from the coalescence of proton, neutron and $\\Lambda$. Future observations of the (anti-)hypertriton global polarization thus provide the opportunity to unveil the spin structure of (anti-)hypertriton and its production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.",

The primary hadronization phase including the strangeness \r\nproduction is described with UrQMD model. It is demonstrated that the \r\nnucleation process can be explained within the statistical approach by \r\napplying the local equilibrium concept. We subdivide the expanding \r\nnuclear system into several parts (clusters) consisting of nucleons and \r\nhyperons which are close in the phase space. The production of nuclei \r\ntakes place inside these clusters, and it can be described as their \r\nstatistical decay in the coexistence region of the nuclear phase \r\ntransition. The local chemical equilibrium concept explain consistently \r\nmany experimental data which was not possible with the statistical \r\nmodels under assumption of global chemical equilibrium [1,2].

      "Abstract": "We contrast the behavior of ordinary and factorial cumulants of proton number and point out that the latter has numerous advantages over the former, in particular with regards to the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions. The new RHIC BES-II data on factorial cumulants of protons is analyzed, indicating clear deviation of two- and three-particle proton correlations from the non-critical baseline at collision energies below 10 GeV. Multiple scenarios for this deviation are explored, including the possibility of critical fluctuations and the implications for the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\nWe also illustrate that the acceptance dependence of the appropriately scaled factorial cumulants, $\\hat{C}_n/(\\hat{C}_1)^n$, is flat if all correlations are driven by long-range correlations only, making it a clean probe of short-range correlations. Furthermore, global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations predict identical $\\hat C_2/(\\hat C_1)^2$ of proton and antiprotons at given collision energy. However, the analysis of RHIC BES-I data reveals a remarkably strong splitting between scaled factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons, which is at odds with the expectation based on a single-fluid hydrodynamics picture. We argue that such a splitting indicates incomplete equilibration between stopped and produced matter, which can be further probed with upcoming high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II with extended acceptance coverage.",

      "Speaker": "Jamie Karthein",
      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition [1]. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.\r\n\r\n1. J.M. Karthein, V. Koch, C. Ratti, arXiv:2409.13961, PRD (under review)",

      "Abstract": "Introduction of a nonzero isospin chemical potential in QCD leads to the emergence of a pion condensed phase at sufficiently large $\\mu_I$, bounded by a second order transition line. At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\\mu_I = m_\\pi/2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition the pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\\mu_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.",

      "Abstract": "The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $\\mu_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. The phase diagram is drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. \r\nOur results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that up to $\\mu_B \\approx 400$~MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\\mu_B$.",

      "Abstract": "We study the influence of the QCD critical point on the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the lines of constant specific entropy (entropy per baryon) on the phase diagram are drawn towards a special point on the coexistence (first-order) line where the specific entropy reaches a maximum [1]. We study the interplay between this feature of the isentropic trajectories and the freezeout curve. If the critical point is located near the freezeout curve, a region inaccessible by isentropic expansion appears on the freezeout curve. This behavior of the isentropes could provide a novel, non-fluctuational signature of the critical point requiring significantly lower statistics than the fluctuational signatures. \r\n\r\n[1] Maneesha Sushama Pradeep, Noriyuki Sogabe, Mikhail Stephanov, and Ho-Ung Yee, Phys.

      "Abstract": "We use a novel real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG), as a valuable tool complementary to classical-statistical simulation, for dynamical systems with reversible mode couplings to study Model H, the conjectured dynamic universality class of the QCD critical point. We emphasize the structural similarities with Model G, conjectured to be the dynamic universality class of the chiral phase transition in the limit of two massless quark flavors. Importantly, our formulation of the real-time FRG preserves all relevant symmetries throughout the FRG flow which, e.g., guarantees the non-renormalization of the reversible mode couplings, as but one exact result. We derive non-perturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, Model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H. For Model G, we also extract a novel dynamic scaling function that describes the universal momentum and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of iso-vector and iso-axial charge densities in the symmetric phase.",

      "Abstract": "We develop a comprehensive analytic framework for jet quenching in QCD media, based on a medium-induced parton cascade sourced by collinear virtual splittings. We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, L. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\\ln(1/R)$, and $\\ln(R/\\theta_c)$, and powers of $L$. We briefly explore the limit of strong quenching, where analytic treatments are feasible, offering insights into the impact of parton cascades on jet quenching. These results provide guidance for future numerical simulations and analytical investigations.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal fluctuations are a fundamental feature of dissipative systems that are essential for understanding physics near the expected critical point of QCD and in small systems. Such fluctuations can be modeled by including a stochastic source in the standard hydrodynamics equations. However, when this is done naively strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions [1–3]. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem [4], we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional [5]. For divergence type theories [6], the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. This generating current is related to the free energy, which allows for a systematic understanding the stability properties of the system. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques [7].\r\n\r\n[1] N. Mullins, M.

The rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions.

This work shows that a system undergoing an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel attractor behavior that resembles a limit cycle in dynamical systems. This phenomenon can be studied in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, which opens the way to the experimental discovery of hydrodynamic attractor phenomenon.\r\n\r\nRefs.:\r\n1.

      "Abstract": "Diffractive vector meson production is a golden channel in the search for gluon saturation. The color glass condensate (CGC) framework has been successfully applied to describe diffractive vector meson production in $e+p$ collisions at HERA. Predictions for $\\gamma+Pb$ collisions realized in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC are however overestimating the experimental data at large center of mass energy, implying that the calculated saturation effects are not strong enough to describe the nuclear suppression. In this work we perform a combined Bayesian analysis of $J/\\psi$ production data from both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ collisions within the CGC framework based on an impact parameter dependent McLerran-Venugopalan model combined with JIMWLK evolution to describe the center of mass energy dependence. The combined fit confirms the challenges of the framework to describe both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ data simultaneously hinting at shortcomings of the framework. We discuss major sources of uncertainty and suggest possible solutions including model extensions. We further present predictions for intermediate systems such as $\\gamma+O$ collisions whose measurement in UPCs could provide further insight into the $A$ dependence of the $J/\\psi$ production cross section.",

Differential measurements of photon-induced $J/\\psi$ production provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations.   The linear polarization of photons involved in these processes enables imaging of the nucleus via spin interference effect in vector meson photoproduction, which  can be quantified by measuring the azimuthal angular modulation between the $J/\\psi$ momentum and its decay daughters' momenta.  Moreover,  the decay daughters of these vector mesons inherit polarization of the photons, which could be used to access the initial collision geometry.

In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which $E_{exc} \\neq E_{\\gamma}$ and compare its results with the results of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. We discuss the role of preequilibrium and equilibrium processes. In addition we analyze the role of scattering of high-energy photons for small neutron multiplicities. Emission of the small number of neutrons at high (virtual) photon energies ($E_{\\gamma} >$ 1 GeV) seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data.

This talk presents a measurement of jet production in UPCs performed with the ATLAS detector using high-statistics 2018 Pb+Pb data. Events are selected using requirements on jet production, rapidity gaps, and forward neutron emission to identify inclusive photo-nuclear hard-scattering processes. These measurements also include detailed studies of rapidity gap distributions and nuclear break-up effects, allowing for precise comparisons between data and theory for inclusive photo-nuclear processes. The measured cross-sections are compared to theoretical models in phase-space regions where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected but not well constrained by world data, demonstrating the potential of these data to provide a strong new constraint on nPDF effects.",

      "Abstract": "In an ultra-peripheral collision, where the impact parameter is larger than the sum of the nuclear radii, the nuclei mainly interact electromagnetically. These reactions are mediated by virtual photons. A photon can interact with a gluon in the target nucleus and produce a pair of charm quarks. These charm quarks then fragment and are observed as open charm hadrons ($\\rm D^{0}$, $\\rm D^{∗} (2010)^{\\pm}$ etc.) or vector mesons (J/ψ and ψ(2S)). This process has been used in e-p collisions to set stringent limits on the proton gluon distribution at low-$x$. The current measurements can provide similar constraints on the much less known nuclear gluon distributions. The cross sections and transverse momentum distributions for D mesons and J/ψ measured in ALICE will be presented. The results will be compared with model calculations.",

      "Abstract": "The event-by-event shapes of colliding nuclei are imprinted on flow patterns measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions because of the strong hydrodynamic response to collision geometry. In this work, we perform high-statistics simulations to study the impacts of nuclear structure on the ratios of anisotropic flow observables between different collision systems. We study $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and find the ratios of anisotropic flow in the same centrality class between the two collision systems to be strongly affected by the nuclear structure inputs in the initial state, providing a novel opportunity to probe the deformed nuclear geometry at very high energies [1]. The ratios of $v_2\\{4\\}/v_2\\{2\\}$ in these collisions are sensitive to the nuclear skin thickness of the colliding nuclei, providing indirect constraints on the nuclei’s neutron skin. We will also highlight the unique opportunities at the upcoming fixed-target SMOG2 experiments at the LHCb. With input from ab initio calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. Elliptic flow in Pb+Ne collisions is significantly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling pin geometry [2]. These studies open a new and emerging avenue for synergy between the nuclear structure and heavy-ion communities, advancing the precision era of relativistic nuclear collisions.\r\n \r\n[1] H.

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and Drell-Yan (DY) processes are primary channels for studying the parton distributions of the proton and the nucleus, and for deducing the properties of cold nuclear matter. However, for nuclear targets, the DY and SIDIS differential cross-sections are modified by multiple interactions between the active parton and spectator nucleons, which we refer to as dynamical nuclear effects. Only recently have theoretical developments allowed us to understand these processes in the nuclear environment from first principles. We present the complete calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) dynamical nuclear corrections to the longitudinal and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) cross-sections in both reactions using the Soft Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons. The main result that this talk focuses on is the first TMD analysis of the nuclear SIDIS and DY data that incorporates these dynamical effects.  We show for the first time medium-induced renormalization group (RG) equations improved to second order in opacity to estimate the truncation uncertainty and a rapidity RG (a Blaitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution) applied in the initial state for DY and the final state for SIDIS. We discuss the implications of the new theoretical analysis for the interpretation of existing data, and for the physics program of the future EIC.",

In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity correlations in nuclear collisions due to the inclusion of event-by-event subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state, by using the 3D resolved McDIPPER for the initial state of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], and for the first time, we connect it to 3D phenomenology by evolving through a full hybrid evolution, including a pre-equilibrium stage, using the novel KøMPøST with charges [3], 3+1D viscous hydrodynamical evolution [4], and hadronic rescattering [5]. We present new results, focusing on the effect of sub-nuclear hotspots and (sub) nuclear thickness fluctuations on the longitudinal structure of observables, such as the flow decorrelations and directed flow. We include phenomenological results for large systems (Pb-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV) as well as predictions for the upcoming O+O and Ne+Ne runs ($\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=6.8$ TeV) at the LHC.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] U.

      "Abstract": "The six-hour Xe-129 run at the LHC has produced a remarkable wealth of physics, among which several studies of its nuclear shape. Previous works indicate that the elliptic flow ratio with Pb-208 collisions determines the quadrupole deformation ($\\beta_2$) of Xe, while the $\\rho_2$ elliptic flow-mean $p_T$ correlator informs us about the so-called triaxiality ($\\gamma$). In this work, we go one step further and perform a global Bayesian analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb data at the LHC varying simultaneously the shapes of Xe, Pb and relevant Trajectum model parameters. This allows us to systematically assess the sensitivity of observables or ratio of observables to the shape of both Pb (in particular its neutron skin) and Xe (in particular $\\beta_2$, its octupole $\\beta_3$, $\\gamma$ and its skin). Our Bayesian extractions lead to a picture for the ground states of these nuclei that is in remarkable agreement with complementary results using methods in low-energy nuclear structure physics. We comment on implications of the analysis of the shapes of other nuclei via future LHC experiments, with particular focus on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The shape and orientation of colliding nuclei play a crucial role in determining the initial conditions of the QGP formed in central collisions, which influence key observables such as anisotropic and radial flow. For instance, central collisions of near-spherical Au nuclei create a QGP with a fixed, circular geometry, whereas prolate-shaped uranium nuclei can collide in a variety of orientations, producing QGP droplets of diverse shapes and sizes. Hence, by comparing systems with similar mass numbers, such as $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au, we can map out their shape differences and gain deeper insights into the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_2$, $p_T$ fluctuations, and\r\n$v_2 - p_T$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions. Our results reveal large differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in central events. A comparison with hydrodynamic model calculations indicates a large deformation in uranium nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry in the ground states of the colliding $^{238}$U nuclei [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales. The potential applications of this method for other nuclear species are explored.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, Nature 635, 67-72 (2024), https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08097-2",

      "Abstract": "Xenon (Xe) nuclei are deformed and have a non-zero quadrupole moment, whereas lead (Pb) nuclei are considered spherical in shape. The study of Xe-Xe collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.44$ TeV opens up a window to study nuclear deformation at LHC. When compared to Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$ TeV, one can explore the dependence of the Fourier flow harmonics ($v_{n}$) on the size and initial-state geometry of the colliding systems. For the first time, correlations between higher-order moments ($\\langle v_{n}^{k}v_{m}^{l}\\rangle$, where $n,m = 2,3,4$ and $k,l = 2,4,6$) between two ($v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ or $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$) or even three flow harmonics ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$) are measured and compared between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions as a function of collision centrality. These new measurements have been calculated with multiparticle mixed harmonic cumulants (upto 8th order) using charged particles in the wide pseudorapidity region of the CMS detector ($|\\mathrm{\\eta}| < 2.4$) and in the transverse momentum range of $0.5 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 3.0$ GeV/c. The results have also been compared to several theoretical model predictions. The observables measured in this analysis have been used to closely probe the non-linearities between $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ and their corresponding eccentricities $\\epsilon_{2}$, $\\epsilon_{3}$ and $\\epsilon_{4}$. This not only helps us to constrain the deformation parameters of Xe nuclei, but can also significantly constrain initial-state model parameters and give us a better understanding of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at LHC.",

In this talk, the first measurement of dijet average pseudorapidity measurements in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV in the widest dijet transverse momentum ranges will be presented with the data samples collected with CMS at the LHC.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We include the perturbative JIMWLK energy evolution into the IP-Glasma initial state description used to simulate the early-time dynamics in heavy ion collisions. By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. This enables us to predict how the initial state evolves when moving from RHIC to LHC energies. [1]\r\n\r\nPreviously, the energy dependence in IP-Glasma was introduced through a Bjorken-$x$ dependent saturation scale extracted from fits to DIS structure data. In contrast, in our work we move beyond this parametrized approximation by providing a method to directly calculate the energy dependence. The energy-dependent initial state description is then coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics in the quark-gluon plasma phase and to the UrQMD hadronic afterburner, enabling us to simulate the full space-time evolution in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate that incorporating the JIMWLK evolution significantly affects various flow observables.\r\n\r\nThe JIMWLK evolution applied in this work is constrained by the available $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ production data from HERA and from Ultra Peripheral Collisions at the LHC [2]. In addition to the JIMWLK-evolved initial state description, we determine an effective energy-dependent parametrization describing the energy-dependent nucleon structure, which can approximate the effect of JIMWLK evolution in IP-Glasma, enabling faster simulations.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] H.

      "Abstract": "It has recently been widely acknowledged that the initial stages are important for correctly describing jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, the initial stages influence the emission spectrum of hard partons traversing the plasma. Such calculations require the knowledge of the momentum-broadening kernel $C$, which describes the probability of a jet parton receiving a momentum kick. While it is often employed in a harmonic approximation using the jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, in this talk, I will present our results for the kernel $C$ from QCD kinetic theory beyond this approximation. We show that the kernel is consistent with previous extractions of $\\hat q$ and find that it is highly anisotropic at early times and that small-momentum exchange processes are more likely than expected from a Landau-matched thermal system. Our results may lead to a better description of jet quenching during the initial stages, which can be particularly significant for the ongoing and upcoming light-ion collision programs.",

      "Abstract": "The second-order shape phase transition of the Xe isotope chain, predicted to lie around $^{128}\\text{Xe}$ to $^{130}$Xe, is challenging to measure in low-energy nuclear experiments. Recently, heavy-ion collisions have demonstrated their potential as an imaging tool for nuclear structure by examining anisotropic flow and its correlations with the mean transverse momentum. Hints of a triaxial structure in $^{129}$Xe have been found experimentally and theoretically using these methods; however, these studies were limited to exploring the first moment of the $\\gamma$ distribution and could not distinguish between a rigid rotor and $\\gamma$-soft nuclei. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, a comprehensive study of the quadrupole deformation, nuclear diffuseness, and triaxial structure of $^{129}$Xe is presented through investigations of various anisotropic flow and mean transverse momentum observables. Additionally, the $\\gamma$-soft structure of the $^{129}$Xe nuclei is investigated experimentally for the first time in heavy-ion collisions using a novel six-particle normalized cumulant, $ NC(v_2^4, \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2) $, which correlates the fourth moment of the elliptic flow, $ v_2^4$, with the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, $ \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2 $. This correlation is measured in Xe–Xe collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV  against the baseline of spherical Pb nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Comparisons with calculations from state-of-the-art models, both with and without fluctuating shape parameters, provide a high-precision probe of the nuclear structure of $^{129}$Xe and facilitate the discovery of the nuclear shape phase transition.",

      "Abstract": "Short-range correlations among hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion experiments are typically regarded as non-hydrodynamic and subtracted from the data. However, the fluid nature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) gives rise to short-range correlations stemming from hydrodynamic fluctuations. These correlations, driven by fluctuation-dissipation relations near local equilibrium, provide key insights into the transport properties of the QGP and can become particularly significant in the vicinity of the QCD critical region.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a theoretical framework for calculating two-particle correlations of charged hadrons. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we first derive an evolution equation for four-point functions of fields in complex scalar field theory. This equation can be interpreted using the Boltzmann-Langevin Equation (BLE), which  predicts the two-particle correlations in momentum space amongst the charges of a conducting fluid.  Our results demonstrate how measuring these short-range charge correlations in heavy ion collisions can constrain the transport properties of the QGP in detail.",

Furthermore, due to the imbalance of protons and neutrons inside the colliding nuclei, initial isospin, which also affects the correlation functions, plays an important role in determining the Equation of State of the medium in collisions at high baryon density.  \r\n\r\nTo extract the effect of the isospin, a systematic analysis of the identical charged pion correlations from $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 4.5, 5.2, 7.7 GeV Au+Au collisions collected by the STAR experiment has been carried out.

In this talk, we will report collision energy dependence of the source size parameters extracted from the positive and negative charged pion correlation functions after removing the 3rd-body Coulomb effect.

Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios, the conclusion has been elusive. \r\n\r\nHere, we employ a recently developed formalism of density correlations to incorporate the effects of resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematical cuts to perform quantitative calculations of charge fluctuations in central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced. On the other hand, the QGP scenario predictions show small sensitivity to the range of local charge conservation and yield excellent agreement with experimental data. We present predictions for LHC Run 2 as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

      "Abstract": "The observation of long-range correlations is a crucial indicator of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions and has been instrumental in establishing the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at RHIC and LHC. In this study, the first direct measurement of radial flow is presented using a new observable, $ v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T}) $, formulated to capture the long-range correlations in the transverse momentum $ p_{\\rm T} $ spectrum. Unlike anisotropic flow coefficients $ v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T}) $, which are influenced by both shear and bulk viscosity, $v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T}) $ is sensitive solely to the bulk properties of the QGP medium, making it a valuable probe for studying bulk viscosity and the hydrodynamic evolution of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of $ v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T})$ is reported across various centrality classes for inclusive charged particles and identified particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector. To minimize short-range non-flow correlations, a rapidity gap technique similar to that used in anisotropic flow measurements is employed. At low $p_{\\rm T}$, characteristic mass ordering, typically associated with collective flow in $v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T})$, is observed. At higher $ p_{\\rm T} $, where hydrodynamic descriptions fail, a baryon-meson splitting indicative of quark coalescence is observed. Measurements are compared with the hydrodynamic model MUSIC under varied initial conditions, as well as non-hydrodynamic models like HIJING and EPOS.",

      "Abstract": "Event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[p_T]$ have been measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, but this topic has so far received less attention than anisotropic flow. Yet the physical mechanism is identical for both phenomena: A long-range correlation in the initial stages, followed by collective expansion. While the origin of anisotropic flow is a fluctuation in the shape of the fireball, that of $[p_T]$ fluctuations is a fluctuation in the initial temperature. It generates a fluctuation in the fluid velocity, which is carried over to the $p_T$ spectrum of outgoing particles. The same fluctuation is present at all rapidities and generates a long-range correlation. \r\n\r\nWe make hydrodynamic predictions for the fluctuation of the spectrum, which is a new observable $v_0(p_T)$ introduced by Schenke, Shen and Teaney [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00690] which has not yet been measured, and for which first experimental results will hopefully be shown at this conference. Like anisotropic flow $v_n(p_T)$, $v_0(p_T)$ is predicted to have a strong mass ordering in the $p_T$ range where hydrodymamics applies. We show that our hydrodynamic calculation reproduces precisely the observed dependence of $[p_T]$ fluctuations on $p_T$ cuts which has previously been observed by PHENIX and ATLAS. We argue that the mechanism of quark coalescence should give rise to a splitting between the $v_0(p_T)$ of baryons and mesons at higher $p_T$, similar to that observed for anisotropic flow.\r\n\r\nBased on Parida, Samanta, Ollitrault, Phys.Lett.B 857 (2024) 138985 [2407.17313].",

Data on this interaction are scarce, solely based on scattering experiments. Since data points are only available at rather high relative momenta and their uncertainties are sizeable, theory calculations are not well constrained. Particularly the characteristics of the interaction in the triplet channel spin configuration are highly uncertain, and it is not yet clear if the interaction in this channel is attractive or repulsive. In this regard, two-particle intensity interferometry (femtoscopy) of $\\Sigma$ baryons and nucleons can provide valuable information. \r\nThe reconstruction of the weak decay of $\\Sigma^+$ baryons is very challenging. Its decay into a proton and a neutral pion via the weak interaction has a branching ratio of around 50%, with the neutral pion decaying electromagnetically almost exclusively into two photons. In this talk, a novel reconstruction method will be shown which makes use of sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve the reconstruction efficiency and purity of the $\\Sigma^+$ baryons, enabling the measurement of their correlation function with protons for the first time.

This paradox raises an intriguing question: How can a medium that exhibits hydrodynamic-like behavior and substantially modifies the distribution of final-state hadrons have little to no effect on high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles? To explore this, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$) as a function of particle transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) and event multiplicity in pp and pPb collisions, recorded by CMS at 13 TeV and 8.16 TeV, respectively. In particular, first measurements of $p_\\mathrm{T}$-differential multiparticle cumulants using the subevent method are reported, probing an extended phase space region up to high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ values. Furthermore, we compare the results across pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions within similar multiplicity ranges.

Two-particle correlations in the “jet frame” show a surprising rise in elliptic flow harmonics, v2*, at large pseudorapidity separations (Δη* > 2), in jets with high charged-particle multiplicities, a trend not reproduced by event generators like Pythia and Sherpa. In this talk, we present the transverse momentum and ∆η* dependence of elliptic and triangular flow, across a wide range of jet multiplicity and transverse momentum. We further explore the role of jet substructure in driving the observed long-range azimuthal correlations, examining its potential connection to the geometry of the initial-state jet system. Recent LHC studies also show signs of collectivity in high-multiplicity photonuclear collisions, where a quasi-real photon from one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus. In this talk, we also present new CMS measurements of two- and multi-particle correlations from photonuclear collisions using PbPb data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3. By leveraging the full detector acceptance, we explore wide pseudorapidity gaps up to 7–8 units, which significantly reduces non-collective contributions and enhances the search for long-range near-side ridge effects.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (i.e. charm and beauty) are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Although they are initially produced out of kinetic equilibrium via hard partonic scattering processes, recent measurements of the anisotropic flow of charmed hadrons pose the question regarding the possible thermalization of heavy quarks in the medium. By exploiting a mapping between transport theory and hydrodynamics [1], we developed a fluid-dynamic description of heavy-quark diffusion in the QCD plasma. We will present results for transverse momentum distributions and integrated yields of charm and beauty hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic code coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current in the QGP. We will show that our calculations are in agreement with the experimental measurements in Pb-Pb collisions [2,3] and provide new predictions for Ne-Ne and O-O collisions.\r\nThis work is funded via the DFG ISOQUANT Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1225).\r\n[1] Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 3, 034021\r\n[2] Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 11, 116011\r\n[3] Capellino, Dubla, Facen, Floerchinger, Grossi, Kirchner, Masciocchi, in preparation",

      "Country": "Russia",
      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow characterizes the shape and direction of expansion of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. The Fourier coefficients in the expansion of particle azimuthal distribution describe the collective response of the medium to the shape of the initial collision geometry, \r\nand are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS). A non-monotonic slope in the first-order flow coefficient $v_1$ (directed flow) is proposed as a potential signature of a first-order phase transition between the QGP and hadronic phase. The second-order coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow) exhibits NCQ scaling at top RHIC and LHC energies, reflecting partonic collectivity, but this scaling vanishes at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV. The third-order coefficient $v_3$ (triangular flow) is typically driven by initial-state fluctuations and is uncorrelated with the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies reveal a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\\Psi_{1}$), attributed to collision geometry and the potential in the responsive medium.\\\\\r\n\\indent In this talk, we will report the measurements of $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3\\{\\Psi_{1}\\}$ for light, strange, multi-strange, net-particles, and light nuclei in Au+Au collisions. These measurements span energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.2 -- 4.5 GeV in fixed-target mode, as well as 7.7 -- 19.6 GeV in collider mode, from the second phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR. We will present the precise measurements of $v_2$ for $\\phi$ mesons and multi-strange hadrons, along with the energy dependence of NCQ scaling. The presented results aim to shed light on the onset of partonic interactions. Additionally, atomic mass number (A) scaled $v_1$ slope of light nuclei will be presented to understand their production mechanism. The experimental measurements will be compared with transport model calculations to explore the underlying physics mechanisms in the high baryon density region of the QCD phase diagram.",

We present two- and four-particle cumulants of $v_2$ and $v_3$ based on new d+Au and O+O datasets collected in the year 2021 with extended forward and midrapidity acceptance of STAR. Notably, we observe a significant enhancement in both $v_2\\{2\\}$ and $v_2\\{4\\}$ in d+Au collisions compared to O+O collisions, in the highest-multiplicity events, suggesting markedly different ellipticities in these two systems. Comparisons with model calculations reveal a clear influence of sub-nucleon fluctuations and nuclear structure effects. The $v_n$ measurements are performed using two-particle correlations in rapidity ranges $|\\eta|<1.5$ and $2.1<|\\eta|<5.1$. The role of flow decorrelations with rapidity is investigated and the findings are compared to previous RHIC measurements and model predictions.

      "Abstract": "The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor, as well initial conserved charge densities. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations\r\n of large and small systems. \r\n With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.\r\n\r\nIn very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken.  Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.\r\n\r\nBased on:  arXiv:2405.13600 and work in progress",

      "Abstract": "The observation of collective-like behaviors in pp and p–Pb collisions at LHC energies has sparked debate about the similarities between the dynamics of small systems and heavy-ion collisions. In this talk, our latest published results are presented, showing baryon-meson $v_{\\rm 2}$ grouping (within 1$\\sigma$) and significant splitting (approximately  5$\\sigma$) at intermediate  $p_{\\rm T}$ in high-multiplicity p–Pb and pp collisions, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. The Hydro-Coal-Frag model, which incorporates partonic flow and quark coalescence, best describes the data, while alternative models fail to reproduce the pattern, providing strong evidence of a collectively flowing partonic medium in high-multiplicity pp and p–Pb collisions. The key question of how far down in system size the dynamics of small systems and heavy-ion physics remain similar is also investigated. The observed baryon-meson  $v_{\\rm 2}$ grouping and splitting, down to lower multiplicities $N_{\\rm{ch}} > 25 $, suggest that partonic collectivity may persist even in smaller systems. Additionally, our newly published results on ultra-long-range two-particle correlations, $|\\Delta \\eta| >$ 5.0(6.5), extending down to or below minimum bias multiplicity in pp and p–Pb collisions, explore the limits of collective medium formation in small systems.\r\n\r\nThe unique sensitivities of flow vector fluctuations to initial geometry and event-by-event fluctuations offer new insights into the initial conditions of both heavy-ion and small collision systems. Newly published results on two-particle correlation observables are presented, revealing $p_{\\rm T}$- and $ \\eta$-dependent flow vector fluctuations in p–Pb collisions at the LHC, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. These measurements, together with comparisons to state-of-the-art theoretical model calculations, allow us to constrain the initial conditions with unprecedented detail in both transverse and longitudinal directions, advancing our understanding of the origin of anisotropic flow phenomena observed in small collision systems at the LHC.",

Recent studies show that measuring collective anisotropic flow and the complex interplay between its Fourier harmonics ($v_n$) and $(\\Psi_n$) can effectively disentangle contributions from various collision phases, providing insights into QGP transport properties and the initial state of the system.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the latest flow measurements from ALICE for Pb–Pb collisions at the highest center-of-mass collision energy, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, ever achieved in a laboratory are presented. This includes the flow coefficient $v_n$, and mixed harmonic cumulants. Added to this are the first measurements of multiharmonic correlations using symmetric cumulants for hexagonal flow harmonics and new symmetry plane correlators, totaling 25 correlators—16 of which are newly introduced with enhanced estimators. Differential results for selected observables are also provided as a function of kinematic variables, alongside standard centrality dependence. In particular, $p_{\\rm T}$-differential flow is further extended to extremely high-$p_{\\rm T}$ regions, providing new inputs for hard processes. These results are compared with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations, offering unique insights for future model developments and further constraining the properties of QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions.

Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production has a special role to shed light on the collective behavior of particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the magnitude of the $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ elliptic flow measured at the LHC in Pb-Pb collisions is interpreted as a signature of the charm-quark thermalization in the QGP, supporting the scenario of charmonium (re)generation at low $p_{\\rm T}$.

      "Abstract": "This talk presents recent ATLAS measurements investigating correlations between the 'ridge' - azimuthal correlations between particles in the underlying event that extend over all rapidities - and hard scattering processes in $pp$ and $p$+Pb collisions. To study this soft-hard correlation, measurements of two-particle correlations in with two different particle-pair selections are studied. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. In the second, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. In $pp$ collisions, excluding jet-associated particles does not affect the ridge, and no significant azimuthal correlations are found between jet-associated particles and the underlying event, ruling out hard-process contributions to the $pp$ ridge. New measurements extending this analysis to $p$+Pb collisions are also presented. Prior $p$+Pb flow measurements have indicated a small but significant high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ up to a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of 50 GeV. This is in contrast to suppression measurements which indicate no clear suppression of high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons.

We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio %\\eta/s% in the early stages of the collision.",

Precise photon and dilepton measurements serve as unique tomographic probes for the properties of hot nuclear matter. In this work, we study the electromagnetic radiation from relativistic heavy-ion collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamical evolution of the QCD medium is calibrated with hadronic data in the RHIC Beam energy scan program based on a recent (3+1)D Bayesian analysis [1, 2]. We convolute the full model posterior distribution from the Bayesian analysis to make robust predictions for the electromagnetic observables with the propagated theoretical uncertainties. We will show how photon and dilepton observables, especially their rapidity dependence, can impose complementary constraints on the QGP dynamics and help to deduce its transport properties at finite baryon densities. \r\n\r\n[1] C.

      "Abstract": "Thermal dielectrons, which are produced throughout the entire evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and are not involved in strong interactions, are suggested as the ideal probes of the hot and dense medium. By measuring the mass spectra of thermal dielectrons, one can extract the average temperature of the medium in different stages.Since the thermal dielectron emission rate is proportional to the medium’s electromagnetic spectral function, the integrated yields offer valuable insights into the microscopic interaction mechanism between the electromagnetic current and the medium. Additionally, the azimuthal angle distribution of the single decayed electrons in the dielectron rest frame provides means to explore the polarization of thermal dielectrons.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will report on STAR measurements of thermal dielectrons produced in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies ($\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 7.7 - 19.6 GeV), as well as in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 200 GeV.

      "Speaker": "Jose Francisco Gonzalez",
      "Institute": "University of California Davis (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We present a selection of recent measurements of electromagnetic probes conducted by CMS to probe initial-state aspects of the heavy ion collision. The Z boson has a very short lifetime and can decay to dimuon final states that can be precisely measured. These properties make it a valuable tool for studying the initial state of heavy ion collisions. It has been proposed that the momentum of muons resulting from a Z decay, and therefore the experimentally observed mass and width of the Z boson, may be modified by the presence of the immense initial-state electromagnetic fields that are thought to be created in heavy ion collisions. Using the CMS experiment, we report the first search for a modification of the observed Z boson mass and width in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV relative to those observed in pp collisions. In addition, measurements of Z boson yields and azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, will be discussed. The centrality and rapidity dependence of the measurements are compared to theoretical models. Taken together, these measurements provide new insights into the role of initial electromagnetic fields, nuclear parton distribution functions, and initial-state geometry in heavy ion collisions. The production of top quarks in heavy ion collisions serves as a novel tool for investigating nuclear parton distribution functions at high Bjorken-x. Although being a quark, the top has a short lifetime, decaying predominantly to a W boson and b quark pair, before hadronizing. Leptonic final states from the subsequent W boson decay are thus effectively electroweak probes of the medium they traverse before reaching the detector. The CMS collaboration has reported evidence of top quark pair ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) production using data from lead-lead (PbPb) collisions during Run 2. This talk will present the first measurement of $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ production utilizing $1.63~\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ of PbPb data collected by CMS at 5.36 TeV in 2023 and derived using kinematic variables from leptons and jets.",

The measurement of direct photons in minimum-bias pp collisions serves as a crucial baseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions, whereas pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities allow the search for interesting phenomena such as the possible presence of QGP in small systems.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present the final LHC Run 2 ALICE results on the direct-photon production in pp and Pb--Pb collisions. In central Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, results from virtual and real direct photons, as well as direct photon Bose-Einstein correlations are shown, enabling a precise direct photon spectrum over a broad range of transverse momentum. To study the possible onset of the formation of a hot medium, we also report the results on the direct-photon production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV as a function of charged-particle multiplicity.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Transport coefficients play an important role in characterizing hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). The electric conductivity can be accessed via the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function's low-energy transport peak, which can be measured via thermal dilepton emission. Several facilities including the Schwer-Ionen Synchrotron (SIS), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have potential to probe low energy dilepton signals in ongoing and future experiments.\r\nIn this contribution, we present our recently published study on the electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter. We implement the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\\rho$ meson. Therefore, hadronic many-body theory is utilized to calculate the $\\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\\pi$-$\\rho$, $\\pi$-$\\sigma$, $\\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\\Delta$-hole loops. Vertex corrections are then introduced to maintain gauge invariance. In particular, we examine the transport peak and electric conductivity along a proposed phase transition line, and under conditions comparable to those expected in future heavy-ion experiments. We compare the transport properties for hadronic matter and a pion gas, in order to examine the individual contributions of various particles to the electric conductivity. In addition, we calculate the transport peak along a proposed phase transition line, and find that the electric conductivity shows a decreasing tendency from high to low collision energies.",

In this range of energies, covered by the STAR Beam Energy Scan program and the future CBM experiment at FAIR, it is unclear how to best decribe the medium evolution. At which beam energy is hydrodynamics *necessary*? How should it be initialized? The electromagnetic radiation in a HIC is heavily dependent on the cumulative emission throughout the expansion, so these questions can be resolved by comparing dilepton observables in different model calculations. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a dynamic approach to fluidizing hadrons in state-of-the-art evolutions of intermediate beam energy HICs, based on the local energy density. This provides a natural core-corona separation, in contrast to commonly employed initalizations based on a constant proper time. In the presence of a first-order phase transition, the dilepton yield is greatly enhanced, which can be seen in the dilepton  excitation function. Moreover, we highlight the need for event-by-event initial conditions compared to smooth averaged profiles, since hotspots account for a significant part of the dilepton spectra.",

      "Abstract": "Despite decades of theoretical and experimental achievements, a coherent picture of the evolution in colliding heavy ion systems is still missing, particularly in the non-perturbative regime.  Since photons are penetrating probes, the combined information of direct photon yields at low transverse momenta ($p_T$) and their azimuthally asymmetric emission (flow) provides important constraints on theories.  Simultaneous observation of high yields and significant (almost hadron-like) flow of low $p_T$ direct photons in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX, dubbed the \"direct photon puzzle\" still eludes a coherent explanation.  A closely related issue is the apparent universality of photon production, that depends only on charged particle multiplicity, but not on the size of the colliding ions, except for the most asymmetric systems.  In this talk, we will present new results on direct photon flow in Au+Au and yields in Au+Au, Cu+Au and $^3$He+Au at low $p_T$.

      "Abstract": "One of the most striking modifications induced by the QGP on a QCD parton shower is the breaking of angular-ordering. This was established in a series of pioneering papers almost 15 years ago by studying the radiation pattern off a QCD antenna in the presence of a medium [1,2]. These effects were captured by a single critical angle solely depending on the medium properties. Constraining the values of $\\theta_c$, and more generally the physics of colour decoherence, is one of the targets of the heavy-ion experimental program at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate that the notion of a critical angle that exclusively depends on the medium properties no longer holds after accounting for medium effects during the formation of the antenna. This generalisation of the results of Refs. [1,2] shows that each splitting in an in-medium parton shower experiences colour decoherence in a different fashion. In addition, the total rate of emissions is enhanced with respect to previous calculations. This result has important implications for the experimental quest of determining medium modifications to parton evolution, as well as in the formulation of in-medium parton showers.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

      "Abstract": "The first measurement of low transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) charged hadron pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions relative to $Z$ bosons in PbPb collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is presented. This study utilizes PbPb collision data recorded in 2018 with an integrated luminosity of $1.67 \\pm 0.03$ nb$^{-1}$, as well as pp collision data acquired in 2017 with an integrated luminosity of $301 \\pm 6$ pb$^{-1}$. For the first time in PbPb collisions, the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons relative to $Z$ bosons are measured in bins of charged hadron $p_\\mathrm{T}$ to search for in-medium parton shower modifications and medium recoil effects. The analysis focuses on events containing at least one $Z$ boson with $40 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 350$ GeV. A significant modification in the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions for charged hadrons in the low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range, around 1 to 2 GeV, is observed compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The results are consistent with expectations from phenomenological models, including medium recoil and the medium response to hard probes traversing the quark-gluon plasma. The data provide significant new information about the correlation between hard and soft particles in heavy ion collisions, which can be used to test predictions of various jet quenching models. In PbPb data comparisons with pp reference and theoretical models, the first evidence for medium recoil and hole effects caused by a hard probe is found.",

      "Abstract": "The production of a Z boson provides a clean handle to control the population of events to be studied. By selecting muonic decays of Z bosons, we can isolate the effect of the recoiling process without potential bias from requiring isolation, as is the case for photons. Di-hadron correlations can naturally separate effects from different angular scales and enable jet substructure measurements without jet reconstruction bias. Similar to the energy-energy correlator (EE) in jets where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes are separated, by studying analogous correlation in the full event, one can unravel potential larger-scale structures that may arise from the interaction of high-energy recoiling particles with the quark-gluon plasma. This talk will present the first measurement of the energy-weighted di-hadron correlation with the CMS collaboration using events tagged with a Z boson. A significant modification of EEC is observed not only in small to intermediate angular scale but also extended to the phase space that is far away from the typical range covered by jet based EEC. The result provides new insight into the jet quenching mechanism and information about the inner workings of the QGP.",

In contrast to this, in a dense coloured medium interactions with the background change the parton's colour and disrupt colour coherence. The phase space for the next emission is then not constrained by angular ordering leading to potentially measurable differences in the distribution of fragments. The effect is not due only to a broader angular distribution of partons, because angular ordering also affects the energy sharing. In this talk I will present the improved treatment of angular ordering in the upcoming release of JEWEL and discuss the effect of loss of angular ordering on different intra-jet observables. I will also quantify related theoretical uncertainties.",

This enhancement is attributed to strong hydrodynamic flow and parton recombination in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). \r\nJet probes have been used extensively to gain insights into QGP properties, with substantial modifications to jet yields and internal structures seen across multiple measurements. Despite apparent medium-induced changes to jet fragmentation patterns, modification of in-jet hadro-chemistry has not yet been found.

      "Abstract": "Jet quenching — modifications to the energy and substructure of high-energy parton showers in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) — serves as a key experimental tool to probe properties of QGP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. On one hand, the quenching effect, often quantified through the nuclear modification factor (e.g., $R_{AA}$), is well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, it is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the observation of collectivity in these collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon. And O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurements of the following three observables related to the jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$), inclusive jet $R_{cp}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{cp}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding. These measurements provide a valuable opportunity to explore possible jet quenching effects in O+O collisions. The $p_{T}$ and centrality differential results will be presented and compared to similar measurements in collision systems of various sizes. Such comparisons will also help disentangle the effects of system size and collision geometry.",

      "Abstract": "Jet substructure provides precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offers more differential ways to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of single hadrons. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as to the mass of partons through the dead-cone effect.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present three key charm-tagged jet measurements, using jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson. The first are measurements of the differences between three different axis definitions inside the jets. These different definitions vary in their sensitivity to wide-angle soft radiation and systematically probe the radiation pattern off of charm quarks. Next are the jet angularities, which characterise the weighted angular distribution of the jet constituents. These powerful observables probe the parton shower, with sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects that can be tuned by adjusting the importance of wide-angle radiation. Finally, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator for $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson tagged jets. This observable is defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs within jets and reveals the detailed structure of QCD radiation from heavy quarks, allowing for a distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative effects in charm showers. Comparisons of all these results to measurements of dominantly gluon-initiated jets, as well as to various event generators, are sensitive to flavor-dependent effects in both the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms. Moreover, comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations emphasize the need for improved theoretical modelling of heavy-quark jets and provide critical insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.",

      "Abstract": "The flavour dependence of parton showers presents a unique opportunity to explore fundamental properties of QCD interactions. In particular, the substructure of low-energy jets containing heavy-flavour hadrons provides experimental access to both mass effects as well as the impact of Casimir colour factors. Using novel tracing methods, splittings of charm quarks are isolated to measure fundamental properties such as the dead-cone effect and the charm-quark splitting function. By using the new high statistics data samples of Run 3, we present new measurements of the dead-cone effect and splitting function of charm quarks, differentially in the energy of the emitter, through measurements of jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. At the low energies uniquely accessible to the ALICE experiment, comparisons of these measurements to an inclusive-jet baseline probe the evolution of the dead-cone of charm quarks with unprecedented accuracy. With increasing energy of the emitting charm quark, the dead-cone angle is predicted to get smaller, allowing for the isolation of the impact of Casimir colour factors. Such differential measurements in the charm sector not only illuminate the role of mass and Casimir colour factors when compared to inclusive jets, but also provide a lower mass heavy quark-enriched sample which is crucial for comparisons to measurements in the beauty sector, in order to isolate the mass dependence of the dead-cone effect.",

It can be characterized by a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by γ-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The diffusion wake valley is found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the γ-jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to the equation of state and shear viscosity is also studied.",

The experiment includes large-acceptance, hermetic electromagnetic (EMCal) and hadronic (HCal) calorimeter systems, along with a very high-rate data acquisition plus trigger system. In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-p$_T$ jet trigger. This dataset represents a major increase in the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous measurements for this collision energy, along with the first HCal at mid-rapidity at RHIC. This talk presents a measurement of dijet p$_T$ asymmetries and azimuthal acoplanarities, over a wide range of leading jet p$_T$, performed with the full sPHENIX calorimeter system. These measurements provide the pQCD baseline for measurements of dijet p$_T$ asymmetries and angular decorrelation in future sPHENIX Au+Au data-taking at RHIC. The tighter initial kinematic correlations at RHIC compared to the LHC are expected to greatly increase the sensitivity to physics effects.",

Although theoretically predicted, clear experimental evidence of the diffusion wake remains elusive. This talk presents jet-track correlations in photon-jet and di-jet events measured in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector to search for diffusion wake signals. While photon-jet events do not show a significant signal within current uncertainties, upper limits on the probability are provided, and the results are consistent with CoLBT theory predictions at the 68% confidence level. New measurements from di-jet events are also presented, offering higher statistical precision, though complicated by potential contamination from the convolution of wakes of the jet pair.",

      "Abstract": "High-energy partons are known to lose energy when passing through the hot and dense medium produced in heavy ion collisions. This energy loss is expected to depend on the mass and flavor of the fragmenting parton. For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy quarks, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. Comparisons between the suppression observed in the inclusive sample of jets with the suppression of b-tagged jets and jets produced at forward rapidity (quark enhances sample of jets) are needed to understand the impact of parton mass and parton flavor on energy loss. Tagging of the $b$-jets is achieved using neural networks trained on Monte Carlo simulation samples and validated in a data-driven way with an independent approach involving the detection of muons from semileptonic decays of B-hadrons. A detailed quantification of the differences between the $b$-jet $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ and the inclusive jet $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ is also provided, together with comparisons to theory.

N-point Energy Correlators, defined as energy-weighted N-particle correlations inside jets, have emerged as a novel substructure observable in proton-proton collisions, where they show a clear separation of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. Recent measurements in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions show striking modifications of the Energy-Energy Correlators (EECs) compared to vacuum QCD baselines.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present a measurement of the EECs in Pb-Pb collisions, presenting results at low jet transverse momentum for the first time. Such a measurement is essential in mapping jet modification across different kinematic regimes in the QGP. In addition we present the first measurements of the 3-point Energy Correlator in Pb-Pb collisions, along with their ratios to the EECs.

The two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC), defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs inside jets, is a novel jet substructure observable probing the correlation of energy flow within jets. In pp collisions, the angular dependence of the EEC cross section shows a distinct separation of the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes, revealing the partonic dynamics of jet formation and the confinement of partons into hadrons. There have been an increasing number of theoretical studies predicting how the presence of a medium modifies the EECs with respect to the vacuum case. In this talk, we present measurements of the EECs for inclusive jets in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. By comparing our results to a measured pp baseline, we study the modifications of jet evolution caused by interactions with a cold nuclear medium and the presence of a high multiplicity environment. Understanding modifications due to cold nuclear matter effects is vital in interpreting EEC results in Pb$-$Pb collisions and separating hot and cold nuclear effects.",

In this talk, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state and compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, that appear as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ experimented by a jet at approximately mid-rapidity. We then pay special attention to the anisotropies in the momentum broadening between the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the collision axis. In opposition to the classical jet analyses, we find that, as the momentum modes of the boost-invariant Glasma are distributed mainly along the transverse direction, the momentum broadening is larger in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction.",

      "Speaker": "Arjun Srinivasan Kudinoor",
      "Institute": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, jets formed from hard-scattered partons experience an overall energy loss and have a modified internal structure compared to vacuum jets. These modifications are a result of the interactions between the energetic partons in a jet shower and the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). As the jet traverses the QGP, it loses momentum to the medium, which in turn responds to the presence of the jet. This “medium response” modifies the momentum distribution of the (soft) hadrons produced when the QGP freezes out. Since these hadrons carry the momentum lost by the parton shower, they and the modified shower both contribute to the energy flow in jets. The quantitative description of the medium response is an open question under active investigation. Recently, the projected N-point energy correlators (ENCs) have seen a resurgence of interest to probe vacuum QCD. For the first time [1], we will present a computation of the full three point energy-energy-energy correlation function in heavy-ion collisions and demonstrate its use for studying the shape of the energy flow originating from medium response. For this study, we utilize the Hybrid Model that implements a hydrodynamical medium response via the wake. We will show that measuring three-point correlation functions offer a promising experimental avenue for imaging the wake of the jet as when the three angles are well-separated the three-point correlator is dominated by the medium response.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] arXiv:2407.13818v2",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A subset of heavy-ion collisions are ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), where the ions collide with a large impact parameter, causing them to interact primarily through their intense electromagnetic fields. These interactions allow for the study of various photon-induced processes at high energies. The products of exclusive UPC interactions are typically characterized by very low transverse momenta products, which present several challenges to efficiently select with a trigger. In Run 3, the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) FastOR trigger provided a novel tool to trigger on these processes at Level 1. The TRT trigger was, for the first time, adapted for use in heavy-ion collisions, allowing it to trigger on low-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles ($p_\\mathrm{T} > 200$ MeV), including muons from coherent J/Psi decays. Another feature of many UPC collisions is single-sided nuclear breakup or multiple photon exchange, which causes one or both of the colliding ions to emit forward neutrons.  \r\nThe Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detects these neutrons and provides a fully digital trigger. This tool allows for triggering on many distinct neutron topologies within the Level 1 system. In Run 4, the new joint ATLAS-CMS HL-ZDC will be installed, providing similar triggering capabilities in the more challenging environment of the HL-LHC. The combination of the ZDC and TRT along with other calorimeter systems allows for the efficient collection of data for many distinct UPC processes.",

      "Abstract": "Ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions have revealed the existence of a hot, dense medium exhibiting collective flow with minimal viscous dissipation, indicative of a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. The CMS Collaboration previously measured the speed of sound in this medium, determining a value of approximately 0.241 at an effective temperature of 219 MeV in ultracentral 5.02 TeV PbPb collisions at the LHC, in excellent agreement with lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predictions for a deconfined QCD matter. In this talk, we present new results from measurements using 5.36 TeV PbPb data collected during LHC Run 3 (2023) and 8.16 TeV pPb data from Run 2. The new larger data samples significantly improve precision, enabling more detailed differential studies. We explore the temperature dependence of the speed of sound by analyzing data at different collision energies and the mean transverse momentum at various rapidities. Additionally, the impact of different centrality estimators on the extraction of the speed of sound is examined in detail. These new results provide critical insights into the thermal properties of the quark-gluon plasma and offer stringent tests of lattice QCD predictions.",

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "A key question about the QCD phase diagram is whether there is a critical point somewhere on the boundary between the hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma phases, and if so where. Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The unknown Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD. We use maximum entropy freeze-out of fluctuations to make estimates for the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoSs with a 3D Ising-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the location and strength of the critical point. We quantify the effect of the non-universal mapping parameters, the distance between the critical point and the freeze-out curve, and the contribution of decay protons on the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Fluctuations of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions are expected to be sensitive to a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD matter [1, 2]. Such a critical point is increasingly predicted to be located in the high baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) region around $\\mu_B$ = 500 - 650 MeV [3–8]. In 2018, the STAR Experiment started collecting data in a fixed-target configuration in order to map the high baryon chemical potential region of the phase diagram ($\\mu_B$ = 420 - 720 MeV). Critical fluctuations may be observed by measuring various orders of cumulants, $C_n$, of the distributions of baryon number. The collision-energy dependence of net-proton $C_4$/$C_2$ from STAR’s measurements in Beam Energy Scan I hinted at a possible non-monotonic deviation from the non-critical baseline in Au+Au collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 19.6 GeV, and the first published result from the fixed-target program, in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV is consistent with the non-critical baseline [9–13]. We report here new results on proton-number high-order cumulants from STAR’s Fixed-Target Program. Implications for the QCD phase diagram and critical-point search will be discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] M. A.

      "Abstract": "Non-monotonic behavior in the RHIC net proton number fluctuation data could signal the presence of a QCD critical point if they probe thermal conditions at the time of freeze-out. However, the connection between higher-order baryon number cumulants calculated in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics and higher-order net proton number cumulants may not be straightforward. Moreover, correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number have been suggested as sensitive probes for detecting changes in the degrees of freedom that carry strangeness at low temperatures (hadrons) and high temperatures (quarks) [1]. A non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model can explain baryon-strangeness correlations calculated in QCD at low temperatures and small chemical potentials, especially when additional strange hadrons are included (QMHRG2020).\r\nIn this presentation, we will show the ratio of first-order to second-order baryon number fluctuations and compare them with the RHIC BES-II results for proton number fluctuations. We will argue that a simple non-interacting HRG model cannot explain the RHIC BES-II results at higher densities, particularly at lower beam energies. Additionally, we will compare higher-order baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD results and argue that these results rule out the possibility of a QCD critical point in the BES-II collider mode. We will also discuss the potential influence of corrections arising from global charge conservation in heavy-ion collisions [2]. Finally, we will compare our results on correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number at finite chemical potential [3] with preliminary results from RHIC BES-II.\r\n[1] V.

As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \\pm 6.9$ MeV and $\\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \\pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively, at expansion order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^2)$ [1].

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD is expected to be of second order if the breaking of axial anomaly remains sufficiently strong at the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ [1]. This is supported by lattice QCD calculations [2]. However, FRG model calculations suggest that the scaling window, in which universal scaling relations hold, may be small [3]. Furthermore, whether or not the $U_A(1)$ symmetry gets effectively restored at $T_c$ remains to be controversial. This suggest that a more detailed analysis of universal critical behavior close to $T_c$ , as well as a direct determination of the relevant universality class for the chiral phase transition [1,4] in (2+1)-flavor QCD are needed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present new results from a study of the scaling behavior\r\nof an improved order parameter $M = M_\\ell - H \\chi_\\ell$ for chiral symmetry restoration in the light 2-flavor sector of (2+1)-flavor QCD. Here $M_\\ell$ and $\\chi_\\ell$ are multiplicatively renormalized light quark chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, respectively. Furthermore, $H = m_l/m_s$ is the light-to-strange quark mass ratio.\r\n\r\nWe construct ratios of $M$ for two different values of the light quark mass, $m_l$ (or $H$ equivalently), and $T$ close to $T_c$ . In the scaling region we find a unique intersection point for these ratios at $T=T_c$, which allows us to determine $T_c$ and the underlying universality class of the chiral phase transition, from the knowledge of critical exponent $\\delta$.\r\n\r\nThe approach followed here will allow to further constrain the influence of axial anomaly on universal critical behavior in (2+1)-flavor QCD. It also provides a new way of determining the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ , which strengthens the upper bound on the temperature range within which a critical end point in QCD for non-vanishing values of  chemical potential can possibly be found in heavy ion experiments.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

However, starting with the fourth-order cumulants, the LQCD results are significantly lower than the corresponding HRG results. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally verify the full QCD partition function by measuring the fourth-order cumulants of the net-proton number distributions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, ALICE data for net-proton number cumulants up to sixth order in proton-proton collisions at top LHC energy are presented to search for effects of a possible chiral phase transition in this small system.

      "Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions create a hot, dense state of QCD matter called Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP). In ultra-central collisions, the QGP volume saturates and remains constant; instead, entropy fluctuations cause temperature variations in the system. This property can be probed by measuring the correlation between the average transverse momentum (⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩) and the multiplicity of charged hadrons. This contribution shows the latest ALICE measurements\r\nof charged-hadron ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ and its higher-order cumulants in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions. Results are in close agreement with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, by fitting the relative increase of ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ to the relative change in the average charged-particle density at midrapidity, it is possible to extract the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the QGP, which indicates how fast compression waves propagate through the QGP medium. The extracted cs shows a strong dependence on the choice of the centrality estimators used to select ultra-central collisions, highlighting the sensitivity of this measurement to experimental biases. This observation suggests a need for careful reassessment of methods for determining cs from heavy-ion data. The measurements are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art models in ultra-central events.",

This phase transition is expected to proceed via spinodal decomposition as the system explores the metastable and unstable areas of the equation of state. To conclusively claim the discovery of the first-order phase transition curve, it is crucial to include spinodal effects in phenomenological simulations of these collisions and identify their experimental signatures. For the first time, we present a covariant formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics including spinodal decomposition [1]. These equations account for surface effects between the two phases and can be used in hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions.

Recent datasets collected by STAR in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3 and 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan II program and in different collision systems at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV (d+Au, Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru) provide us a chance to look into the $\\Omega$/$\\phi$ ratios and possibly locate the threshold of QGP production.\r\nIn addition, (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity in different collision systems at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV can be compared with the results from LHC, where an intriguingly smooth increase in these ratios was first reported.\r\nFurthermore, rapidity density of (anti-)strange baryons may give insight into the baryon stopping mechanism.\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will present new measurements of strange hadron ($K_s^0$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi$, $\\bar{\\Xi}$, $\\Omega$, $\\bar{\\Omega}$, $\\phi$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3, 19.6, 200 GeV and in d+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, including transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra, nuclear modification factors, antibaryon-to-baryon ratios and baryon-to-meson ratios.

      "Abstract": "Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons. The measurement of the production of hypernuclei with mass number A=3 and 4 in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful tool to investigate the hyper-nucleosynthesis mechanism. In the coalescence model, the production yields are sensitive to the interplay between the spatial extension of the nucleus wavefunction and the baryon-emitting source size, whereas, in the statistical hadronization model, the nuclear structure does not come into play in the production. Hypernuclei span over a wide range of wavefunction radii, from about 2 fm for A=4 hypernuclei to about 10 fm for the hypertriton, making them ideal probes to test such models. In addition, the study of hypernuclei properties provides information on the nucleon-hyperon interactions, complementing the results obtained through femtoscopy correlation measurements. The strength of such interactions is a fundamental input to calculate the equation-of-state of the high-density nuclear matter found inside neutron stars.\r\nThis contribution presents recent measurements of ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$He based on the data samples collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Besides the yield measurement, the production mechanisms can be investigated via anisotropic flow and global spin polarization measurements, comparing the behaviour of hypernuclei with their non-strange counterpart. In this contribution, we present recent flow measurements of ${}^{3}$He, ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}$He, obtained from the large Pb-Pb data sample collected by ALICE at the LHC in Run 3. Both the yields and the flow coefficients will be discussed in the context of the state-of-the-art theoretical models.",

      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By contrasting the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the ϕ-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^{*}$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution will present new results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^{*}$(892) and ϕ(1020) in Pb–Pb collisions obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results will be compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret which underlying mechanism can describe the experimental observations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. Proposed Glueball candidates like the f$_2$(1270), f$^{′}_2$(1525), and f$_0$(1710) also provide opportunities to explore the gluonic bound states predicted by lattice QCD. Utilizing its excellent particle identification capabilities ALICE has recently conducted detailed studies of the exotic resonance production in pp collisions data at √s = 13 and 13.6 TeV. This contribution will present new measurements of exotic resonances such as f$_0$(980), f$_1$(1285), and the glueball candidates to get more insight into their internal structure.",

A dense baryon-rich medium is formed during collisions at center-of-mass energies of a few-GeV.

Enhancement of baryon to meson ratio hints at an onset of deconfinement in this energy range. We will also explore the centrality dependence of hadron yields, and the evolution of the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperature, baryon chemical potential and average radial expansion flow in the reported energy range, which can give insights on the EoS of the created medium.

      "Speaker": "Yili Wang",
      "Institute": "Peking University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The study of exotic hadrons has long been a topic of great interest for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As one of the light exotic hadrons, the structure and constituent quark content of $f_0(980)$ have been debated for decades, with theories suggesting it could be a tetraquark state ($s\\bar sq\\bar q$) or a hadronic molecule ($K\\bar K$). Recently, the CMS experiment has measured the elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$ of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions and concluded that  $f_0(980)$ is an ordinary $s\\bar s$ meson, based on the number-of-constituent-quarks (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow [1]. Assuming that loosely bound light exotic hadrons can only survive at the kinetic freeze-out of the expanding hadronic matter, we have implemented the first $K\\bar K$ coalescence model to a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic and hadronic transport model to calculate the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV.  Using the well tuned phase-space distributions of kaons in this collision, our coalescence model results agree well with the CMS flow measurements,  providing thus a strong evidence for the $K\\bar K$ molecular nature of $f_0(980)$. Our study also indicates that the CMS Collaboration may have unjustifiably ruled out the $K\\bar K$ molecular state of $f_0(980)$ by not considering the different $v_2$ scalings in  the coalescence of hadrons and the coalescence of quarks[2].\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] A.

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "One of the unresolved issues in hadron–hadron collisions is the microscopic understanding of how light (anti)(hyper)nuclei are created. Several differential measurements of (anti)(hyper)nuclei yields, momentum distributions, and fluctuations have been carried out in pp, p–A, and A–A collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Comparisons to models based on statistical hadronization or nucleon coalescence generally provide a good fit to the data. However, these models are grounded in different underlying scenarios, leading to a highly model dependent interpretation of the results.\r\nIn this work, new results based on femtoscopy correlations of deuteron proton and deuteron–pion pairs measured in pp and Pb–Pb collisions by ALICE at collision energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, respectively, are presented. Deuteron–proton correlations allow for studying the particle-emitting source size of deuterons compared to other hadrons. The deuteron source aligns with the proton source across all colliding systems. In pp collisions, the deuteron–pion correlation reveals the residual interaction between pions and nucleons from short lived Δ decays, followed by nucleon coalescence into deuterons. This effect is not observed in Pb–Pb collisions due to the large pion  multiplicities.\r\nThese results demonstrate, in a model-independent manner, that coalescence is a viable mechanism for (anti)deuteron production in ultra-relativistic hadron–hadron collisions.",

We address these challenges using heavy flavour, which offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium. We demonstrate how modified and groomed versions of the Cambridge/Aachen or FlavourCone jet finding algorithms applied on $g \\to c\\bar{c}$ splittings can be used to reconstruct the kinematics of such splittings with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons. We construct the parton formation time distribution, which has characteristic distortions arising from medium effects.

Using a hybrid simulation framework that combines the IP-Glasma model for initial-state with viscous hydrodynamic evolution MUSIC to model the medium, we study charm quark propagation through different stages of the collision, from pre-equilibrium to hadronization. Heavy quark initial production is generated using PYTHIA and their interactions within the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic medium are modeled through Langevin dynamics in MARTINI. Our results reveal that both the nuclear modification factor and anisotropic flow coefficients of D-mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are sensitive to the momentum-dependent energy loss of charm quarks in the initial stages.

We study the effect of the initial shape of the collision system on the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of promptly produced $D^{0}$ using event-shape engineering (ESE) in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV, at CMS. A correlation between the initial shape anisotropy with the $D^{0}$ $v_{2}$ would suggest that the flow gets driven by the interactions between the charm quark and the QGP and comparison with theoretical predictions allow us to unravel the mechanism behind the generation of $v_{2}$. We also study the anisotropic flow of nonprompt $D^{0}$ produced due to the decay of the bottom quarks and the nuclear modification factor ($\\mathrm{R_{AA}}$) for prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$. These studies provide further insights into the QGP interactions of heavy quarks like charm and bottom in heavy-ion collisions in different $p_{T}$ regions ranging from 1--40 GeV/c, the widest ever performed with ESE, and centralities between 0--50\\%.",

Using its novel streaming-readout-capable, precision tracking system, sPHENIX collected 100 billion unbiased p+p collisions, and a further sample of minimum-bias Au-Au collisions, in Run-24. A key measurement of the sPHENIX heavy flavor physics program is the comparison of $\\Lambda_c$ to $D^0$ differential yields in both Au+Au and p+p collisions, which probes questions related to the hadronization of heavy-flavor baryons compared to mesons in the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium and in vacuum. At RHIC energies, there is no previous measurement of the $\\Lambda_c$ / $D^0$ baseline in p+p collisions, modern Monte Carlo event generators give widely different predictions, and the ratio in Au+Au is only poorly known. This talk presents a measurement from sPHENIX of the $\\Lambda_c$/ $D^0$ ratio in p+p collisions and the status of the measurement in Au+Au collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Charmonium production has long been identified as one of the golden probes to study the quark­­–gluon plasma (QGP). In fact, the early production of heavy quarks ($c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$) make charmonia an ideal tool to investigate the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, at LHC energies the recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks pairs, namely (re)generation, was found to significantly affect charmonium observables, in contraposition to the well known suppression mechanism. This aspect makes the production measurements of ground and excited states more and more relevant to discriminate among the scenarios foreseen by the different theoretical models. In addition, the possibility to isolate the non-prompt charmonia, i.e. originating from beauty hadron decays, provides an insight into the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. In this contribution, recently published results by the ALICE collaboration of inclusive charmonia production obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented. At midrapidity, the measurements of prompt and non-prompt  J/$\\psi$ production will be shown, while at forward rapidity the measurement will be extended to the excited state as the $\\psi$(2S).

While this limit is accurate for $\\Upsilon(1S)$, its applicability to other quarkonium states is unclear.  In this talk, wwe present a generalization of this code that incorporates the regime where $rT \\sim 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation. In its new version, QTRAJ implements new jump operators connecting different states, which are then expanded in plane waves, giving rise to a variation of the algorithm present in QTRAJ 1.0 where jumps with $\\Delta \\ell > 1$ are allowed. We will show a review of this approach comparing the $rT\\ll 1$ and $rT\\sim 1$ cases, and we present preliminary phenomenological results.",

      "Abstract": "The strong interaction in the non-perturbative regime typical of the system created in Heavy-Ion collision has been studied in the past years through an effective Quasi-Particle Model ($QPM$): we present an extension to a more realistic model, named $QPMp$, incorporating momentum-dependent parton masses as entailed by QCD asymptotic free dynamics. This model naturally improves the description of quark susceptibilities previously underestimated in the simple $QPM$. Coupling the $QPMp$ modeling to an event-by-event transport approach based on Langevin equations, we evaluate the heavy-flavour $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{n}(p_T)$ for $D$, $\\Lambda_c$, $B$, $\\Lambda_b$ hadrons in $PbPb$ as well as for $OO$ at $5$ $ATeV$. In $PbPb$ we find a quite good prediction for both $D$ meson and leptons from $B$ decays at least within current experimental uncertainties; we also discuss the additional information that can be carried by collisions of light $OO$ system. \r\nA main general result is that for charm quark the extracted space diffusion Ds(T) appears to be significantly larger (about $30-40\\%$) wrt the recent lQCD/NREFT results at momentum $p=0$. We propose a novel analysis that point out the crucial role of the momentum dependence of the interaction to draw solid conclusions about the agreement between the phenomenological approach and lQCD calculation as well as to determine the thermalization time of HQ and in particular its mass dependence from charm to bottom quark. We will point out that $\\Lambda_c$ production and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of D meson at very low momenta ($p_T<1.5$ $GeV$) will allow for a novel and more solid determination of the space diffusion coefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.L.Sambataro, V.

      "Abstract": "Screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part. We determine the complex potential in QGP using lattice calculations on lattices with large temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=16-36$. The complex potential is extracted from the Wilson line correlators and physically motivated forms of the corresponding spectral functions [1,2]. We find that the real part of the complex potential is not screened in QGP independently of the detailed form of the spectral functions. We also estimate the imaginary part of the potential using prior information from various theoretical calculations [2].\r\n\r\nLattice calculations also find that the wave function of bottomonium states does not change much across the QCD transition [3]. This is consistent with the observation of the unscreened potential. Therefore, we use the vacuum wave function of different quarkonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\chi_c(1P)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\chi_b(1P)$ and $\\chi_b(2P)$ states\r\nin QGP [2] and compare to lattice NRQCD results [3].\r\n\r\n[1] Alexei Bazavov, Daniel Hoying, Rasmus N.

Recent measurements in pp collisions show baryon-to-meson ratios significantly higher than those in $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions, challenging the validity of theoretical calculations based on the factorisation approach and assuming universal fragmentation functions across collision systems. Several QCD-inspired effective models (e.g. Catania, POWLANG, QCM) and Monte Carlo generators (e.g. PYTHIA 8, EPOS 4) take different approaches to describe the charm-quark hadronization, and to explain the observed baryon production at the LHC.

Precise measurements of strange and non-strange charm-baryon production are crucial to put constraints on model calculations, and to understand the mechanisms governing the charm-quark hadronization in pp collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of strange ($\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0,+}$) and non-strange ($\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2455)$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2520)$) charm-baryon production utilising the large data sample of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV harvested from the start of LHC Run 3 are presented, and the comparison with model predictions are discussed.",

We have developed a state-of-the-art model to provide a comprehensive description of the heavy quark evolution in a realistic QGP medium from the heavy quark's production in the initial stages of the collision all the way to hadronic freeze-out. \r\n\r\nThe transport of heavy quarks in the QGP medium is described by a Langevin-based transport model that has been augmented to incorporate medium-induced radiation. This transport model is coupled to a bulk evolution model based on 2+1D relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. The heavy quark transport coefficients are derived from non-perturbative T-matrix calculations, which account for resonant correlations near the QGP transition temperature.  Hadronization of the heavy quark is described by a fragmentation plus coalescence model. We utilize the resonance recombination model that satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions. The recombination probabilities are derived from resonant heavy-quark scattering rates. \r\n\r\nWe report on key observables in open heavy flavor physics, including the nuclear modification factor, elliptic flow, baryon-to-meson ratio, as well as D-Dbar angular correlations and compare our results to experimental data from the ALICE collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at 5 TeV.",

To explore them we present a model of quarkonia formation based on the convolution between the Wigner densities, associated to the quarkonia eigenstates (excited states up to 3S states),  and the Wigner density of  the two-body $Q \\bar Q$  pairs produced those collisions. This model allows to predict quantitatively the rapidity and $p_T$ distribution of ground states and excited states of charmonia as well as of bottomonia in pp collisions.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mainly produced in hard-scattering processes among partons in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions at the LHC. In heavy-ion collisions, where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state is produced, charm and beauty quarks are produced on a timescale shorter than the medium formation time, being sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the fireball and to the magnetic field produced perpendicularly to the reaction plane in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large angular momentum and initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised, and the quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron during the hadronization process. Experimentally, heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring either the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ of spin-1 bosons (as the D$^{*+}$ meson) or the longitudinal polarization $P_{\\rm z}$ of spin ½ fermions (as the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryon). Measurements in pp collisions provide a crucial baseline to disentangle the amount of charm-hadron polarization induced by the charm-quark polarization inherited from the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of the $\\rho_{00}$ parameter of D$^{*+}$ meson in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=5.02~$TeV, exploiting the data sample collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the LHC Run 2, is shown.

      "Abstract": "Recent observations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have revealed a significant enhancement in baryon production in hadronic collisions compared to e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, challenging the long-held assumption of fragmentation universality. This phenomenon, initially observed in the charm sector, has also been observed in the beauty sector, indicating a broader implication for heavy-flavor hadronization processes. This observation has led to the development of several models attempting to explain these observations, by implementing modified hadronization approaches with respect to the in-vacuum fragmentation process. Proposed mechanisms include color reconnection beyond leading-color approximation, hadronisation via coalescence, and feed-down from unobserved resonant states in a statistical hadronization approach.\r\n\r\nTo further elucidate this phenomenon, recent studies have focused on baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of event multiplicity. Intriguingly, evidence of a multiplicity dependence, with increased ratios in high-multiplicity events, has been observed in both the charm and beauty sectors, suggesting a possible connection between baryon enhancement and the local parton density. These investigations have significant implications also for heavy-ion physics, potentially bridging the gap between phenomena observed in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive understanding of these effects is essential for refining our theoretical models of heavy-quark hadronisation in hadronic environments.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, new ALICE measurements of prompt and non-prompt $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$-baryon and ${\\rm D}^0$-meson production cross sections, evaluated on the dataset of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3, will be reported. The $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+/{\\rm D}^0$ production-yield ratios in the same collision system, both multiplicity integrated and as a function of multiplicity, will also be discussed and compared to state-of-the-art model predictions implementing different hadronisation approaches.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are useful probes for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) generated in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their participation in the collective motion of the medium can be assessed by measuring the charm-hadron elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$, originating from the initial-state spatial asymmetry in non-central heavy-ion collisions. These measurements provide fundamental inputs to constrain theoretical models describing the charm-quark transport in the QGP, as well as its possible thermalization in the medium. In addition, the comparison between meson and baryon $v_2$ can provide further insights into medium-induced phenomena, such as the radial flow and the charm-quark hadronization via coalescence.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurements of $\\mathrm{D^0}$-, $\\mathrm{D^+}$-, $\\mathrm{ D_s^+}$-meson and $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$-baryon $v_2$ in different centrality intervals of Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run 3 are shown. The measurements are compared to model predictions that incorporate various implementations of heavy-quark interaction and hadronization with the QGP constituents. Moreover, the measurement of the $\\mathrm{D^0}$-meson elliptic flow in pp collisions is presented.",

      "Abstract": "The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy [1]. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference.

      "Abstract": "A number of new four-quark states containing from one to four $c$ or $\\overline c$ quarks have been observed recently.  Many of these new states have been discovered at the LHC.  The production of these states via intrinsic charm in the proton is investigated.  The tetraquark masses obtained in this approac agree well with the measured masses [1].  These calculations can provide some insight into the nature of the tetraquark candidates, whether as a bound meson pair or as a looser configuration of four individual partons which can influence their interactions in the nuclear medium, such as in heavy-ion collisions. The kinematic distributions of these states as a function of $y$ and $p_T$ are also studied.  Previous investiagations [2-4] show that $J/\\psi$ and $\\overline D$ mesons produced from such states manifest themselves at forwrad rapidity and relatively high $p_T$.

Compared to previous lattice calculations with unphysical light quark masses, we consider near-physical values and a much wider temperature range. Our results for the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient near the crossover temperature are considerably smaller than the estimates obtained by comparing phenomenological models with experimental data and by T-matrix calculations, and are close to the AdS/CFT limit. At high temperatures, however, the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient increases and approaches the NLO weak coupling prediction within the estimated errors. We also find that the dependence of the spatial heavy quark diffusion coefficient on the heavy quark mass $M_Q$ on the lattice is weaker compared to the model calculations.",

However, since not all the features of the measurements can be well reproduced by the models, the assumption that the spin degrees of freedom of the QGP are equilibrated can be questioned. In this talk, I will derive the dissipative, out-of-equilibrium contributions to spin polarization at first order in gradients using the Zubarev method for spin hydrodynamics. I will prove that the thermal shear can not give rise to dissipative corrections to spin polarization. I will derive momentum dependent kubo formulas that gives the intensity of each contributions and that can be evaluated for any underlying microscopic theory. At the end I will discuss consequences on the interpretation of the measurements.",

Additionally, anisotropic flow can produce local vorticities in both in-plane (z) and out-of-plane (y) directions, leading to local polarization.

      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) in heavy-ion collisions probes the topological sector of quantum chromodynamics, where parity and charge-parity symmetries are locally violated. Unlike the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), where the induced dipole moment fluctuates randomly from event to event, the CMW generates an electric quadrupole moment with a same sign for a given net charge state of the system, thus CMW can be observed even when CME is not detected. The CMW leads to charge-dependent elliptic flow ($v_2$) which correlates with charge asymmetry ($A_{ch}$) of the system. \r\nExperimental searches for the CMW, however, face challenges from background contributions related to elliptic flow and nonflow. \r\nThe correlation between triangular flow $v_3$ and $A_{ch}$ will be discussed as a background indicator.\r\nSimilar to the CME search, we use RHIC isobar collisions ($^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}\\rm Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$) at STAR for the CMW search, anticipating a stronger signal in $^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru$ due to its larger magnetic field. \r\nIn addition, we compare with Au+Au to study the system dependence at the top RHIC energy, examining the magnetic field effects from isobar to Au+Au. \r\nThe prerequisite of the CMW is expected to change with collision energy. \r\nWe present the measurement of slope $ r_2$ of $v_2$ vs. $A_{ch}$ correlation in isobar collisions and Au+Au collisions with BES-II data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 19, 27 and 200 GeV.\r\nWe use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions. \r\nWe will also explore the feasibility of the event-shape selection scheme to subtract the flow-related background in CMW search.",

      "Speaker": "Enrico Speranza",
      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of spin-polarization effects in heavy-ion collisions. Most approaches assume that final-state particles become polarized only if the thermal vorticity and shear are non-zero at freeze-out. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different polarization mechanism. For the first time, spin density is introduced in the initial state in a similar way as one introduces energy density. We argue that the collision of two nuclei, which occurs among participant nucleons carrying spin, deposits in the transverse plane a spin density that polarizes the produced QCD fireball along some random direction. If the subsequent evolution (e.g., kinetic or hydrodynamic) of the fireball does not alter this effect, the spins of the particles emitted at freeze-out will be polarized along the same direction. Using a simple model, we estimate that the polarization induced by initial-state fluctuations is on the order of 1% in central collisions, increasing to over 10% in noncentral collisions. At high energies, it is thus much larger than the polarization due to event-by-event fluctuations of the thermal vorticity. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable able to reveal net-spin fluctuations in the initial states, for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons. This new effect depends little on beam energy and could be promptly studied at both the LHC and RHIC. Finally, besides introducing new tools to probe spin effects in nuclear collisions, this work provides a framework to define spin initial conditions suitable for extensions of hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom.",

      "Abstract": "Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of particles of interest (POI's). Event-shape engineering (ESE) [1] and event-shape selection (ESS) [2] are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\\Delta\\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. The former groups events according to the elliptic anisotropy vector $\\vec{q}_2$ of particles in phase space different from that of POI's, thus to the dynamical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$, whereas the latter groups events according to $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$ of pairs of POI's themselves, thus to the statistical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$. In this talk, we conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations [3]. \r\nIt is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept, because of the limited dynamical fluctuation range of $v_2$ than that of  statistical fluctuations.\r\nIt is found that the ESE method can faithfully probe the CME when the $\\vec{q}_2$ phase space is distanced from the POI's, while nonflow effect cannot be neglected when the $\\vec{q}_2$ and POI's phase spaces are close. The ESS method, on the other hand, is obscured because of the intertwining $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$, $v_2$, and $\\Delta\\gamma$, all of which are computed from the same POI's. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the  event content, such as the relative mixtures of background-contributing sources, and thus is not a robust measure of the CME.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

Many studies indicate that final-state effects, particularly from hadronization, play a significant role. Recently, it has been proposed that spin correlations of $\\Lambda$ hyperons could provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of $\\Lambda$ polarization. In this talk, we report the first experimental measurements of $\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Lambda\\Lambda$, and $\\bar{\\Lambda}\\bar{\\Lambda}$ spin-spin correlations in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 200\\,\\textrm{GeV}$, as recorded by the STAR experiment in 2012.

We propose a systematic method to describe such correlations in the quark matter. The correlations can be classified as local and long range types. We show in particular that the effective quark spin correlations contain the genuine spin correlations originated directly from the dynamical process as well as those induced by averaging over other degrees of freedom. We also show that such correlations can be studied by measuring the vector meson's spin density matrix and hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-anti-hyperon spin correlations.

      "Abstract": "We investigate the weak-interaction-driven bulk-viscous transport properties of npe matter in the neutrino transparent regime. This work complements our recent study that shows that the dynamics of neutron star mergers away from beta equilibrium can be precisely described by an Israel-Stewart formulation with far-from-equilibrium bulk and relaxation time transport coefficients, which are strongly affected by the nuclear symmetry energy [1]. In this work, we designed a simple parametric model for the equation of state and the bulk viscosity that satisfies all the thermodynamics (causality and stability) and observational constraints from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. This parametric model explicitly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters and is ideal for studying their effects on equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties. With this new model, we systematically show how the transport coefficients vary with the nuclear symmetry energy. We also discuss how the nuclear symmetry energy affects gravitational-wave observables, such as the dissipative tidal deformability [2] present in the inspiral phase of neutron star mergers.  \r\n \r\n[1] Y.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "It is known from earlier studies that the hadronic interaction affects the measured yield of short lived resonance e.g. $K^{*0}$.  Recent studies [1] show that the directed flow ($v_{1}$) of $K^{*0}$ is strongly affected during the hadronic stage due to asymmetric loss in different sides of the $p_{x}$ axis in momentum space caused by the tilted fireball and density dependent rescattering. Therefore the $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ can be a good probe to study the late-stage hadronic interaction and provide more information (e.g rescattering affected by variations in matter density across phase-space) compared to the yield measurement integrated over full azimuth and rapidity. \r\n\r\nWe present the first measurement of directed flow of $K^{*0}$ resonances in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV. Centrality-dependent difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $K^{*0}$ resonances will be presented.  The difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $\\phi$  mesons will be also shown. The results will be compared with a hydrodynamic model that incorporates a hadronic afterburner [1].  The measured $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ resonances can provide more insights into hadronic rescattering and regeneration processes in heavy-ion collisions and can constrain transport-based models of QCD matter.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

      "Abstract": "Over the past two decades, research has shown that various observables measured in heavy-ion collisions can be effectively described using relativistic fluid dynamics across different collision systems and energies. However, a common challenge in these studies is the modeling of the transition from the initial state to the fluid-dynamic phase. While the collision likely involves complex, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is possible that a second-order fluid theory can adequately capture its softer features. If successfully completed, this approach could lead to a comprehensive dynamical description of a heavy-ion collision, where the only free parameters are related to the thermodynamics and the transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.\r\nIn our work (arXiv:2410.08169), we investigate this possibility. We discuss how to characterize the state prior to the collision within this framework, the implications of relativistic causality on the equations of motion, the entropy production from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how this can inform sensible initial conditions for subsequent transverse expansion.",

Coupled with an upgraded wide-acceptance tracker ($|\\eta|<4$) and high-granularity calorimetry ($|\\eta|<5$), these upgrades will allow for more detailed investigations of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the (3+1)-dimensional evolution of heavy flavor quark dynamics and particle composition inside jets over a wide angular range. Additionally, the improved detector capabilities will significantly expand opportunities in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), enabling precise measurements of photon-induced processes, which are crucial for studying the gluonic structure of nuclei.

Track pointing resolution of better than 10 micron for $p_{\\rm T} > 200$ MeV/$c$ can be achieved by placing the vertex detector on a retractable structure inside the beam pipe. ALICE 3 will, on the one hand, enable novel studies of the quark-gluon plasma and, on the other hand, open up important physics opportunities in other areas of QCD and beyond. The main new studies in the QGP sector focus on low-$p_{\\rm T}$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons and charm-charm correlations, as as well as on precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission to probe the mechanism of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of the QGP temperature. Besides QGP studies, ALICE 3 can uniquely contribute to hadronic physics, with femtoscopic studies of the interaction potentials between charm mesons and searches for nuclei with charm, and to fundamental physics, with tests of the Low theorem for ultra-soft photon emission.

      "Abstract": "Spin hydrodynamics is the extension of standard relativistic hydrodynamics with the total angular momentum considered as an independent conserved charge, where the total angular momentum is often expressed as a surface integral of a rank-3 tensor.\r\nThis rank-3 tensor is then decomposed into orbital and spin parts, which, by using the definition of orbital angular momentum in Cartesian coordinates and the energy-momentum tensor conservation, leads to the equation of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nThis treatment is not covariant under coordinate transformations, even in flat spacetime.\r\nWe address this issue by redefining the orbital and total angular momentum in a covariant way, which can also be extended to curved spacetime in cases where the Belinfante and Hilbert definitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent.\r\nThen, we review the constitutive equations of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics developed from a systematic expansion in the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\r\nThis formulation is inspired by, but not necessarily based on, quantum kinetic theory.\r\nUp to the first order in $\\hbar$, there is no back-reaction from the spin sector to fluid dynamics, and, therefore, solutions to standard hydrodynamics act as an input for the equations of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nWe consider three simple solutions to the fluid’s equation of motion: hydrostatic, linearized hydrodynamics, and conformal Bjorken flow.\r\nWe demonstrate that, up to first-order in $\\hbar$, the spin waves are not affected by the fluid waves, and therefore, the results from the hydrostatic case and linearized hydrodynamics are the same.\r\nThis shows that our results for the damping of spin waves are not modified by slight fluid perturbations.\r\nFor the case of conformal Bjorken flow, we first review the consequences of conformal invariance in spin hydrodynamics and, in particular, show that conformal invariance should be considered only in the limit where $\\hbar$ vanishes.\r\nThen, we use the attractor solution to find the evolution of the spin potential.\r\nWe show that the spin potential in this nonlinear regime is damped in a similar fashion to the linear regime.\r\nThese results strengthen our previous findings on the possible long equilibration time for spin, and support a dynamical treatment of spin degrees of freedom.",

      "Abstract": "In the past years, different observables related to the spin polarization of hadrons such as $\\Lambda$-Baryons have attracted much attention and continue to find new applications. \r\nWhile some measurements (such as the global polarization) are straightforwardly reproduced by assuming the spins of the particles to be in equilibrium, the explanation of more differential observables (such as the local polarization) remains a subject of active discussion.\r\n\r\nA crucial ingredient in a more thorough description of spin dynamics is a formulation of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that accounts for the finite (and possibly long [1]) timescale of spin relaxation, i.e., of the approach of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$ to the thermal vorticity $\\varpi^{\\mu\\nu}$. In such a theory, the spin potential remains a dynamical quantity that follows certain evolution equations, akin to the Bloch equations for the magnetization in the (nonrelativistic) description of spin dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe main result to be presented are the equations of motion for such a theory, derived from first principles based on quantum kinetic theory [2]. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach [3], a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. \r\nIt is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor $\\mathfrak{t}^{\\mu\\nu}$. For a simple truncation, all first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.\r\n\r\n[1] DW, M. Shokri, D. H.

      "Speaker": "Lucia Oliva",
      "Institute": "Università di Catania, INFN Catania",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The unexpected pattern of global spin alignment of vector mesons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for different particle species have posed a strong challenge to theoretical interpretation, as it cannot be explained solely through conventional polarization sources such as vorticity and electromagnetic fields. We argue that fluctuations of strong-force fields with short correlation length may be the key to solve the puzzle. We derive a relativistic spin Boltzmann equation for vector mesons from Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporating an effective quark-meson model for interaction and the quark coalescence process for hadronization. Our calculations of the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ for unflavored vector mesons reveal that all field contributions appear in squared terms. This finding indicates that anisotropies in local field correlations, relative to the spin quantization axis, lead to the spin alignment of unflavored vector mesons. We propose that the large spin alignment observed for $\\phi$ mesons at lower energies arises from effective $\\phi$ fields that  polarize the strange quarks and antiquarks, which in turn form polarized $\\phi$ mesons via coalescence during the hadronization stage.  The strength of the $\\phi$ field can be inferred from the experimental data on $\\phi$-meson spin alignment as functions of collision energy reported by STAR Collaboration. Our findings show a transverse momentum dependence of $\\rho_{00}$ in fair agreement with STAR data, and we also predict the azimuthal angle dependence of $\\rho_{00}$. The proposed polarization mechanism driven by fluctuating strong-force fields may open a new window into a hitherto unknown behaviour of QCD interaction.\r\n[X.-L. Sheng, L. Oliva, Z.-T. Liang, Q.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The multistage approach based on hydrodynamics has achieved remarkably success in modeling heavy-ion physics, providing an accurate description of experimental particle spectra as well as various signatures of collective flow, flow correlations, and fluctuations. However, traditional numerical simulations of hydrodynamics are challenged by recent high-precision measurements: to probe the finer details in the system via statistics-demanding observables, 10^9-10^10 collisions events are commonly required. As heavy-ion collision physics enters a high-precision era, theoretical modeling needs to evolve to meet growing computational demands.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we introduce DiffHIC, a generative diffusion model designed to bridge this gap. The model simulates ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end, taking initial entropy density profiles as input and producding two-dimensional final particle spectra. By comparing observables derived from particle spectra generated by both traditional numerical simulations and our trained generative model, we demonstrate that DiffHIC not only accurately replicates integrated and differential observables but also effectively captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These results indicate that DiffHIC successfully learns the intricate mapping from initial entropy density profiles to final particle spectra, governed by a set of nonlinear hydrodynamic and Boltzmann transport equations. While preserving the fine  details of the underlying physical processes, DiffHIC significantly accelerates end-to-end heavy-ion collision simulations. For example, DiffHIC can simulate a single central collision event in just 0.1 seconds on a GeForce GTX 4090 GPU.\r\n \r\nThe code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.\r\n \r\n \r\n[1]arxiv:2410.13069",

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the transverse momentum broadening coefficient, $\\hat{q}$ plays an integral role in characterising how a high-energy parton loses energy to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it passes. Over the last few years, it has been shown [1,2] that $\\hat{q}$ starts to receive radiative corrections at $\\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, featuring potentially large logarithms. Indeed, better understanding the nature of these logarithmic corrections is extremely relevant for the goal of obtaining a precise theoretical description of parton energy loss.\r\nDuring this talk, I will begin by presenting our results from [3], where we investigate how the inclusion of thermal effects impacts these radiative corrections. I will then report on our progress in understanding how the logarithmic phase space is deformed, once one relaxes the so-called harmonic oscillator approximation. In this direction, we make use of the improved opacity expansion [4], which has recently found success in analytically describing, at leading order, the interface of the single and multiple-scattering regimes.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] T.Liou, A.Mueller, B.Wu, arxiv:1304.7677\r\n[2] J.P.Blaizot, F.Dominguez, E.Iancu, Y.Mehtar-Tani, arxiv: 1311.5823\r\n[3] J.Ghiglieri, E.Weitz, arxiv: 2207.08842\r\n[4]J.Barata, Y.Mehtar-Tani, A.Soto-Ontoso, K.Tywoniuk, arxiv: 2106.07402",

      "Abstract": "Intermediate to low energy heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to the finite temperature ($T$), high baryon number density ($n_B$) QCD equation of state (EoS) at a ratio between charged and total number of baryons that is fixed by the colliding species. For typical nuclei used in collisions, like gold and lead, this ratio, also known as the charge fraction ($Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$), is around 0.4. On the other hand, studies of isolated neutron stars and the dynamics of their birth and mergers require $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ as low as 0.01. We propose a new finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter EoS [1] that can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point observations of isolated neutron stars and nuclear experiments. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data from low to intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. With our new method, we can separately quantify the uncertainty in the $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ and finite $T$ components of the EoS without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We check the accuracy of our framework using a microscopic equation of state up to T = 100 MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B \\geq$ 1100 MeV (∼ 1 − 2 $n_{\\rm sat}$) and find that the error introduced is less than 5%, with even better results for larger $\\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

We discuss that the model calculations with the $\\Lambda$ potential are consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1] and the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2].\r\n\r\nA unified approach integrating heavy-ion collisions, other nuclear experiments, and neutron stars with the modern nuclear force from chiral EFT has provided valuable insights into the properties of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter (e.g. Ref. [3]). This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of both nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. For a microscopic description of dense matter, such an approach must be performed also for the hyperon sector. A precise understanding of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter is essential for addressing the long-standing hyperon puzzle of neutron star physics. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we consider the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2] at RHIC-BES energies to verify the $\\Lambda$ potential based on chiral EFT [4]. This potential is sufficiently repulsive at high densities to solve the hyperon puzzle and has proven by us to be consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1]. We employ a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) implemented into the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2. We show that the model with the $\\Lambda$ potential from chiral EFT can reproduce the experimental data [2], while a more attractive $\\Lambda$ potential also reproduces the data. Thus, additional constraints on the Λ potential are demanded.\r\n\r\nWe will also report the analysis of $v_1$ for $\\Lambda$ with various updates including the covariant collision term [5] and the hyperon-nucleon scattering cross section from up-to-date chiral EFT forces [6].

      "Abstract": "We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\\mu = 2.6~\\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\\Delta$ of $457~\\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and \r\n$216~\\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions.

      "Abstract": "We generalize the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory recently derived in Ref. [1] to describe the dissipative dynamics occurring in accretion disks in presence of large magnetic fields. For this purpose we consider a relativistic dilute gas composed of electrons and ions described by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and simplify it using the 14-moment approximation. This procedure leads to an extended version of the MHD theory traditionally employed in astrophysics simulations [2,3] which typically considers only the parallel component of the shear-stress tensor aligned with magnetic field, B. In our framework, we consider all three distinct, non-degenerate components of the shear-stress tensor relative to B, each governed by unique dynamical equations. We demonstrate that this novel framework exhibits oscillatory behavior in strong magnetic fields that cannot be captured by the conventional MHD formulation, similar to what was observed in Ref. [1]. We finally compare both frameworks in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In particular, we analyze the equations in conditions that lead to firehose instability [4], which is usually observed in simulation-based frameworks. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] K.
