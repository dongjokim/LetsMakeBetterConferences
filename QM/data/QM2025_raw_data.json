      "description": "<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Quark Matter 2025 is the XXXI International Conference on Ultra-relativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions, which will be held in Frankfurt, Hesse, Germany. This conference brings together theoretical and experimental physicists from around the world to discuss new developments in high-energy heavy-ion physics. The focus of the discussions is on the fundamental understanding of strongly-interacting matter at extreme conditions, as formed in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, as well as on emergent QCD phenomena in high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">The scientific program will cover the following topics:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Chirality</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Collective dynamics &amp; small systems</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Correlations &amp; fluctuations</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Detectors &amp; future experiments</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Electromagnetic probes</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Heavy flavor &amp; quarkonia </span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Initial state of hadronic and electron-ion collisions &amp; nuclear structure</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Jets</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Light and strange flavor physics &amp; nuclei</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">New theoretical developments</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">Physics of ultraperipheral collisions</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">QCD matter in astrophysics</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #555555;\">QCD phase diagram &amp; critical point</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br><br></p>",

          "description": "Understanding the properties of hypernuclei is crucial for constraining the nature of hyperon-nucleon ($Y\\text{-}N$) interactions, which plays a key role in determining the inner structure of compact stars. The lightest (anti-)hypernuclei are the hypertriton ($^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$), which consists  of a pair of nucleons and  a $\\Lambda$ hyperon, and its anti-nucleus (${^3_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}}\\overline{\\rm H}$).  Significant knowledge has recently been acquired regarding the mass, lifetime, and binding energy of $^3_\\Lambda\\text{H}$. However, its exact spin, whether $\\frac{1}{2}$ or  $\\frac{3}{2}$, remains undetermined in both experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we present a novel method of using the hypertriton global polarization in heavy-ion collisions to decipher not only  its total spin but also its internal spin  structure.  This method is based on the finding that  its three different  spin structures  exhibit distinct beam energy dependence of its global polarization when it is produced in these collisions from the coalescence of proton, neutron and $\\Lambda$. Future observations of the (anti-)hypertriton global polarization thus provide the opportunity to unveil the spin structure of (anti-)hypertriton and its production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.",

Goethe University, \r\nD-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe investigate the formation of light nuclei and hypernuclei in the \r\nrapidly expanding nuclear matter after relativistic nucleus-nucleus \r\ncollisions. The primary hadronization phase including the strangeness \r\nproduction is described with UrQMD model. It is demonstrated that the \r\nnucleation process can be explained within the statistical approach by \r\napplying the local equilibrium concept. We subdivide the expanding \r\nnuclear system into several parts (clusters) consisting of nucleons and \r\nhyperons which are close in the phase space. The production of nuclei \r\ntakes place inside these clusters, and it can be described as their \r\nstatistical decay in the coexistence region of the nuclear phase \r\ntransition. The local chemical equilibrium concept explain consistently \r\nmany experimental data which was not possible with the statistical \r\nmodels under assumption of global chemical equilibrium [1,2]. This model \r\nwas also successfully applied to describe experimental data on both \r\nnormal nuclei and strange hypernuclei production in the GSI and RHIC-BES \r\nenergy range [3,4]. We predict the production of double hypernuclei up \r\nto $^4_{\\Lambda \\Lambda}$H and further intermediate mass nuclei up to \r\n$^8$Be for Au+Au central collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3 GeV, recently \r\nexplored by the STAR experiments [4]. The production of charmed nuclei \r\nis discussed too. These new nuclei can be identified by the measurement \r\nof the correlated particles. \r\n\r\n[1] A. S. Botvina, N. Buyukcizmeci and M.

          "description": "We contrast the behavior of ordinary and factorial cumulants of proton number and point out that the latter has numerous advantages over the former, in particular with regards to the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions. The new RHIC BES-II data on factorial cumulants of protons is analyzed, indicating clear deviation of two- and three-particle proton correlations from the non-critical baseline at collision energies below 10 GeV. Multiple scenarios for this deviation are explored, including the possibility of critical fluctuations and the implications for the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\nWe also illustrate that the acceptance dependence of the appropriately scaled factorial cumulants, $\\hat{C}_n/(\\hat{C}_1)^n$, is flat if all correlations are driven by long-range correlations only, making it a clean probe of short-range correlations. Furthermore, global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations predict identical $\\hat C_2/(\\hat C_1)^2$ of proton and antiprotons at given collision energy. However, the analysis of RHIC BES-I data reveals a remarkably strong splitting between scaled factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons, which is at odds with the expectation based on a single-fluid hydrodynamics picture. We argue that such a splitting indicates incomplete equilibration between stopped and produced matter, which can be further probed with upcoming high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II with extended acceptance coverage.",

          "description": "In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition [1]. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.\r\n\r\n1. J.M. Karthein, V. Koch, C. Ratti, arXiv:2409.13961, PRD (under review)",

          "description": "Introduction of a nonzero isospin chemical potential in QCD leads to the emergence of a pion condensed phase at sufficiently large $\\mu_I$, bounded by a second order transition line. At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\\mu_I = m_\\pi/2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition the pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\\mu_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.",

In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. The phase diagram is drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. \r\nOur results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that up to $\\mu_B \\approx 400$~MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\\mu_B$.",

          "description": "We study the influence of the QCD critical point on the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the lines of constant specific entropy (entropy per baryon) on the phase diagram are drawn towards a special point on the coexistence (first-order) line where the specific entropy reaches a maximum [1]. We study the interplay between this feature of the isentropic trajectories and the freezeout curve. If the critical point is located near the freezeout curve, a region inaccessible by isentropic expansion appears on the freezeout curve. This behavior of the isentropes could provide a novel, non-fluctuational signature of the critical point requiring significantly lower statistics than the fluctuational signatures. \r\n\r\n[1] Maneesha Sushama Pradeep, Noriyuki Sogabe, Mikhail Stephanov, and Ho-Ung Yee, Phys.

These lead to photon-induced interactions that have been observed in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), such as vector meson and lepton-pair production. The high photon flux also enables the occurrence of multiple photon-induced processes in a single collision.\r\nThis talk presents the first measurement of coincident production of $\\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and a $\\rho$ meson in UPC Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV and 5.36 TeV with ATLAS. Correlations between the di-muon system's properties, such as its mass, and the coincident $\\rho$ meson production rate, are also presented. These results can provide tighter constraints on photon fluxes and nuclear charge form factors, as well as insights into nuclear gluon PDFs, beyond those from inclusive $\\rho$ meson photoproduction.",

          "description": "Jet substructure measurements in heavy-ion collisions offer vital insights into the dynamics of jet quenching within the hot and dense QCD medium generated in these events. In this talk, we present new results from the ATLAS Collaboration on jet suppression and substructure using the Soft-Drop grooming technique in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02~\\mathrm{TeV}$. The study explores jet splitting across a broad range of angles for large-radius jets $R=1.0$, using charged particles to achieve high precision, providing access to small angular separations. This work unifies two previously published ATLAS analyses on small- and large-$R$ jets, providing a more comprehensive view of jet substructure. The degree of jet suppression is characterized by the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$, presented as a function of jet transverse momentum $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, the opening angle of the hardest internal splitting $r_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and the transverse momentum scale $\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{12}}}$. By comparing these results with theoretical models, we deepen our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms, explore the properties of the QCD medium, and challenge current theoretical frameworks in heavy-ion collisions.",

In this poster, we describe the jet trigger strategy and performance in the ATLAS experiment during LHC run 3. The performance of level 1 (L1) triggers used as seeds for high-level trigger (HLT) will be shown along with typical trigger rates. While performing the underlying event (UE) subtraction at the L1 trigger is challenging, the UE subtraction can be implemented at the HLT step. The strategy to perform the subtraction at the HLT and differences with respect to the online jet reconstruction are described. Performance of the HLT jet reconstruction in terms of energy scale, energy resolution, position resolution, and HLT reconstruction efficiency is shown and compared with typical performance obtained for offline jets. Performance is evaluated for various jet sizes and rapidity positions in the detector. Strategies to trigger on events with rare topologies are discussed, and typical trigger rates for various trigger strategies are summarized.",

          "description": "Understanding energy reconstruction in the forward rapidity region is crucial for the definition of collision centrality as well as for the measurements of jet suppression in the forward region. In this poster, we discuss the performance n the forward rapidity region of the ATLAS detector in 2023 and 2024 Pb+Pb data for both total energy reconstruction and jet reconstruction. Jet reconstruction performance is evaluated in terms of jet energy scale, jet energy resolution, jet position resolution, and jet reconstruction efficiency. The difference between the inclusive jet performance and forward jet performance is quantified. An important part of the ability to reconstruct jets is the trigger. We show the evaluation of the high-level trigger performance in the forward region in terms of trigger efficiency and the momentum difference between jets reconstructed using HLT and offline jets. Lastly, we describe the strategy to reconstruct total energy in the forward rapidity region and related performance. Contributions from various sources of background will also be discussed and the strategy to deal with them will be put forward.",

          "description": "LHC Run 4 will provide additional challenges in the already demanding field of charged particle track reconstruction. The Inner Detector of the ATLAS experiment will be replaced by an all-silicon inner tracker (ITk) that will consist of Pixels and Strips providing greater coverage in pseudorapidity spanning up to 8 units. The ACTS Common Tracking Software (ACTS) is the toolkit of choice that will be used to perform track reconstruction, and it is expected to meet the new challenges. The physics of heavy ions (HI) requires a different tracking setup as compared to $pp$ collisions. This is dictated by the difference in experimental conditions, where instead of a huge pile-up of 200 parasitic interactions per crossing in $pp$ collisions, the HI physics expects only one collision per bunch crossing. Despite this, a central lead ion collision produces a comparable number of tracks as to $pp$ collisions. The single vertex of the collision allows for optimizations and in other aspects makes the task more challenging. The poster discusses the progress in setting up the ACTS based track  reconstruction for HI in the ITk, shows a comparison between $pp$ and HI tracking performances, and presents the predicted performance of ACTS compared to the existing tracking algorithms used by ATLAS.",

Measurements of particles produced in photonuclear reactions can shed light on the QCD dynamics of these novel, extremely asymmetric colliding systems, with energies between those available at RHIC and the LHC. Previous studies by ATLAS have characterized photonuclear collisions through inclusive charged hadron measurements, and have observed elliptic and triangular flow coefficients in these events. This talk presents a measurement of charged hadron production and, for the first time, measurements of identified hadron yields in high-multiplicity photonuclear collisions using 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb data collected in 2018 by ATLAS, with a dedicated photo-nuclear event trigger.\r\n\r\nThe yields of charged hadrons and, for the first time, identified strange hadrons ($K^0_S$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Xi$) are shown differentially in rapidity, transverse momentum, and event multiplicity. These new results shed light on potential QGP formation in ultraperipheral collisions via observables sensitive to radial flow, enhanced baryon-to-meson ratios, and strangeness enhancement.  These results are compared to 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb data collected by ATLAS in 2016, at the same event multiplicities. The results are also compared with calculations from DPMJET and hydrodynamic-based models predicting flow even in these ultraperipheral collisions.",

We emphasize the structural similarities with Model G, conjectured to be the dynamic universality class of the chiral phase transition in the limit of two massless quark flavors. Importantly, our formulation of the real-time FRG preserves all relevant symmetries throughout the FRG flow which, e.g., guarantees the non-renormalization of the reversible mode couplings, as but one exact result. We derive non-perturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, Model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H. For Model G, we also extract a novel dynamic scaling function that describes the universal momentum and temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient of iso-vector and iso-axial charge densities in the symmetric phase.",

          "description": "We describe a unique formulation of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics based on the *density frame*. The equations of motion are strictly first order in time and have no non-hydrodynamic modes. The only fields are the energy and momentum densities $T^{0\\mu}$ and the only parameters are the equilibrium equation state and the shear and bulk viscosities. We compare numerical results to QCD kinetic theory simulations for a set of one dimensional tests -- we find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics, and the simulation is well behaved outside of this regime. The results are compared to a second-order formulation developed by Bemfica, Disconzi,  Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) as well as to second-order hydrodynamics as implemented in MUSIC.\r\n\r\nIn the density frame we propose a strikingly simple algorithm to simulate stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on the Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. Then random (three) momentum transfers between fluid cells are proposed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as the Boltzmann weight. On average the algorithm reproduces viscous hydrodynamics in the density-frame. The algorithm can be generalized to general coordinates and space-time foliations by parallel transporting the proposed momentum transfers.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nG. Basar, J. Bhambure, R.

          "description": "The effective kinetic theory of QCD provides a possible picture of various non-equilibrium processes in heavy- and light-ion collisions. While there have been substantial advances in simulating the EKT in simple systems with enhanced symmetry, eventually, event-by-event simulations will be required to test this physical picture. As of now, these simulations are prohibitively expensive due to the numerical complexity of the Monte Carlo evaluation of the collision kernels. In this talk, we show how the evaluation of the collision kernels can be performed using neural networks paving the way to full event-by-event simulations.",

          "description": "We develop a comprehensive analytic framework for jet quenching in QCD media, based on a medium-induced parton cascade sourced by collinear virtual splittings. We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, L. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\\ln(1/R)$, and $\\ln(R/\\theta_c)$, and powers of $L$. We briefly explore the limit of strong quenching, where analytic treatments are feasible, offering insights into the impact of parton cascades on jet quenching. These results provide guidance for future numerical simulations and analytical investigations.",

          "description": "Thermal fluctuations are a fundamental feature of dissipative systems that are essential for understanding physics near the expected critical point of QCD and in small systems. Such fluctuations can be modeled by including a stochastic source in the standard hydrodynamics equations. However, when this is done naively strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions [1–3]. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem [4], we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional [5]. For divergence type theories [6], the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. This generating current is related to the free energy, which allows for a systematic understanding the stability properties of the system. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques [7].\r\n\r\n[1] N. Mullins, M.

Specifically, we compute the QCD pressure and\r\nchemical potentials as functions of $n_B$ and $n_S$ and construct\r\nan equation of state. Our computations rely on\r\nhigh-statistics simulations with 2+1 4HEX-staggered fermions.",

          "description": "Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. The rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. Until now, hydrodynamic attractors have been studied only in monotonically expanding systems, e.g., Bjorken expansion. This work shows that a system undergoing an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel attractor behavior that resembles a limit cycle in dynamical systems. This phenomenon can be studied in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, which opens the way to the experimental discovery of hydrodynamic attractor phenomenon.\r\n\r\nRefs.:\r\n1.

          "description": "Diffractive vector meson production is a golden channel in the search for gluon saturation. The color glass condensate (CGC) framework has been successfully applied to describe diffractive vector meson production in $e+p$ collisions at HERA. Predictions for $\\gamma+Pb$ collisions realized in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC are however overestimating the experimental data at large center of mass energy, implying that the calculated saturation effects are not strong enough to describe the nuclear suppression. In this work we perform a combined Bayesian analysis of $J/\\psi$ production data from both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ collisions within the CGC framework based on an impact parameter dependent McLerran-Venugopalan model combined with JIMWLK evolution to describe the center of mass energy dependence. The combined fit confirms the challenges of the framework to describe both $\\gamma+p$ and $\\gamma+Pb$ data simultaneously hinting at shortcomings of the framework. We discuss major sources of uncertainty and suggest possible solutions including model extensions. We further present predictions for intermediate systems such as $\\gamma+O$ collisions whose measurement in UPCs could provide further insight into the $A$ dependence of the $J/\\psi$ production cross section.",

In this contribution, quarkonium measurements, along with new studies of charm pair production, will be discussed and compared with the latest theoretical models and with results from other experiments.

          "description": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, $J/\\psi$ photoproduction serves as a sensitive probe for studying the gluonic structure in heavy nuclei. Differential measurements of photon-induced $J/\\psi$ production provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations.   The linear polarization of photons involved in these processes enables imaging of the nucleus via spin interference effect in vector meson photoproduction, which  can be quantified by measuring the azimuthal angular modulation between the $J/\\psi$ momentum and its decay daughters' momenta.  Moreover,  the decay daughters of these vector mesons inherit polarization of the photons, which could be used to access the initial collision geometry.  Thus, measurement of differential cross sections of J/$\\psi$ photoproduction and the azimuthal anisotropy of their decay daughters offer a novel and direct probe into both the gluonic structure and the initial collision geometry.\r\n \r\n In this contribution, we will present the diﬀerential cross sections of photon-induced coherent $J/\\psi$  in  Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These cross-section measurements will also be compared with existing d+Au and Au+Au data to investigate system size dependencies.    Furthermore, we will report the azimuthal angular modulation measurements of the photon-induced $J/\\psi$ in isobaric UPCs. Finally, we will present the measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy  of electrons decayed from photon-induced  $J/\\psi$ with respect to the event plane  in non-central collisions from the same collision systems. Physics implications of these results will be discussed together with model comparisons.",

          "description": "The study of $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) offers a powerful probe of gluon dynamics in heavy nuclei. In UPCs, photons can interact with the nucleus coherently (involving the entire nucleus) or incoherently (with individual constituents). While coherent processes provide insight into the average gluon density, incoherent photoproduction is uniquely sensitive to the local gluon density fluctuations at both nucleonic or subnucleonic levels. In this talk, we present the first energy-dependent measurement of the incoherent $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ photoproduction cross section in PbPb UPCs at the LHC with the CMS experiment. Employing forward neutron tagging technique, we explore a wide photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy range from 40 to 400 GeV, probing fluctuating gluon fields over a broad Bjorken-$x$ range of $x <10^{-4}$. Furthermore, we report the cross section ratio of incoherent to coherent $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ production and evaluate the nuclear suppression factor for the incoherent production as a function of $x$. By comparing state-of-the-art theoretical predictions, these results offer unique insights into gluon fluctuations and have important implications for understanding nuclear gluon distributions and saturation phenomena.",

          "description": "In this talk, we present the first measurement of $\\mathrm{D}^0$ photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) using the data collected by CMS experiment during 2023 PbPb collisions at LHC. The measured production cross sections are presented as a function of the $\\mathrm{D}^0$ transverse momentum (2$< p_{T} <$12 GeV/c) and rapidity (-2< y <2). Additionally, we will present new results from a much larger data sample from 2024 PbPb UPCs, which could significantly improve the data precision and extend the measurements to zero $p_T$. The results are compared to theoretical calculations that exploit different modeling of the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and provide new constraints into the properties of nuclear matter at low x down to $x~10^{-4}$ and for Q^2 ranging from O(10) to O(100) GeV$^2$, in absence of significant final-state effects.",

          "description": "The ultraperipheral collisions are a source of various interesting phenomena based on photon-induced reactions. We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$ in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies emitted in forward/backward directions. We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment [1] using zero degree calorimeters, for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which $E_{exc} \\neq E_{\\gamma}$ and compare its results with the results of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. We discuss the role of preequilibrium and equilibrium processes. In addition we analyze the role of scattering of high-energy photons for small neutron multiplicities. Emission of the small number of neutrons at high (virtual) photon energies ($E_{\\gamma} >$ 1 GeV) seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section for four- and five-neutron emission is rather difficult. Several open issues will be discussed. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.

          "description": "In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, the charged ions produce an intense flux of equivalent photons. Photon-induced processes are the dominant interaction mechanism when the colliding nuclei have an impact parameter larger than the nuclear diameter. In these ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), the photon provides a clean, energetic probe of the partonic structure of the nucleus, analogous to deep inelastic scattering. This talk presents a measurement of jet production in UPCs performed with the ATLAS detector using high-statistics 2018 Pb+Pb data. Events are selected using requirements on jet production, rapidity gaps, and forward neutron emission to identify inclusive photo-nuclear hard-scattering processes. These measurements also include detailed studies of rapidity gap distributions and nuclear break-up effects, allowing for precise comparisons between data and theory for inclusive photo-nuclear processes. The measured cross-sections are compared to theoretical models in phase-space regions where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected but not well constrained by world data, demonstrating the potential of these data to provide a strong new constraint on nPDF effects.",

          "description": "The fully stripped ions used in heavy ion collisions at the LHC are an excellent source of high-energy quasi-real photons.  These can interact with photons emitted by the oncoming nucleus, or with the nucleus itself, either directly in inelastic processes or diffractively via pomeron exchange.  Diffractive photonuclear processes can produce exclusive vector mesons that are uniquely sensitive to the spatial and momentum structure of the nuclear parton distribution functions, as well as spatial fluctuations (hotspots).  In Run 3, the ATLAS experiment utilized a low-multiplicity track trigger in heavy ions for the first time, allowing the collection of a large sample of events with a few tracks.  A substantial fraction of these are sensitive to dilepton decays of vector mesons, including the $J/\\psi$.  First results on $J/\\psi$ yields, in association with various topologies of forward neutron emission will be presented using the widest continuous rapidity range available at the LHC.  Discussion of important backgrounds from dissociative and multiple-UPC processes will also be provided.",

          "description": "In an ultra-peripheral collision, where the impact parameter is larger than the sum of the nuclear radii, the nuclei mainly interact electromagnetically. These reactions are mediated by virtual photons. A photon can interact with a gluon in the target nucleus and produce a pair of charm quarks. These charm quarks then fragment and are observed as open charm hadrons ($\\rm D^{0}$, $\\rm D^{∗} (2010)^{\\pm}$ etc.) or vector mesons (J/ψ and ψ(2S)). This process has been used in e-p collisions to set stringent limits on the proton gluon distribution at low-$x$. The current measurements can provide similar constraints on the much less known nuclear gluon distributions. The cross sections and transverse momentum distributions for D mesons and J/ψ measured in ALICE will be presented. The results will be compared with model calculations.",

          "description": "The event-by-event shapes of colliding nuclei are imprinted on flow patterns measured in relativistic heavy-ion collisions because of the strong hydrodynamic response to collision geometry. In this work, we perform high-statistics simulations to study the impacts of nuclear structure on the ratios of anisotropic flow observables between different collision systems. We study $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and find the ratios of anisotropic flow in the same centrality class between the two collision systems to be strongly affected by the nuclear structure inputs in the initial state, providing a novel opportunity to probe the deformed nuclear geometry at very high energies [1]. The ratios of $v_2\\{4\\}/v_2\\{2\\}$ in these collisions are sensitive to the nuclear skin thickness of the colliding nuclei, providing indirect constraints on the nuclei’s neutron skin. We will also highlight the unique opportunities at the upcoming fixed-target SMOG2 experiments at the LHCb. With input from ab initio calculations of the structure of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne, we compute 3+1D hydrodynamic predictions for the anisotropic flow of Pb+Ne and Pb+O collisions to be tested with upcoming LHCb data. Elliptic flow in Pb+Ne collisions is significantly enhanced compared to the Pb+O baseline due to the shape of $^{20}$Ne, which is deformed in a bowling pin geometry [2]. These studies open a new and emerging avenue for synergy between the nuclear structure and heavy-ion communities, advancing the precision era of relativistic nuclear collisions.\r\n \r\n[1] H.

          "description": "The semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) and Drell-Yan (DY) processes are primary channels for studying the parton distributions of the proton and the nucleus, and for deducing the properties of cold nuclear matter. However, for nuclear targets, the DY and SIDIS differential cross-sections are modified by multiple interactions between the active parton and spectator nucleons, which we refer to as dynamical nuclear effects. Only recently have theoretical developments allowed us to understand these processes in the nuclear environment from first principles. We present the complete calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) dynamical nuclear corrections to the longitudinal and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) cross-sections in both reactions using the Soft Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons. The main result that this talk focuses on is the first TMD analysis of the nuclear SIDIS and DY data that incorporates these dynamical effects.  We show for the first time medium-induced renormalization group (RG) equations improved to second order in opacity to estimate the truncation uncertainty and a rapidity RG (a Blaitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov evolution) applied in the initial state for DY and the final state for SIDIS. We discuss the implications of the new theoretical analysis for the interpretation of existing data, and for the physics program of the future EIC.",

          "description": "Subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state of heavy-ion collisions impact not only transverse long-range correlations of small systems, but also the creation of longitudinal structures, measured in longitudinal decorrelation observables [1]. In this work, we study the emergence of long-range rapidity correlations in nuclear collisions due to the inclusion of event-by-event subnuclear fluctuations in the initial state, by using the 3D resolved McDIPPER for the initial state of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], and for the first time, we connect it to 3D phenomenology by evolving through a full hybrid evolution, including a pre-equilibrium stage, using the novel KøMPøST with charges [3], 3+1D viscous hydrodynamical evolution [4], and hadronic rescattering [5]. We present new results, focusing on the effect of sub-nuclear hotspots and (sub) nuclear thickness fluctuations on the longitudinal structure of observables, such as the flow decorrelations and directed flow. We include phenomenological results for large systems (Pb-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV) as well as predictions for the upcoming O+O and Ne+Ne runs ($\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=6.8$ TeV) at the LHC.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] U.

          "description": "The six-hour Xe-129 run at the LHC has produced a remarkable wealth of physics, among which several studies of its nuclear shape. Previous works indicate that the elliptic flow ratio with Pb-208 collisions determines the quadrupole deformation ($\\beta_2$) of Xe, while the $\\rho_2$ elliptic flow-mean $p_T$ correlator informs us about the so-called triaxiality ($\\gamma$). In this work, we go one step further and perform a global Bayesian analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb data at the LHC varying simultaneously the shapes of Xe, Pb and relevant Trajectum model parameters. This allows us to systematically assess the sensitivity of observables or ratio of observables to the shape of both Pb (in particular its neutron skin) and Xe (in particular $\\beta_2$, its octupole $\\beta_3$, $\\gamma$ and its skin). Our Bayesian extractions lead to a picture for the ground states of these nuclei that is in remarkable agreement with complementary results using methods in low-energy nuclear structure physics. We comment on implications of the analysis of the shapes of other nuclei via future LHC experiments, with particular focus on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double beta decay searches.",

          "description": "The shape and orientation of colliding nuclei play a crucial role in determining the initial conditions of the QGP formed in central collisions, which influence key observables such as anisotropic and radial flow. For instance, central collisions of near-spherical Au nuclei create a QGP with a fixed, circular geometry, whereas prolate-shaped uranium nuclei can collide in a variety of orientations, producing QGP droplets of diverse shapes and sizes. Hence, by comparing systems with similar mass numbers, such as $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au, we can map out their shape differences and gain deeper insights into the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_2$, $p_T$ fluctuations, and\r\n$v_2 - p_T$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions. Our results reveal large differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in central events. A comparison with hydrodynamic model calculations indicates a large deformation in uranium nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry in the ground states of the colliding $^{238}$U nuclei [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales. The potential applications of this method for other nuclear species are explored.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, Nature 635, 67-72 (2024), https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08097-2",

          "description": "Xenon (Xe) nuclei are deformed and have a non-zero quadrupole moment, whereas lead (Pb) nuclei are considered spherical in shape. The study of Xe-Xe collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.44$ TeV opens up a window to study nuclear deformation at LHC. When compared to Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$ TeV, one can explore the dependence of the Fourier flow harmonics ($v_{n}$) on the size and initial-state geometry of the colliding systems. For the first time, correlations between higher-order moments ($\\langle v_{n}^{k}v_{m}^{l}\\rangle$, where $n,m = 2,3,4$ and $k,l = 2,4,6$) between two ($v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ or $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$) or even three flow harmonics ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$) are measured and compared between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions as a function of collision centrality. These new measurements have been calculated with multiparticle mixed harmonic cumulants (upto 8th order) using charged particles in the wide pseudorapidity region of the CMS detector ($|\\mathrm{\\eta}| < 2.4$) and in the transverse momentum range of $0.5 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 3.0$ GeV/c. The results have also been compared to several theoretical model predictions. The observables measured in this analysis have been used to closely probe the non-linearities between $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ and their corresponding eccentricities $\\epsilon_{2}$, $\\epsilon_{3}$ and $\\epsilon_{4}$. This not only helps us to constrain the deformation parameters of Xe nuclei, but can also significantly constrain initial-state model parameters and give us a better understanding of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at LHC.",

In such studies, it is possible to investigate, with a highest precision, the shadowing, anti-shadowing and EMC effects. In this talk, the first measurement of dijet average pseudorapidity measurements in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV in the widest dijet transverse momentum ranges will be presented with the data samples collected with CMS at the LHC.

          "description": "We include the perturbative JIMWLK energy evolution into the IP-Glasma initial state description used to simulate the early-time dynamics in heavy ion collisions. By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. This enables us to predict how the initial state evolves when moving from RHIC to LHC energies. [1]\r\n\r\nPreviously, the energy dependence in IP-Glasma was introduced through a Bjorken-$x$ dependent saturation scale extracted from fits to DIS structure data. In contrast, in our work we move beyond this parametrized approximation by providing a method to directly calculate the energy dependence. The energy-dependent initial state description is then coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics in the quark-gluon plasma phase and to the UrQMD hadronic afterburner, enabling us to simulate the full space-time evolution in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate that incorporating the JIMWLK evolution significantly affects various flow observables.\r\n\r\nThe JIMWLK evolution applied in this work is constrained by the available $\\mathrm{J}/\\psi$ production data from HERA and from Ultra Peripheral Collisions at the LHC [2]. In addition to the JIMWLK-evolved initial state description, we determine an effective energy-dependent parametrization describing the energy-dependent nucleon structure, which can approximate the effect of JIMWLK evolution in IP-Glasma, enabling faster simulations.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] H.

Based on the Color Glass Condensate effective field theory, where the gluonic interactions between the large Bjorken-x, static sources localized in the colliding nuclei are described by classical Yang-Mills equations, I will present remarkably simple, analytic solutions for the Glasma field strength tensor by linearizing the Yang-Mills equations for weak sources. I will discuss our results for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC and Au+Au collisions at RHIC energies using a generalized three-dimensional McLerran-Venugopalan nuclear model with parametrized longitudinal correlations inside the nucleus. I will also discuss pA collisions using an advanced nuclear model with individual quark hot spots focusing on rapidity-dependent factorization breakdown and event plane fluctuations.\r\n\r\n[1] Ipp, A., Leuthner, M., Müller, D.

          "description": "It has recently been widely acknowledged that the initial stages are important for correctly describing jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, the initial stages influence the emission spectrum of hard partons traversing the plasma. Such calculations require the knowledge of the momentum-broadening kernel $C$, which describes the probability of a jet parton receiving a momentum kick. While it is often employed in a harmonic approximation using the jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, in this talk, I will present our results for the kernel $C$ from QCD kinetic theory beyond this approximation. We show that the kernel is consistent with previous extractions of $\\hat q$ and find that it is highly anisotropic at early times and that small-momentum exchange processes are more likely than expected from a Landau-matched thermal system. Our results may lead to a better description of jet quenching during the initial stages, which can be particularly significant for the ongoing and upcoming light-ion collision programs.",

          "description": "We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model, MC-EKRT, for computing partonic initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions [1]. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies [2,3]. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent fluctuating nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. We show, by averaging a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions for 3+1 dimensional hydrodynamical evolution, that we obtain a good agreement with the rapidity-dependent multiplicity and elliptic flow data for LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. This suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has successfully explained the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities. As a further application of MC-EKRT, we also study event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Kuha, J. Auvinen, K. J. Eskola, H. Hirvonen, Y. Kanakubo, H.

          "description": "The second-order shape phase transition of the Xe isotope chain, predicted to lie around $^{128}\\text{Xe}$ to $^{130}$Xe, is challenging to measure in low-energy nuclear experiments. Recently, heavy-ion collisions have demonstrated their potential as an imaging tool for nuclear structure by examining anisotropic flow and its correlations with the mean transverse momentum. Hints of a triaxial structure in $^{129}$Xe have been found experimentally and theoretically using these methods; however, these studies were limited to exploring the first moment of the $\\gamma$ distribution and could not distinguish between a rigid rotor and $\\gamma$-soft nuclei. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, a comprehensive study of the quadrupole deformation, nuclear diffuseness, and triaxial structure of $^{129}$Xe is presented through investigations of various anisotropic flow and mean transverse momentum observables. Additionally, the $\\gamma$-soft structure of the $^{129}$Xe nuclei is investigated experimentally for the first time in heavy-ion collisions using a novel six-particle normalized cumulant, $ NC(v_2^4, \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2) $, which correlates the fourth moment of the elliptic flow, $ v_2^4$, with the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, $ \\delta p_{\\rm T}^2 $. This correlation is measured in Xe–Xe collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV  against the baseline of spherical Pb nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Comparisons with calculations from state-of-the-art models, both with and without fluctuating shape parameters, provide a high-precision probe of the nuclear structure of $^{129}$Xe and facilitate the discovery of the nuclear shape phase transition.",

          "description": "Short-range correlations among hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion experiments are typically regarded as non-hydrodynamic and subtracted from the data. However, the fluid nature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) gives rise to short-range correlations stemming from hydrodynamic fluctuations. These correlations, driven by fluctuation-dissipation relations near local equilibrium, provide key insights into the transport properties of the QGP and can become particularly significant in the vicinity of the QCD critical region.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present a theoretical framework for calculating two-particle correlations of charged hadrons. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we first derive an evolution equation for four-point functions of fields in complex scalar field theory. This equation can be interpreted using the Boltzmann-Langevin Equation (BLE), which  predicts the two-particle correlations in momentum space amongst the charges of a conducting fluid.  Our results demonstrate how measuring these short-range charge correlations in heavy ion collisions can constrain the transport properties of the QGP in detail.",

          "description": "The three-dimensional structure of the initial state in heavy-ion collisions have become important topic of interest in the community, since it provides insights into the origins of anisotropic flow, the breaking of boost invariance, longitudinal de-correlation, and particle correlations observed after kinetic freeze-out. One of the important properties of the 3D initial state is the tilt of the particle-emitting source away from the beam direction—a phenomenon particularly pronounced at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This tilt, rooted in the initial collision geometry’s three-dimensional structure, is relevant for understanding phenomena such as directed flow and particle polarization. However, a direct extraction of tilt from such measurements remains challenging.\r\n\r\nBy employing azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT), we explore the relationship between the tilt parameter measured experimentally and the predicted tilt of freeze-out coordinates from UrQMD model  [1]. This approach allows us to investigate the tilt of the pion-emitting source in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.5, and 27 GeV using asHBT techniques. \r\n\r\nWhile tilt might naively be expected to correlate strongly only with collision centrality, our findings indicate a more pronounced dependence on the momentum of particle pairs. This momentum dependence invites a reevaluation of directed flow: rather than attributing it to a uniform tilt of the emission source, we propose that distinct regions of homogeneity with varying orientations may underlie these observations.\r\n\r\nOur approach offers a framework that the STAR experiment can employ to perform a precision extraction of tilt using the high-statistics BES-II data—measurements of which are currently underway and whose prospects we discuss here. By accurately determining tilt angles across different particle types and momenta, we aim to provide a more precise description of directed flow across species and momenta. This method offers a potentially clearer and more detailed framework for understanding directed flow and other phenomena influenced by the three-dimensional initial state.\r\n\r\n[1] Yevheniia Khyzhniak and Michael Annan Lisa. “Pair momentum depen-\r\ndence of tilted source in heavy ion collisions”.

The two-particle correlation in pair relative momentum, which reveals valuable information about the space-time evolution of the particle-emitting source and final state interactions involving hyperons, is the primary observable of interest. The measurements of correlations between light nuclei ($d$, $t$, $^{3}He$) and $\\Lambda$ can shed light on internal structure and binding energy of hypernuclei as well as the many-body interactions among hyperon and nucleons which are important for understanding the inner structure and equation of state of neutron stars.\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurement of $\\it d$-$\\Lambda$, $\\it t$-$\\Lambda$ and $^{3}He$-$\\Lambda$ correlations with high statistics data of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions from the STAR Beam Energy Scan II. The correlation functions are analyzed within the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism in order to characterize the emission source size, the scattering length, and the effective range of light nuclei-$\\Lambda$ interactions. The extracted parameters will be compared to those from other baryon correlations and various effective theory model calculations. Finally, physics implications on final state interactions involving hyperons and the inner structure of the light hypernuclei will be discussed.",

          "description": "Measurements of identical pion femtoscopy offer insights into collision dynamics, such as collective expansion, geometry of the collision zone at freeze-out, etc. In addition to the quantum interference among the pion pairs, Coulomb interactions between the pair and the net positive charge in the emitting source affect the final measurements as well. Furthermore, due to the imbalance of protons and neutrons inside the colliding nuclei, initial isospin, which also affects the correlation functions, plays an important role in determining the Equation of State of the medium in collisions at high baryon density.  \r\n\r\nTo extract the effect of the isospin, a systematic analysis of the identical charged pion correlations from $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 4.5, 5.2, 7.7 GeV Au+Au collisions collected by the STAR experiment has been carried out. A new procedure has been developed to remove the residual effect from the 3rd-body Coulomb force and to extract the contribution from isospin. In this talk, we will report collision energy dependence of the source size parameters extracted from the positive and negative charged pion correlation functions after removing the 3rd-body Coulomb effect. Transport model UrQMD calculations with realistic experimental cuts will be used to aid the discussions.",

          "description": "This presentation discusses recent results on femtoscopic correlations involving $D^0$ ($\\bar{D0}$) mesons and hyperon polarization in pPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV. The femtoscopic measurements investigate the strong interaction for pair combinations of particles, allowing to extract the scattering observables accessible through their correlation functions. The results may contribute to the search for new exotic bound states of matter, such as molecular states arising from strong interactions. The results for charged hadrons produced in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV will also be discussed, in which the Levy-type of sources are employed to extract the correlation strength parameter \\lambda, the Levy index \\alpha, and the Levy scale parameter $R$, as a function of the pair transverse mass $m_T$, for various centrality ranges. In addition, the first measurements of $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ particles’ local polarization in pPb collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 8.16$ will be presented. These results pose a challenge to the current theoretical implementation of spin polarization in heavy ion collisions and offer new insights into the origin of spin polarization in hadronic collisions at LHC energies.",

          "description": "The D-measure of the event-by-event net charge fluctuations was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, based on the fractional charges of quarks leading to suppression of fluctuations relative to hadron gas baseline. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios, the conclusion has been elusive. \r\n\r\nHere, we employ a recently developed formalism of density correlations to incorporate the effects of resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematical cuts to perform quantitative calculations of charge fluctuations in central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced. On the other hand, the QGP scenario predictions show small sensitivity to the range of local charge conservation and yield excellent agreement with experimental data. We present predictions for LHC Run 2 as a precision test of the two scenarios.",

          "description": "The observation of long-range correlations is a crucial indicator of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions and has been instrumental in establishing the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at RHIC and LHC. In this study, the first direct measurement of radial flow is presented using a new observable, $ v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T}) $, formulated to capture the long-range correlations in the transverse momentum $ p_{\\rm T} $ spectrum. Unlike anisotropic flow coefficients $ v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T}) $, which are influenced by both shear and bulk viscosity, $v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T}) $ is sensitive solely to the bulk properties of the QGP medium, making it a valuable probe for studying bulk viscosity and the hydrodynamic evolution of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of $ v_{\\rm 0}(p_{\\rm T})$ is reported across various centrality classes for inclusive charged particles and identified particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector. To minimize short-range non-flow correlations, a rapidity gap technique similar to that used in anisotropic flow measurements is employed. At low $p_{\\rm T}$, characteristic mass ordering, typically associated with collective flow in $v_{\\rm n}(p_{\\rm T})$, is observed. At higher $ p_{\\rm T} $, where hydrodynamic descriptions fail, a baryon-meson splitting indicative of quark coalescence is observed. Measurements are compared with the hydrodynamic model MUSIC under varied initial conditions, as well as non-hydrodynamic models like HIJING and EPOS.",

          "description": "The interactions between Λ hyperons and nucleons are of crucial importance for understanding the composition of the inner core of neutron stars. The equation of state for these dense objects requires accurate knowledge of two- and three-body interactions at short distances, which remain poorly constrained by existing experimental data. ALICE has introduced a novel approach for probing these interactions by measuring femtoscopic correlation functions of particles emitted at distances of 1–2 fm in high-energy pp collisions. This technique enables the study of various hadron–nucleus pairs and provides, for the first time, direct access to the 3 → 3 free scattering process. \r\nIn this talk, ALICE measurements of p–d, p–p–p, and p–p–Λ correlation functions in proton-proton\r\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV, obtained using three-body software triggers, will be presented. These results offer a fifteenfold increase in the statistical sample compared to Run 2. Additionally, the corresponding first-ever measurement of Λ–d pairs in proton-proton collisions will be showcased. The measured correlation functions will be compared with theoretical predictions, highlighting their sensitivity to the dynamics of three-body systems.",

          "description": "Studies of strong interactions between hadrons provide a valuable opportunity to test Quantum Chromodynamics at nucleon-scale distances. The femtoscopy technique has proven to be an effective tool for studying interactions between unstable hadrons by measuring the correlation function of hadron pairs in momentum space. This approach offers insights into the interaction between two hadrons, based on the spatial extension of the emitting source. While several measurements of residual strong interactions between light and strange hadrons have been conducted using this technique, studies of charm hadrons have been limited. These studies can shed light on the formation of exotic charm states or, in case of baryons, nuclei with charm content.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present measurements of residual strong interaction between charm hadrons and light-flavor hadrons using the femtoscopy technique. The final results on the correlation functions and residual strong interactions between D mesons and light mesons measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV will be discussed. Additionally, new studies of correlations between $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$ and protons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, utilizing the new data samples collected from LHC Run 3, will be presented.",

          "description": "Dibaryons, exotic states composed of six quarks, have long been a subject of interest in understanding the strong interaction beyond conventional hadrons. Among these, strange dibaryons, which contain strange quarks, offer an important role of studying the hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-hyperon ($YY$) interactions . Of particular interest are the spin-0 $H$ ($S$ = -2) and the spin-2 $N\\Omega$ ($S$ = -3) dibaryon state, which are considered promising candidates for the strange dibaryon bound state. In heavy-ion collisions, two-particle femtoscopy is a powerful and unique method for extracting information about the spatio-temporal properties of the source, characterising the final state interactions (FSI), and searching for the possible bound states.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the measurements of baryon-baryon correlation functions, including $p$-$\\Xi^{-}$, $\\Lambda$-$\\Lambda$ and $p$-$\\Omega^{-}$ pairs, in Isobar collisions (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The correlation functions are analyzed within the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism. The extracted scattering length and effective range will be presented. Those measured parameters will be compared with recent Lattice QCD and effective theory model calculations. Most importantly, the physics implications for the formation of strange dibaryon ($S=-2$ and $S=-3$) bound state will be discussed.",

          "description": "Event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[p_T]$ have been measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, but this topic has so far received less attention than anisotropic flow. Yet the physical mechanism is identical for both phenomena: A long-range correlation in the initial stages, followed by collective expansion. While the origin of anisotropic flow is a fluctuation in the shape of the fireball, that of $[p_T]$ fluctuations is a fluctuation in the initial temperature. It generates a fluctuation in the fluid velocity, which is carried over to the $p_T$ spectrum of outgoing particles. The same fluctuation is present at all rapidities and generates a long-range correlation. \r\n\r\nWe make hydrodynamic predictions for the fluctuation of the spectrum, which is a new observable $v_0(p_T)$ introduced by Schenke, Shen and Teaney [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00690] which has not yet been measured, and for which first experimental results will hopefully be shown at this conference. Like anisotropic flow $v_n(p_T)$, $v_0(p_T)$ is predicted to have a strong mass ordering in the $p_T$ range where hydrodymamics applies. We show that our hydrodynamic calculation reproduces precisely the observed dependence of $[p_T]$ fluctuations on $p_T$ cuts which has previously been observed by PHENIX and ATLAS. We argue that the mechanism of quark coalescence should give rise to a splitting between the $v_0(p_T)$ of baryons and mesons at higher $p_T$, similar to that observed for anisotropic flow.\r\n\r\nBased on Parida, Samanta, Ollitrault, Phys.Lett.B 857 (2024) 138985 [2407.17313].",

Its primary goals are to study the onset of deconfinement and to search for the critical point within this type of matter. To accomplish these objectives, the program conducts scans over a range of beam momenta (from 13A to 150A/158A GeV/c) and system sizes, involving collisions such as p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, and Pb+Pb. Achieving these goals necessitates a diverse array of measurements.\r\nIn this contribution, we present final results on how multiplicity and net-charge fluctuations depend on system size and energy, analyzed using higher-order moments by comparing p+p and Ar+Sc most central interactions. The results take into account detector bias and centrality selection in the case of Ar+Sc. The results are compared across different energies, as well as against model predictions.",

          "description": "Constraining the initial conditions of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) remains a key challenge in the study of heavy-ion collisions. Recent hydrodynamic model studies suggest that event-wise mean transverse momentum ($[p_\\mathrm{T}]$) is sensitive to the overlap area, and that fluctuations in nuclear overlap size (geometric component) can be distinguished from other sources (intrinsic component) using higher-order moments of the $[p_\\mathrm{T}]$ distribution.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents precise ATLAS measurements of the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of $[p_\\mathrm{T}]$ in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions, highlighting distinct patterns in ultra-central collisions due to suppression of the geometric component as the overlap area reaches its maximum.New measurements exploring the dependence of these observables on momentum and pseudorapidity ranges are also presented. They probe the decorrelations of radial flow fluctuations in the transverse and longitudinal directions, as well as test the robustness of the extraction of QGP's speed-of-sound. These results offer new insights into the initial conditions and properties of the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Experimental information on the strong interaction between $\\Sigma$ hyperons and protons is a crucial input for both the description of the equation of state of neutron stars with hyperon content and theoretical predictions regarding potential $\\Sigma$-hypernuclei. Data on this interaction are scarce, solely based on scattering experiments. Since data points are only available at rather high relative momenta and their uncertainties are sizeable, theory calculations are not well constrained. Particularly the characteristics of the interaction in the triplet channel spin configuration are highly uncertain, and it is not yet clear if the interaction in this channel is attractive or repulsive. In this regard, two-particle intensity interferometry (femtoscopy) of $\\Sigma$ baryons and nucleons can provide valuable information. \r\nThe reconstruction of the weak decay of $\\Sigma^+$ baryons is very challenging. Its decay into a proton and a neutral pion via the weak interaction has a branching ratio of around 50%, with the neutral pion decaying electromagnetically almost exclusively into two photons. In this talk, a novel reconstruction method will be shown which makes use of sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve the reconstruction efficiency and purity of the $\\Sigma^+$ baryons, enabling the measurement of their correlation function with protons for the first time. The obtained correlation function will be discussed and related to latest theoretical calculations using Chiral Effective Field Theories, providing new constraints on the $\\Sigma$–nucleon interaction.",

          "description": "Over the past several years, significant progress has been made in leveraging rapidity-dependent measurements from colliders to gain insight about the early and late-time dynamics of relativistic nuclear collisions. In this study, we perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using simulations of Au-Au and $d$-Au collisions and a broad range of measurements from the PHENIX, STAR, PHOBOS, and BRAHMS Collaborations spanning nearly two decades of RHIC operations. In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner [1]. We calibrate on rapidity- and pT-differential observables–examining the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties–and highlight the tension between them within our model. We quantify the additional constraints provided by rapidity dependent measurements and we emphasize the similarity in posteriors from separate calibrations of large and small systems. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in additional smaller systems in $p$-Au and $^3$He-Au, as well as statistically-sensitive or proposed measurements in the calibrated systems. Furthermore, we predict longitudinal de-correlations, highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference.\r\n\r\n[1] C. Shen and B.

          "description": "sPHENIX is a next-generation collider detector at RHIC which was successfully commissioned in 2023 and 2024 and took physics data in p+p and Au+Au collisions. In addition to its high-p$_T$ jet and heavy flavor physics program, sPHENIX is a general purpose collider detector with excellent capabilities for exploring collective phenomena in small and large systems. This is due to its large pseudorapidity and full-azimuth acceptance, dedicated forward detectors such as the sPHENIX Event Plane Detector (sEPD), and large data samples collected in RHIC Run-24. This talk presents new measurements of collective phenomena in Au+Au collisions using the sEPD, and in p+p collisions through two-particle correlation and cumulant methods. These measurements can help shed light on the nature of collective behavior at RHIC energies, especially in small systems, with a greatly expanded statistical and kinematic reach.",

          "description": "Measurements at the LHC have provided evidence for collective behavior in high-multiplicity pp and pPb collisions through multiparticle correlation techniques. However, no conclusive evidence of jet quenching—characterized by the energy loss of high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ partons traversing the medium—have been observed in these smaller systems. This paradox raises an intriguing question: How can a medium that exhibits hydrodynamic-like behavior and substantially modifies the distribution of final-state hadrons have little to no effect on high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles? To explore this, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$) as a function of particle transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) and event multiplicity in pp and pPb collisions, recorded by CMS at 13 TeV and 8.16 TeV, respectively. In particular, first measurements of $p_\\mathrm{T}$-differential multiparticle cumulants using the subevent method are reported, probing an extended phase space region up to high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ values. Furthermore, we compare the results across pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions within similar multiplicity ranges. This comparison will help assess similarities and differences in the medium's interaction with high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles in these three collision types.",

          "description": "Recent CMS data revealed intriguing long-range correlations within high-multiplicity jets produced in proton-proton collisions, suggesting the potential onset of collective behavior, typically associated with heavy-ion collisions, at much smaller scales. Two-particle correlations in the “jet frame” show a surprising rise in elliptic flow harmonics, v2*, at large pseudorapidity separations (Δη* > 2), in jets with high charged-particle multiplicities, a trend not reproduced by event generators like Pythia and Sherpa. In this talk, we present the transverse momentum and ∆η* dependence of elliptic and triangular flow, across a wide range of jet multiplicity and transverse momentum. We further explore the role of jet substructure in driving the observed long-range azimuthal correlations, examining its potential connection to the geometry of the initial-state jet system. Recent LHC studies also show signs of collectivity in high-multiplicity photonuclear collisions, where a quasi-real photon from one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus. In this talk, we also present new CMS measurements of two- and multi-particle correlations from photonuclear collisions using PbPb data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.36$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3. By leveraging the full detector acceptance, we explore wide pseudorapidity gaps up to 7–8 units, which significantly reduces non-collective contributions and enhances the search for long-range near-side ridge effects. Elliptic and triangular azimuthal anisotropies are extracted as functions of particle transverse momentum and event multiplicity.",

          "description": "We find a remarkable universality in the experimentally observed transverse momentum spectra in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions, obtained by removing the global scales of total particle number and mean transverse momentum. This scaling behavior breaks down at large transverse momentum and for very small systems, such as those produced in p-p collisions. We further demonstrate that this universal scaling behavior is compatible with hydrodynamic predictions and, thus, may indicate the onset of a hydrodynamic regime. Our results pave the way for further theoretical and experimental investigations of this novel scaling phenomenon to bring to light the collective and non-collective behavior encoded in the transverse particle spectrum of different collision systems.\r\nThis presentation is based on 2406.15208.",

          "description": "Heavy quarks (i.e. charm and beauty) are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Although they are initially produced out of kinetic equilibrium via hard partonic scattering processes, recent measurements of the anisotropic flow of charmed hadrons pose the question regarding the possible thermalization of heavy quarks in the medium. By exploiting a mapping between transport theory and hydrodynamics [1], we developed a fluid-dynamic description of heavy-quark diffusion in the QCD plasma. We will present results for transverse momentum distributions and integrated yields of charm and beauty hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic code coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current in the QGP. We will show that our calculations are in agreement with the experimental measurements in Pb-Pb collisions [2,3] and provide new predictions for Ne-Ne and O-O collisions.\r\nThis work is funded via the DFG ISOQUANT Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1225).\r\n[1] Phys.Rev.D 106 (2022) 3, 034021\r\n[2] Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 11, 116011\r\n[3] Capellino, Dubla, Facen, Floerchinger, Grossi, Kirchner, Masciocchi, in preparation",

          "description": "Particle correlations are powerful tools for studying quantum chromodynamics in hadron collisions. In heavy-ion collisions, azimuthal angular correlations probe collective phenomena in hot, dense, nuclear media, such as QGP. In small collision systems, they could point to final-state effects or potential initial-state correlations. The LHCb experiment has the unique ability to study particle correlations in high-energy hadron collisions at forward rapidity, exploring a unique region with respect to other experiments, where longitudinal expansion becomes more important. In this contribution, recent results on collective flow from the LHCb experiment will be discussed",

          "description": "Anisotropic flow characterizes the shape and direction of expansion of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. The Fourier coefficients in the expansion of particle azimuthal distribution describe the collective response of the medium to the shape of the initial collision geometry, \r\nand are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS). A non-monotonic slope in the first-order flow coefficient $v_1$ (directed flow) is proposed as a potential signature of a first-order phase transition between the QGP and hadronic phase. The second-order coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow) exhibits NCQ scaling at top RHIC and LHC energies, reflecting partonic collectivity, but this scaling vanishes at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV. The third-order coefficient $v_3$ (triangular flow) is typically driven by initial-state fluctuations and is uncorrelated with the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies reveal a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\\Psi_{1}$), attributed to collision geometry and the potential in the responsive medium.\\\\\r\n\\indent In this talk, we will report the measurements of $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3\\{\\Psi_{1}\\}$ for light, strange, multi-strange, net-particles, and light nuclei in Au+Au collisions. These measurements span energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.2 -- 4.5 GeV in fixed-target mode, as well as 7.7 -- 19.6 GeV in collider mode, from the second phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR. We will present the precise measurements of $v_2$ for $\\phi$ mesons and multi-strange hadrons, along with the energy dependence of NCQ scaling. The presented results aim to shed light on the onset of partonic interactions. Additionally, atomic mass number (A) scaled $v_1$ slope of light nuclei will be presented to understand their production mechanism. The experimental measurements will be compared with transport model calculations to explore the underlying physics mechanisms in the high baryon density region of the QCD phase diagram.",

          "description": "The understanding of collectivity in small collision systems must address three key issues related to the initial conditions: (1) the role of nucleon and sub-nucleon fluctuations, (2) nucleon forces and emergent correlations in light ions, such as alpha clustering, and (3) the influence of longitudinal fluctuations and their impact on flow decorrelations. We present two- and four-particle cumulants of $v_2$ and $v_3$ based on new d+Au and O+O datasets collected in the year 2021 with extended forward and midrapidity acceptance of STAR. Notably, we observe a significant enhancement in both $v_2\\{2\\}$ and $v_2\\{4\\}$ in d+Au collisions compared to O+O collisions, in the highest-multiplicity events, suggesting markedly different ellipticities in these two systems. Comparisons with model calculations reveal a clear influence of sub-nucleon fluctuations and nuclear structure effects. The $v_n$ measurements are performed using two-particle correlations in rapidity ranges $|\\eta|<1.5$ and $2.1<|\\eta|<5.1$. The role of flow decorrelations with rapidity is investigated and the findings are compared to previous RHIC measurements and model predictions. These new findings greatly expand our understanding of small system collectivity.",

Building on the foundation of the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which solves general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) equations for astrophysical phenomena, BHAC-QGP adapts these capabilities to the unique challenges of high-energy nuclear collisions. BHAC-QGP leverages Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to dynamically enhance resolution in regions requiring high precision, enabling detailed tracking of QGP properties over a wide range of length scales. We present applications of BHAC-QGP to gold-gold (Au-Au) collisions at RHIC energies, demonstrating its superior accuracy over existing models and confirming its consistency with established results. These advancements underscore BHAC-QGP's potential as a robust tool for precision studies in relativistic heavy-ion physics.",

          "description": "The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor, as well initial conserved charge densities. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations\r\n of large and small systems. \r\n With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.\r\n\r\nIn very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken.  Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.\r\n\r\nBased on:  arXiv:2405.13600 and work in progress",

          "description": "The observation of collective-like behaviors in pp and p–Pb collisions at LHC energies has sparked debate about the similarities between the dynamics of small systems and heavy-ion collisions. In this talk, our latest published results are presented, showing baryon-meson $v_{\\rm 2}$ grouping (within 1$\\sigma$) and significant splitting (approximately  5$\\sigma$) at intermediate  $p_{\\rm T}$ in high-multiplicity p–Pb and pp collisions, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. The Hydro-Coal-Frag model, which incorporates partonic flow and quark coalescence, best describes the data, while alternative models fail to reproduce the pattern, providing strong evidence of a collectively flowing partonic medium in high-multiplicity pp and p–Pb collisions. The key question of how far down in system size the dynamics of small systems and heavy-ion physics remain similar is also investigated. The observed baryon-meson  $v_{\\rm 2}$ grouping and splitting, down to lower multiplicities $N_{\\rm{ch}} > 25 $, suggest that partonic collectivity may persist even in smaller systems. Additionally, our newly published results on ultra-long-range two-particle correlations, $|\\Delta \\eta| >$ 5.0(6.5), extending down to or below minimum bias multiplicity in pp and p–Pb collisions, explore the limits of collective medium formation in small systems.\r\n\r\nThe unique sensitivities of flow vector fluctuations to initial geometry and event-by-event fluctuations offer new insights into the initial conditions of both heavy-ion and small collision systems. Newly published results on two-particle correlation observables are presented, revealing $p_{\\rm T}$- and $ \\eta$-dependent flow vector fluctuations in p–Pb collisions at the LHC, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. These measurements, together with comparisons to state-of-the-art theoretical model calculations, allow us to constrain the initial conditions with unprecedented detail in both transverse and longitudinal directions, advancing our understanding of the origin of anisotropic flow phenomena observed in small collision systems at the LHC.",

          "description": "Characterizing the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions requires identifying observables sensitive to different stages of the collision. Recent studies show that measuring collective anisotropic flow and the complex interplay between its Fourier harmonics ($v_n$) and $(\\Psi_n$) can effectively disentangle contributions from various collision phases, providing insights into QGP transport properties and the initial state of the system.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the latest flow measurements from ALICE for Pb–Pb collisions at the highest center-of-mass collision energy, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, ever achieved in a laboratory are presented. This includes the flow coefficient $v_n$, and mixed harmonic cumulants. Added to this are the first measurements of multiharmonic correlations using symmetric cumulants for hexagonal flow harmonics and new symmetry plane correlators, totaling 25 correlators—16 of which are newly introduced with enhanced estimators. Differential results for selected observables are also provided as a function of kinematic variables, alongside standard centrality dependence. In particular, $p_{\\rm T}$-differential flow is further extended to extremely high-$p_{\\rm T}$ regions, providing new inputs for hard processes. These results are compared with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations, offering unique insights for future model developments and further constraining the properties of QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, multi-particle elliptic flow measurements in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions will be discussed, evaluating higher-order flow coefficients and the role of octupole deformation in shaping the initial state of the system.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production has long been identified as one of the golden probes to study the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production has a special role to shed light on the collective behavior of particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the magnitude of the $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ elliptic flow measured at the LHC in Pb-Pb collisions is interpreted as a signature of the charm-quark thermalization in the QGP, supporting the scenario of charmonium (re)generation at low $p_{\\rm T}$. Interestingly, the observation of collective-like effects in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions raises questions about the minimal conditions needed for QGP formation. In this contribution, measurements of quarkonium flow coefficients from small (pp) to large (Pb–Pb) collision systems carried out by the ALICE collaboration will be presented. New results on $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ $v_{2}$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV using event-plane and scalar product methods as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ and rapidity will be discussed. In addition, multi-particle cumulant $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ $v_{2}${4} will be shown, allowing further insight into charm quark thermalization into the QGP and, for the first time, access to flow fluctuations.",

We then develop a framework that interpolates these two limits to calculate shear viscosity across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. The pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence, leading to a non-trivial shear viscosity at finite densities. In addition, we extend the next-to-leading order weak-coupling shear viscosity of QCD to finite baryon chemical potential μ, and we show that the convergence is better at μ > T than at μ = 0. Finally, we present leading order calculations of flavor diffusion for weak-coupling QCD at finite baryon chemical potential μ for three flavors.",

          "description": "It was recently discovered that Israel-Stewart theory is not as causal as we thought [1]. When a fluid expands too fast, as in heavy ion simulations at early times, the large viscous stresses modify the propagation speeds, leading to superluminal signaling [2]. Since we would not trust hydrodynamic information speeds anyway, this may not sound like such disconcerting news, were it not for some recent theorems that link causality violations to instabilities due to time-reversed dissipation [3]. In this talk, I will discuss the physical implications of early-time causality violations in heavy-ion simulations, and how current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic solvers such as MUSIC deal with the expected early-time pathologies [4]. Particular attention will be devoted to the following pressing question: How can hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions be seemingly stable when theory indicates they should not be?\r\n\r\n[1] Bemfica, Disconzi, Hoang, Noronha, Radosz; Phys.

          "description": "The first measurement of two-particle angular correlations for charged particles with LEP-II data is presented. The study is performed using archived hadronic $e^+e^-$ data collected by ALEPH at center-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV, above the $WW$ production threshold, which provide access to unprecedented charged-particle multiplicities and more complex color-string configurations if compared to previous measurements at LEP-I energies. An intriguing long-range near-side excess is observed in the correlation function measured with respect to the thrust axis in the highest multiplicity interval ($\\rm N_{\\mathrm{trk}}\\geq 50$). Such a structure is not predicted by the Monte-Carlo simulation. The harmonic anisotropy coefficients $v_n$, which result from the Fourier expansion of the two-particle correlation functions, were also measured for the first time in $e^+e^-$ data, and compared to PYTHIA6 predictions and to the results obtained in proton-proton collisions. The results presented in this talk provide novel experimental constraints on the formation of collective phenomena in point-like $e^+e^-$ collisions.",

          "description": "This talk presents recent ATLAS measurements investigating correlations between the 'ridge' - azimuthal correlations between particles in the underlying event that extend over all rapidities - and hard scattering processes in $pp$ and $p$+Pb collisions. To study this soft-hard correlation, measurements of two-particle correlations in with two different particle-pair selections are studied. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. In the second, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. In $pp$ collisions, excluding jet-associated particles does not affect the ridge, and no significant azimuthal correlations are found between jet-associated particles and the underlying event, ruling out hard-process contributions to the $pp$ ridge. New measurements extending this analysis to $p$+Pb collisions are also presented. Prior $p$+Pb flow measurements have indicated a small but significant high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ up to a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ of 50 GeV. This is in contrast to suppression measurements which indicate no clear suppression of high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons. These jet-tagged measurements can thus provide insight into the origin of the high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ observed in $p$+Pb collisions.",

          "description": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, top quarks are expected to be attractive candidates for probing the quark-gluon plasma as well as to bring unique information about the time evolution of strongly interacting matter. We report the first study of top-quark pair production in lead-lead collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The dataset was recorded in 2015 and 2018, amounting to an integrated luminosity of $1.9~\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$. Top-quark pair production cross section is studied in the eµ channel. The result is compared to theory predictions based on different nuclear PDF sets.",

As they do not interact strongly with the medium, they carry undisturbed information about the QCD matter from which they are emitted.\r\nBy studying low-mass and low-momentum dileptons, we can gain insights into transport \r\nproperties and potentially uncover new phases of QCD matter, such as the color \r\nsuperconducting phase. \r\nIn this contribution, we discuss the essential steps towards investigating such soft dileptons. \r\nTo achieve this, data from Ag+Ag collisions at 1.23$A$ GeV with a nominal magnetic field strength are compared to a dedicated run conducted with a reduced magnetic field (5% of $B_\\mathrm{max}$) to increase the acceptance of low-momentum pairs.\r\nAdditionally, we will present the new data collected in 2024 for Au+Au collisions at 0.8$A$ GeV with a lower magnetic field strength allowing us to study the low-mass and low-momentum dileptons in more detail.",

          "description": "We propose the angular distribution of lepton pairs produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions as a probe of thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio %\\eta/s% in the early stages of the collision.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program and SPS energies probe the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon densities. Precise photon and dilepton measurements serve as unique tomographic probes for the properties of hot nuclear matter. In this work, we study the electromagnetic radiation from relativistic heavy-ion collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamical evolution of the QCD medium is calibrated with hadronic data in the RHIC Beam energy scan program based on a recent (3+1)D Bayesian analysis [1, 2]. We convolute the full model posterior distribution from the Bayesian analysis to make robust predictions for the electromagnetic observables with the propagated theoretical uncertainties. We will show how photon and dilepton observables, especially their rapidity dependence, can impose complementary constraints on the QGP dynamics and help to deduce its transport properties at finite baryon densities. \r\n\r\n[1] C.

By measuring the mass spectra of thermal dielectrons, one can extract the average temperature of the medium in different stages.Since the thermal dielectron emission rate is proportional to the medium’s electromagnetic spectral function, the integrated yields offer valuable insights into the microscopic interaction mechanism between the electromagnetic current and the medium. Additionally, the azimuthal angle distribution of the single decayed electrons in the dielectron rest frame provides means to explore the polarization of thermal dielectrons.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will report on STAR measurements of thermal dielectrons produced in Au+Au collisions at BES-II energies ($\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 7.7 - 19.6 GeV), as well as in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 200 GeV. The presented results will cover the electron angular distributions in the dielectron rest frame, thermal dielectron invariant mass spectra, excess yields, and temperature measurements.",

          "description": "We present a selection of recent measurements of electromagnetic probes conducted by CMS to probe initial-state aspects of the heavy ion collision. The Z boson has a very short lifetime and can decay to dimuon final states that can be precisely measured. These properties make it a valuable tool for studying the initial state of heavy ion collisions. It has been proposed that the momentum of muons resulting from a Z decay, and therefore the experimentally observed mass and width of the Z boson, may be modified by the presence of the immense initial-state electromagnetic fields that are thought to be created in heavy ion collisions. Using the CMS experiment, we report the first search for a modification of the observed Z boson mass and width in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV relative to those observed in pp collisions. In addition, measurements of Z boson yields and azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, will be discussed. The centrality and rapidity dependence of the measurements are compared to theoretical models. Taken together, these measurements provide new insights into the role of initial electromagnetic fields, nuclear parton distribution functions, and initial-state geometry in heavy ion collisions. The production of top quarks in heavy ion collisions serves as a novel tool for investigating nuclear parton distribution functions at high Bjorken-x. Although being a quark, the top has a short lifetime, decaying predominantly to a W boson and b quark pair, before hadronizing. Leptonic final states from the subsequent W boson decay are thus effectively electroweak probes of the medium they traverse before reaching the detector. The CMS collaboration has reported evidence of top quark pair ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$) production using data from lead-lead (PbPb) collisions during Run 2. This talk will present the first measurement of $\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}}$ production utilizing $1.63~\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$ of PbPb data collected by CMS at 5.36 TeV in 2023 and derived using kinematic variables from leptons and jets.",

          "description": "Electromagnetic probes are a unique tool for studying the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Photons and dielectron pairs are emitted during the entire evolution of the medium created in such collisions, providing access to direct-photon production that includes thermal radiation from the early hot stages of the collision. The measurement of direct photons in minimum-bias pp collisions serves as a crucial baseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions, whereas pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities allow the search for interesting phenomena such as the possible presence of QGP in small systems.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present the final LHC Run 2 ALICE results on the direct-photon production in pp and Pb--Pb collisions. In central Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, results from virtual and real direct photons, as well as direct photon Bose-Einstein correlations are shown, enabling a precise direct photon spectrum over a broad range of transverse momentum. To study the possible onset of the formation of a hot medium, we also report the results on the direct-photon production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. The results are compared to theoretical models that include a contribution from a thermalised source.",

          "description": "Transport coefficients play an important role in characterizing hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). The electric conductivity can be accessed via the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function's low-energy transport peak, which can be measured via thermal dilepton emission. Several facilities including the Schwer-Ionen Synchrotron (SIS), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have potential to probe low energy dilepton signals in ongoing and future experiments.\r\nIn this contribution, we present our recently published study on the electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter. We implement the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\\rho$ meson. Therefore, hadronic many-body theory is utilized to calculate the $\\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\\pi$-$\\rho$, $\\pi$-$\\sigma$, $\\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\\Delta$-hole loops. Vertex corrections are then introduced to maintain gauge invariance. In particular, we examine the transport peak and electric conductivity along a proposed phase transition line, and under conditions comparable to those expected in future heavy-ion experiments. We compare the transport properties for hadronic matter and a pion gas, in order to examine the individual contributions of various particles to the electric conductivity. In addition, we calculate the transport peak along a proposed phase transition line, and find that the electric conductivity shows a decreasing tendency from high to low collision energies.",

          "description": "We present a newly developed hybrid hadronic transport + hydrodynamics geared towards heavy ion collisions (HICs) at low to intermediate beam energies, and report on the resulting excitation function of dileptons. In this range of energies, covered by the STAR Beam Energy Scan program and the future CBM experiment at FAIR, it is unclear how to best decribe the medium evolution. At which beam energy is hydrodynamics *necessary*? How should it be initialized? The electromagnetic radiation in a HIC is heavily dependent on the cumulative emission throughout the expansion, so these questions can be resolved by comparing dilepton observables in different model calculations. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we propose a dynamic approach to fluidizing hadrons in state-of-the-art evolutions of intermediate beam energy HICs, based on the local energy density. This provides a natural core-corona separation, in contrast to commonly employed initalizations based on a constant proper time. In the presence of a first-order phase transition, the dilepton yield is greatly enhanced, which can be seen in the dilepton  excitation function. Moreover, we highlight the need for event-by-event initial conditions compared to smooth averaged profiles, since hotspots account for a significant part of the dilepton spectra.",

          "description": "The measurement of dielectron production is a fundamental piece of the puzzle in the understanding of the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The dielectron spectrum provides information that penetrates the veil of final-state hadronic interactions and provides direct access to the early phases of the collision. However, the interpretation of the measured spectra relies on a precise understanding of all the contributing sources.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the measurement of dielectron production in the high-precision proton-proton data collected with the upgraded ALICE detector at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV. This establishes a crucial baseline for all measurements of dielectron production in larger collision systems. Utilizing the new inner tracking system, dielectron pairs from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons are identified and subtracted using a data-driven approach. \r\nThe possibilities of using the extracted spectrum of prompt dielectrons over a wide mass range are discussed in the context of a possible onset of thermal radiation or the production of dielectron pairs via the Drell--Yan process in a regime where no reliable calculations based on perturbative QCD are available. We will in addition show the status of the analysis of the Pb-Pb data collected during LHC Run 3.",

The yield of direct virtual photons depend strongly on fireball volume, emission time, total baryon chemical potential, and temperature.\r\nThe STAR experiment has recorded large datasets of Au+Au collisions in the Beam Energy Scan Phase-II (BES-II) program, spanning center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 3 - 54.4 GeV.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, new results on the direct virtual photon measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 14.6 and 19.6 GeV will be presented, including $p_{T}$ spectra and invariant yields. Additionally, prompt photons from initial hard scattering are estimated using model calculations and the effective temperature is extracted from non-prompt direct photons at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 14.6 - 54.4 GeV.

          "description": "Despite decades of theoretical and experimental achievements, a coherent picture of the evolution in colliding heavy ion systems is still missing, particularly in the non-perturbative regime.  Since photons are penetrating probes, the combined information of direct photon yields at low transverse momenta ($p_T$) and their azimuthally asymmetric emission (flow) provides important constraints on theories.  Simultaneous observation of high yields and significant (almost hadron-like) flow of low $p_T$ direct photons in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX, dubbed the \"direct photon puzzle\" still eludes a coherent explanation.  A closely related issue is the apparent universality of photon production, that depends only on charged particle multiplicity, but not on the size of the colliding ions, except for the most asymmetric systems.  In this talk, we will present new results on direct photon flow in Au+Au and yields in Au+Au, Cu+Au and $^3$He+Au at low $p_T$.

          "description": "The fermion damping rates of quarks and the electrical conductivity of a strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma (QGP) are derived at leading order in the coupling constant using first-principles field-theoretical techniques. The quark damping arises from one-to-two and two-to-one scattering processes, with their rates calculated by incorporating full kinematic details and exact amplitudes. This approximation holds for sufficiently strong magnetic fields and high temperatures. Utilizing the damping rates, we investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the mechanisms governing these conductivities, leading to a pronounced suppression of the transverse conductivity compared to the longitudinal one. While the approximation may break down in the regime of strong coupling, our study offers valuable insights into the charge transport properties of strongly magnetized plasmas.",

Foremost among these is the X(3872), which is thought to contain\r\na ccbar pair plus two light quarks. In heavy ion collisions, these multiquark\r\nstates are especially sensitive to a range of phenomena that can suppress or\r\nenhance their production. With a full range of precision vertexing, tracking,\r\nand particle ID capabilities covering forward rapidity, the LHCb experiment is especially well suited to measurements of both prompt and non-prompt exotic hadrons. This talk will present recent LHCb measurements of exotic hadrons, including the recent measurements of the nuclear modification factor of the exotic hadron X(3872) in pPb collisions and of the X(3872) production in jets.",

          "description": "The sPHENIX experiment is a next-generation collider detector at RHIC designed for rare jet and heavy flavor probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The experiment includes a large-acceptance, granular electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) and very high-rate data acquisition plus trigger system. In RHIC\r\nRun-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-pT photon trigger. This dataset represents a nearly-tenfold increase of the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous EMCal-based high-pT neutral meson measurements for this collision energy at RHIC. This talk presents the first sPHENIX EMCal measurements in p+p collisions, including neutral pion and eta meson production over a  significantly extended kinematic range, where the eta decay photons remain well-separated in the granular EMCal out to very high pT, and isolated photon production, with an isolation   requirement based on the full calorimeter system for the first time at RHIC. These provide  important pQCD baselines for future measurements of single hadron suppression at very high pT in Au+Au collisions. Additionally, the transverse single spin asymmetry for neutral mesons  serves as a foundational measurement for the sPHENIX Cold QCD physics program.",

          "description": "One of the most striking modifications induced by the QGP on a QCD parton shower is the breaking of angular-ordering. This was established in a series of pioneering papers almost 15 years ago by studying the radiation pattern off a QCD antenna in the presence of a medium [1,2]. These effects were captured by a single critical angle solely depending on the medium properties. Constraining the values of $\\theta_c$, and more generally the physics of colour decoherence, is one of the targets of the heavy-ion experimental program at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will demonstrate that the notion of a critical angle that exclusively depends on the medium properties no longer holds after accounting for medium effects during the formation of the antenna. This generalisation of the results of Refs. [1,2] shows that each splitting in an in-medium parton shower experiences colour decoherence in a different fashion. In addition, the total rate of emissions is enhanced with respect to previous calculations. This result has important implications for the experimental quest of determining medium modifications to parton evolution, as well as in the formulation of in-medium parton showers.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

          "description": "Energy correlators inside of high energy jets provide a powerful tool to image the intrinsic and emergent angular scales of QCD. They have the potential to provide unprecedented insight on the interplay between vacuum scales inside of a jet and its medium modification. Energy correlators of jets containing a gluon splitting to heavy quarks can provide unique experimental access to two- and three-point correlators with known parton flavors through jets tagged with heavy hadrons. We demonstrate how these correlators open up important new avenues in phenomenology. The interplay between the quark mass and medium effects gives the correlator a distinct formation time-dependent medium modification at small angles, while the clean access to the splitting has the potential to unveil effects from an anisotropic, flowing medium.",

The difference between jet axes as determined via energy-weight and winner-take-all clustering schemes, also known as the decorrelation of jet axes and denoted Δj, is measured for the first time in photon-tagged jet events. This observable is sensitive to both multiple scattering and large-angle scattering effects in the QGP. The pp and PbPb data samples were recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to integrated luminosities of 1.69 nb−1 and 302 pb−1 respectively. Events are required to have a leading isolated photon with 6060 GeV in central PbPb show signs of narrowing relative to pp. The results are compared to the Hybrid, Jewel and Pyquen theoretical models, which include different mechanisms of energy loss.",

          "description": "The first measurement of low transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) charged hadron pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions relative to $Z$ bosons in PbPb collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is presented. This study utilizes PbPb collision data recorded in 2018 with an integrated luminosity of $1.67 \\pm 0.03$ nb$^{-1}$, as well as pp collision data acquired in 2017 with an integrated luminosity of $301 \\pm 6$ pb$^{-1}$. For the first time in PbPb collisions, the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons relative to $Z$ bosons are measured in bins of charged hadron $p_\\mathrm{T}$ to search for in-medium parton shower modifications and medium recoil effects. The analysis focuses on events containing at least one $Z$ boson with $40 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 350$ GeV. A significant modification in the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions for charged hadrons in the low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range, around 1 to 2 GeV, is observed compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The results are consistent with expectations from phenomenological models, including medium recoil and the medium response to hard probes traversing the quark-gluon plasma. The data provide significant new information about the correlation between hard and soft particles in heavy ion collisions, which can be used to test predictions of various jet quenching models. In PbPb data comparisons with pp reference and theoretical models, the first evidence for medium recoil and hole effects caused by a hard probe is found.",

          "description": "The production of a Z boson provides a clean handle to control the population of events to be studied. By selecting muonic decays of Z bosons, we can isolate the effect of the recoiling process without potential bias from requiring isolation, as is the case for photons. Di-hadron correlations can naturally separate effects from different angular scales and enable jet substructure measurements without jet reconstruction bias. Similar to the energy-energy correlator (EE) in jets where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes are separated, by studying analogous correlation in the full event, one can unravel potential larger-scale structures that may arise from the interaction of high-energy recoiling particles with the quark-gluon plasma. This talk will present the first measurement of the energy-weighted di-hadron correlation with the CMS collaboration using events tagged with a Z boson. A significant modification of EEC is observed not only in small to intermediate angular scale but also extended to the phase space that is far away from the typical range covered by jet based EEC. The result provides new insight into the jet quenching mechanism and information about the inner workings of the QGP.",

          "description": "The elliptic anisotropy of energetic particles produced in heavy-ion collisions is understood as an effect of a geometrical selection bias due to energy loss. In the measured ensemble, particles oriented in the direction in which the medium is shorter are over-represented as compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the elliptic anisotropy for jets, obtaining quantitative agreement with available experimental data.\r\n\r\nJets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. The ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations is determined by the physics of color coherence. We find that jet $v_2$ has a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of the critical angle $\\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, we show that the relative size of jet $v_2$ for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follows a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to experimentally reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter. To this end, precise jet measurements from sPHENIX will be determinant as one explores larger values of $\\theta_c$ in AuAu collisions. Our study incorporates results for OO collisions at the LHC as well, providing predictions for both jet $R_{\\rm AA}$ and jet $v_2$ for different $R$.",

          "description": "The spectrum of coherent gluon radiation from a quark-antiquark pair experiencing multiple scatterings within a coloured medium is central for understanding in-medium parton cascades. Despite its foundational importance, current results are limited by reliance on simplified scattering rates, such as the harmonic oscillator approximation, valid only in restricted phase-space regions. Using the formalism introduced in [1], we express the gluon emission spectrum as a set of differential equations that can be solved numerically, circumventing conventional approximations. We present the transverse momentum and energy distributions of emitted gluons for realistic interaction models, illustrating the breakdown of color coherence across the entire accessible phase-space, and consequently enabling a higher-precision description of jet observables.\r\n\r\n[1] Andrés, Apolinário, Dominguez, JHEP 07 (2020) 114",

          "description": "When a hard parton fragments in vacuum, subsequent emissions are angular ordered due to colour coherence. In contrast to this, in a dense coloured medium interactions with the background change the parton's colour and disrupt colour coherence. The phase space for the next emission is then not constrained by angular ordering leading to potentially measurable differences in the distribution of fragments. The effect is not due only to a broader angular distribution of partons, because angular ordering also affects the energy sharing. In this talk I will present the improved treatment of angular ordering in the upcoming release of JEWEL and discuss the effect of loss of angular ordering on different intra-jet observables. I will also quantify related theoretical uncertainties.",

          "description": "We present a comprehensive study of jet substructure modifications in heavy-ion collisions using the JETSCAPE framework. Our approach utilizes the multi-stage jet energy loss description, which includes suppression of jet-medium interaction at high virtuality, reflecting the virtuality dependence of the process. The parameters used in our simulations are tuned to reproduce hadron RAA and inclusive jet RAA, particularly in the high-pT region at 5.02 TeV. Using these simulations, we analyze key observables such as Soft Drop observables, jet mass, and fragmentation functions. Our results show good agreement with current experimental data, highlighting the model’s reliability. This study provides a solid baseline for further detailed investigations of jet structures in heavy-ion collisions, offering insights into jet-medium interactions and their effects on jet evolution.",

We derive an analytical expression for the modification of the EEC as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. We obtain explicit results for the dependence of the modification on the jet energy, the scattering power of cold nuclear\r\nmatter, and the path length within the medium. We extend our calculations to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare our results with recent preliminary data for proton-lead collisions at the LHC.

          "description": "Measurements of jet substructure observables in heavy-ion collisions provide powerful constraints on the microscopic mechanisms of interactions between energetic partons and the QGP. Though there has been remarkable progress in measuring inclusive charged-particle jet substructure observables, a complete understanding of the identified particle production inside jets (jet hadrochemistry) and its modification in heavy-ion collisions remains elusive. Jet quenching models predict modifications to jet hadrochemical composition in heavy-ion collisions, arising from both jet-medium interactions and altered particle production in the jet wake. Measurements of identified particles in jets can help discriminate between different proposed jet-medium interaction mechanisms.\r\nEnabled by the excellent PID capabilities of ALICE, we present the first measurements of π, K, and p ratios within jets and in the underlying event as a function of particle transverse momentum in pp and Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. This study aims to advance our understanding of soft particle production mechanisms and distinguish modified jet fragmentation from bulk medium effects.",

          "description": "Measurements at RHIC and the LHC show strongly enhanced baryon-to-meson yield ratios at intermediate transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) in inclusive measurements from high-energy nuclear collisions compared to $p$+$p$ baseline. This enhancement is attributed to strong hydrodynamic flow and parton recombination in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). \r\nJet probes have been used extensively to gain insights into QGP properties, with substantial modifications to jet yields and internal structures seen across multiple measurements. Despite apparent medium-induced changes to jet fragmentation patterns, modification of in-jet hadro-chemistry has not yet been found. To search for such effects with the STAR detector at RHIC, we couple the jet-hadron correlation technique with particle identification to measure in-cone baryon-to-meson yield ratios associated with fully reconstructed jets from Au+Au and $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV. These in-jet ratios are studied with jet selections of jet radius, R $= 0.2, 0.3, 0.4$, and jet constituent $p_{\\rm{T}}$, $p^{\\rm{cons}}_{\\rm{T}} > 2.0$, $3.0$ GeV/$c$, to probe jets with different levels of QGP interaction. We present in-jet $p/\\pi$ ratios as a function of $p_{T}$ as well as $\\Delta R$, alongside jet shapes for identified hadrons, and compare Au+Au and $p$+$p$ measurements to examine QGP effects on hadronization.",

          "description": "Jet quenching — modifications to the energy and substructure of high-energy parton showers in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) — serves as a key experimental tool to probe properties of QGP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. On one hand, the quenching effect, often quantified through the nuclear modification factor (e.g., $R_{AA}$), is well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, it is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the observation of collectivity in these collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon. And O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurements of the following three observables related to the jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$), inclusive jet $R_{cp}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{cp}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding. These measurements provide a valuable opportunity to explore possible jet quenching effects in O+O collisions. The $p_{T}$ and centrality differential results will be presented and compared to similar measurements in collision systems of various sizes. Such comparisons will also help disentangle the effects of system size and collision geometry.",

          "description": "Jet substructure provides precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offers more differential ways to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of single hadrons. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as to the mass of partons through the dead-cone effect.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present three key charm-tagged jet measurements, using jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson. The first are measurements of the differences between three different axis definitions inside the jets. These different definitions vary in their sensitivity to wide-angle soft radiation and systematically probe the radiation pattern off of charm quarks. Next are the jet angularities, which characterise the weighted angular distribution of the jet constituents. These powerful observables probe the parton shower, with sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects that can be tuned by adjusting the importance of wide-angle radiation. Finally, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator for $\\rm{D^{0}}$-meson tagged jets. This observable is defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs within jets and reveals the detailed structure of QCD radiation from heavy quarks, allowing for a distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative effects in charm showers. Comparisons of all these results to measurements of dominantly gluon-initiated jets, as well as to various event generators, are sensitive to flavor-dependent effects in both the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms. Moreover, comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations emphasize the need for improved theoretical modelling of heavy-quark jets and provide critical insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.",

          "description": "The flavour dependence of parton showers presents a unique opportunity to explore fundamental properties of QCD interactions. In particular, the substructure of low-energy jets containing heavy-flavour hadrons provides experimental access to both mass effects as well as the impact of Casimir colour factors. Using novel tracing methods, splittings of charm quarks are isolated to measure fundamental properties such as the dead-cone effect and the charm-quark splitting function. By using the new high statistics data samples of Run 3, we present new measurements of the dead-cone effect and splitting function of charm quarks, differentially in the energy of the emitter, through measurements of jets tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. At the low energies uniquely accessible to the ALICE experiment, comparisons of these measurements to an inclusive-jet baseline probe the evolution of the dead-cone of charm quarks with unprecedented accuracy. With increasing energy of the emitting charm quark, the dead-cone angle is predicted to get smaller, allowing for the isolation of the impact of Casimir colour factors. Such differential measurements in the charm sector not only illuminate the role of mass and Casimir colour factors when compared to inclusive jets, but also provide a lower mass heavy quark-enriched sample which is crucial for comparisons to measurements in the beauty sector, in order to isolate the mass dependence of the dead-cone effect.",

          "description": "In the last years, it has become clearer that recoiling particles originated due to elastic scatterings between the energetic partons within a jet and the medium constituents within the QGP are of great importance for jet quenching phenomenology. Current implementations in state-of-the-art models consider that the elastic scattering process takes place between an on-shell energetic parton and the medium constituent. Crucially, however, highly energetic partons produced during jet evolution cannot be considered in general as on-shell states coming from infinity, and their correct description is in terms of a collection of color correlated dipoles. In this talk we present the first computation of the properties of the soft recoils produced as a result of perturbative elastic scatterings between a color coherent dipole and a quark medium constituent.\r\n\r\nOur findings [1] indicate that the angular phase space of these soft recoiling quarks is tightly constrained by the opening angle of the color coherent dipole, owing to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we provide the first estimate of the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics.\r\n\r\n[1] arXiv:2406.08550v2",

          "description": "The diffusion wake accompanying the jet-induced Mach cone provides a unique probe of the properties of quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It can be characterized by a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by γ-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The diffusion wake valley is found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the γ-jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to the equation of state and shear viscosity is also studied.",

          "description": "The sPHENIX experiment is a next-generation collider detector at RHIC designed for rare jet and heavy flavor probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. The experiment includes large-acceptance, hermetic electromagnetic (EMCal) and hadronic (HCal) calorimeter systems, along with a very high-rate data acquisition plus trigger system. In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-p$_T$ jet trigger. This dataset represents a major increase in the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous measurements for this collision energy, along with the first HCal at mid-rapidity at RHIC. This talk presents a measurement of dijet p$_T$ asymmetries and azimuthal acoplanarities, over a wide range of leading jet p$_T$, performed with the full sPHENIX calorimeter system. These measurements provide the pQCD baseline for measurements of dijet p$_T$ asymmetries and angular decorrelation in future sPHENIX Au+Au data-taking at RHIC. The tighter initial kinematic correlations at RHIC compared to the LHC are expected to greatly increase the sensitivity to physics effects.",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, hard-scattered partons lose energy as they traverse the medium, which is simultaneously modified by this interaction. One expected medium modification, known as the \"diffusion wake,\" is a particle enhancement in the direction of the parton and a depletion in the opposite direction. Although theoretically predicted, clear experimental evidence of the diffusion wake remains elusive. This talk presents jet-track correlations in photon-jet and di-jet events measured in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector to search for diffusion wake signals. While photon-jet events do not show a significant signal within current uncertainties, upper limits on the probability are provided, and the results are consistent with CoLBT theory predictions at the 68% confidence level. New measurements from di-jet events are also presented, offering higher statistical precision, though complicated by potential contamination from the convolution of wakes of the jet pair.",

          "description": "High-energy partons are known to lose energy when passing through the hot and dense medium produced in heavy ion collisions. This energy loss is expected to depend on the mass and flavor of the fragmenting parton. For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy quarks, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. Comparisons between the suppression observed in the inclusive sample of jets with the suppression of b-tagged jets and jets produced at forward rapidity (quark enhances sample of jets) are needed to understand the impact of parton mass and parton flavor on energy loss. Tagging of the $b$-jets is achieved using neural networks trained on Monte Carlo simulation samples and validated in a data-driven way with an independent approach involving the detection of muons from semileptonic decays of B-hadrons. A detailed quantification of the differences between the $b$-jet $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ and the inclusive jet $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ is also provided, together with comparisons to theory. The measurements are performed in $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC.",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, jets propagating through the quark-gluon plasma undergo interactions with the medium. These interactions modify the internal structure of jets, making jet substructure an invaluable tool for probing the microscopic properties of the QGP. N-point Energy Correlators, defined as energy-weighted N-particle correlations inside jets, have emerged as a novel substructure observable in proton-proton collisions, where they show a clear separation of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. Recent measurements in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions show striking modifications of the Energy-Energy Correlators (EECs) compared to vacuum QCD baselines.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present a measurement of the EECs in Pb-Pb collisions, presenting results at low jet transverse momentum for the first time. Such a measurement is essential in mapping jet modification across different kinematic regimes in the QGP. In addition we present the first measurements of the 3-point Energy Correlator in Pb-Pb collisions, along with their ratios to the EECs. This higher order correlator is predicted to have an enhanced sensitivity to medium effects such as the medium response and offers unique insights into the interactions of the jet and the plasma.",

          "description": "Jet substructure is a powerful tool for testing QCD in elementary particle collisions. The two-point energy-energy correlator (EEC), defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs inside jets, is a novel jet substructure observable probing the correlation of energy flow within jets. In pp collisions, the angular dependence of the EEC cross section shows a distinct separation of the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes, revealing the partonic dynamics of jet formation and the confinement of partons into hadrons. There have been an increasing number of theoretical studies predicting how the presence of a medium modifies the EECs with respect to the vacuum case. In this talk, we present measurements of the EECs for inclusive jets in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. By comparing our results to a measured pp baseline, we study the modifications of jet evolution caused by interactions with a cold nuclear medium and the presence of a high multiplicity environment. Understanding modifications due to cold nuclear matter effects is vital in interpreting EEC results in Pb$-$Pb collisions and separating hot and cold nuclear effects.",

          "description": "We study the momentum broadening of a high energy quark jet in the high-density gluon medium created right after the collision of two ultrarrelativistic heavy nuclei, the Glasma. Previous Glasma studies consider the jet as a classical probe particle, for which position and momentum are simultaneously determined.  In this talk, we use the light-front QCD Hamiltonian formalism to treat the jet as a fully quantum state and compute its real-time evolution while propagating through the Glasma classical background fields, that appear as an interaction potential in the quantum evolution of the jet. We present results for the momentum broadening and jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ experimented by a jet at approximately mid-rapidity. We then pay special attention to the anisotropies in the momentum broadening between the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the collision axis. In opposition to the classical jet analyses, we find that, as the momentum modes of the boost-invariant Glasma are distributed mainly along the transverse direction, the momentum broadening is larger in the transverse than in the longitudinal direction.",

          "description": "The first measurement of the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in Pb-Pb collisions has revealed its sizeable modifications with respect to the p-p baseline. Nevertheless, challenges arise in comparing these measurements due to selection bias caused by energy loss, which leads to a shift in the Pb-Pb EEC spectrum toward smaller angles as compared to the p-p measurement. In this talk, we will show that jets retain a memory of their original distribution before losing energy, allowing us to define a new EEC-based observable that corrects for the leading-order effects of this selection bias while keeping sensitivity to other medium effects. This represents the first-ever jet substructure observable whose medium modifications cannot be explained solely by selection bias and/or changes in quark/gluon fractions. Finally, we will extend this procedure to charged energy correlators, which correlate the energy flux carried by hadrons of different quantum numbers",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, jets formed from hard-scattered partons experience an overall energy loss and have a modified internal structure compared to vacuum jets. These modifications are a result of the interactions between the energetic partons in a jet shower and the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). As the jet traverses the QGP, it loses momentum to the medium, which in turn responds to the presence of the jet. This “medium response” modifies the momentum distribution of the (soft) hadrons produced when the QGP freezes out. Since these hadrons carry the momentum lost by the parton shower, they and the modified shower both contribute to the energy flow in jets. The quantitative description of the medium response is an open question under active investigation. Recently, the projected N-point energy correlators (ENCs) have seen a resurgence of interest to probe vacuum QCD. For the first time [1], we will present a computation of the full three point energy-energy-energy correlation function in heavy-ion collisions and demonstrate its use for studying the shape of the energy flow originating from medium response. For this study, we utilize the Hybrid Model that implements a hydrodynamical medium response via the wake. We will show that measuring three-point correlation functions offer a promising experimental avenue for imaging the wake of the jet as when the three angles are well-separated the three-point correlator is dominated by the medium response.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] arXiv:2407.13818v2",

          "description": "A subset of heavy-ion collisions are ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), where the ions collide with a large impact parameter, causing them to interact primarily through their intense electromagnetic fields. These interactions allow for the study of various photon-induced processes at high energies. The products of exclusive UPC interactions are typically characterized by very low transverse momenta products, which present several challenges to efficiently select with a trigger. In Run 3, the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) FastOR trigger provided a novel tool to trigger on these processes at Level 1. The TRT trigger was, for the first time, adapted for use in heavy-ion collisions, allowing it to trigger on low-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles ($p_\\mathrm{T} > 200$ MeV), including muons from coherent J/Psi decays. Another feature of many UPC collisions is single-sided nuclear breakup or multiple photon exchange, which causes one or both of the colliding ions to emit forward neutrons.  \r\nThe Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detects these neutrons and provides a fully digital trigger. This tool allows for triggering on many distinct neutron topologies within the Level 1 system. In Run 4, the new joint ATLAS-CMS HL-ZDC will be installed, providing similar triggering capabilities in the more challenging environment of the HL-LHC. The combination of the ZDC and TRT along with other calorimeter systems allows for the efficient collection of data for many distinct UPC processes.",

          "description": "Determining the luminosity of collisions delivered by the LHC is the goal of the ATLAS luminosity programme. An accurate luminosity measurement is fundamental for any physics measurement with the ATLAS detector, in PbPb collisions especially for high precision physics measurements, such as the $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ cross section in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. In ATLAS, the absolute luminosity calibration and its uncertainty is derived from a set of dedicated van-der-Meer (vdM) scans, which the LHC delivers for every collision dataset (p+p, p+Pb, Pb+Pb etc.) and at every centre-of-mass energy. The absolute calibration is monitored during the full data-taking period regarding its stability. During Pb+Pb running in the autumn of 2023, the ATLAS experiment recorded seven vdM scan pairs in different configurations, which are used to extract the absolute luminosity calibration. The stability of this calibration is monitored through a set of independent luminometers. This presentation discusses the procedure of the ATLAS luminosity measurement, and the results obtained for the 2023 Pb+Pb dataset.",

          "description": "Exotic degrees of freedom, such as hyperons, dark matter, and deconfined quark matter, have attracted significant attention in the theoretical modeling of compact objects like neutron stars, which have extremely dense cores. Our goal is to explore the formation of these particles in high-density environments while maintaining neutron star stability and satisfying observational constraints from neutron stars. We employ a relativistic density functional approach for the hadronic phase, incorporating hyperons and bosonic dark matter, going through a phase transition to deconfined quark matter described by the non-local Nambu–Jona-Lasinio model with color superconductivity. We assess the compatibility of our model with observational data and use Bayesian analysis to constrain its parameters.",

          "description": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, copious rates of $\\gamma\\gamma$ processes are expected through the interaction of the large electromagnetic fields of the heavy nuclei. These can lead to light-by-light scattering via loop diagrams or photon-induced production of particles such as leptons or virtual axion-like particles. In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), characterized by large impact parameters between the nuclei, a di-photon interaction can be the only one taking place, leading to very clean signatures in the detector. The outgoing leptons or photons are back-to-back in the transverse plane, which allows a precise and efficient identification. This talk presents recent UPC-based measurements, performed using data from the ATLAS experiment recorded in Pb+Pb collisions. It includes measurements of the processes $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\tau\\tau$ and $\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\gamma\\gamma$, which are used to extract properties of the $\\tau$-lepton and probe for new physics contributions. Measured cross-sections will be presented, and the implications for these results on physics processes beyond the Standard Model will be discussed.",

          "description": "Ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions have revealed the existence of a hot, dense medium exhibiting collective flow with minimal viscous dissipation, indicative of a strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. The CMS Collaboration previously measured the speed of sound in this medium, determining a value of approximately 0.241 at an effective temperature of 219 MeV in ultracentral 5.02 TeV PbPb collisions at the LHC, in excellent agreement with lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predictions for a deconfined QCD matter. In this talk, we present new results from measurements using 5.36 TeV PbPb data collected during LHC Run 3 (2023) and 8.16 TeV pPb data from Run 2. The new larger data samples significantly improve precision, enabling more detailed differential studies. We explore the temperature dependence of the speed of sound by analyzing data at different collision energies and the mean transverse momentum at various rapidities. Additionally, the impact of different centrality estimators on the extraction of the speed of sound is examined in detail. These new results provide critical insights into the thermal properties of the quark-gluon plasma and offer stringent tests of lattice QCD predictions.",

          "description": "A key question about the QCD phase diagram is whether there is a critical point somewhere on the boundary between the hadron gas and quark-gluon plasma phases, and if so where. Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The unknown Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD. We use maximum entropy freeze-out of fluctuations to make estimates for the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoSs with a 3D Ising-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the location and strength of the critical point. We quantify the effect of the non-universal mapping parameters, the distance between the critical point and the freeze-out curve, and the contribution of decay protons on the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities.",

          "description": "One method to estimate the position of the critical endpoint of QCD is to model the free energy as a rational function of the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ and determine the Lee-Yang edge singularities. Using high-statistics simulations on 4HEX improved staggered $16^3\\times 8$ lattices by the Wuppertal-Budapest Collaboration we estimate the location of the closest singularity in the QCD phase diagram. Using this lattice setup we are able to reach an unprecedentedly low temperature of $T=100$MeV in our simulation dataset. To understand the true predictive power of such an approach we analyze the systematic uncertainties of such an approach in detail. We compare various ansätze, including formulations that preserve baryon charge quantization by forcing the appropriate periodicity in the imaginary chemical potential. The parameters can be constrained by the cumulants of the net baryon density calculated with lattice simulations at $\\mu_B^2\\leq 0$. Thus, we also compare single point and multipoint Padé approximations.",

Such quantities can not be directly calculated in lattice QCD\r\nbecause of the infamous sign problem.

          "description": "Fluctuations of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions are expected to be sensitive to a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD matter [1, 2]. Such a critical point is increasingly predicted to be located in the high baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) region around $\\mu_B$ = 500 - 650 MeV [3–8]. In 2018, the STAR Experiment started collecting data in a fixed-target configuration in order to map the high baryon chemical potential region of the phase diagram ($\\mu_B$ = 420 - 720 MeV). Critical fluctuations may be observed by measuring various orders of cumulants, $C_n$, of the distributions of baryon number. The collision-energy dependence of net-proton $C_4$/$C_2$ from STAR’s measurements in Beam Energy Scan I hinted at a possible non-monotonic deviation from the non-critical baseline in Au+Au collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 19.6 GeV, and the first published result from the fixed-target program, in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV is consistent with the non-critical baseline [9–13]. We report here new results on proton-number high-order cumulants from STAR’s Fixed-Target Program. Implications for the QCD phase diagram and critical-point search will be discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] M. A.

          "description": "Non-monotonic behavior in the RHIC net proton number fluctuation data could signal the presence of a QCD critical point if they probe thermal conditions at the time of freeze-out. However, the connection between higher-order baryon number cumulants calculated in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics and higher-order net proton number cumulants may not be straightforward. Moreover, correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number have been suggested as sensitive probes for detecting changes in the degrees of freedom that carry strangeness at low temperatures (hadrons) and high temperatures (quarks) [1]. A non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model can explain baryon-strangeness correlations calculated in QCD at low temperatures and small chemical potentials, especially when additional strange hadrons are included (QMHRG2020).\r\nIn this presentation, we will show the ratio of first-order to second-order baryon number fluctuations and compare them with the RHIC BES-II results for proton number fluctuations. We will argue that a simple non-interacting HRG model cannot explain the RHIC BES-II results at higher densities, particularly at lower beam energies. Additionally, we will compare higher-order baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD results and argue that these results rule out the possibility of a QCD critical point in the BES-II collider mode. We will also discuss the potential influence of corrections arising from global charge conservation in heavy-ion collisions [2]. Finally, we will compare our results on correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number at finite chemical potential [3] with preliminary results from RHIC BES-II.\r\n[1] V.

          "description": "Higher-order cumulants of (net-)proton multiplicity distributions serve as sensitive observables for probing the QCD phase diagram and searching for the QCD critical point (CP). Critical point is a long range collective phenomenon, and within a larger kinematic range, the critical point signal is significantly enhanced, especially in the higher-order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions. To explore these critical phenomena we conduct a detailed kinematic range scan of the (net-)proton number cumulants up to fourth order.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the precision measurements of systematical kinematic range scans of the (net-)proton multiplicity cumulants along both rapidity and transverse momentum axes in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7\\ \\mathrm{to}\\ 27$ GeV from the beam energy scan program (phase-II) of the STAR experiment at RHIC. We apply both cumulative and differential scans to explore long-range correlations and examine the behaviors of cumulants within localized rapidity ($y$) and transverse momentum ($p_T$) bins. The results from 0-5% most central collisions are compared with non-critical model calculations and with data from 70-80% peripheral collisions, both of which are used as references.",

          "description": "We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \\pm 6.9$ MeV and $\\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \\pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively, at expansion order $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^2)$ [1]. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. \r\n\r\n[1] H.

          "description": "The chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD is expected to be of second order if the breaking of axial anomaly remains sufficiently strong at the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ [1]. This is supported by lattice QCD calculations [2]. However, FRG model calculations suggest that the scaling window, in which universal scaling relations hold, may be small [3]. Furthermore, whether or not the $U_A(1)$ symmetry gets effectively restored at $T_c$ remains to be controversial. This suggest that a more detailed analysis of universal critical behavior close to $T_c$ , as well as a direct determination of the relevant universality class for the chiral phase transition [1,4] in (2+1)-flavor QCD are needed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present new results from a study of the scaling behavior\r\nof an improved order parameter $M = M_\\ell - H \\chi_\\ell$ for chiral symmetry restoration in the light 2-flavor sector of (2+1)-flavor QCD. Here $M_\\ell$ and $\\chi_\\ell$ are multiplicatively renormalized light quark chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, respectively. Furthermore, $H = m_l/m_s$ is the light-to-strange quark mass ratio.\r\n\r\nWe construct ratios of $M$ for two different values of the light quark mass, $m_l$ (or $H$ equivalently), and $T$ close to $T_c$ . In the scaling region we find a unique intersection point for these ratios at $T=T_c$, which allows us to determine $T_c$ and the underlying universality class of the chiral phase transition, from the knowledge of critical exponent $\\delta$.\r\n\r\nThe approach followed here will allow to further constrain the influence of axial anomaly on universal critical behavior in (2+1)-flavor QCD. It also provides a new way of determining the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ , which strengthens the upper bound on the temperature range within which a critical end point in QCD for non-vanishing values of  chemical potential can possibly be found in heavy ion experiments.\r\n\r\n[1] R.

          "description": "Lattice QCD calculations predict that chiral symmetry is restored in a smooth crossover transition between a quark--gluon plasma and a hadron resonance gas (HRG) at vanishing net-baryon density, a condition realized in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. In this regime, the net-baryon number cumulants computed  using the HRG and lattice QCD partition functions are in good agreement up to third order. However, starting with the fourth-order cumulants, the LQCD results are significantly lower than the corresponding HRG results. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally verify the full QCD partition function by measuring the fourth-order cumulants of the net-proton number distributions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, ALICE data for net-proton number cumulants up to sixth order in proton-proton collisions at top LHC energy are presented to search for effects of a possible chiral phase transition in this small system. An extension of the net-proton measurements in Pb-Pb collisions to fourth order is also presented. In addition to providing experimental access to the full QCD partition function, these measurements will, for the first time, allow to distinguish between different mechanisms of baryon production.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions create a hot, dense state of QCD matter called Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP). In ultra-central collisions, the QGP volume saturates and remains constant; instead, entropy fluctuations cause temperature variations in the system. This property can be probed by measuring the correlation between the average transverse momentum (⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩) and the multiplicity of charged hadrons. This contribution shows the latest ALICE measurements\r\nof charged-hadron ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ and its higher-order cumulants in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions. Results are in close agreement with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, by fitting the relative increase of ⟨$p_{\\rm T}$⟩ to the relative change in the average charged-particle density at midrapidity, it is possible to extract the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the QGP, which indicates how fast compression waves propagate through the QGP medium. The extracted cs shows a strong dependence on the choice of the centrality estimators used to select ultra-central collisions, highlighting the sensitivity of this measurement to experimental biases. This observation suggests a need for careful reassessment of methods for determining cs from heavy-ion data. The measurements are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art models in ultra-central events.",

In this talk I will aim to provide an overview of the current state of this intersection of fields, focusing on the application of machine learning to theoretical studies in high energy nuclear physics. It covers diverse aspects, including heavy ion collisions, lattice field theory, and neutron stars, and discuss how machine learning can be used to explore and facilitate the physics goals of understanding QCD matter. The talk will also provide a commonality overview from a methodology perspective, from data-driven perspective to physics-driven perspective.

          "description": "We expect to probe the QCD phase diagram in the region beyond the critical point at the beam energy scan program at Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and at the upcoming Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). In this region, the heavy-ion collision systems will undergo a first-order phase transition. This phase transition is expected to proceed via spinodal decomposition as the system explores the metastable and unstable areas of the equation of state. To conclusively claim the discovery of the first-order phase transition curve, it is crucial to include spinodal effects in phenomenological simulations of these collisions and identify their experimental signatures. For the first time, we present a covariant formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics including spinodal decomposition [1]. These equations account for surface effects between the two phases and can be used in hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. We solve them for a nearly boost invariant flow and discuss the effects of phase separation on system evolution.\r\n\r\n[1] J. I. Kapusta, M. Singh and T. Welle; arXiv:2407.16963",

          "description": "Strangeness production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy-ion collisions.\r\nThere are significant discussions in the field about the initial conditions, including the colliding energy and the size of the system, needed to generate a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is expected that the threshold can be revealed by the measurements of the colliding energy and system size dependence of baryon-to-meson enhancement. Recent datasets collected by STAR in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3 and 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan II program and in different collision systems at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV (d+Au, Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru) provide us a chance to look into the $\\Omega$/$\\phi$ ratios and possibly locate the threshold of QGP production.\r\nIn addition, (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity in different collision systems at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV can be compared with the results from LHC, where an intriguingly smooth increase in these ratios was first reported.\r\nFurthermore, rapidity density of (anti-)strange baryons may give insight into the baryon stopping mechanism.\r\n \r\nIn this talk, we will present new measurements of strange hadron ($K_s^0$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi$, $\\bar{\\Xi}$, $\\Omega$, $\\bar{\\Omega}$, $\\phi$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3, 19.6, 200 GeV and in d+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, including transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra, nuclear modification factors, antibaryon-to-baryon ratios and baryon-to-meson ratios. In particular, precise measurements of the energy and centrality dependence of $\\Omega$/$\\phi$ ratios in Au+Au collisions at different energies and in different collision systems at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be presented. In addition, (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity in different collision systems at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will also be reported.\r\nThese results will be compared to theoretical calculations and physics implications will be discussed.",

          "description": "Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons. The measurement of the production of hypernuclei with mass number A=3 and 4 in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful tool to investigate the hyper-nucleosynthesis mechanism. In the coalescence model, the production yields are sensitive to the interplay between the spatial extension of the nucleus wavefunction and the baryon-emitting source size, whereas, in the statistical hadronization model, the nuclear structure does not come into play in the production. Hypernuclei span over a wide range of wavefunction radii, from about 2 fm for A=4 hypernuclei to about 10 fm for the hypertriton, making them ideal probes to test such models. In addition, the study of hypernuclei properties provides information on the nucleon-hyperon interactions, complementing the results obtained through femtoscopy correlation measurements. The strength of such interactions is a fundamental input to calculate the equation-of-state of the high-density nuclear matter found inside neutron stars.\r\nThis contribution presents recent measurements of ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}_\\Lambda$He based on the data samples collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Besides the yield measurement, the production mechanisms can be investigated via anisotropic flow and global spin polarization measurements, comparing the behaviour of hypernuclei with their non-strange counterpart. In this contribution, we present recent flow measurements of ${}^{3}$He, ${}^{3}_\\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}$He, obtained from the large Pb-Pb data sample collected by ALICE at the LHC in Run 3. Both the yields and the flow coefficients will be discussed in the context of the state-of-the-art theoretical models.",

          "description": "Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By contrasting the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the ϕ-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^{*}$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution will present new results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^{*}$(892) and ϕ(1020) in Pb–Pb collisions obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results will be compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret which underlying mechanism can describe the experimental observations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. Proposed Glueball candidates like the f$_2$(1270), f$^{′}_2$(1525), and f$_0$(1710) also provide opportunities to explore the gluonic bound states predicted by lattice QCD. Utilizing its excellent particle identification capabilities ALICE has recently conducted detailed studies of the exotic resonance production in pp collisions data at √s = 13 and 13.6 TeV. This contribution will present new measurements of exotic resonances such as f$_0$(980), f$_1$(1285), and the glueball candidates to get more insight into their internal structure.",

          "description": "Hypernuclei are bound states of hyperons (Y) and nucleons (N). Measurements on their yields can help us investigate their production mechanisms. In particular, the ${}^5_{\\Lambda}$He and  $^{4}_{\\Lambda}$H(e) are bounded substantially tighter compared to the $^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H. The large radius of the $^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H leads to suppression in coalescence models, but not in the thermal model where the size of the nucleus does not play a role. As such, studying the $A=3-5$ hypernuclei yields allow us to extract information on the effects of hypernuclear binding on hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions. Meanwhile, measurements on their intrinsic properties can constrain the Y-N and Y-Y interactions, which are crucial ingredients for the equation-of-state of strange matter in dense environments. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present ${}^5_{\\Lambda}$He yields in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV,  $^{4}_{\\Lambda}$H(e) yields in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3-4.5$ GeV, $^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H yields in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3-27$ GeV, and $^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H(${}^{3}_{\\bar{\\Lambda}} \\mathrm{\\bar{H}}$) yields in Ru(Zr)+Ru(Zr) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These measurements and thier yield ratios will be compared to thermal and coalescence model calculations, and implications on their production mechansims will be discussed. In addition, we will present the first measurement of $\\bar{\\mathrm{R}}_{3}$, the relative branching ratio of ${}^{3}_{\\bar{\\Lambda}} \\mathrm{\\bar{H}}$, which can provide information on the spin of the ${}^{3}_{\\bar{\\Lambda}} \\mathrm{\\bar{H}}$.",

          "description": "Hadrons have been suggested as sensitive probes for the medium properties of nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. A dense baryon-rich medium is formed during collisions at center-of-mass energies of a few-GeV. Since (anti-)strange hadrons and anti-protons are produced near or below the threshold, their phase space distribution and yield ratios may provide strong constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of high baryon density matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, the recent results on $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $\\rm{K}^{\\pm}$($\\rm{K}^0_S$), $\\phi$, $p$($\\overline{p}$), $\\Lambda (\\overline{\\Lambda})$ and $\\Xi^-(\\overline{\\Xi}^{+})$  production at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.0 - 7.7 GeV in Au + Au collisions with fixed-target mode from the STAR experiment will be presented. The transverse momentum spectra ($p_{\\rm T}$), rapidity density distributions (dN/dy) and their yield ratios as a function of centrality and collision energy are able to provide unique information about QCD phase structure. The $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra and dN/dy ratios of baryon to anti-baryon will provide important input to differentiate between hadron production via quark coalescence and hadronic scattering. Enhancement of baryon to meson ratio hints at an onset of deconfinement in this energy range. We will also explore the centrality dependence of hadron yields, and the evolution of the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperature, baryon chemical potential and average radial expansion flow in the reported energy range, which can give insights on the EoS of the created medium. These results will be compared with those from higher collision energies and the physics implications will be studied by comparing to the model calculations.",

          "description": "The study of exotic hadrons has long been a topic of great interest for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As one of the light exotic hadrons, the structure and constituent quark content of $f_0(980)$ have been debated for decades, with theories suggesting it could be a tetraquark state ($s\\bar sq\\bar q$) or a hadronic molecule ($K\\bar K$). Recently, the CMS experiment has measured the elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$ of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions and concluded that  $f_0(980)$ is an ordinary $s\\bar s$ meson, based on the number-of-constituent-quarks (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow [1]. Assuming that loosely bound light exotic hadrons can only survive at the kinetic freeze-out of the expanding hadronic matter, we have implemented the first $K\\bar K$ coalescence model to a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic and hadronic transport model to calculate the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV.  Using the well tuned phase-space distributions of kaons in this collision, our coalescence model results agree well with the CMS flow measurements,  providing thus a strong evidence for the $K\\bar K$ molecular nature of $f_0(980)$. Our study also indicates that the CMS Collaboration may have unjustifiably ruled out the $K\\bar K$ molecular state of $f_0(980)$ by not considering the different $v_2$ scalings in  the coalescence of hadrons and the coalescence of quarks[2].\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] A.

The data collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS North Area allows for a comprehensive scan of the strangeness production across various collision energies and system sizes. \r\n\r\nThis presentation will focus on the new results of the strangeness production in central collisions of medium-sized nuclei, such as Ar+Sc, at the SPS energy range. In particular, the results for Lambda hyperons and charged and neutral K mesons will be shown. The energy and system size dependencies of Lambda-to-pion and strangeness-to-pion ratios are also explored. Moreover, an unexpected excess of charged over neutral meson production in Ar+Sc and pi-+C interactions will be presented. The obtained results will be compared with predictions from selected particle production models, as well as with existing world data from proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus collisions.",

          "description": "One of the unresolved issues in hadron–hadron collisions is the microscopic understanding of how light (anti)(hyper)nuclei are created. Several differential measurements of (anti)(hyper)nuclei yields, momentum distributions, and fluctuations have been carried out in pp, p–A, and A–A collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Comparisons to models based on statistical hadronization or nucleon coalescence generally provide a good fit to the data. However, these models are grounded in different underlying scenarios, leading to a highly model dependent interpretation of the results.\r\nIn this work, new results based on femtoscopy correlations of deuteron proton and deuteron–pion pairs measured in pp and Pb–Pb collisions by ALICE at collision energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, respectively, are presented. Deuteron–proton correlations allow for studying the particle-emitting source size of deuterons compared to other hadrons. The deuteron source aligns with the proton source across all colliding systems. In pp collisions, the deuteron–pion correlation reveals the residual interaction between pions and nucleons from short lived Δ decays, followed by nucleon coalescence into deuterons. This effect is not observed in Pb–Pb collisions due to the large pion  multiplicities.\r\nThese results demonstrate, in a model-independent manner, that coalescence is a viable mechanism for (anti)deuteron production in ultra-relativistic hadron–hadron collisions.",

          "description": "Understanding strangeness enhancement in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC remains a challenge for hadronization models. Recent observations of the $\\Omega_\\mathrm{c}^0$ baryon indicate that a substantial fraction of the detected Ω baryons may originate from the decay of charm hadrons, e.g. from $\\Omega_\\mathrm{c}^0 \\rightarrow \\Omega^- + \\pi^+$. However, the unknown absolute branching ratios prevent an exact estimation of the contribution of $\\Omega$ baryons coming from charm-hadron decays.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurement of the fraction of Ω baryons originating from charm-hadron decays in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, performed by the ALICE collaboration. This result is enabled by ALICE's new silicon Inner Tracking System, which allows the direct tracking of the Ω baryon prior to its decay. By studying the evolution of the fraction of Ω coming from charm hadrons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity, we will explore the role of charm-hadron production as a driver of strangeness enhancement.",

While at RHIC and LHC energies hypernuclei production is typically discussed with a focus on two scenarios, statistical production in full equilibrium versus production via coalescence, at SIS energies, the spatial region of hypernuclei formation is also considered, distinguishing between production in the participant zone and formation in the spectator matter fragmentation region.\r\nWe address both of these aspects by performing a multi-differential analysis of the kinematic distributions of hypernuclei, hyperons, and light nuclei. These studies provide crucial insights into the dynamics of nuclear matter and the interactions between hyperons and nucleons in a dense, strongly interacting medium, enhancing our understanding of hypernuclei production mechanisms in low-energy heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "With its precise vertex reconstruction and particle identification capabilities, the LHCb detector is ideally suited to study the production and polarization of strange particles. In addition, being the origin of hyperon polarization from unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions not yet fully understood, measurements in different collision systems and kinematic ranges must be provided. In this contribution, recent LHCb measurements of strange hyperon production and polarization in proton-lead collisions are discussed, including their implications for hadronization modification in small collision systems and for transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions.",

          "description": "Heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity to access the space-time ordering of parton branching processes, since parton showers interact with a spatially-extended dense medium. However, the challenges of robustly isolating the formation time of a splitting phenomenologically has prevented formation time-dependent modification effects from being accessed experimentally. We address these challenges using heavy flavour, which offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium. We demonstrate how modified and groomed versions of the Cambridge/Aachen or FlavourCone jet finding algorithms applied on $g \\to c\\bar{c}$ splittings can be used to reconstruct the kinematics of such splittings with high fidelity using either final state partons or hadrons. We construct the parton formation time distribution, which has characteristic distortions arising from medium effects. This effect can be used to construct ratios of $\\tau_f$-distributions in which the sensitivity of parton branching to the QCD formation time becomes experimentally accessible.",

          "description": "Charm quarks offer valuable insights into the properties and evolution of the QCD medium as they are generated in the initial moments of energetic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy-Ion collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In particular, they can carry signals from the pre-equilibrium stage since the very high energy density of this stage can result in significant charm-medium interaction. Using a hybrid simulation framework that combines the IP-Glasma model for initial-state with viscous hydrodynamic evolution MUSIC to model the medium, we study charm quark propagation through different stages of the collision, from pre-equilibrium to hadronization. Heavy quark initial production is generated using PYTHIA and their interactions within the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic medium are modeled through Langevin dynamics in MARTINI. Our results reveal that both the nuclear modification factor and anisotropic flow coefficients of D-mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are sensitive to the momentum-dependent energy loss of charm quarks in the initial stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hadronization mechanisms—specifically fragmentation and coalescence—play a crucial role in shaping the final-state charm observables.",

          "description": "Charm quarks serve as a sensitive probe of the Quark Gluon Plasma providing direct insights into its formation, evolution, and properties. We present the first-ever measurement of the elliptic flow of charm baryons, specifically prompt $\\Lambda_c^+$, in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.36 TeV, using the CMS experiment. We also present the elliptic and triangular flow of prompt $D_{s}^{\\pm}$ mesons with new standard of precision. The broader kinematic coverage and the first-ever $v_3$ measurement of $D_{s}^{\\pm}$ mesons provide new insights into charm quark flow generation mechanisms and the impact of hadronization on flow. By comparing the flow of prompt $\\Lambda_c^+$ and prompt $D_{s}^{\\pm}$ to $D^0$ mesons in the same kinematic range, we investigate charm quark interactions with the medium and hadronization mechanisms. Additionally, we explore the charm quark hadronization mechanism further by measuring the $\\Lambda_c^+/D^0$ yield ratio across pp, PbPb, and pPb collisions. These results offer a unique opportunity to explore the influence of initial-state effects on heavy quark dynamics. Additionally, comparison with theoretical models provides critical validation of the underlying physics mechanisms, and provide deeper insights into charm quark dynamics in heavy ion collisions.",

          "description": "The charm quark is formed almost exclusively during the initial stages of the collision, and a significant fraction of the charm quarks fragment into the $D^{0}$ meson, the lightest open-charm hadron. We can gain insights into the interactions between the charm quark and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium by studying the production and the flow of $D^{0}$ meson in heavy-ion collisions. We study the effect of the initial shape of the collision system on the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of promptly produced $D^{0}$ using event-shape engineering (ESE) in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV, at CMS. A correlation between the initial shape anisotropy with the $D^{0}$ $v_{2}$ would suggest that the flow gets driven by the interactions between the charm quark and the QGP and comparison with theoretical predictions allow us to unravel the mechanism behind the generation of $v_{2}$. We also study the anisotropic flow of nonprompt $D^{0}$ produced due to the decay of the bottom quarks and the nuclear modification factor ($\\mathrm{R_{AA}}$) for prompt and nonprompt $D^{0}$. These studies provide further insights into the QGP interactions of heavy quarks like charm and bottom in heavy-ion collisions in different $p_{T}$ regions ranging from 1--40 GeV/c, the widest ever performed with ESE, and centralities between 0--50\\%.",

          "description": "sPHENIX is a next-generation experiment at RHIC for jet and heavy-flavor physics which was fully commissioned during 2023 and 2024. Using its novel streaming-readout-capable, precision tracking system, sPHENIX collected 100 billion unbiased p+p collisions, and a further sample of minimum-bias Au-Au collisions, in Run-24. A key measurement of the sPHENIX heavy flavor physics program is the comparison of $\\Lambda_c$ to $D^0$ differential yields in both Au+Au and p+p collisions, which probes questions related to the hadronization of heavy-flavor baryons compared to mesons in the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium and in vacuum. At RHIC energies, there is no previous measurement of the $\\Lambda_c$ / $D^0$ baseline in p+p collisions, modern Monte Carlo event generators give widely different predictions, and the ratio in Au+Au is only poorly known. This talk presents a measurement from sPHENIX of the $\\Lambda_c$/ $D^0$ ratio in p+p collisions and the status of the measurement in Au+Au collisions.",

          "description": "Charmonium production has long been identified as one of the golden probes to study the quark­­–gluon plasma (QGP). In fact, the early production of heavy quarks ($c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$) make charmonia an ideal tool to investigate the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, at LHC energies the recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks pairs, namely (re)generation, was found to significantly affect charmonium observables, in contraposition to the well known suppression mechanism. This aspect makes the production measurements of ground and excited states more and more relevant to discriminate among the scenarios foreseen by the different theoretical models. In addition, the possibility to isolate the non-prompt charmonia, i.e. originating from beauty hadron decays, provides an insight into the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. In this contribution, recently published results by the ALICE collaboration of inclusive charmonia production obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented. At midrapidity, the measurements of prompt and non-prompt  J/$\\psi$ production will be shown, while at forward rapidity the measurement will be extended to the excited state as the $\\psi$(2S). Finally, the first preliminary measurement of the $\\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\\psi$ ratio obtained with the new data sample collected in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV will be presented.",

Charm meson production provides strong constraints on nuclear parton distributions, while charm baryon and strange charm hadron production can be used to probe strangeness- and baryon-enhancing hot QCD effects, respectively. The LHCb detector is designed to study heavy flavor hadrons at the LHC, providing unique opportunities to study open charm production in heavy-ion collisions.

          "description": "The open quantum system framework allows one to compute quarkonium's evolution in a medium, keeping track of the needed quantum features. However, computing this evolution is a computationally demanding task. QTRAJ is an efficient code that allows one to simulate the behavior of quarkonium in a medium in the case in which the medium sees quarkonium as a small color dipole $rT\\ll 1$. While this limit is accurate for $\\Upsilon(1S)$, its applicability to other quarkonium states is unclear.  In this talk, wwe present a generalization of this code that incorporates the regime where $rT \\sim 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation. In its new version, QTRAJ implements new jump operators connecting different states, which are then expanded in plane waves, giving rise to a variation of the algorithm present in QTRAJ 1.0 where jumps with $\\Delta \\ell > 1$ are allowed. We will show a review of this approach comparing the $rT\\ll 1$ and $rT\\sim 1$ cases, and we present preliminary phenomenological results.",

          "description": "The strong interaction in the non-perturbative regime typical of the system created in Heavy-Ion collision has been studied in the past years through an effective Quasi-Particle Model ($QPM$): we present an extension to a more realistic model, named $QPMp$, incorporating momentum-dependent parton masses as entailed by QCD asymptotic free dynamics. This model naturally improves the description of quark susceptibilities previously underestimated in the simple $QPM$. Coupling the $QPMp$ modeling to an event-by-event transport approach based on Langevin equations, we evaluate the heavy-flavour $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{n}(p_T)$ for $D$, $\\Lambda_c$, $B$, $\\Lambda_b$ hadrons in $PbPb$ as well as for $OO$ at $5$ $ATeV$. In $PbPb$ we find a quite good prediction for both $D$ meson and leptons from $B$ decays at least within current experimental uncertainties; we also discuss the additional information that can be carried by collisions of light $OO$ system. \r\nA main general result is that for charm quark the extracted space diffusion Ds(T) appears to be significantly larger (about $30-40\\%$) wrt the recent lQCD/NREFT results at momentum $p=0$. We propose a novel analysis that point out the crucial role of the momentum dependence of the interaction to draw solid conclusions about the agreement between the phenomenological approach and lQCD calculation as well as to determine the thermalization time of HQ and in particular its mass dependence from charm to bottom quark. We will point out that $\\Lambda_c$ production and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of D meson at very low momenta ($p_T<1.5$ $GeV$) will allow for a novel and more solid determination of the space diffusion coefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nM.L.Sambataro, V.

          "description": "Screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part. We determine the complex potential in QGP using lattice calculations on lattices with large temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=16-36$. The complex potential is extracted from the Wilson line correlators and physically motivated forms of the corresponding spectral functions [1,2]. We find that the real part of the complex potential is not screened in QGP independently of the detailed form of the spectral functions. We also estimate the imaginary part of the potential using prior information from various theoretical calculations [2].\r\n\r\nLattice calculations also find that the wave function of bottomonium states does not change much across the QCD transition [3]. This is consistent with the observation of the unscreened potential. Therefore, we use the vacuum wave function of different quarkonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\chi_c(1P)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\chi_b(1P)$ and $\\chi_b(2P)$ states\r\nin QGP [2] and compare to lattice NRQCD results [3].\r\n\r\n[1] Alexei Bazavov, Daniel Hoying, Rasmus N.

          "description": "Charm-baryon production measurements in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC are fundamental to investigate the charm-quark hadronization, and to test perturbative QCD-based calculations. Recent measurements in pp collisions show baryon-to-meson ratios significantly higher than those in $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions, challenging the validity of theoretical calculations based on the factorisation approach and assuming universal fragmentation functions across collision systems. Several QCD-inspired effective models (e.g. Catania, POWLANG, QCM) and Monte Carlo generators (e.g. PYTHIA 8, EPOS 4) take different approaches to describe the charm-quark hadronization, and to explain the observed baryon production at the LHC. However, most of them do not manage to describe simultaneously the production of strange and non-strange charm baryons. Precise measurements of strange and non-strange charm-baryon production are crucial to put constraints on model calculations, and to understand the mechanisms governing the charm-quark hadronization in pp collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of strange ($\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0,+}$) and non-strange ($\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2455)$, $\\Sigma_\\mathrm{c}^{0,++}(2520)$) charm-baryon production utilising the large data sample of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV harvested from the start of LHC Run 3 are presented, and the comparison with model predictions are discussed.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Charmonium cross section can be split into prompt and non-prompt components, the first corresponding to directly produced  charm-anticharm pairs, the second originating from the decay of beauty hadrons. Both components are relevant for the investigation of the properties of the quark–gluon plasma (QGP), with the latter allowing a study the mass dependence of heavy-quarks in-medium energy-loss mechanism. In this contribution the recent measurement of prompt and non-prompt $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ carried out by the ALICE Collaboration in pp and Pb–Pb collisions at midrapidity (|y| < 0.8) will be shown, including the newest results from LHC Run 3. Moreover, thanks to the installation of the new muon forward tracker (MFT), prompt/non-prompt charmonium separation is now possible in LHC Run 3 at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 3.6). Using pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV, performances for the prompt and non-prompt $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ separation at forward rapidity will be discussed. For the first time, preliminary results on the prompt/non-prompt $\\rm{J}/\\psi$ fraction will be presented.",

          "description": "Heavy quarks serve as a clean probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nuclear collisions. They are primarily generated from early-stage hard scatterings and retain information about the entire evolution of the QGP fireball. We have developed a state-of-the-art model to provide a comprehensive description of the heavy quark evolution in a realistic QGP medium from the heavy quark's production in the initial stages of the collision all the way to hadronic freeze-out. \r\n\r\nThe transport of heavy quarks in the QGP medium is described by a Langevin-based transport model that has been augmented to incorporate medium-induced radiation. This transport model is coupled to a bulk evolution model based on 2+1D relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. The heavy quark transport coefficients are derived from non-perturbative T-matrix calculations, which account for resonant correlations near the QGP transition temperature.  Hadronization of the heavy quark is described by a fragmentation plus coalescence model. We utilize the resonance recombination model that satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions. The recombination probabilities are derived from resonant heavy-quark scattering rates. \r\n\r\nWe report on key observables in open heavy flavor physics, including the nuclear modification factor, elliptic flow, baryon-to-meson ratio, as well as D-Dbar angular correlations and compare our results to experimental data from the ALICE collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at 5 TeV.",

          "description": "A  heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\\bar Q$) pair can be produced in several pQCD processes, which impose different correlations between the $Q$ and $\\bar Q$. Employing  the recently advanced EPOS4HQ event generator, which contains these processes,  we show  that they explain the measured $D$$\\bar D$  and $DD$ correlations and how they influence the $p_T$ distributions of open heavy flavor mesons in pp and AA collisions. It turns out that this influence is different for D and B mesons.  \r\n\r\nThese correlations have also an influence on hidden heavy flavour mesons produced in pp collisions. To explore them we present a model of quarkonia formation based on the convolution between the Wigner densities, associated to the quarkonia eigenstates (excited states up to 3S states),  and the Wigner density of  the two-body $Q \\bar Q$  pairs produced those collisions. This model allows to predict quantitatively the rapidity and $p_T$ distribution of ground states and excited states of charmonia as well as of bottomonia in pp collisions. We compare the results with experiments and identify the influence of the correlations.

          "description": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mainly produced in hard-scattering processes among partons in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions at the LHC. In heavy-ion collisions, where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state is produced, charm and beauty quarks are produced on a timescale shorter than the medium formation time, being sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the fireball and to the magnetic field produced perpendicularly to the reaction plane in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large angular momentum and initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised, and the quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron during the hadronization process. Experimentally, heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring either the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ of spin-1 bosons (as the D$^{*+}$ meson) or the longitudinal polarization $P_{\\rm z}$ of spin ½ fermions (as the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryon). Measurements in pp collisions provide a crucial baseline to disentangle the amount of charm-hadron polarization induced by the charm-quark polarization inherited from the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of the $\\rho_{00}$ parameter of D$^{*+}$ meson in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=5.02~$TeV, exploiting the data sample collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the LHC Run 2, is shown. Moreover, the $\\rho_{00}$ parameter of D$^{*+}$ mesons and the longitudinal polarization $P_{\\rm z}$ of $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryon measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13.6~$TeV collected during the LHC Run 3 are presented. In this case, the measurements are performed also for charm hadrons originating from b-hadron decays, for which the helicity conservation in weak decays should imply a non-zero polarization of the produced charm hadrons.",

          "description": "Due to their large mass, beauty quarks are always produced in hard-scattering processes, and hence their production can be computed with perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. The production cross section of beauty hadrons can be theoretically described with the factorisation approach as a convolution of the parton distribution functions of the incoming projectiles, the perturbative partonic cross section, and the fragmentation functions describing the transition from quarks to hadrons. Measurements of the production cross section of beauty hadrons in proton–proton (pp) collisions are therefore excellent tests of pQCD calculations. Measurements down to low transverse momenta are also fundamental ingredients for the estimation of the $\\mathrm{b\\overline{b}}$ production cross section. Moreover, the relative abundances of different beauty-hadron species also gives insights about the beauty-quark hadronisation mechanisms.\r\nFinally, measurements of beauty-hadron production cross sections in pp collisions provide a reference for Pb–Pb collisions, where modifications due to the creation of the quark–gluon plasma are expected.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the measurement of non-strange B-meson and $\\mathrm{B_s}^0$-meson production in pp collisions at 13.6 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run 3 are presented. The B mesons are fully reconstructed via their decay channels into a D meson and a charged pion. The measured production cross sections are compared with state-of-art pQCD calculations with next-to-leading order accuracy plus all-order resummation of next-to-leading logarithms.",

          "description": "Recent observations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have revealed a significant enhancement in baryon production in hadronic collisions compared to e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, challenging the long-held assumption of fragmentation universality. This phenomenon, initially observed in the charm sector, has also been observed in the beauty sector, indicating a broader implication for heavy-flavor hadronization processes. This observation has led to the development of several models attempting to explain these observations, by implementing modified hadronization approaches with respect to the in-vacuum fragmentation process. Proposed mechanisms include color reconnection beyond leading-color approximation, hadronisation via coalescence, and feed-down from unobserved resonant states in a statistical hadronization approach.\r\n\r\nTo further elucidate this phenomenon, recent studies have focused on baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of event multiplicity. Intriguingly, evidence of a multiplicity dependence, with increased ratios in high-multiplicity events, has been observed in both the charm and beauty sectors, suggesting a possible connection between baryon enhancement and the local parton density. These investigations have significant implications also for heavy-ion physics, potentially bridging the gap between phenomena observed in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive understanding of these effects is essential for refining our theoretical models of heavy-quark hadronisation in hadronic environments.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, new ALICE measurements of prompt and non-prompt $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$-baryon and ${\\rm D}^0$-meson production cross sections, evaluated on the dataset of proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 3, will be reported. The $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+/{\\rm D}^0$ production-yield ratios in the same collision system, both multiplicity integrated and as a function of multiplicity, will also be discussed and compared to state-of-the-art model predictions implementing different hadronisation approaches.",

          "description": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are useful probes for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) generated in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their participation in the collective motion of the medium can be assessed by measuring the charm-hadron elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$, originating from the initial-state spatial asymmetry in non-central heavy-ion collisions. These measurements provide fundamental inputs to constrain theoretical models describing the charm-quark transport in the QGP, as well as its possible thermalization in the medium. In addition, the comparison between meson and baryon $v_2$ can provide further insights into medium-induced phenomena, such as the radial flow and the charm-quark hadronization via coalescence.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurements of $\\mathrm{D^0}$-, $\\mathrm{D^+}$-, $\\mathrm{ D_s^+}$-meson and $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$-baryon $v_2$ in different centrality intervals of Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run 3 are shown. The measurements are compared to model predictions that incorporate various implementations of heavy-quark interaction and hadronization with the QGP constituents. Moreover, the measurement of the $\\mathrm{D^0}$-meson elliptic flow in pp collisions is presented.",

          "description": "The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy [1]. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment [2] shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\n[1] Shouxing Zhao and Min He, arXiv: 2407.05234\r\n[2] CMS Collab., Phys.

          "description": "A number of new four-quark states containing from one to four $c$ or $\\overline c$ quarks have been observed recently.  Many of these new states have been discovered at the LHC.  The production of these states via intrinsic charm in the proton is investigated.  The tetraquark masses obtained in this approac agree well with the measured masses [1].  These calculations can provide some insight into the nature of the tetraquark candidates, whether as a bound meson pair or as a looser configuration of four individual partons which can influence their interactions in the nuclear medium, such as in heavy-ion collisions. The kinematic distributions of these states as a function of $y$ and $p_T$ are also studied.  Previous investiagations [2-4] show that $J/\\psi$ and $\\overline D$ mesons produced from such states manifest themselves at forwrad rapidity and relatively high $p_T$. The extension to bottom tetraquark candidates is also considered.\r\n\r\n[1] R. Vogt, Tetraquarks from Intrinsic Heavy Quarks, Phys. Rev. D in press, arXiv:2405.09018 [hep-ph].\r\n\r\n[2] R.

          "description": "We present new lattice results for the heavy quark diffusion coefficient in 2+1 flavor QCD in the temperature range from 163 MeV up to few GeV. Compared to previous lattice calculations with unphysical light quark masses, we consider near-physical values and a much wider temperature range. Our results for the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient near the crossover temperature are considerably smaller than the estimates obtained by comparing phenomenological models with experimental data and by T-matrix calculations, and are close to the AdS/CFT limit. At high temperatures, however, the spatial heavy diffusion coefficient increases and approaches the NLO weak coupling prediction within the estimated errors. We also find that the dependence of the spatial heavy quark diffusion coefficient on the heavy quark mass $M_Q$ on the lattice is weaker compared to the model calculations.",

          "description": "The observation of global and local spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions is explained as being induced by thermodynamics gradients of the QGP at local thermal equilibrium, such as the thermal vorticity and the thermal shear. However, since not all the features of the measurements can be well reproduced by the models, the assumption that the spin degrees of freedom of the QGP are equilibrated can be questioned. In this talk, I will derive the dissipative, out-of-equilibrium contributions to spin polarization at first order in gradients using the Zubarev method for spin hydrodynamics. I will prove that the thermal shear can not give rise to dissipative corrections to spin polarization. I will derive momentum dependent kubo formulas that gives the intensity of each contributions and that can be evaluated for any underlying microscopic theory. At the end I will discuss consequences on the interpretation of the measurements.",

          "description": "Although strong magnetic fields are expected in off-central heavy ion collisions, directly measuring their imprints, such as chiral magnetic effects, remains challenging. In this talk, we propose baryon electric charge correlation, $\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$, as well as the chemical potential ratio, $\\mu_{\\rm Q}/\\mu_{\\rm B}$, as useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy ion collisions [\\[1\\]][1].  This is based on (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line, $\\chi^{\\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $\\mu_{\\rm Q}/\\mu_{\\rm B}$ for Pb+Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4, respectively, at a magnetic field strength of $eB\\simeq 8m_{\\pi}^2$. The latter also varies across different collision systems, increasing by a factor of 1.5 from Zr+Zr to Ru+Ru isobar collisions. We will also discuss possible experimental analyses which could be carried out across various centrality classes or in different collision systems exhibiting distinct $eB$ values.\r\n\r\n[\\[1\\]][1] Heng-Tong Ding, Jin-Biao Gu, Arpith Kumar, Sheng-Tai Li and Jun-Hong Liu,  Phys.

          "description": "The appearance of vortical structures originating from gradients is a ubiquitous signature of collective fluid dynamic motion. We present event-by-event simulations for central asymmetric light+heavy and Au+Au collisions to investigate the formation and evolution of vortex-ring structures in the longitudinal flow velocity profile [1]. The production-plane polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons, defined with respect to the $\\Lambda$'s momentum and the beam, can track the \"vortex ring\" feature in the event, a characteristic vortical structure generated by longitudinal flow gradients. We make comprehensive model predictions for the rapidity-dependent vortex-ring observables for different collision system sizes at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} =$ 200 and 72 GeV. Our predictions at the latter energy can be explored in the future LHCb fixed-target experiment (SMOG2) at the Large Hadron Collider. We further make hydrodynamic model comparisons with the preliminary CMS hyperon polarization measurements in p+Pb collisions at 8.16 TeV.\r\n\r\n[1] D. Dobrigkeit Chinellato, M. A. Lisa, W.

          "description": "In non-central heavy ion collisions, substantial angular momentum is generated, resulting in significant vorticity and the spin polarization of particles with finite spin along the global angular momentum. Additionally, anisotropic flow can produce local vorticities in both in-plane (z) and out-of-plane (y) directions, leading to local polarization. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program, including the Fixed-Target (FXT) mode at STAR, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hyperon ($\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$,  $\\Xi^{\\pm}$, $\\Omega^{\\pm}$) global polarization over a wide range of baryon chemical potential. This study probes the vortical characteristics of the medium and can serve as a tool for exploring the nuclear matter equation of state. Also, the second harmonic of local spin polarization ($P_{2y}$ and $P_{2z}$) for $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ and their difference, are predicted to be a sensitive probe for the spin Hall effect driven by gradients in baryon chemical potential.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present measurements of the global polarization of $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi^{\\pm}$ and $\\Omega^{\\pm}$ at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ - $27$\\;GeV in BES-II Au+Au collisions, and the global $\\Lambda$ polarization at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0$ - $6.2$\\;GeV in FXT Au+Au collisions. Additionally, we report the second harmonics of local $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ polarization and their difference at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ - $27$\\;GeV. These measurements provide valuable insights into the spin dynamics within the QCD medium produced in heavy ion collisions.",

          "description": "The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) in heavy-ion collisions probes the topological sector of quantum chromodynamics, where parity and charge-parity symmetries are locally violated. Unlike the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), where the induced dipole moment fluctuates randomly from event to event, the CMW generates an electric quadrupole moment with a same sign for a given net charge state of the system, thus CMW can be observed even when CME is not detected. The CMW leads to charge-dependent elliptic flow ($v_2$) which correlates with charge asymmetry ($A_{ch}$) of the system. \r\nExperimental searches for the CMW, however, face challenges from background contributions related to elliptic flow and nonflow. \r\nThe correlation between triangular flow $v_3$ and $A_{ch}$ will be discussed as a background indicator.\r\nSimilar to the CME search, we use RHIC isobar collisions ($^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}\\rm Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$) at STAR for the CMW search, anticipating a stronger signal in $^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}\\rm Ru$ due to its larger magnetic field. \r\nIn addition, we compare with Au+Au to study the system dependence at the top RHIC energy, examining the magnetic field effects from isobar to Au+Au. \r\nThe prerequisite of the CMW is expected to change with collision energy. \r\nWe present the measurement of slope $ r_2$ of $v_2$ vs. $A_{ch}$ correlation in isobar collisions and Au+Au collisions with BES-II data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 19, 27 and 200 GeV.\r\nWe use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions. \r\nWe will also explore the feasibility of the event-shape selection scheme to subtract the flow-related background in CMW search.",

          "description": "The $\\Lambda$ polarization is a crucial probe of the gradients of velocity and temperature in the quark-gluon plasma generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, it is still not systematically used to tune hydrodynamic models. In this talk, we investigate the influence of different initial conditions and parametrization of the bulk viscosity on $\\Lambda$ polarization, showing that they affect the local polarization significantly. These results highlight the impact that the use of local $\\Lambda$ polarization can have on refining theoretical models. Finally, we compare our results, including feed-down corrections, with experimental data from high-energy heavy-ion collisions at STAR and ALICE, and demonstrate the crucial role of bulk viscosity in generating the correct sign of longitudinal polarization at LHC energies.\r\n\r\nBased on Eur.Phys.J.C 84 (2024) 9, 920",

          "description": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of spin-polarization effects in heavy-ion collisions. Most approaches assume that final-state particles become polarized only if the thermal vorticity and shear are non-zero at freeze-out. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different polarization mechanism. For the first time, spin density is introduced in the initial state in a similar way as one introduces energy density. We argue that the collision of two nuclei, which occurs among participant nucleons carrying spin, deposits in the transverse plane a spin density that polarizes the produced QCD fireball along some random direction. If the subsequent evolution (e.g., kinetic or hydrodynamic) of the fireball does not alter this effect, the spins of the particles emitted at freeze-out will be polarized along the same direction. Using a simple model, we estimate that the polarization induced by initial-state fluctuations is on the order of 1% in central collisions, increasing to over 10% in noncentral collisions. At high energies, it is thus much larger than the polarization due to event-by-event fluctuations of the thermal vorticity. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable able to reveal net-spin fluctuations in the initial states, for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons. This new effect depends little on beam energy and could be promptly studied at both the LHC and RHIC. Finally, besides introducing new tools to probe spin effects in nuclear collisions, this work provides a framework to define spin initial conditions suitable for extensions of hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom.",

          "description": "The interplay between the chiral anomaly and strong magnetic or vortical fields generated in off-central heavy-ion collisions is theorized to produce anomalous chiral effects in the quark–gluon plasma, such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) and the Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE). These effects have been actively studied by several experiments for over a decade as they could shed light on the topological structure of vacuum gauge fields and reveal potential local violations of P and/or CP symmetries in strong interactions. Although recent developments have shown that the signals are small, various underlying mechanisms remain unclear, including the quark flavor dependence and its contributions to both the signal and the background.\r\nIn this talk, we extend the ALICE measurements of charge-dependent two particle correlations from inclusive hadrons to identified hadrons (pions, kaons, and protons) in Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV. Together with previous results of Λ–proton correlations aimed at searching for the CVE, we discuss several possible background mechanisms, including local charge conservation, coalescence, and flow. These studies offer new insights into the search for anomalous chiral effects and enhance our understanding of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of particles of interest (POI's). Event-shape engineering (ESE) [1] and event-shape selection (ESS) [2] are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\\Delta\\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. The former groups events according to the elliptic anisotropy vector $\\vec{q}_2$ of particles in phase space different from that of POI's, thus to the dynamical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$, whereas the latter groups events according to $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$ of pairs of POI's themselves, thus to the statistical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$. In this talk, we conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations [3]. \r\nIt is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept, because of the limited dynamical fluctuation range of $v_2$ than that of  statistical fluctuations.\r\nIt is found that the ESE method can faithfully probe the CME when the $\\vec{q}_2$ phase space is distanced from the POI's, while nonflow effect cannot be neglected when the $\\vec{q}_2$ and POI's phase spaces are close. The ESS method, on the other hand, is obscured because of the intertwining $\\vec{q}_{2,{\\rm pair}}$, $v_2$, and $\\Delta\\gamma$, all of which are computed from the same POI's. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the  event content, such as the relative mixtures of background-contributing sources, and thus is not a robust measure of the CME.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

          "description": "Approximately fifty years ago, the polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons produced in unpolarized proton-beryllium collisions was discovered, though the origin of this phenomenon remains elusive. Many studies indicate that final-state effects, particularly from hadronization, play a significant role. Recently, it has been proposed that spin correlations of $\\Lambda$ hyperons could provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of $\\Lambda$ polarization. In this talk, we report the first experimental measurements of $\\Lambda\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Lambda\\Lambda$, and $\\bar{\\Lambda}\\bar{\\Lambda}$ spin-spin correlations in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 200\\,\\textrm{GeV}$, as recorded by the STAR experiment in 2012. Both short-range ($|\\Delta y| < 0.5$ and $|\\Delta \\phi| < \\pi/3$) and long-range ($0.5 < |\\Delta y| < 2.0$, or $\\pi/3 < |\\Delta \\phi| < \\pi$) $\\Lambda$ hyperon pairs were measured. We will discuss the implications of the measured spin-spin correlations in relation to the longstanding puzzle of $\\Lambda$ hyperon polarization, offering new insights into the hadronization of strange quarks.",

          "description": "The observation of the vector meson's global spin alignment by the STAR Collaboration reveals that strong spin correlations may exist for quarks and antiquarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the normal direction of the reaction plane. We propose a systematic method to describe such correlations in the quark matter. The correlations can be classified as local and long range types. We show in particular that the effective quark spin correlations contain the genuine spin correlations originated directly from the dynamical process as well as those induced by averaging over other degrees of freedom. We also show that such correlations can be studied by measuring the vector meson's spin density matrix and hyperon-hyperon and hyperon-anti-hyperon spin correlations. We present the relationships between these measurable quantities and spin correlations of quarks and antiquarks.",

          "description": "We investigate the weak-interaction-driven bulk-viscous transport properties of npe matter in the neutrino transparent regime. This work complements our recent study that shows that the dynamics of neutron star mergers away from beta equilibrium can be precisely described by an Israel-Stewart formulation with far-from-equilibrium bulk and relaxation time transport coefficients, which are strongly affected by the nuclear symmetry energy [1]. In this work, we designed a simple parametric model for the equation of state and the bulk viscosity that satisfies all the thermodynamics (causality and stability) and observational constraints from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. This parametric model explicitly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters and is ideal for studying their effects on equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties. With this new model, we systematically show how the transport coefficients vary with the nuclear symmetry energy. We also discuss how the nuclear symmetry energy affects gravitational-wave observables, such as the dissipative tidal deformability [2] present in the inspiral phase of neutron star mergers.  \r\n \r\n[1] Y.

          "description": "We study the linear sigma model coupled with dynamical quarks undergoing rigid rotation in unbounded Minkowski spacetime under the Tolman-Ehrenfest approximation. The thermodynamics of this rigidly rotating system induces, kinematically, an infinite local temperature state at the light cylinder, where the velocity of the system equals the speed of light. We show that the infinite-temperature cylinder serves as a barrier (literally, a ``firewall'') characterized by emerging boundary conditions that protect the system from artifacts of superluminal motion outside of the cylinder. In particular, the local (differential) formulation of the gap equation naturally imposes that chiral symmetry is always restored at the light-cylinder. As a consequence, the rigidly rotating system cannot host a single chirally broken phase in the whole space. On the contrary, the system in a thermodynamic ground state resides in a mixed phase that comprises dynamically broken and dynamically restored phases located at different distances from the rotation axis. The existence of such mixed inhomogeneous phases is demonstrated explicitly.",

          "description": "The LHCb experiment’s forward acceptance offers a unique opportunity to study bulk physics in heavy-ion collisions. Properties of bulk particle production, such as the average transverse momentum of charged particles, are sensitive to both collective phenomena and the initial state of heavy-ion collisions. Bulk physics measurements in small collision systems can reveal the interplay between initial- and final-state effects in heavy-ion collisions, and can provide new insights into the origins of collective phenomena. In this contribution, new bulk physics measurements from the LHCb experiment will be presented.",

These innovative methods, based on LHCb time of flight capabilities and on energy loss discrimination in the LHCb detectors, open a new window of possible measurements at LHCb. A nearly background-free sample of more than $10^5$ helium candidates is identified and used to reconstruct (anti)hypertriton production, while (anti)helium from (anti)Lambda-b decays are also studied. In fixed-target beam-gas collisions, deuterons at low momentum are identified with high precision. In both cases, a rich programme of QCD and astrophysics interest, exemplifying LHCb flexibility in exploring new research fields, is foreseen.",

          "description": "One of the main physics goals of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC is to study the QCD phase diagram, especially around the phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and  hadronic matter. BES Phase-I studied Au+Au collisions from center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm{NN}}}} $) of 7.7 to 62.4 GeV. BES Phase-II extended these measurements in several important ways, one of which was the addition of a fixed-target program that pushed the collision energy down to 3.0  GeV  (or baryon chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\rm{B}},$ up to  720 MeV). \r\n\r\nFixed-target (FXT) collisions at STAR allow for a more extensive scanning of the QCD phase diagram to an important region where the QCD critical point may lie, and to a region dominated by dense baryonic matter. One key measurement in both FXT and collider modes is the spectrum of the light hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}, \\ \\rm{K^{\\pm}}$, p$(\\bar{p})$) as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity, and collision centrality. Such measurements enable the empirical determination of the colliding system's location on the phase diagram at chemical freeze-out. Moreover, certain observables involving the production of hadrons have been proposed as a signature of a first order phase transition between hadronic matter and QGP. Specifically, studying the rapidity density distribution ($dN/dy$) of protons as a function of center-of-mass energy has been suggested as a way to probe the nature of the QCD phase transition from hadron gas to QGP. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, the transverse momentum spectra and rapidity density distributions of pions, kaons, and (anti-)protons are presented in an energy range of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm{NN}}}} = 3.2 - 27$ GeV, which includes measurements from both FXT and collider configurations. Implications of these measurements on the QCD phase diagram are then discussed.",

          "description": "It is known from earlier studies that the hadronic interaction affects the measured yield of short lived resonance e.g. $K^{*0}$.  Recent studies [1] show that the directed flow ($v_{1}$) of $K^{*0}$ is strongly affected during the hadronic stage due to asymmetric loss in different sides of the $p_{x}$ axis in momentum space caused by the tilted fireball and density dependent rescattering. Therefore the $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ can be a good probe to study the late-stage hadronic interaction and provide more information (e.g rescattering affected by variations in matter density across phase-space) compared to the yield measurement integrated over full azimuth and rapidity. \r\n\r\nWe present the first measurement of directed flow of $K^{*0}$ resonances in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV. Centrality-dependent difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $K^{*0}$ resonances will be presented.  The difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $\\phi$  mesons will be also shown. The results will be compared with a hydrodynamic model that incorporates a hadronic afterburner [1].  The measured $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ resonances can provide more insights into hadronic rescattering and regeneration processes in heavy-ion collisions and can constrain transport-based models of QCD matter.\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.

          "description": "Over the past two decades, research has shown that various observables measured in heavy-ion collisions can be effectively described using relativistic fluid dynamics across different collision systems and energies. However, a common challenge in these studies is the modeling of the transition from the initial state to the fluid-dynamic phase. While the collision likely involves complex, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is possible that a second-order fluid theory can adequately capture its softer features. If successfully completed, this approach could lead to a comprehensive dynamical description of a heavy-ion collision, where the only free parameters are related to the thermodynamics and the transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.\r\nIn our work (arXiv:2410.08169), we investigate this possibility. We discuss how to characterize the state prior to the collision within this framework, the implications of relativistic causality on the equations of motion, the entropy production from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how this can inform sensible initial conditions for subsequent transverse expansion.",

          "description": "This talk reviews recent progress in next-to-leading order calculations for dilute-dense-processes in the small-x gluon saturation regime,  especially for Deep Inelastic Scattering observables. A systematical formalism for such observables is provided by a combination of light cone perturbation for the dilute probe, combined with a Color Glass Condensate picture for eikonal scattering off the dense gluonic target. In particular we focus here on the recent calculation [1,2] of the diffractive DIS structure function, which is expected to be more sensitive to gluon saturation than inclusive DIS observables.\r\n\r\n[1] G.

          "description": "The FoCal is a high-granularity forward calorimeter to be installed as an ALICE upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 and take data in Run 4. It will cover a pseudorapidity interval of $3.2 < \\eta < 5.8$, allowing to explore QCD at unprecedented low Bjorken-$x$ of down to $\\approx 10^{-6}$ - a regime where non-linear QCD dynamics are expected to be sizable.\r\nThe FoCal consists of a compact silicon-tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with pad and pixel readout to achieve high spatial resolution for discriminating between isolated photons and decay photon pairs. Its hadronic component is constructed from copper capillary tubes with scintillator fibers. The detector design allows measuring a multitude of probes, including direct photons, jets, as well as photo-production of vector mesons in ultra-peripheral collisions and angular correlations of different probes.\r\nAfter the recent completed of the Technical Design Report (https://cds.cern.ch/record/2696471), the FoCal project is entering the production phase in view of installation in 2028.\r\nWe will give an overview of the FoCal physics programme, of the detector design and of its expected performance using results from recent test beams of small-scale prototypes.",

It aims to explore the phase structure and microscopic properties of strong interaction (QCD) matter at large net-baryon densities and moderate temperatures using heavy-ion collisions in the energy range √sNN = 2.9 - 4.9 GeV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCBM is a fixed-target experiment, equipped with fast and radiation hard detector systems and an advanced triggerless data acquisition scheme. It will collect data at unprecedented interaction rates by performing online reconstruction and event selection, thus allowing measurements of rare probes not accessible so far in this energy range. These include: multi-strange hadron production and their flow, higher-order cumulants, dileptons, as well as double-strange hypernuclei.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis contribution will provide an overview of the CBM physics performance and objectives, as well as the detector technologies being developed for the experiment. The status of preparations for CBM’s commissioning in 2028, including performance evaluations of CBM components at FAIR Phase-0 experiments, will also be presented.",

          "description": "A new fixed-target experiment, NA60+, is proposed at the CERN SPS to measure muon pairs in the centre-of-mass energy range from 6 to 17 GeV across various collision systems, from Pb--Pb to p--Be. Its physics scope spans topics from thermal radiation, to chiral symmetry restoration, strangeness, and charm production.\r\n\r\nThe experimental apparatus comprises a vertex spectrometer and a large-acceptance muon spectrometer., A vertex telescope with ultra-thin, large-area Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) is positioned close to the target and operates within a dipole magnetic field. Downstream, the set-up includes a muon spectrometer based on large-area gaseous detectors and a second dipole magnet. A high-intensity beam grants access to rare observables that have been scarcely explored.\r\n\r\nThe physics program includes searching for chiral symmetry restoration through $\\rho$-$a_{1}$ mixing, studying the phase transition order at high baryochemical potential via a caloric curve, and detecting deconfinement onset through $J/\\psi$ suppression. Additionally, NA60+ will measure medium transport properties using open charm states and study hadrochemistry through strange hadrons and hypernuclei production.\r\n\r\nA technical proposal is being prepared for submission to the SPS committee in May 2025, with data taking targeted to begin in 2029/2030.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover the technical aspects of the experimental apparatus, the R&D progress, and the physics program and its potential impact alongside other experiments.",

          "description": "The intriguing phenomena emerging in high-density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter are being extensively studied in the LHC’s heavy ion program, and will be explored in greater depth during the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era. To meet the challenges of HL-LHC, the CMS experiment is undergoing significant Phase-2 upgrades, including the MIP Timing Detector (MTD), which provides 30 ps timing resolution for minimum ionizing particles (MIPs). With its large pseudorapidity coverage up to $|\\eta|<3$, the MTD enables particle identification (PID) via time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, offering new opportunities for probing QCD matter. Coupled with an upgraded wide-acceptance tracker ($|\\eta|<4$) and high-granularity calorimetry ($|\\eta|<5$), these upgrades will allow for more detailed investigations of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the (3+1)-dimensional evolution of heavy flavor quark dynamics and particle composition inside jets over a wide angular range. Additionally, the improved detector capabilities will significantly expand opportunities in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), enabling precise measurements of photon-induced processes, which are crucial for studying the gluonic structure of nuclei. This talk will discuss new physics opportunities enabled by the Phase-2 upgrades covering a wide range of topics. The latest status of the MTD project, including its R&D advancements and prototyping efforts, will also be presented.",

          "description": "Owing to its spectrometer acceptance, unique with respect to the other LHC experiments, and to its excellent tracking and particle identification, LHCb has been developing since the LHC Run2 a complete heavy-ion programme. In parallel, by exploiting the injection of gases in the LHC accelerator beam-pipe, LHCb is now simultaneously acquiring data in collider and fixed-target mode, with two independent interaction points. The sum of the\r\ntwo configurations already gives unique inputs to theoretical models. With the foreseen LHCb Upgrade II, to be operated from Run5, even more possibilities will be opened. Detector granularity will be increased, and new instrumentation with timing capabilities will be added, opening a plethora of new possible analyses to be explored. In this contribution, a full overview of the heavy-ion opportunities with the LHCb Upgrade II, as discussed in a recent workshop with theoreticians, will be presented and discussed.",

          "description": "The ALICE Collaboration has proposed a completely new apparatus, ALICE 3, for the LHC Run 5 (LoI, arXiv:2211.02491). The detector consists of a large pixel-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by multiple systems for particle identification, including silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. Track pointing resolution of better than 10 micron for $p_{\\rm T} > 200$ MeV/$c$ can be achieved by placing the vertex detector on a retractable structure inside the beam pipe. ALICE 3 will, on the one hand, enable novel studies of the quark-gluon plasma and, on the other hand, open up important physics opportunities in other areas of QCD and beyond. The main new studies in the QGP sector focus on low-$p_{\\rm T}$ heavy-flavour production, including beauty hadrons, multi-charm baryons and charm-charm correlations, as as well as on precise multi-differential measurements of dielectron emission to probe the mechanism of chiral-symmetry restoration and the time-evolution of the QGP temperature. Besides QGP studies, ALICE 3 can uniquely contribute to hadronic physics, with femtoscopic studies of the interaction potentials between charm mesons and searches for nuclei with charm, and to fundamental physics, with tests of the Low theorem for ultra-soft photon emission. The presentation will cover the detector concept, the physics performance, and the status of detector R&D.",

We also discuss cold and dense quark matter in the presence of a very strong magnetic field using perturbative QCD at finite density. The effectively negligible contribution of the exchange diagram allows for building a simple analytic model for the equation of state for pure quark magnetars at extremely large fields. Finally, we consider the Taylor coefficients for the pressure in magnetic QCD. Our results for the chiral condensate, strange quark number susceptibility and Taylor coefficients can be directly compared to recent lattice QCD data away from the chiral transition. Even though current lattice results do not overlap with the region of validity for perturbation theory, perturbative results seem to be in the same ballpark.",

          "description": "Spin hydrodynamics is the extension of standard relativistic hydrodynamics with the total angular momentum considered as an independent conserved charge, where the total angular momentum is often expressed as a surface integral of a rank-3 tensor.\r\nThis rank-3 tensor is then decomposed into orbital and spin parts, which, by using the definition of orbital angular momentum in Cartesian coordinates and the energy-momentum tensor conservation, leads to the equation of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nThis treatment is not covariant under coordinate transformations, even in flat spacetime.\r\nWe address this issue by redefining the orbital and total angular momentum in a covariant way, which can also be extended to curved spacetime in cases where the Belinfante and Hilbert definitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent.\r\nThen, we review the constitutive equations of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics developed from a systematic expansion in the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar$.\r\nThis formulation is inspired by, but not necessarily based on, quantum kinetic theory.\r\nUp to the first order in $\\hbar$, there is no back-reaction from the spin sector to fluid dynamics, and, therefore, solutions to standard hydrodynamics act as an input for the equations of motion for the spin tensor.\r\nWe consider three simple solutions to the fluid’s equation of motion: hydrostatic, linearized hydrodynamics, and conformal Bjorken flow.\r\nWe demonstrate that, up to first-order in $\\hbar$, the spin waves are not affected by the fluid waves, and therefore, the results from the hydrostatic case and linearized hydrodynamics are the same.\r\nThis shows that our results for the damping of spin waves are not modified by slight fluid perturbations.\r\nFor the case of conformal Bjorken flow, we first review the consequences of conformal invariance in spin hydrodynamics and, in particular, show that conformal invariance should be considered only in the limit where $\\hbar$ vanishes.\r\nThen, we use the attractor solution to find the evolution of the spin potential.\r\nWe show that the spin potential in this nonlinear regime is damped in a similar fashion to the linear regime.\r\nThese results strengthen our previous findings on the possible long equilibration time for spin, and support a dynamical treatment of spin degrees of freedom.",

          "description": "In the past years, different observables related to the spin polarization of hadrons such as $\\Lambda$-Baryons have attracted much attention and continue to find new applications. \r\nWhile some measurements (such as the global polarization) are straightforwardly reproduced by assuming the spins of the particles to be in equilibrium, the explanation of more differential observables (such as the local polarization) remains a subject of active discussion.\r\n\r\nA crucial ingredient in a more thorough description of spin dynamics is a formulation of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that accounts for the finite (and possibly long [1]) timescale of spin relaxation, i.e., of the approach of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$ to the thermal vorticity $\\varpi^{\\mu\\nu}$. In such a theory, the spin potential remains a dynamical quantity that follows certain evolution equations, akin to the Bloch equations for the magnetization in the (nonrelativistic) description of spin dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe main result to be presented are the equations of motion for such a theory, derived from first principles based on quantum kinetic theory [2]. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach [3], a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. \r\nIt is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential $\\Omega_0^{\\mu\\nu}$, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor $\\mathfrak{t}^{\\mu\\nu}$. For a simple truncation, all first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.\r\n\r\n[1] DW, M. Shokri, D. H.

          "description": "We present the first set of fully-nonlinear, necessary *and* sufficient conditions guaranteeing causal evolution of the initial data for the Israel-Stewart equations with shear and bulk viscosity from kinetic theory coupled to a nonzero baryon current. These nonlinear constraints not only provide causality: they also (a) guarantee the existence of a locally well-posed evolution of the initial data (they enforce strong hyperbolicity) when excluding the endpoints of the bounds, (b) arise from purely algebraic constraints that make no underlying symmetry assumptions on the degrees of freedom and (c) propagate the relevant symmetries of the degrees of freedom over the entire evolution of the problem. Our work enforces a mathematically rigorous foundation for future studies of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics with baryon-rich matter including neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "The unexpected pattern of global spin alignment of vector mesons observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for different particle species have posed a strong challenge to theoretical interpretation, as it cannot be explained solely through conventional polarization sources such as vorticity and electromagnetic fields. We argue that fluctuations of strong-force fields with short correlation length may be the key to solve the puzzle. We derive a relativistic spin Boltzmann equation for vector mesons from Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporating an effective quark-meson model for interaction and the quark coalescence process for hadronization. Our calculations of the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$ for unflavored vector mesons reveal that all field contributions appear in squared terms. This finding indicates that anisotropies in local field correlations, relative to the spin quantization axis, lead to the spin alignment of unflavored vector mesons. We propose that the large spin alignment observed for $\\phi$ mesons at lower energies arises from effective $\\phi$ fields that  polarize the strange quarks and antiquarks, which in turn form polarized $\\phi$ mesons via coalescence during the hadronization stage.  The strength of the $\\phi$ field can be inferred from the experimental data on $\\phi$-meson spin alignment as functions of collision energy reported by STAR Collaboration. Our findings show a transverse momentum dependence of $\\rho_{00}$ in fair agreement with STAR data, and we also predict the azimuthal angle dependence of $\\rho_{00}$. The proposed polarization mechanism driven by fluctuating strong-force fields may open a new window into a hitherto unknown behaviour of QCD interaction.\r\n[X.-L. Sheng, L. Oliva, Z.-T. Liang, Q.

          "description": "The multistage approach based on hydrodynamics has achieved remarkably success in modeling heavy-ion physics, providing an accurate description of experimental particle spectra as well as various signatures of collective flow, flow correlations, and fluctuations. However, traditional numerical simulations of hydrodynamics are challenged by recent high-precision measurements: to probe the finer details in the system via statistics-demanding observables, 10^9-10^10 collisions events are commonly required. As heavy-ion collision physics enters a high-precision era, theoretical modeling needs to evolve to meet growing computational demands.\r\n \r\nIn this work, we introduce DiffHIC, a generative diffusion model designed to bridge this gap. The model simulates ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end, taking initial entropy density profiles as input and producding two-dimensional final particle spectra. By comparing observables derived from particle spectra generated by both traditional numerical simulations and our trained generative model, we demonstrate that DiffHIC not only accurately replicates integrated and differential observables but also effectively captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These results indicate that DiffHIC successfully learns the intricate mapping from initial entropy density profiles to final particle spectra, governed by a set of nonlinear hydrodynamic and Boltzmann transport equations. While preserving the fine  details of the underlying physical processes, DiffHIC significantly accelerates end-to-end heavy-ion collision simulations. For example, DiffHIC can simulate a single central collision event in just 0.1 seconds on a GeForce GTX 4090 GPU.\r\n \r\nThe code and trained model are available at https://huggingface.co/Jing-An/DiffHIC/tree/main.\r\n \r\n \r\n[1]arxiv:2410.13069",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, the transverse momentum broadening coefficient, $\\hat{q}$ plays an integral role in characterising how a high-energy parton loses energy to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it passes. Over the last few years, it has been shown [1,2] that $\\hat{q}$ starts to receive radiative corrections at $\\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, featuring potentially large logarithms. Indeed, better understanding the nature of these logarithmic corrections is extremely relevant for the goal of obtaining a precise theoretical description of parton energy loss.\r\nDuring this talk, I will begin by presenting our results from [3], where we investigate how the inclusion of thermal effects impacts these radiative corrections. I will then report on our progress in understanding how the logarithmic phase space is deformed, once one relaxes the so-called harmonic oscillator approximation. In this direction, we make use of the improved opacity expansion [4], which has recently found success in analytically describing, at leading order, the interface of the single and multiple-scattering regimes.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] T.Liou, A.Mueller, B.Wu, arxiv:1304.7677\r\n[2] J.P.Blaizot, F.Dominguez, E.Iancu, Y.Mehtar-Tani, arxiv: 1311.5823\r\n[3] J.Ghiglieri, E.Weitz, arxiv: 2207.08842\r\n[4]J.Barata, Y.Mehtar-Tani, A.Soto-Ontoso, K.Tywoniuk, arxiv: 2106.07402",

          "description": "Intermediate to low energy heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to the finite temperature ($T$), high baryon number density ($n_B$) QCD equation of state (EoS) at a ratio between charged and total number of baryons that is fixed by the colliding species. For typical nuclei used in collisions, like gold and lead, this ratio, also known as the charge fraction ($Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$), is around 0.4. On the other hand, studies of isolated neutron stars and the dynamics of their birth and mergers require $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ as low as 0.01. We propose a new finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter EoS [1] that can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point observations of isolated neutron stars and nuclear experiments. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data from low to intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. With our new method, we can separately quantify the uncertainty in the $Y^{\\rm QCD}_Q$ and finite $T$ components of the EoS without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We check the accuracy of our framework using a microscopic equation of state up to T = 100 MeV for baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B \\geq$ 1100 MeV (∼ 1 − 2 $n_{\\rm sat}$) and find that the error introduced is less than 5%, with even better results for larger $\\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

          "description": "We investigate the validity of the $\\Lambda$  single-particle potential ($\\Lambda$ potential) in dense matter that is based on chiral effective field theory (chiral EFT) that is sufficiently repulsive to solve the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars. We discuss that the model calculations with the $\\Lambda$ potential are consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1] and the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2].\r\n\r\nA unified approach integrating heavy-ion collisions, other nuclear experiments, and neutron stars with the modern nuclear force from chiral EFT has provided valuable insights into the properties of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter (e.g. Ref. [3]). This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of both nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. For a microscopic description of dense matter, such an approach must be performed also for the hyperon sector. A precise understanding of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter is essential for addressing the long-standing hyperon puzzle of neutron star physics. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we consider the $\\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2] at RHIC-BES energies to verify the $\\Lambda$ potential based on chiral EFT [4]. This potential is sufficiently repulsive at high densities to solve the hyperon puzzle and has proven by us to be consistent with the $\\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1]. We employ a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) implemented into the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2. We show that the model with the $\\Lambda$ potential from chiral EFT can reproduce the experimental data [2], while a more attractive $\\Lambda$ potential also reproduces the data. Thus, additional constraints on the Λ potential are demanded.\r\n\r\nWe will also report the analysis of $v_1$ for $\\Lambda$ with various updates including the covariant collision term [5] and the hyperon-nucleon scattering cross section from up-to-date chiral EFT forces [6]. A consistent treatment of the $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma$ potentials based on chiral EFT will also be discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] A. Jinno, K. Murase, Y. Nara, and A. Ohnishi, Phys. Rev.

          "description": "We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\\mu = 2.6~\\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\\Delta$ of $457~\\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and \r\n$216~\\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions. This constraint may be strengthened by future astrophysical measurements as well as by future advances in high density QCD calculations.",

          "description": "We generalize the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory recently derived in Ref. [1] to describe the dissipative dynamics occurring in accretion disks in presence of large magnetic fields. For this purpose we consider a relativistic dilute gas composed of electrons and ions described by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and simplify it using the 14-moment approximation. This procedure leads to an extended version of the MHD theory traditionally employed in astrophysics simulations [2,3] which typically considers only the parallel component of the shear-stress tensor aligned with magnetic field, B. In our framework, we consider all three distinct, non-degenerate components of the shear-stress tensor relative to B, each governed by unique dynamical equations. We demonstrate that this novel framework exhibits oscillatory behavior in strong magnetic fields that cannot be captured by the conventional MHD formulation, similar to what was observed in Ref. [1]. We finally compare both frameworks in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In particular, we analyze the equations in conditions that lead to firehose instability [4], which is usually observed in simulation-based frameworks. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] K.

          "description": "Completing the perturbative four-loop pressure of cold quark matter (QM) has been shown to significantly constrain the neutron-star-matter equation of state. Building on the milestone results in [1, 2], where all screened gluonic contributions to the QM pressure at this order were computed, the remaining challenge lies in evaluating the missing hard contributions arising from four-loop QCD vacuum diagrams at finite density. In this talk, we will present the latest progress in calculating these four-loop contributions [3], with a particular focus on the new algorithmic technique based on Loop Tree Duality (LTD), originally developed for perturbative computations in high-energy collider physics, which we recently generalized to finite density [4]. This novel approach tackles multiloop computations via direct numerical integration of entire Feynman diagrams, enabling the treatment of complex four-loop diagrams at finite density that were previously considered impossible to evaluate.\r\n\r\n[1] Gorda, Kurkela, Paatelainen, Säppi, Vuorinen, Phys.Rev.Lett. 127 (2021)\r\n[2] Gorda, Paatelainen, Säppi, Seppänen, Phys.Rev.Lett. 131 (2023)\r\n[3] Kärkkäinen, Navarrete, Nurmela, Paatelainen, Seppänen, Vuorinen, In preparation \r\n[4] Navarrete, Paatelainen, Seppänen, arxiv:2403.02180",

          "description": "The high-intensity beams provided by the CERN SPS in a wide energy interval offer a unique opportunity to investigate the region of the QCD phase diagram at high baryochemical potential. The NA60+ experiment, proposed for taking data with heavy-ion collisions at the SPS in the next years, has a strong potential for investigating the QCD phase diagram via measurements of electromagnetic probes in a beam-energy scan of Pb-Pb and p-A collisions in the interval $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6-17 GeV.\r\nIn this talk the physics program of the NA60+ experiment on thermal dimuons will be described.\r\nAt beam energies below top SPS energy, the baryon density becomes maximal and its effect on $\\rho$ meson broadening can be measured by NA60+ with utmost precision. \r\nNA60+ will have sensitivity to the $\\rho−a_1$ chiral mixing mechanism, which provides access also to the properties of the a1 by exploring the thermal dimuon mass spectrum in the range 1 < M < 1.4 GeV.\r\nFor dimuon masses above 1.5 GeV, the temperature of the emitting source can be directly extracted by a fit of the mass spectrum. The experimental program of NA60+ plans to determine for the first time a caloric curve by measuring the temperature vs beam energy, with particular focus on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ < 10 GeV, which is believed to be essential to map out the phase transition regime at high $\\mu_B$.\r\nFinally, the competitiveness and complementarity of NA60+ in the landscape of the experiments foreseen at other facilities in the next decade will be discussed.",

          "description": "As an effective theory, relativistic hydrodynamics is fixed by symmetries up to a set of transport coefficients. A lot of effort has been devoted to explicit calculations of these coefficients. Here we adopt a more general approach, deploying bootstrap techniques to rule out theories that are inconsistent with microscopic causality. What remains is a universal convex geometry in the space of transport coefficients, which we call the hydrohedron. The landscape of all consistent theories necessarily lies inside or on the edges of the hydrohedron. We analytically construct cross-sections of the hydrohedron corresponding to bounds on transport coefficients that appear in sound and diffusion modes’ dispersion relations for theories without stochastic fluctuations.",

          "description": "Jet quenching is an important phenomenon that could be used to construct analyses for probing the properties of the QGP and understanding its structure. However, the exact mechanisms behind jet quenching are not yet fully understood, particularly the relative contributions from medium response and medium-induced radiation, which are difficult to disentangle. Moreover, the momentum dependence of the medium response signal, especially across a range of parton momenta, remains largely unexplored. In this presentation, we utilize high-momentum partons produced over a wide range of parton momentum in lead-lead collisions, to probe the QGP created in heavy ion collisions. By studying the underlying event in the opposite direction of the high-momentum parton, we can gain deeper insights into the QGP's response to hard probes. We present the first measurement of low-momentum hadron spectra over a wide acceptance with respect to the high-momentum parton direction, using lead-lead data recorded by the CMS detector at 5.02 TeV. This new result provides a clear signal of the correlation between medium-recoil and jet axis as well as the parton momentum. Those measurements offer sensitivity to the equation of state, the speed of sound in the QGP, and other potential novel phenomena.",

          "description": "In recent years, CMOS silicon pixel detectors have seen significant advancements and widespread usage across various physics fields, allowing for significant improvements in particle detection technologies. One relevant example is the ALPIDE chip, which is a CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor developed for the upgrade of the Inner Tracking System of the ALICE experiment at the LHC.\r\nOn top of its excellent capabilities for high-energy particle physics, its excellent spatial resolution and charged-particle detection efficiency, very limited noise and fake-hit rate, and reduced sensitivity to photons make it suitable for several applications in medical physics.\r\nIn this poster, we will show recent developments for an intraoperative probe containing an ALPIDE chip as a sensitive element, with online imaging capabilities, to be exploited in radioguided surgery in association with beta-emitting radiotracers.\r\nIn this regard, the design of the probe and the construction of a first functioning prototype will be discussed. Simulation studies for the investigation of the probe performance in discriminating tumoral tissues from healthy tissues, as well as first results from experimental studies with phantoms, will also be reported.",

          "description": "RHIC data taken over two decades showed that even charm quarks thermalize in the hot system formed in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV. These measurements were constrained to the mid-rapidity region, where charm production peaks. The question is what is the longitudinal extension of the charm thermalization and how that would impact the quantification of charm diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma. It also raises the question on how the charm flow can affect bound state charmonium production by charm recombination.  The PHENIX collaboration measured muons from open heavy flavor and $J/\\psi$ decays at rapidity range 1.2$<|y|<$2.2 in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV. Their second Fourier component $v_2$ of azimuthal distribution relative to the reaction plane of the collision were measured for the first time at these large rapidities at RHIC. This presentation will summarizes these results and discuss them along with different theoretical scenarios.",

These include the implications of collective flow in both large and small systems as well as the impact of hadronization by recombination on baryon and strangeness enhancement.  Studies of the system size dependence of various observables also shed light on the role of initial conditions, such as the nuclear-overlap size and shape, nuclear modification of parton distribution functions, etc.  In this talk, we present recently finalized PHENIX measurements of the production of $\\phi$-mesons and identified charged hadrons in $p$+Al and $p/d/^3$He/Cu+Au at 200 GeV and U+U collisions at 193 GeV. The tests of various empirical scalings and comparisons to previous measurements of light hadron production to different model calculations are discussed.",

Higher order flow harmonics probe the initial geometry of heavy ion collisions as well as the viscous damping of flow coefficients during the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). By extending the study of flow harmonics to higher orders, we can access information about the QGP's transport properties that is complementary to existing measurements. In this talk, we will present the centrality dependence of flow harmonics up to order 12 and compare them to theory calculations and previous measurements at lower orders. Additionally, we will report the charged hadron collectivity using multiparticle correlation methods up to 10 particle correlations in PbPb collisions. All the results presented here provide new precision in probing the sensitivity of initial-state fluctuations and viscosity of the QGP, and deepen our understanding of the collective behavior of the strongly interacting matter.",

          "description": "Hypernuclei are objects composed of nucleons and hyperons. Measuring their properties and production provides insights into the force that binds strange hadrons to ordinary nucleons, which is poorly known. Additionally, measuring hypernuclei production in high-energy hadronic collisions offers a critical test for nucleosynthesis models, such as statistical hadronization and coalescence approaches. The difference between these two models is expected to be significant in pp and p–Pb collisions, as the wave function radii of the hypernuclei are larger than the size of the colliding systems. Therefore, the system size is crucial in yield determination within the two pictures. This contribution presents the new results on A=3 and A=4 hypernuclei measured in pp collisions collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 3. The results are consistent with the expectations from state-of-the-art coalescence models, warranting the comparison with measurements of heavier states. Finally, the first ALICE measurement of the hypertriton $^3_{\\rm Λ}$H two-to-three body relative branching ratio is shown, providing an additional constraint to the $^3_{\\rm Λ}$H properties.",

          "description": "Machine learning models have previously been utilized to address the challenge of subtracting combinatorial backgrounds from jets in heavy-ion collisions, with most earlier efforts focusing on supervised regression models. In this talk, we introduce the first self-supervised application of a generative AI model for jet background subtraction. We utilize UVCGAN [1], a Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN), to perform unpaired translations of full detector calorimeter data between heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions. This approach effectively isolates jets from combinatorial backgrounds in heavy-ion collisions while preserving both global jet kinematics and jet substructure.\r\nAdditionally, we present the effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as AI-based generative surrogate models for full-detector, whole-event, and high-fidelity simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments [2]. Trained on HIJING minimum-bias data simulated with Geant4 in the sPHENIX geometry, DDPMs achieve speedups of approximately 100 times over Geant4 simulations. This allows for the rapid generation of large datasets for applications requiring high statistics heavy ion simulation, such as the background events for jet embedding. Both methods were trained and benchmarked with simulated sPHENIX data, which will be discussed in this talk.\r\n \r\n[1] D.

          "description": "Jet substructure measurements at the LHC produce precision tests of jet formation and fragmentation in vacuum as well as at the high temperatures and densities formed in heavy-ion collisions. Jets containing a heavy-flavor hadron drive these QCD measurements into a regime where parton mass and colour factors are critical, pushing the limits of theoretical calculations both in-vacuum and in-medium. Mapping out individual emissions in the Lund jet plane for heavy-flavour jets and comparing to light-quark-enriched jets tagged by a Z boson reveals significant mass-dependence to jet fragmentation, offering a decisive channel to decipher in-medium modification to jet fragmentation across different kinematics. At the same time, measuring heavy-flavour jet mass with a theoretically-safe flavour tagging algorithm for the first time tests perturbative QCD at unprecedented theoretical precision and probes the gluon splitting contribution to heavy-flavour production, a yet-unobserved probe of how the medium resolves quark entanglement. The LHCb collaboration presents recent jet substructure results at forward rapidity in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. These measurements are compared to theoretical predictions, providing new insight on QCD fragmentation at forward rapidity and at low and moderate values of jet transverse momentum. These results provide a baseline for future measurements of jet quenching in PbPb collisions.",

          "description": "The nonperturbative process of hadronization has recently been the subject of intense experimental investigation at the LHC. Since heavy quark production is suppressed at the hadronization scale, heavy-flavour hadrons offer an insightful probe into this effect, connecting perturbative parton-level calculations with experimental final states. Jets produced in conjunction with heavy hadrons offer additional information about hadronic formation at various mass scales and how hadronization depends on the partonic final states. In particular, recent measurements of in-jet quarkonium production suggest significant parton shower production, where gluons split into heavy quark-antiquark pairs. This further complicates the interpretation of charmonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions as evidence of QGP formation. Jet substructure can also be used to probe the formation of exotic hadrons, whose structure is still not well understood. This talk presents recent studies of hadronization using heavy-flavour jets with the LHCb detector, including inclusive hadron production in heavy-flavor jets, as well as quarkonium and tetraquark production in jets.\r\nResults are compared to various models of hadronization, providing strong new constraints on theoretical predictions, and offering insight into interpretations of future measurements in PbPb collisions.",

          "description": "The differences in hadron chemistry observed at e+e- machines versus hadron\r\ncolliders may indicate that the mechanisms by which partons evolve into visible matter are not universal. In particular, the presence of many other quarks produced in the underlying event may affect the hadronization process. With full particle ID, precision vertexing, and a high rate DAQ, the LHCb experiment is uniquely well suited to study the hadronization of heavy quarks. New results will be discussed in this contribution, including progress on studies of charm baryon enhancement in $pp$ collisions.",

Since 2022, LHCb is working with two independent collision points and as a collider and a fixed-target\r\nexperiment simultaneously, a unique opportunity in the scientific panorama. In 2024, samples with larger statistics up to three orders of magnitude with respect to Run2 have been collected, giving access to very accurate measurements of abundant probes and the possibility to explore the rarer ones, such as bottomonia resonances, which is unique at this energy scale. In this contribution, the performance of the system from the 2024 acquired data,\r\nthe first obtained results and the physics prospects for the incoming years will be presented.",

The experiment includes a suite of precision tracking detectors for measurements of jet structure, open heavy flavor, and quarkonia. The tracking system includes a MAPS-based silicon pixel detector, a fast silicon strip detector, a compact time projection chamber, and a micromegas-based outer tracker. In 2024 all tracking detectors were successfully commissioned and collected a large sample of proton-proton collision data, and a pilot sample of Au-Au collision data, at center-of-mass energies of 200 GeV. This includes a unique hybrid streaming readout data sample that enables the collection of a very large unbiased p-p collision dataset, where the tracking detectors continuously readout all collisions for up to 50$\\mu s$  after a calorimeter triggered or minimum bias collision. In this talk, the development and status of the sPHENIX 4D tracking reconstruction and calibration with collision data utilizing the ACTS tracking package will be presented. This constitutes the first use of ACTS with data in a high energy nuclear physics experiment.",

The experiment includes large-acceptance, electromagnetic (EMCal) and hadronic (HCal) calorimeter systems, along with a very high-rate data acquisition plus trigger system. In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-pT jet trigger. This dataset represents a major increase in the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous measurements for this collision energy, along with the first HCal at mid-rapidity at RHIC for measuring the contribution from neutral hadrons. This talk presents a measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section performed with the full sPHENIX calorimeter system. This measurement serves as the pQCD baseline for measurements of single jet suppression in future sPHENIX Au+Au data-taking at RHIC, and as a key demonstration of the sPHENIX detector capability",

          "description": "Dileptons, being electromagnetically decoupled from the strongly interacting medium, are key probes of the thermal and chemical evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the hadronic matter. In the intermediate mass range ($m_\\phi < m_{ee} < m_{J/\\psi}$), they primarily originate from the thermal radiation of the QGP and semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons. Disentangling these sources in the dilepton mass spectrum is essential for understanding the dynamics of thermal radiation and constraining theoretical models of the QCD matter. In this talk, using the Silicon Vertex Detector and high-statistics Au+Au data at 200 GeV from 2014, PHENIX presents the first measurements of the dielectron mass spectrum at mid-rapidity and an empirical approach to separate the thermal and the heavy-flavor components via the distance-of-closest-approach.",

          "description": "The extraction of charm quark cross sections at RHIC energies is crucial for understanding heavy quark dynamics in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the underlying mechanisms of charm production. Multiple partonic interactions (MPIs) from simultaneous scatterings within a single collision event, may significantly influence the production of charm quark. Accounting for MPI is essential in distinguishing primary charm production from secondary effects such as recombination or thermal production within the QGP. In this talk, PHENIX presents a new measurement of the charm production cross-section via the dielectron spectrum in the intermediate mass range ($m_\\phi < m_{ee} < m_{J/\\psi}$) in p+p collisions at 200 GeV, alongside the azimuthal correlation of electron-muon pairs across rapidities. These results are compared with single-electron spectra from heavy-flavor decays and Pythia8 simulations to assess possible contributions from MPI.",

The measurement is performed using the central silicon vertex detector, which provides precise tracking and distance-of-closest-approach determinations, enabling the statistical separation of $J/\\psi$ due to $B$-meson decays from prompt $J/\\psi$. PHENIX results will be shown across a large rapidity range, and compared to other experiments as a function of transverse momentum, and center of mass energy. In addition, the interpretation of the results with respect to fixed-order-next-to-leading-logarithm, and the current theoretical model calculations are provided for better understanding of the underlying physics. It should be noted that the measurement of bottom ($B$) mesons in $p$+$p$ collisions is of interest to constrain the total bottom cross section as well as test our understanding of bottom quark production mechanisms and hadronization. The present results in $p$+$p$ collisions are crucial baseline for the future measurements of $B$-meson decay in more complex environments like in Au $+$ Au collisions at maximum RHIC energy where the quark-gluons plasma has been created.",

These measurements brought to the attention the importance of multi-parton interactions (MPI) in a single $p+p$ collision. Collisions with high activity can also produce an environment dense enough to break weak charmonium states, such as $\\psi$(2S). The PHENIX experiment has a unique configuration of spectrometers covering positive, mid-, and negative rapidities. This configuration was used to study the multiplicity dependency of $J/\\psi$ decays, where the charmonium state and the event activity are measured with distinct rapidity gaps which isolates potential auto-correlations biases in the measurements. The $\\psi$(2S) production relative to $J/\\psi$ is also measured to verify if co-moving particles in high activity events can break $\\psi$(2S) states. This presentation will show the final result of these measurements and if they reveal the existence of MPIs at RHIC energies after considering potential auto-correlations in previous results.",

The data are well represented by L\\'{e}vy-stable source distributions. Three source parameters have been extracted as a function of transverse mass $m_T$ and centrality: the correlation-strength parameter $\\lambda$, the L\\'{e}vy index of stability $\\alpha$, and the L\\'{e}vy-scale parameter $R$. At all centralities, the L\\'{e}vy exponent $\\alpha$ is significantly different from that of Gaussian ($\\alpha=2$) or Cauchy ($\\alpha=1$) source distributions. Monte-Carlo simulations of resonance-decay chains show that in all but the most peripheral centrality class (50\\%-60\\%), a significant reduction of the in-medium mass of the $\\eta'$ meson is needed to match the data. In each centrality class, the best value of the in-medium $\\eta'$ mass is compared to the mass of the $\\eta$ meson, as well as to several theoretical predictions that consider restoration of $U_A(1)$ symmetry in hot hadronic matter.",

The study of strange hadrons across various collision systems and sizes has received renewed interest, particularly in understanding hadronization models. Systematic studies of baryons with varying strangeness content has served to distinguish cold nuclear matter effects from those associated with the quark–gluon plasma. Photoproduction of strangeness on proton targets has been studied at HERA, including measurements of non-diffractive $\\rm \\rho^{0}$(770), $\\rm K^{∗}$(892), and φ(1020) mesons at an average photon-proton center-of-mass energy of 210 GeV. By analyzing data from inelastic photonuclear reactions in Run 3, ALICE can probe even higher energies with nuclear targets and thereby provide new constraints on cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-ion collisions. In this talk, we will present the first studies on the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of strange hadrons in inelastic photonuclear interactions. The data will be compared to previous experimental results and theoretical predictions.",

          "description": "Ultra-peripheral collisions enable a variety of two-photon and photonuclear interactions to be studied. Earlier analyses have mostly focused on exclusive photonuclear vector meson production and on two-photon interactions. This presentation will be on photonuclear interactions where the target nucleus breaks up. The cross sections for these interactions are huge in Pb–Pb collisions at the LHC. The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of pions, kaons, and protons measured by ALICE will be presented. The results will be compared to model calculations. These interactions provide an additional measure of cold nuclear matter effects, which have previously been probed in proton-nucleus interactions.",

          "description": "Theory predicts that the inner structure of hadrons changes with increasing energy, and that gluon saturation can occur in heavy nuclei at lower energiescompared to protons. Additionally, phenomena such as gluon shadowing can exhibit similar experimental signatures to gluon saturation. ALICE has recently presented new results on coherent J/ψ mesons, where the photon probes the entire nucleus. These results span photon–nucleon center-of-mass energies from around 10 GeV to 1000 GeV, confirming previous ALICE measurements at lower energies and extending them to higher energies. The data at high energies can be described by both saturation-based and gluon shadowing models, though no current theoretical model fully captures the energy dependence observed. In this talk, we will present new ALICE studies on the energy dependence of coherent J/ψ production across various $t$-intervals using Run 3 data, providing the strongest test yet of theoretical predictions through the first double differential cross sections for this process.",

          "description": "Direct photon measurements provide essential insights into the properties and evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), from the early initial conditions through the pre-equilibrium stage to the QGP and hadronic phases. In the ALICE experiment, photons are reconstructed using two complementary methods: the photon conversion method, making use of the excellent tracking capabilities of ALICE, and the use of one of the two calorimeters. These techniques enable photon detection across a broad transverse momentum range from 0.4 GeV/$c$, where thermal photons dominate, to several GeV/c, where prompt photon production becomes significant.\r\n\r\nThis talk will present measurements of direct photon production across different centrality classes in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ and $5.02~$TeV. Additionally, we will show the first significant results on direct-photon HBT correlations at low momentum, extending the direct photon measurement down to $p_{\\rm T}$ = 0.25 GeV/$c$ and offering new insights into the space-time evolution of the emitting source. Finally, preliminary results from photon reconstruction in LHC Run 3 data will also be discussed.",

The ALICE measurements of neutral meson production give constraints on parton distribution functions (PDF) and fragmentation functions (FF), and provide essential background corrections for direct photon and dilepton analyses. The results in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are furthermore shown as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity and the correlation of the  $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ meson with jets.\r\n\r\nMeasurements in high-multiplicity pp collisions have revealed similarities to Pb--Pb collisions for observables that were previously attributed to the formation of a QGP, suggesting a continuous evolution from small to large collision systems. In addition, the correlation of neutral mesons and jets measured in pp collisions provides further constraints on the meson FF. The status of the analysis of the high-statistics Run 3 data using the upgraded ALICE detector will also be presented.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. From a theoretical point of view, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by the available theoretical models. In this context, quarkonium polarization measurements represent a powerful tool to discriminate among the different theoretical predictions. In particular, the study of the anisotropies in the angular distribution of the decay production with respect to a given quantization axis is sensitive to the quarkonium hadronization mechanism, even if the very small values measured at the LHC have been challenging the commonly-used theoretical models. Moreover,  the possibility to investigate effects related to the formation of a strongly interacting medium in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions requires a precise determination of the proton-proton reference cross section and polarization. The ALICE collaboration has measured the $\\Upsilon$(1S) cross section and polarization at different center-of-mass energies and in this contribution we will present the recent measurements in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at forward rapidity  (2.5 < y < 4) in the dimuon channel. In addition, thanks to the upgraded detector and the large data sample collected in LHC Run 3 the preliminary measurement of $\\Upsilon$(2S)-to-$\\Upsilon$(1S) ratio both at mid ( |y| < 0.9) and forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4) will be presented for the first time at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13.6 TeV in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay channel respectively.",

          "description": "The study of charmonium production in hadronic collisions is a valuable test for models of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) as both perturbative and non-perturbative processes need to be taken into account in the calculations. At LHC energies, several parton interactions may occur in a single pp collision. Multi-parton interactions (MPI) influence the production of light quarks and gluons, affecting the total event multiplicity, but also hard processes as charmonium production. Therefore the event-multiplicity dependent production of charmonium has the potential to give new insights on the interplay between the hard and soft mechanisms in charmonium production. Another topic of interest in hadronic collisions is the measurement of the J/$\\psi$ production in jets, which can shed light into the mechanisms governing the hadronization of a $c-\\bar{c}$ pair into a J/$\\psi$. In this contribution the prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ fragmentation functions in charged jets measured at midrapdity are presented and compared with models. Moreover, the J/$\\psi$ production at midrapdity and forward rapidity as a function of the relative charged-particle multiplicity, respectively at midrapidity and forward rapidity will be shown, and compared with models.",

          "description": "The study of quarkonium production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions allows the investigations of both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Charmonia states, which are bound states of charm and anti-charm quarks, are produced via a process that can be factorized into two distinct stages: the generation of heavy quarks, followed by the formation of the bound state. The initial stage, governed by hard parton-parton scatterings at substantial momentum transfer, is effectively described by perturbative QCD. In contrast, the second stage, which involves large spatial separations and low momentum scales, is intrinsically non-perturbative. Precise measurements of quarkonium production cross sections in pp collisions are essential for enhancing the understanding of charmonium production mechanisms and for testing various theoretical models. Moreover, these measurements provide fundamental benchmarks for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and for evaluating cold nuclear matter effects in proton-nucleus collisions. In this contribution, preliminary results on the double ratio of $\\psi(2S)$-to-J/$\\psi$ as well as on the inclusive quarkonium yields in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV, measured by the ALICE Collaboration, will be presented and compared with current theoretical model predictions. Additionally, preliminary results from ALICE's ongoing measurements of the exotic particle X(3872) for the same collision system and energy will also be discussed.",

          "description": "In high-energy hadron-hadron collisions at the LHC, Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI), where multiple hard-parton scatterings occur in a single collision, play a significant role. Among these, Double Parton Scattering (DPS) represents the simplest case, where two independent scatterings take place simultaneously. The DPS contribution to processes involving two final states, A and B, can be described as the product of the cross-sections for the independent production of A and B, divided by an effective cross section. This effective cross section is a phenomenological parameter linked to the transverse spatial overlap between partons in the proton. Studying DPS helps to improve our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), particularly in the context of multi-parton distribution functions and potential correlations in parton color and spin. Heavy quark production arises from hard-parton scatterings due to their significant masses, making these processes ideal for studying DPS. One way to explore DPS is by measuring the production cross sections of charm-hadron pairs. In this contribution, we present the latest results on the production of charm-hadron and quarkonium pairs, specifically $\\rm{D}^{0}\\rm{D}^{0}$, $\\rm{D}^{0}\\rm{J}/\\psi$, and $\\rm{J}/\\psi\\rm{J}/\\psi$, at midrapidity and forward rapidity in proton-proton (pp) collisions. These measurements are based on data collected with the ALICE detector at the LHC during Run 2 at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and Run 3 at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of DPS in QCD and provide valuable insights into the structure of partonic interactions at high energies.",

          "description": "Precise measurements of charm-strange hadron production are crucial for validating perturbative QCD calculations based on the factorization approach. In particular, comparing production yields of strange and non-strange charm hadrons is essential for understanding heavy-quark hadronization in hadronic collisions and for constraining models with different quark hadronisation approaches.\r\nIn this context, recent advances in charm-meson spectroscopy have led to the discovery of several excited charm-strange states, whose production yields in hadronic collisions remain unmeasured. Quantifying these yields would provide valuable insights into charm quark hadronization, given the significant contribution to the ground-state charm-hadron yields from their decays. Moreover, the production of short-lived resonances allows us to obtain information on the hadronic phase of the system created in heavy-ion collisions, and potentially present also in smaller collision systems.\r\n\r\nThis contribution presents new production measurements of the orbitally excited charm-strange mesons $\\mathrm{D_{s1}}(2536)^+$ and $\\mathrm{D_{s2}}^{*}(2573)^+$ in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. Their production-yield ratios relative to ground-state D mesons are reported, complementing and extending recent final results from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Production yield ratios of $\\mathrm{D_s}^+$ to $\\mathrm{D}^+$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV will also be reported and compared to state-of-the-art model predictions. The influence of the surrounding color-charge density on charm quark hadronisation, and the potential impact to charm-strange resonance production from a hadronic phase in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions, will be investigated by performing the measurements in different event-multiplicity intervals.",

In a complementary approach to charm-tagged jets, measurements of azimuthal correlations between charm hadrons and charged particles provide a differential description of charm-jet shape and composition in terms of the transverse momentum of associated particles. Additionally, the comparison of correlation-peak measurements for different charm-hadron species can help to understand better the charm hadronisation mechanism, and investigate the possibility of different mechanisms in addition to in-vacuum fragmentation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we report new results of angular correlations between charm hadrons and charged particles in pp collisions from Run 3 data samples, comparing them with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo predictions and models implementing different charm production and hadronisation mechanisms. We will present a comparison between strange and non-strange D-meson correlation measurements, aiming to investigate the influence of strangeness on the charm hadronisation process. Additionally, we will discuss new $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^+$ baryon correlation measurements and compare them with results from the D-meson studies, giving insights into the differences in charm hadronisation between charm baryons and mesons.",

          "description": "Recent measurements of hadron production have revealed a non-universal behaviour in the fragmentation of partons into baryons in hadronic collisions compared to baselines in $\\rm{e}^{+}\\rm{e}^{-}$ and $\\rm{ep}$ collisions. Exploration of this phenomenon is most controlled in the heavy-flavour sector, where the large mass of charm or beauty quarks allows us to experimentally relate a heavy-flavour parton to the resulting hadron. This allows for well defined measurements of heavy-flavour jet fragmentation, enabling us to take steps beyond the traditional hadronic measurements in order to unveil the microscopic details of this non-universality. In this talk we present the first measurement of the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets carried by the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons, as a function of both the jet and event multiplicities in pp collisions. We also present corresponding first measurements of these quantities for jets containing $\\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons, where comparisons to the $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets test the impact of local colour density on the modification of the baryon fragmentation functions. Using the new high statistics Run 3 data sample will allow for differential measurements not only in multiplicity, but also in jet transverse momentum, probing the partonic scales at which non-universal behaviour emerges. Additionally, we report the first measurements of the energy energy correlators (EECs) of jets containing $\\Lambda_{\\rm c}^{+}$ baryons compared to those containing $\\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons. The power of the EECs lies in separating the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes in the evolution of partons and provide a discriminating ingredient with which to pinpoint the scale at which the non-universality arises.",

Charged-particle jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\\textrm{T}}$ charged hadron trigger are reconstructed with resolution parameters 0.2 and 0.4. We report the distribution of the acoplanarity observable, $\\Delta \\varphi$, defined as the azimuthal angle between the trigger and the recoiling jet. In pp collisions this observable is sensitive to next-to-leading order hadron and jet production, and in Pb--Pb collisions it probes medium-induced decorrelation. We also report a new study of the substructure of recoil jets, measuring the phase-space distance between the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) and Standard jet axes, which probes the distribution of soft radiation in the jet. Such semi-inclusive measurements extend the exploration of substructure measurements to large R and low jet transverse momentum and can elucidate the physical mechanisms underpinning the striking medium-induced acoplanarity broadening that was recently reported by ALICE.",

          "description": "Recent measurements in pp and p-Pb collisions at the LHC showed that the production of light-flavour hadrons relative to pions increases with the charged particle multiplicity of the event already in small systems. This smooth evolution connects different collision systems almost independently of the collision energy. This extends to the strangeness sector, where the enhanced production of strange hadrons in high-multiplicity pp events is reminiscent of heavy-ion phenomenology in the case of quark-gluon plasma formation. With the wealth of data collected in Run 2 and Run 3 with the ALICE experiment, it is possible to bridge the gap in multiplicity between small and large systems, exploring for the first time the systems size dependence of light-flavour particle production at the same multiplicity values for pp and AA. This contribution presents new results on the production of light flavour hadrons in pp collisions up to a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions up to an energy of 5.36 TeV. A dedicated high multiplicity trigger is used in pp collisions to reach values up to those of peripheral Pb–Pb collisions. At the same time, exploiting the large statistics sample of Pb-Pb collisions collected in Run 3, the production of (multi-)strange hadrons is studied in low-multiplicity heavy-ion collisions, accessing for the first time with good sensitivity peripheral collision events. Moreover, for the first time at the LHC, the system size dependence is explored down to values smaller than in pp collisions using ultra-peripheral $\\gamma$--Pb reactions. The system size dependence in light-flavour production is probed from the smallest system ($\\gamma$--Pb) to the largest one (Pb--Pb) at the LHC, enabling testing the statistical hadronization picture at its limits. This contribution will present new light-flavour hadron measurements covering three orders of magnitude in multiplicity. These results are discussed within the context of state-of-the-art QCD and statistical hadronization models.",

          "description": "The ALICE Collaboration observed that the production of light-flavoured hadrons relative to pions increases with the charged-particle multiplicity evolving smoothly across interaction systems and energies, from pp collisions to nucleus-nucleus collisions. Notably, this observation extends to the strange hadron sector, where an enhanced production in heavy-ion collisions with respect to minimum bias pp collisions is expected in the case of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. Concurrent models attempt to explain such an increase. Some invoke the thermalisation of the system with a gradual release of the local conservation of the quantum charges; others describe the microscopic mechanism of hadronisation. In both cases, models are asking experiments to disentangle the effect of local and global properties of the system with more differential measurements. This contribution presents new results on the production of light-flavour hadrons using the pp data samples collected by ALICE during LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Strange particle production is correlated to global properties of the event exploiting the concept of effective available energy, estimated through the anti-correlated energy deposited in the ALICE Zero Degree Calorimeters. The production of (multi-)strange hadrons is further correlated to local properties of the collision, exploring the association with the production inside of jets and in the underlying event as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. This can be done using event shape observables such as spherocity or exploiting a full jet reconstruction. Both cases will be discussed in this contribution, presenting new results. Additionally, the production of strange hadrons is further studied by exploiting a new event classifier based on the charged particle flattenicity, which proves to be more sensitive to multiple parton interactions (MPI) while being less sensitive to final-state hard processes compared to traditional event shape methods. All the results are discussed in light of predictions from QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators.",

          "description": "In proton-proton (pp) collisions, the ratio of strange to non-strange hadron yields is observed to increase smoothly with the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the event. In high multiplicity pp collisions, such ratios are comparable to those measured in Pb–Pb interactions at similar multiplicities. The microscopic origin of this phenomenon in pp collisions has yet to be understood. Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between the EPOS4 model, based on core-corona separation between a vacuum phase and a thermalised QGP phase with global strangeness conservation, and the PYTHIA 8.3 implementation, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally. In particular, correlations between a ϕ meson and (multi-)strange hadrons are shown to be excellent discriminators between the two types of models. This contribution presents the first measurement of such correlated production as a function of the event multiplicity in $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV pp collisions collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the Run 3 of the LHC. Results are compared with predictions from the EPOS4 and PYTHIA 8.3 models with improved hadronisation mechanisms (Rope hadronisation and Close Packing), as well as with predictions from the thermal statistical model.",

          "description": "The anisotropic flow of identified hadrons is sensitive to the early dynamics of heavy-ion collisions and to the equation of state (EoS) of the medium. In particular, strange and (multi-)strange baryons have small hadronic cross-sections, thus being clean probes of the early stages of the collision system evolution. As such, they constitute the perfect observable to test the hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball. Additionally, strange and multi-strange baryons are sensitive to the vorticity of the produced medium and to the magnetic field that it experiences at collision time. The effect of vorticity and magnetic field can be examined experimentally by studying the polarization of strange and (multi-)strange baryons. This talk will present the $v_2$ and the longitudinal polarization of strange baryons measured with the high statistics sample of Pb–Pb collisions collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the Run 3 of the LHC. The measurements will be discussed in comparison with predictions from state-of-the-art QCD-inspired models.",

It is especially interesting at LHC energies, as this observable is sensitive to non-linear QCD evolution of the initial state. For the Run~3 of LHC, ALICE has upgraded its detectors, increasing its pseudorapidity coverage and tracking of charged particles over a wider range of pseudorapidity (−3.6 < $\\eta$ < 2) by combining the information from the upgraded Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the newly installed Muon Forward Tracker (MFT). These new detectors enable the exploration of particle production mechanisms by addressing the charged-particle pseudorapidity densities, measured over a wide $\\eta$ range, in pp and Pb−Pb collisions. This contribution presents new results from Run 3 on charged-particle multiplicity, allowing us to investigate the evolution of particle production with energy and system size. The measurement will be compared with models based on various particle-production mechanisms and different initial conditions at mid and forward rapidities.",

In this talk, a differential study of the system size of Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV with ALICE Run 3 data using correlations in momentum space of charged pion–pion pairs is presented. \r\nIn this study, the spherical harmonics decomposition of the correlation functions ($C^0_0$ , Re$C^0_2$ , and Re$C^2_2$) are analysed in several relative transverse momenta ($k_{\\rm T}$) of pion pairs and centrality bins. The three-dimensional radii of the source are extracted by fitting the correlation functions as a function of $k_{\\rm T}$ and centrality. The results show the presence of collectivity in the system, as observed previously at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV with ALICE Run 1 data. This study provides the baseline for further femtoscopic analyses  in Pb–Pb collisions, serves as a benchmark for models, and provides constraints for the evolution of the collision.",

          "description": "Angular (ΔηΔφ) correlations of identified particles in ultrarelativistic proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions exhibit features dependent on collision systems and particle types. These characteristics stem from mechanisms such as (mini-)jets, elliptic flow, resonance decays, and conservation laws, with quantum statistics and final-state interactions influencing each particle pair’s unique correlation function.\r\nALICE [1] and STAR [2] measurements of ΔηΔφ correlations show distinctions in baryon versus meson production. While meson correlation functions display an expected near-side peak attributed to mini-jet fragmentation, which is well reproduced by general-purpose Monte Carlo (MC) models, baryon-baryon correlations reveal a surprising near-side anti-correlation structure. This effect has not been reproduced by the MC models until recently [3, 4, 5, 6], posing fundamental questions about the production mechanism of baryons.\r\nThis talk presents new insights into this “baryon correlation puzzle”. Using Run 2 data from ALICE, a comprehensive study of multiplicity centrality dependent angular correlation functions for pairs of pions, kaons, and protons in pp, p–Pb, and Pb–Pb collisions, along with new Run 3 results for pp collisions at 13.6 TeV, are provided. These include correlation functions for baryon pairs and a new analysis of strange and charm sectors, featuring multi-strange baryons (pΞ, pΩ), pϕ, and pD correlations, allowing for tests of mass dependence and baryon number conservation.\r\nReferences\r\n[1] J.

          "description": "Balance functions have been used extensively to elucidate the time evolution of quark production in heavy-ion collisions. Early models predicted two stages of quark production: one for light quarks and another for the heavier strange quark, separated by a period of isentropic expansion. This led to the notion of clocking particle production and tracking radial flow effects that drive the expansion of the system.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the balance functions of identified particles in different multiplicity classes of pp and Pb–Pb collisions at  $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, respectively, are reported, as recorded by ALICE in Run 3. The results are compared with different models, as well as with previously published results on pp and Pb–Pb collisions at various energies. The results track the balancing of electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness by measuring how the widths and integrals of the charge, baryon number, and strangeness balance functions evolve across multiplicity classes. Results from pp collisions provide a reference for the Pb–Pb results, while the evolution with multiplicity allows us to glimpse the behavior toward high multiplicity scenarios in small systems. Comparisons with models constrain particle production mechanisms as well as the dynamics of system evolution.",

          "description": "In high-energy collider physics, a key question is whether quark--gluon plasma (QGP) is formed in proton-proton (pp) collisions. Recent observations suggest that collectivity exists in pp collisions, although signatures of jet quenching would provide stronger evidence. This study examines jet quenching in pp collisions at two different beam energies: $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV (LHC Run 2) and $\\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV (LHC Run 3) using di-hadron correlations. Correlations are measured for various $p_\\mathrm{T}$ intervals as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. High-multiplicity (HM) events show azimuthal narrowing of jets compared to minimum bias (MB) events, though this difference diminishes at higher $p_\\mathrm{T}$. These findings suggest a potential bias in the commonly used low-multiplicity template method of flow extraction.\r\n\r\nThe measurements are compared with various model calculations, including PYTHIA8, PYTHIA String shoving, EPOS, AMPT, and JETSCAPE, with jet quenching on and off. This presentation offers final results on jet fragmentation functions in HM and MB events from LHC Run 2 as well as preliminary results from the larger statistics LHC Run 3 pp collisions. The transverse momentum fraction of leading strange hadrons in mini-jets is also measured to investigate hadronization and potential medium effects.",

          "description": "Experimental data on the interaction between vector mesons and nucleons are a crucial input for understanding the pattern of in-medium chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) and dynamically generated excited nucleon states. However, accessing these interactions is hampered by the short lived nature of the vector mesons, making traditional scattering experiments unfeasible. In recent years the ALICE Collaboration performed femtoscopy studies with particle pairs produced in nucleus nucleus collisions to investigate the interactions on challenging systems like ϕ—p.\r\nLeveraging the excellent PID capabilities of the ALICE experiment, coupled with the copious production of $\\rho^0$ mesons and protons at the LHC in pp collisions, ALICE presents the first-ever measurement of the $\\rho^0$–p correlation function as a function of the relative momentum. The data are interpreted employing calculations within the framework of unitarised chiral perturbation theory in a coupled-channel ansatz. This measurement represents an unprecedented opportunity to study the nature of the excited N, in particular N(1700) and N(1900), unveiling if these states are molecular in nature and shedding light on possible signatures of CSR at LHC energies.",

Now, with Run 3 data, the study is extended, reaching the low multiplicity regime. The resonance source model, which accounts for the effects of strong decaying resonances, allows comparison of source size dependence on multiplicity in pp collisions with results from larger systems.\r\nThese results provide a new framework for exploring radial flow effects on source scaling and offer a benchmark for theoretical models on collective phenomena in small colliding systems. They are also  essential for coalescence models addressing nuclear cluster productio and serve as a crucial reference, by fixing the emission source, for high-precision studies of interaction potentials in hadron–hadron pairs with strangeness and charm using ALICE Run 3 data.",

Femtoscopic correlations provide a powerful tool for measuring the size of the homogeneity region at kinetic freeze-out. In this analysis, we measure femtoscopic correlations within jets produced in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, using the full LHC Run-2 dataset collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The correlation function, $C_2$, is evaluated as a function of relative momentum, $q_{\\text{inv}}$, for different ranges of average transverse momentum and transverse mass of constituent pairs, categorized by the average number of charged particles within the jet. The analysis is performed in the \"jet frame\", where particle kinematics are defined relative to the jet axis. By modeling the source distribution with a Gaussian function, we aim to extract $R_{\\text{inv}}$ and $\\lambda$, which characterize the particle-emitting source within jets. This approach is expected to offer deeper insights into jet substructure in high-multiplicity environments.",

Unfortunately, the decays of b hadrons, which are typically cascading, obscure the parton level branching, by filling the radiative dead cone. To circumvent this, one may study exclusive b-hadron decays, but one then sacrifices the vast majority of the b-jet cross section. We have implemented a technique to partially reconstruct the b-hadrons by aggregating their charged hadron decay products, dramatically improving the sensitivity to the underlying QCD splitting. Using this technique, we report the first measurements of the soft drop groomed momentum fraction and jet radius for b-jets, as well as the b-jet charged fragmentation function.",

          "description": "Coherent photoproduction of vector meson (VM) in heavy-ion ultrapheripheral collisions (UPCs) is highly sensitive to the gluon distributions within heavy nuclei, making it a powerful tool for probing the nuclear gluonic structure. It is of particular interest for investigating nonlinear dynamics such as gluon saturation and nuclear shadowing effects in the small Bjorken-x region. The mass of VM determines the energy scale of the photonuclear interactions, meaning that measurements of different VMs provide varying sensitivities to these nonlinear dynamics. In particular, the measurement of coherent $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction provides a unique opportunity to explore the nuclear gluonic structure at the highest energy scales among these processes. However, due to the extremely low production rate, a direct measurement of coherent $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction in heavy-ion UPCs has not yet been achieved. In this talk, we will present the first observation of coherent $\\Upsilon$ photoproduction of a heavy nucleus using the dataset from PbPb UPCs at 5.02 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment. The differential cross section will be presented as a function of $\\Upsilon$ rapidity in the range $0<|y|<2.4$. Additionally, the nuclear suppression factor will be presented. The results will be compared to theoretical model calculations, and the relevant physics implications will be discussed.",

We are studying the production cross section of $\\rho^{0}$ mesons in PbPb UPCs at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, having an integrated luminosity of 1.68 $\\mu b^{−1}$, with the CMS detector. The contributions from the continuum and the resonant part of the coherent production of pions will be shown. The differential cross-section $d\\sigma / dy$ of $\\rho^{0}$ is reported as a function of its rapidity for a wide window of $0 < |y| < 2.4$. The two-way ambiguity problem in such a symmetric Pb-Pb system is addressed by separating out the low and high energy photons using the neutron tagging mechanism. We will present the rapidity differential cross sections in these different forward neutron multiplicity classes and discuss its physics implications.",

          "description": "A key objective of high-energy nuclear physics is the search for the onset of gluon saturation phenomena in the limit of extreme gluon densities. Photon-induced vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions (UPCs) offers a unique and powerful probe of the gluon distribution in nuclei. The $\\phi$ meson, with its mass around 1 GeV, lies at the boundary of hard scales between the perturbative and nonperturbative QCD regimes, making it uniquely suited to probe the transition between these two domains. However, the significant challenge in detecting those extremely low transverse momentum (around 100 MeV) kaons from exclusive $\\phi$ decays has hindered the measurement of its production in UPCs for the past decades. In this talk, we present the first observation and measurement of exclusive $\\phi$ photoproduction via the $K^+K^-$ decay channel in PbPb UPCs at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV, using the CMS detector with a novel low-p$_T$ reconstruction technique. The differential cross sections for coherent $\\phi$ meson photoproduction are reported as a function of $\\phi$ rapidity. The results are compared to various theoretical models and provide new insights into the small-$x$ nuclear gluonic structure at a critical scale.",

On the one hand, constraining the importance of short- and long-distance splittings in PbPb collisions is required to characterize the mechanisms of charm and beauty energy loss. On the other hand, measuring the rates of g \\to c\\bar{c} and g \\to b\\bar{b} splittings in the medium can provide a qualitatively new way to study quenching. Recent theoretical studies show that the same framework (BDMPS) predicting an enhancement of g \\to gg splittings in the QGP also predicts an enhancement of the probability of g \\to c\\bar{c} splittings. In this contribution, we will present recent measurements that constrain heavy-quark gluon splitting processes using heavy-flavor correlations and jet-substructure techniques in pp and PbPb collisions. We will also discuss the first measurement of the fraction of g \\to c\\bar{c} -tagged jets in PbPb and pp collisions at the LHC as a function of jet transverse momentum. This study will provide the first experimental constraints on the predicted enhancement of g \\to c\\bar{c} splittings in the QGP",

          "description": "Quarkonia are versatile tools to probe the dynamics of heavy quarks and of bound states at various scales in heavy ion collisions. While their prompt production rate mainly results from interactions between charm quarks and the medium constituents, the significant fraction of charmonia originating from the decay of B hadrons (nonprompt charmonia) offers a proxy for the behavior of beauty quarks as well. In addition, measurements at high transverse momenta ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) provide new experimental handles for the study of in-medium energy loss of color charges. We report the most precise nuclear modification factor results of prompt and nonprompt J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) mesons, including ratios among these contributions, thanks to the large sample of lead-lead (PbPb) collisions data recorded by the CMS experiment. The prompt measurements extend beyond the highest $p_\\mathrm{T}$ ranges ever reported for quarkonia in heavy ion collisions. The results are discussed together with the measurements of the elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow coefficients for similar charmonium contributions in order to establish a comprehensive picture of the fate of heavy quark bound states throughout the time evolution of the medium. Finally, the precision of the nonprompt data will constrain the degree of interaction of beauty quarks within the quark-gluon plasma.",

The results are obtained in the helicity and Collins-Sopper frames and compared with the corresponding measurements in pp collisions. Until now, all studies of quarkonium suppression in heavy ion collisions have assumed unpolarized production in the computation of the detection acceptance. The observed suppression patterns could be caused (to a large extent) by variations in quarkonium polarization rather than by a genuine medium-induced modification of the production yields. Polarization measurements represent an important step in establishing a comprehensive picture of the production and suppression of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium.",

In fact, the contribution of double parton scattering (DPS) in nuclear collision in the total charm cross section is significant in LHC energies. By studying double charm correlation, one can extract information about the contribution of DPS production. Also, the correlation from single scattering is used to better understand higher order contribution in initial $c\\bar{c}$ production. In this study we present the double charm hadron production in pPb collision data, taken with the CMS detector in LHC run 2 pPb data.

          "description": "Measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons provide stringent tests of the Standard Model and potential hints of physics beyond the Standard Model. These measurements for electrons and muons are among the most precisely measured quantities in physics. However, due to the short lifetime of the tau lepton, it is impossible to measure its anomalous magnetic moment through traditional methods, such as spin precession measurements. The CMS experiment follows a comprehensive approach to measure this quantity in complementary phase spaces of ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions. We will report the latest measurements of the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton using ultraperipheral PbPb collisions recorded by the CMS experiment during Run 2. In addition, the luminosity for PbPb running has been measured using the photo-production of muon pairs. This offers the promise of reducing systematic uncertainties on future measurements",

Investigating this asymmetry, particularly at forward rapidities, offers a novel avenue to probe jet-medium dynamics. Using the PbPb and pp data at $\\sqrt{s_{{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV collected by the CMS detector, the near-side jet peak of two-particle correlation functions have been examined to explore jet modifications and novel boost invariance phenomena in forward rapidity. The peak exhibits substantial broadening along the longitudinal ($\\Delta\\eta$) axis from peripheral to central PbPb collisions, indicating energy loss by the progenitor parton. A significant rapidity-dependent asymmetry in associated particle yields has been observed for the first time, with a pronounced difference between $\\Delta\\eta > 0$ and $\\Delta\\eta < 0$ that increases at forward rapidity and in central PbPb collisions. This finding, particularly evident for high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles, points to a potential violation of boost invariance at forward rapidity. Comparisons with different theoretical models will be discussed to understand the influence of jet-medium interactions on jet structure.",

          "description": "It has been proposed to search for thermal and collective properties arising from parton-fragmentation processes by examining high jet charged-constituent multiplicities ($N_{j,ch}$) in proton-proton (pp) collisions [1]. Initial studies that tested this proposal using the PYTHIA 8 event generator with the Monash tune, incorporating multiparton interactions (MPI) and the MPI-based colour reconnection (CR) model, did not reveal any strangeness enhancement, nor provide conclusive evidence for the presence of radial flow. In this contribution, we expand upon the proposed Monte Carlo study by eliminating selection biases associated with triggering on charged particle multiplicities. We disable MPI to focus exclusively on jet fragments. We analyse pp collisions at √s=13 TeV simulated with PYTHIA 8, exploring different implementations of the generator: thermodynamical string fragmentation and the standard Lund fragmentation model, considering various CR models. Surprisingly, the thermodynamical string fragmentation model predicts a hint of strangeness enhancement in jets. Additionally, the light-flavor baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of $j_T$ exhibit similarities across all PYTHIA 8 implementations, and hint at radial flow-like effects. In contrast, the ratio of heavy-flavor hadrons (Λ$^+_c$/D$^0$) at low $j_T$ as a function of $N_{j,ch}$ shows a similar trend to that observed as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in soft data, suggesting that colour string junctions may play an important role in jet development [2].\r\n\r\n[1] A.

Given the complexity of QGP-like phenomena in small-collision systems, a multi-observable analysis is an effective method for investigating the origins of collectivity. We present the latest measurements of multi-particle observables, including multiple-particle correlations, cumulants, flow coefficients, symmetric cumulants, and nonlinear flow, in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV using ALICE Run 3 data. The initial stages are characterized by flow coefficients $v_n$ and nonlinear flow coefficients $v_{4,22}$ and $\\chi_{4,22}$. Event-by-event properties of the initial stage are evaluated through symmetric cumulant measurements.\r\nWith the highest luminosity achieved to date, these observations are expected to explore various mechanisms within the collisions and provide unprecedented precision and unique insights into QGP properties and initial conditions in small-collision systems.",

However, the hydrodynamic description of anisotropic flow deviates from the data in ultra-central collisions. \r\nAn octupole deformation of the $\\textbf{$^{208}$Pb}$ nuclei has been proposed as a remedy to improve the modeling of the measured $v_{3} \\{2\\} / v_{2} \\{2\\}$ ratio. Such a deformation should manifest in triangular flow fluctuations via measurements of the $v_3\\{4\\}/v_3 \\{2\\}$ ratio.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we present multi-particle elliptic flow measurements of the coefficient $v_{n}\\{m\\}$ in Pb--Pb collisions with LHC Run 3 data over the full centrality range. We will also present measurements from \r\nultra-central collisions and discuss whether there is experimental evidence for an octupole deformation.",

          "description": "Momentum transport in a medium is characterized quantitatively by its shear and bulk viscosities. The shear viscous coefficient ($\\eta$) governs the momentum transport transverse to the hydrodynamic flow while its bulk counterpart ($\\zeta$) does the same along the flow. In the context of quark gluon plasma (QGP), both $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$ are very important transport coefficients, controlling phenomenologically important quantities such as the QGP thermalization time, sound attenuation length, elliptic flow, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that large initial magnetic fields (which subsequently decay) are produced in the heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, which have been shown to influence the evolution of the QGP medium. However, most studies in the literature are made with the assumption of a constant magnetic field.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation type collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time and conversely decrease with the strength of the magnetic field.  To connect these observations with the experiment we have obtained the thermalization time, the sound attenuation length and other various phenomenologically significant quantities, using our results of $\\eta$ and $\\zeta$.",

          "description": "Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) is a heavy-ion physics experiment designed to probe the QCD phase diagram at high densities. It is being installed at the Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany, and will use a beam from the new SIS-100 accelerator. The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the core tracking detector of CBM, tasked with achieving high-precision measurements of particle tracks and momentum. Currently, a prototype system, comprising several detector subsystems, including a scaled version of the STS called mSTS is undergoing extensive testing and data taking in the miniCBM (mCBM) experiment using the existing SIS-18 accelerator of the GSI, Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt. This testing initiative is critical for validating hardware and software in realistic experimental conditions and ensures their performance in online data read-out, processing, and analysis of complex event topologies detected by the mCBM's subsystems.\r\n\r\nWe will present our comprehensive study of data rates achievable with the mSTS detector system, emphasizing results from simulations and experimental runs taken during the year 2024. Using UrQMD-based minimum bias events for Ni-Ni collisions at a beam momentum of 1.93 AGeV/c, we simulate the expected detector performance in a realistic free-streaming readout with an additional beam background simulated with GEANT4. We will present in a poster a comparative analysis of the simulations with data collected during the experimental campaign in 2024. The study will provide insights into the scaling and optimization required for full-scale implementation in CBM.",

          "description": "The Silicon Tracking System (STS) in the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) Experiment at FAIR’s SIS100\r\naccelerator, aims to precisely track charged particles and determine their momenta. Its 876 double-sided micro-\r\nstrip sensors are the means to accomplish this task in the high multiplicity environment of heavy ion collisions\r\nwith high spatial, temporal and momentum resolution. A scaled down version of CBM is installed at the SIS18\r\naccelerator and it serves as a full-system test-setup for the capabilities of the future experiment. The m(ini)CBM\r\nexperiment has outgrown its diminutive prefix by showing promising results in the operational and scientific realms.\r\nAt the core of mCBM resides mSTS, with 3 stations and a total of 12 sensors is able to contribute to the global\r\ntrack reconstruction. The goal of this work is to explore the particle identification (PID) capabilities of mSTS by\r\nmeasuring the collected charge from traversing ionizing particles, which is related to energy loss; this task relies on\r\na correct charge calibration and noise suppression of mSTS data. In the absence of a magnetic field, momentum\r\nmeasurements are not possible, but using the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector of mCBM we can extract the particle\r\nvelocity and correlate it with dE\r\ndx data from mSTS to show the behavior of multiple particle species. The data for\r\nthis work was taken from the May 2024 beam-time of mCBM@SIS18",

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will be installed at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It aims to explore the phase structure of strongly interacting (QCD) matter at large net-baryon densities and moderate temperatures by means of heavy-ion collisions in the energy range $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9$ GeV. A key observable for the anticipated first order phase transition or even critical point is electromagnetic radiation from the dense system. \r\n\r\nElectron identification will be performed with a large ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector followed by a transition radiation detector (TRD). The RICH detector will use CO$_2$ as radiator gas allowing for electron-pion separation of up to 6-8 GeV/c. The RICH detector design is at an advanced stage with construction of first elements already ongoing. Key elements for the RICH detector are the mirror system and the photon detector. \r\n\r\nThis poster presentation will focus on the aspects important for the mirror system which has to ensure high quality, high efficiency Cherenkov photon reflection with low material budget. This requires thin, high reflectivity mirrors featuring a homogeneous surface. These mirrors then have to be fixed in a low weight but stable holding structure allowing for precise alignment and alignment control. Prototypes of all elements have been investigated and constructed allowing for a complete design of the full mirror wall. Start of construction is planned for early spring 2025. \r\n\r\nWork supported by BMBF (05P21PXFC1, 05P24PX1, 05P21RGFC1, 05P24RG6).",

          "description": "Resonances can give us multiple ways to probe the properties of the QCD matter created in nucleus-nucleus collisions at different time scales. Due to a short lifetime of about $4 fm/c$, $K^{*0}$ will primarily decay inside the fireball formed after the collision. Their decay daughters may undergo various in-medium effects, such as rescattering and regeneration. The resonance to non-resonance yield ratio, $K^{*0}$/K, can help shed light on these in-medium effects. Study of the properties of $K^{*0}$ can help us understand the lifetime and particle interactions during the hadronic phase.\r\n\r\n  In this poster, we will present measurements of $K^{*0}$ production in Au+Au collisions at  = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR BES-II experiment. The transverse momentum spectra, rapidity densities, and average transverse momentum of $K^{*0}$ will be presented as functions of collision centrality and beam energy. The $K^{*0}/K$ yield ratios will be presented for different collision centrality intervals and beam energies. These yield ratios will be compared to those obtained at higher collision energies and physics implications will be discussed.",

          "description": "In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction has been recognized as one of the most sensitive probes of the gluon structure in nucleons and nuclei. Recently, STAR published differential measurements on photoproduced J/$\\psi$ in ultra-peripheral d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. These results provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations in both light and heavy nuclei. Compared to d+Au and Au+Au collisions, the collision system size in isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}Ru$ + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}Zr$ + $^{96}_{40}Zr$) lies in between. Therefore, the measurement of coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction in isobaric UPCs offers a unique opportunity to study the system size dependence of gluon evolution.\r\n\r\n In this poster, we present the differential cross sections of photoproduced coherent J/$\\psi$ as a function of rapidity (y) in $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) UPCs at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results will also be shown for different combinations of neutron emission, where neutrons are detected by zero degree calorimeters, which help resolve the photon-gluon emitter ambiguity. More importantly, these data provide crucial constraints on the system size dependence of the gluon structure within nuclei in the kinematic range x$_{parton}$, the momentum fraction carried by the gluon, $\\sim 0.015-0.03 $. The results are compared with theoretical model calculations and previous STAR measurements, and the physics implications are discussed.",

Hypertriton $\\rm {}^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ ($np\\Lambda$) and $\\rm {}^{4}_{\\Lambda}H$ ($nnp\\Lambda$) are the two simplest observed hypernuclei. The $\\rm {}^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ is the loosest bound hypernucleus, with a $\\Lambda$ binding energy of $\\sim$0.1 MeV, while the $\\rm {}^{4}_{\\Lambda}H$ is more strongly bound, with a $\\Lambda$ binding energy of $\\sim$2 MeV. Precise measurements of $\\rm {}^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ and $\\rm {}^{4}_{\\Lambda}H$ yields in heavy ion collisions provide important guidance on the understanding of hypernuclei production mechanisms as well as the role of the hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interaction in hypernuclei formation. The second phase of the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC (BES-II) offers a great opportunity to investigate collision energy and system size dependence of hypernuclei production.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the measurements of the production yields of $\\rm {}^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ and $\\rm {}^{4}_{\\Lambda}H$ and their ratios to $\\Lambda$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV will be presented. The rapidity (y) and centrality dependence of the production yields (dN/dy) of $\\rm {}^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ and $\\rm {}^{4}_{\\Lambda}H$ will also be reported. The physics implications of these results will be discussed together with theoretical model calculations.",

          "description": "Investigating collective behavior due to the formation of a fluid-like medium in small collision systems has been a significant focus in the field. A tell-tale signature of this would be the medium's response to the initial state in small collision systems, as predicted by fluid-dynamic models.\r\n\r\nRecent RHIC studies of small systems have shown a hierarchy of elliptic anisotropy coefficients ($v_2$($^{3}$He+Au) $\\sim$ $v_2$(d+Au) $>$ $v_2$($p$+Au)) suggesting fluid-dynamic behavior even in the smallest systems. This raises the question: could a photo-nuclear collision, such as $\\gamma$+Au also exhibit signatures of collectivity? Notably, signatures of collectivity have been investigated in high-multiplicity, high energy $\\gamma$+$p$/Pb collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\nThis poster explores anisotropic flow in $\\gamma$+Au processes at RHIC by triggering ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. At this collision energy, the maximum photon-nucleon center of mass energy $W_{\\gamma N}^{\\rm max}$ $\\approx$ 34.7 GeV [1], an energy between d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19 GeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 GeV, previously performed at RHIC. For both $\\gamma$+Au and d+Au, the exact multiplicity range is accessible at STAR, making d+Au a suitable baseline system for comparison. Furthermore, the STAR detector’s extended rapidity coverage, with mid and forward rapidity upgrades ($|\\eta| < 1.5$ and $2.1 < |\\eta| < 5.1$) enables the triggering and analysis of photo-nuclear processes. Preliminary results will present $v_2$ and $v_3$ in $\\gamma$+Au collisions at multiplicities and energy comparable to those of d+Au, where collectivity has already been observed. These results will provide new insights into collectivity in small collision systems, emphasizing the role of initial-state effects and collective behavior in understanding the evolution of the fluid-like medium created in various collision systems at RHIC. \r\n\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] A.J.

The UE are defined as those aspects of p−p collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest\r\nof the proton. The conventional approach of studying underlying events is usually carried out by defining topological regions with respect to the leading particle in an event. The transverse region\r\nis generally sensitive to UE and various classifiers have been used to discriminate the extent of UE activity regions. The production of identified particles like π±, K±, p, K0S , and Λ0 are studied\r\nin different ranges of transverse activity classifier in p−p collisions at √s = 13 TeV using pQCD inspired PYTHIA 8 event generator. A comparative analysis of the identified particle spectra, mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum has been carried out with respect to ST and the performance of this new observable is gauged by comparing the results with previously defined RT\r\nobservable",

The use of jets as a probe in p+A and A+A collisions allows access to the interaction of the hard-scattered partons with the nuclear environment and is sensitive to a wide range of scales. Using calorimetric jets constructed from the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the hadronic being first of its kind at midrapidity at RHIC, we can study the jet's structure to learn more about the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced during heavy ion collisions. This poster will outline the method used to construct purely calorimetric jets from underlying event subtracted calorimeter towers, by first clustering calorimeter towers into anti-kT R = 0.2 “constituent” jets and then clustering the constituent jets into larger R jets for substructure study. We will show the performance on a set of simulated Pythia8 simulations and present the status of the analysis of the p+p collisions dataset recently collected by sPHENIX in Run-24.",

          "description": "Entanglement Enabled Spin Interference (EESI), an example of the Cotler-Wilczek process, was used to measure the structure of nuclei and neutron skins in ultraperipheral (UPC) Au+Au and U+U collisions. Study of the interference in peripheral collisions provides novel information on the impact parameter dependence, the entanglement criteria, and wavefunction decoherence. On one hand, the medium created in such collisions can act as a semi-opaque screen and decohere or weaken the interference effect. On the other hand, the interference is expected to be stronger as the impact parameter decreases. Furthermore,  it remains unclear whether the coherence of the photon/pomeron emitters can be preserved, despite the breakup of nuclei in hadronic interactions. \r\n\r\nIn this poster we will present the $p_{T}$ and centrality dependence of the $\\left\\langle 2cos(2\\Delta\\phi) \\right\\rangle$ modulation of photoproduced $\\rho$ mesons in peripheral Au+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200\\:\\mathrm{GeV}$ collisions measured with the STAR experiment. The data will be compared to theoretical model calculations. The interpretation of the results will be discussed in the framework of the Cotler-Wilczek process and future opportunities for nuclear physics will be proposed.",

          "description": "In this study, the phase structure of the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in (2 + 1) dimensions for non-zero µ and non-zero T is explored. This work complements previous works in 1+1 dimensions for finite N and 2+1 dimensional infinite and finite N results (at zero chemical potential). The Functional Renormalization Group is used to calculate the effective potential. Within the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), the computation of the effective action can be further simplified to a diffusion type equation with a sink/source. The resulting Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is then solved with existing hydrodynamic solving techniques. With this setup, the phase diagram in the µ-T plane is calculated.",

          "description": "Lattice QCD predicts a phase transition from hadronic matter to the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at high temperature and low baryon chemical potential. The QGP can be created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where dileptons are produced throughout the entire evolution and do not involve strong interactions. As a result, they carry original information about their emission source, and are therefore suggested as the ideal probes of hot and dense medium properties. In particular, the invariant mass distribution of thermal dielectrons is not subjected to blue-shift effects, which enables the extraction of the average temperature of the hot QCD medium at different stages of the evolution.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we report the measurements of the thermal dielectron production in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. The invariant mass and transverse momentum spectra of the thermal dielectrons will be compared with theoretical calculations. The average temperature extracted from thermal dielectrons in the low-mass and intermediate-mass regions will be presented as a function of baryon chemical potential and compared with those from other collision energies and systems. These measurements will shed new light on the understanding of the QGP evolution and the in-medium properties of the $\\rho$ meson.",

          "description": "The centrality estimation in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC is typically based on measuring charged-particle multiplicity or zero-degree energy. The former, however, induces a bias on the hardness of the proton-nucleon collisions, resulting in deviations from the binary nucleon-nucleon scaling of hard processes. In contrast, the energy deposited at zero degrees, i.e. at forward rapidities, by slow nucleons is shown to be insensitive to such a multiplicity bias.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, an alternative centrality estimator based on a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, is proposed to study proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision 5.02 TeV using PYTHIA 8 Angantyr. According to studies performed in pp collisions with PYTHIA 8, the flattenicity classifier shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions. It is less affected by selection biases towards larger transverse momenta than the multiplicity-based estimators. The results are compared with those obtained using other centrality estimators based on charged-particle multiplicity, at both mid and forward pseudorapidity. The identified particle production for the different estimators is also presented to explore the effects of multiparton interactions and colour reconnection.",

Understanding the interplay between jets from the collision’s hard scattering and soft particle emission in the region azimuthally transverse to the event’s hardest jet can inform our understanding of contributions to jet events in proton-proton collisions from multiple parton interactions as well as final and initial state radiation. The sPHENIX calorimeter system, featuring both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters with full azimuthal coverage and wide rapidity acceptance, is well suited to make high-resolution measurements of jets and energy measurements of the underlying event transverse to the hard scattering in jet events. This poster reports preliminary results of the underlying event as a function of jet properties using data collected by sPHENIX from RHIC Run 24 p+p collisions at center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV.",

          "description": "The large angular momentum generated in non-central heavy-ion collisions contributes to the formation of vorticity within the medium, which subsequently induces polarization of particles with non-zero spin. The global polarization of Λ-hyperons near mid-rapidity increases at lower energies, which can be attributed to the correlation between angular momentum and enhanced baryon stopping. Recent model predictions\r\nsuggest that the decay products of polarized hyper-nucleus (${}^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H) are highly sensitive to their spin structure [1]. Additionally, in regions of high baryon density, the enhanced\r\nproduction of ${}^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H makes their polarization measurement feasible.\r\nIn order to understand the spin structure of the ${}^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H hyper-nucleus as well as its production mechanism, we have carried out a systematic study of the global polarization of\r\nthe ${}^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H hyper-nucleus using 3 GeV Au+Au collisions with about 2 billion events collected during 2021 by STAR. Both 2-body and 3-body decays are used for the reconstruction of the ${}^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H. Collision centrality and rapidity dependence of the polarization will be presented. Finally, the results will be compared with model predictions based on different assumptions of spin structures.\r\n\r\n[1] Kai-Jia Sun, Dai-Neng Liu, Yun-Peng Zhen, Jin-Hui Chen, Che Ming Ko, and Yu-Gang Ma.

          "description": "The $\\phi$ meson is an excellent probe of the partonic phase due to its small hadronic cross-section, making it less influenced by late-stage hadronic interactions compared to other hadrons. In the energy range of the STAR Beam Energy Scan II (BES II), the directed flow ($v_1$) of net-baryons has been suggested as a sensitive probe of the equation of state of hot and dense matter. The $\\phi$ meson, with its mass close to that of the proton but with strange ($s\\bar{s}$) quark content, provides a unique test for understanding the differences between net-baryon and meson directed flow.\r\nIn this poster, we will present the measurements of $\\phi$ meson directed flow in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 3 - 4.5$ GeV Au+Au collisions from the RHIC-STAR experiment utilizing the fixed target datasets. The rapidity dependence of directed flow and its slope for the $\\phi$ meson  will be presented as a function of beam energy and compared with predictions from the AMPT-HC and JAM models.",

          "description": "In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, several nontrivial physics phenomena (e.g. collective anisotropic flow, jet quenching, etc.) can lead to persistent event-by-event azimuthal anisotropies in particle distributions, which are traditionally quantified with Fourier harmonics $v_n$. Besides the conventional measurements of individual $v_n$ harmonics, further independent information about different stages in heavy-ion collisions can be extracted from multiharmonic $v_n$ correlations, using recently developed Symmetric Cumulants (SC) and Asymmetric Cumulants (AC). These novel observables are particularly suitable for Bayesian studies, after it was demonstrated that they exhibit a better sensitivity to model parameters than the previously used observables.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf particular interest is a differential measurement of SC and AC observables as a function of transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}$, because this enables the separation of the contribution to $v_n$ harmonics from collective flow at low $p_{\\rm T}$ and jet quenching at large $p_{\\rm T}$.\r\n\r\nThis contribution presents the differential measurements of SC and AC observables in Run 3 Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.36$~TeV as a function of kinematic variables. Dependence on collision energy is investigated as well by comparing results for SC and AC observables obtained from Pb--Pb collisions in Run 3 at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.36$~TeV and Run 1 at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$~TeV.",

Over the past decade, the scientific community has extensively studied the possibility of a system analogous to quark-gluon plasma, predicted in heavy nuclei collisions, also existing in collisions involving light nuclei and protons. We have reanalysed the data published by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. We present the dependence of the mean transverse momenta obtained in the soft and soft+hard (mixed) parts. Finally, we also discuss possible refinements of the analyses concerning the use of statistical parameters of higher order, aimed at a more detailed way of comparing the models with data.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] G.

          "description": "Conservation of energy and momentum leads to interesting signatures in small systems such as $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collisions at the LHC, and $d$-Au collisions at RHIC. For large systems, such as those created in heavy-ion collisions, the production of rare high-$p_T$ probes is a small perturbation. But for small systems, hard probes can both infuse or extract a significant fraction of the energy and momentum from mid to forward rapidities. Depending on the energy and exchanged transverse momentum in the hard process, there may be an excess or a depletion of the energy available for both bulk evolution and other hard/semi-hard processes.\r\nWe investigate correlations between hard probes and bulk dynamics in small systems at LHC energies. We use a multi-stage approach where the hard scatterings are sampled first, followed by an initial state shower, yielding the energy and momenta of the originating hard partons, which are then subtracted from the incoming nucleons. The remaining energy is used for soft-particle production, modeled by 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics. We present results for the nuclear modification factor as a function of event activity, and the collision event activity dependence on the high $p_T$ trigger. Comparisons are presented to data from the ATLAS and ALICE experiments. Our results indicate that hard-soft correlations are crucial to understand the dynamics in small systems. We further demonstrate the lack of any energy loss given the small size of the bulk media created in events with hard jets.\r\nThe presence of hard scatterings at sufficiently high energy, for a given $\\sqrt{s}$, will lead to a depletion of the energy available for further hard interactions in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$, or even $d$-$A$ collisions. We explore how this depletion can lead to an anti-correlation of the high-$p_T$ pion and photon yields at RHIC energies, as observed by the PHENIX collaboration.\r\nPartially based on I.

          "description": "We investigate jet production and modification in lead-lead collisions at the LHC energies. The core of the framework is a time-like parton shower, modelled using the recently developed SUBA-Jet framework [1], along with the vHLLE code for the relativistic viscous fluid dynamic evolution of the medium. High-$Q^2$ jet seeds are generated by PYTHIA/Angantyr, while the initial state of the medium is modelled using the $\\mathrm{T_{R}ENTo}$ model. Jet partons lose energy in the medium and hadronize via fragmentation implemented in PYTHIA. At the particlization hypersurface, the medium decouples into hadrons, with final-state hadronic rescatterings simulated by SMASH hadronic transport. In our simulation jet hadrons interact with hadrons produced by particlization of the medium.\r\nWith this framework, called J-PHASE Generator, we examine modifications induced by QGP using SUBA-Jet, while also examining how the hadronic phase affects jet properties. Conventionally, jet modification is attributed solely to the QGP phase, supported by assumptions about formation proper time of jet hadrons and the low value of jet transport coefficient in the hadronic phase. However, we argue that these assumptions are $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$-dependent, and thus, the full jet structure may undergo observable modifications even in the hadronic phase. This we show through various inclusive and exclusive jet observables.\r\n\r\n[1] Iu. Karpenko, A. Lind, M. Rohrmoser, J. Aichelin, P.-B. Gossiaux, arXiv: 2404.14579 [hep-ph]",

          "description": "The production of beauty hadrons in proton-proton (pp), proton-lead (p-Pb), and lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions offers critical insights into heavy-flavor hadrons production mechanisms across different collision systems. In pp collisions, beauty hadron production can be used to test the predictions of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD), providing constraints on parton distribution functions and hadronization processes. In p-Pb collisions, beauty quarks serve as sensitive probes of cold nuclear matter effects such as shadowing, while in Pb-Pb collisions, they offer an excellent probe of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) dynamics and its evolution throughout different stages in heavy-ion collision. This work presents a Bayesian unfolding data-driven measurements of the open beauty hadron production, utilizing ALICE and LHCb data to recover full kinematic information from the measured non-prompt $\\rm D^{0}$ and non-prompt $\\rm J/\\psi$. The beauty hadron production cross sections are found to be perfectly consistent across different decay channels and from two Collaborations. The precision of new results significantly improves upon worldwide measurements. This method has been validated in pp collision at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV [1].\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the data-driven measurements of the $p_{\\rm T}$-integrated and differential open beauty production cross section $\\rm{d}\\sigma/\\rm{d}y\\rm{d} p_{\\rm T}$, $\\rm{d}\\sigma/\\rm{d}y$, and the total $\\rm{b}\\rm\\overline{b}$ cross section $\\sigma_{\\rm {b}\\overline{b}}$ in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collision at midrapidity at LHC energies will be reported. Additionally, we will discuss nuclear modification factors $R_{\\rm pA}$ and $R_{\\rm AA}$ in p-Pb and Pb-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ $\\rm{TeV}$, respectively. All the results will be discussed in comparison with existing measurements and theoretical calculations.\r\nReference:        \r\n[1] X.Bai et. al, JHEP11(2024)018,  arXiv.2405.01444v2",

Several other measurements provided insight into the unexpected collective behaviour similar to the one exhibited in heavy-ion collisions. These properties can be explained by several models, which consider a microscopic description like PYTHIA 8 and a macroscopic treatment as EPOS4. Balance functions have been regarded in the past as a method of investigating the late-stage hadronization found in the presence of a strongly-coupled medium. We present balance functions confronting EPOS4 and PYTHIA 8 in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV to distinguish between these models.",

          "description": "The recent spin polarization measurement of $\\Lambda$-hyperons by the STAR and ALICE Collaboration has created a remarkable interest in the nuclear and high energy physics community to investigate the possible sources for hyperon polarization. It is suggested that in peripheral heavy ion collisions, the initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) manifests the vorticity, which primarily accounts for the spin polarization of the hyperon. Apart from the OAM, there are several other potential sources of vorticity, such as the shear viscosity, magnetic field, inhomogeneous transverse expansion, etc. In the present study, we couple the vorticity, viscosity, and magnetic field within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and estimate the lifetime of the vortical quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fluid. We observe that the coupling of vorticity and viscosity significantly decreases the QGP evolution rate, and the inclusion of the magnetic field makes the evolution further slower. We observed that the medium evolution becomes highly nonlinear if we consider a coupling between vorticity, viscosity and magnetic field. Using the vortical QGP evolution, we obtain the global spin polarization of $\\Lambda$-hyperon. Further, we investigate viscosity and magnetic field impact on the polarization of  $\\Lambda$-hyperon. This study provides a qualitative understanding of the QGP medium evolution and spin-polarization of hyperon in heavy-ion collisions. The details of the results will be presented along with the latest experimental developments in this direction.",

This approach is useful for probing the Dead Cone phenomenon, a predicted suppression of soft gluon radiation in a conical region around the forward axis of a radiating massive quark. We present preliminary findings from analyzing the emission density within the LJP of bottom jets generated in PYTHIA8 simulations. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities for extensions to heavy-ion collisions where medium-induced radiation is expected to fill the Dead Cone, providing a tool to characterize the high temperature phase of the Quark Gluon Plasma.",

          "description": "The spin polarization of hadrons emitted from heavy-ion collisions can serve as a probe of the angular momentum contained within the colliding system. Recent measurements of hyperon global spin polarization at midrapidity from ALICE, STAR, and HADES, spanning a collisional beam energy range from O(1000) to O(1) GeV, have shown a monotonic trend of continually increasing signal with decreasing energy even in the region extremely close to the two-nucleon-mass threshold. This appears surprising, as the angular momentum stopped at midrapidity depends on two competing factors: with decreasing beam energy, the total angular momentum drops quickly while a bigger fraction of the total angular momentum gets stopped in midrapidity. As such, a non-monotonic dependence on beam energy is expected for midrapidity angular momentum, which should first increase with decreasing beam energy and then decrease, approaching zero when beam energy comes down to the threshold.\r\nIn this work, we present a quantitative model (dubbed “Glauber+”) of initial nucleon stopping based on general requirements of energy-momentum conservation in binary collisions. We further use measurements of midrapidity net proton numbers to constrain the key model parameter that characterizes the inelasticity of binary collisions. This allows us to predict the initial angular momentum at midrapidity across a wide range of beam energies, which indeed shows a non-monotonic behavior with a peak around 5 GeV. The discord in the beam energy dependence between initial angular momentum and the observed global spin polarization casts intriguing questions on conventional interpretations assuming a strong positive correlation between them, especially in the very low energy region. The corresponding rapidity distributions of initial angular momentum are also obtained across beam energies, which could provide valuable initial conditions for spin hydrodynamics simulations.",

          "description": "In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets traverse the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and deposit energy into the medium, leading to jet-induced medium response. The medium response takes the form of Mach-cone-like excitations and can modify the internal structure of the jet, affecting many observables, such as jet shape and jet fragmentation function and so on. However, Simulation of jet-induced medium response requires not only a complete model that can accurately describe the evolution of hard and soft partons concurrently, but also substantial computational resources for full-scale simulations. In this study, we trained a generative neural network using a flow model with gamma jet events from Pb $+$ Pb collisions of centrality $0-10\\%$ at 5.02 TeV to estimate the final-state effects of jet-induced medium response. Our findings indicate that with only the initial jet information—namely, the energy-momentum of gamma and the jet, along with their initial positions—the network can accurately predict the positions of the front wake and diffusion wake, and maintain the particle spectrum within the same order of magnitude as the actual data.",

          "description": "One of the major motivations for the planned p--O and O--O collisions at the LHC is to explore the possibilities of small system collectivity. Such transverse collective expansion results in the appearance of long-range azimuthal correlation and is quantified via the coefficients, $v_{\\rm n}$, of Fourier expansion of the azimuthal momentum distribution of the final-state particles. These flow coefficients serve as the medium response to the initial spatial anisotropy and are sensitive to the density profile of the colliding nuclei. Light nuclei such as $^{12}\\rm C$ and $^{16}\\rm O$ are theorized to possess extra stability due to the presence of an $\\alpha$-clustered arrangement of its nucleons. In this context, studies on ultra-relativistic p--A collisions involving $^{12}\\rm C$ or $^{16}\\rm O$ nuclei can serve a dual purpose: exploring small system collectivity along with investigating the effects of a clustered nuclear geometry on the medium anisotropy. With this motivation, for the first time, we study p--O and p--C collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 9.9 TeV through a multi phase transport model (AMPT) simulations. We attempt to explore how an initial $\\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}\\rm O$ and $^{12}\\rm C$ influences the production yield, initial eccentricities and flow coefficients in the final state, in comparison to an unclustered density profile, Sum-Of-Gaussians (SOG). The flow coefficients are estimated via a two-particle Q-cumulant method. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe results show that $\\langle\\epsilon_{2}\\rangle$ varies with centrality in a unique manner for $\\alpha$-clustered p--O and p--C collisions, similar to O--O collisions. However, the centrality dependence of $\\langle\\epsilon_{2}\\rangle$ and $\\langle\\epsilon_{3}\\rangle$ is not effectively carried forward to the final state $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$, owing to lesser participants. We also see that the dependence of $v_{2}$ on centrality is much less in comparison to $v_{3}$, which is reflected in the $v_{3}$/$v_{2}$, $v_{2}$/$\\langle\\epsilon_{2}\\rangle$ and $v_{3}$/$\\langle\\epsilon_{3}\\rangle$ ratios studied in our work. We notice that the $\\alpha$-clustered case shows almost a flatter trend of $v_{3}$ with centrality than the corresponding collisions with a SOG profile, possibly indicating the discretized internal structure of an $\\alpha$-clustered nucleus. Thus, by probing the effects of the nuclear structure employing ultra-relativistic collisions, this work serves as a transport-model-based prediction for the upcoming p--O collisions in the LHC Run$~$3.",

Using realistic parametrizations of the freeze-out conditions, which reproduce well the spectra of protons and pions, we make predictions for deuteron transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra. The best agreement with the experimentally known deuteron yield is obtained if the freeze-out temperature is relatively high and, accordingly, the system size at freeze-out is rather small. In addition, the standard Gaussian distribution of the relative distance between nucleons is replaced by the distribution resulting from their independent and approximately uniform production inside the initial thermal system.",

          "description": "We use open charm production to estimate how far we can see back in time in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. We analyze the transverse momentum distributions of the identified D mesons from pp, p–-Pb and A–-A collisions at the ALICE and STAR experiments covering the energy range from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV up to 7 TeV. While the low-momentum part of the spectra can be associated with particles stemming from a thermal equilibrium, the high-momentum regime follows a power-law-like distribution, resulting from perturbative QCD hadron production. Recent non-extensive thermodynamical models, however, are able to successfully describe the spectra within a unified framework [1]. We discuss the consistency of the resulting Tsallis temperature and non-extensivity parameter, and compare them to the ones of light-flavour hadrons. These results allow us to estimate the production time of D mesons in relation to the light-flavour hadrons [2]. We also explore the species-dependent timescales of formation of particle spectra, as well as provide constrains to the heat capacity of investigated systems [3].\r\n\r\n[1] G. Bíró, G. G.

          "description": "The CBM experiment at FAIR aims to study the properties of dense nuclear matter at the edge of the quark-gluon plasma phase transition. This extreme environment offers a unique opportunity to study hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions through the production and decay of multi-strange particles and hypernuclei. Understanding these interactions is critical for describing the nuclear equation of state at high densities and the structure of neutron stars.\r\nCBM's exceptional capabilities, including the world's highest interaction rate coupled with high-precision tracking and particle identification, enable comprehensive measurements of rare multi-strange particles and double-lambda hypernuclei. This extends to two- and three-body decays with neutral daughters, significantly expanding the accessible decay channels and providing stringent constraints on theoretical models.\r\nThe KFParticle Finder package will be employed to identify the complex topologies of multi-strange particle and double-lambda hypernuclei decays, enabling precise measurements and analysis.\r\nResults of multi-strange particles like $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ reconstruction in the Au+Au collision at FAIR energies will be presented. The possibility of discovering rare double-lambda hypernuclei like ${}^4_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$H, ${}^4_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$n and ${}^6_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$He also will be discussed.\r\nExtensive feasibility studies demonstrate CBM's ability to measure these rare probes with high precision and statistics. The sophisticated analysis of this data will shed light on hyperon-hyperon interactions, paving the way for a comprehensive investigation of hypernuclei at FAIR. These measurements will provide crucial insights into the properties of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions.",

          "description": "The observables computed in simulations of heavy ion collisions are known to be highly sensitive to the initial state of the evolution. Despite advances in the modeling, fully understanding this initial state remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a method to relate final observables to the initial state, described as the sum of an average state and a random linear combination of independent fluctuation modes. We illustrate the approach on Pb-Pb events in fixed centrality classes, and quantify how the modes contribute to final-state observables. We show the importance of both linear and quadratic responses in this evolution, and we highlight how statistical noise can affect simulations including hadronic interactions. Our results provide deeper insight into the impact of fluctuations for heavy ion collisions.",

I use the parity doublet model to investigate the qualitative properties and systematics of the first- to fourth-order cumulants and their ratios. I show that the fluctuations of the positive-parity (e.g. protons) and negative-parity baryons do not qualitatively reflect the fluctuations of the total net-baryon number density at the phase boundaries of the liquid-gas and chiral phase transitions. I qualitatively compare the factorial cumulants for the net-proton and net-baryon number and point to the importance of the non-trivial correlations between various baryon species, in particular to the correlations between protons and neutrons as well as positive- and negative-parity baryonic chiral partners.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- M.

          "description": "The location of critical-point as per quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and the nature of phase transition is the subject of both theoretical and experimental studies. It is observed that local density fluctuations are directly related to the critical behaviour in QCD. As the system approaches phase transition, there is a divergence of the correlation length. The system becomes scale-invariant with particle correlation function having power-law with increasing bin resolution. The correlation function, within the contours of intermittency, used to study these spatial fluctuations is the normalized factorial moments (NFM) derived for the density of particles in the phase space bins. NFMs have essential properties of Poisson noise suppression and sensitivity to high density fluctuations. A two dimensional intermittency analysis is performed for the charged particles generated using EPOS4 in the (η, ϕ) phase space within the acceptance region of central barrel detector of the ALICE experiment at LHC, CERN. Scaling of NFM with number of bins, termed as intermittency, has been observed for the charged particles produced in the recent collider experiments. Here we report on the observations from a similar analysis performed for the charged particles generated in the heavy-ion collision events with EPOS4.",

          "description": "The beam energy scan probes the QCD phase diagram from high temperatures, low densities (high energies) to low temperatures and high densities (low energies). At high energies the system is boost-invariant such that 2+1D simulations using hyperbolic coordinates can reasonably capture most of the dynamical behavior for symmetric collisions, but as one lowers the beam energies the Lorentz contraction decreases (the radius along the beam is comparable to the transverse radius) such that the system requires 3+1D simulations and a later start time to wait for the two nuclei to pass through each other. If one applies hyperbolic coordinates at low energies, the initialization time for hydrodynamics is either extremely late or one needs to dynamically initialize the hydrodynamics using source terms. However, using cartesian coordinates rather than the traditional hyperbolic coordinates would avoid this issue. In this work, we rewrite the 3+1 relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code CCAKE with a generic coordinate system such that we can compare hyperbolic to cartesian coordinates across beam energies. For each beam energy, we identify the optimal coordinate system for simulations (comparing numerical error and code run time).",

A collection of jet observables, including $R_{AA}$, anisotropies, dijet asymmetry, and substructure, is presented to assess the impact of event-by-event medium effects on jets with direct comparisons to JEWEL original longitudinal-only approach and expand upon prior results [1].

          "description": "The ultrarelativistic motion of charges in heavy-ion collisions is responsible for generating extreme electromagnetic fields, with magnetic fields of the order of $10^{18} \\; G$ (for RHIC energies) [1]. However, the fields are very short-lived and their effects on the dynamics of the hot and dense matter produced in the collision are not well understood. In this work, we use a hybrid simulation chain, to investigate the effects that the electromagnetic field generated by the charged participants (and the currents induced by it) on the final state observables and on the hydrodynamic evolution itself. The initial conditions for the energy-momentum tensor and net electric charge 4-current are constructed using AMPT [2,3] and the evolution of the fluid is solved using a newly developed 3+1D hydrodynamic code. The effects of the magnetic field produced by the fluid are studied using a relativistic magnetohydrodynamics approach, neglecting any effects of the shear viscosity.\r\n\r\n 1. D. E. Kharzeev, L. D.

          "description": "We present a systematic Bayesian analysis of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties at finite baryon density using measurements of Au+Au collisions at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program. The theoretical model simulates event-by-event (3+1)D dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion collisions with the state-of-the-art hybrid hydrodynamics and hadronic transport theory. We analyze the model's 20-dimensional posterior distributions obtained using three Gaussian Process emulators with different accuracy and demonstrate the essential role of training an accurate model emulator in the Bayesian analysis [1]. Our analysis provides robust constraints on the Quark-Gluon Plasma's transport properties and various aspects of (3+1)D relativistic nuclear dynamics using heavy-ion measurements from 7.7 to 200 GeV [2]. By running full model simulations with a few parameter sets sampled from the posterior distribution, we make timely predictions for $p_T$-differential observables, anisotropic flow rapidity decorrelation, and flow observables in O+O collisions with systematic theory uncertainties, which can be compared with the upcoming measurements from the STAR Collaboration. Finally, we highlight a detailed experimental design analysis to elucidate how individual experimental observables constrain different model parameters, providing valuable physics insights into the phenomenological model for heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for advancing our understanding of high-energy nuclear physics. We employ DL methods to probe two crucial phenomena: collective flow in small colliding systems and the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nCollective flow is similar between small colliding systems ($p$ $+$ $p$ and $p$ $+$ A collisions) and large colliding systems (peripheral A+A collisions) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  for events with similar multiplicity. To study the differences in collective flow generation mechanism between small and large colliding systems, we employ a point cloud network to identify $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV generated from a multiphase transport model (AMPT). After removing the discrepancies in the pseudorapidity distribution and the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra, we capture the discrepancy in collective flow, revealing an increased distinction with higher final hadron multiplicity and parton scattering cross sections.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the search for chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions has attracted long-term attention. Multiple observables are proposed, but all suffer large background contaminations, especially from collective flow, generating with quark gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. We design a U-Net architecture based on deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the CME signal by reversing the evolution of the CME signal inside the QGP. Trained on AMPT-generated datasets, our model effectively reconstructs the charge separation in phase space, providing a strong AI technique for future experimental search for the CME.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] S.Guo, H.S.Wang, K.Zhou and G.L.Ma, Machine learning study to identify collective flow in small and large colliding systems, Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024), 2305.09937 \r\n[2] S.Guo, L.X.

          "description": "The process of Lévy walk, i.e., movement patterns described by heavy-tailed random walks, play a role in many different phenomena, from chemical and microbiological systems through marine predators to climate change. Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this talk, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to Lévy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric Lévy-stable distribution. We also discuss a possible generalization of this approach to interaction femtoscopy.",

          "description": "We report our new results on the chiral crossover transition in 2+1 flavor QCD on $N_\\tau=8$ lattice using the Mobius domain wall fermion (MDWF) discretization scheme. By performing a high statistics study of the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, $\\chi_{disc}$, we extract a pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{pc}=158.9(-2.1)(+2.6)$ MeV. This is in very good agreement with the pseudo-critical temperature estimated after performing a careful continuum extrapolation of different chiral observables using highly improved staggered quarks [1]. More remarkably the continuum extrapolated data for $\\chi_{disc}$ obtained using highly improved staggered quarks are in excellent agreement with those obtained with MDWF on a finite lattice, highlighting the importance of the role of exact chiral symmetry of lattice fermion operators for the study of crossover transition. We also show our new results on the topological susceptibility in 2+1 flavor QCD with MDWF in the temperature range between $T_{pc}$-$1.2~T_{pc}$, and from its temperature dependence and comparison with $\\chi_{disc}$ we discuss about the effective restoration of the singlet $U_A(1)$ and the non-singlet parts of chiral symmetry corresponding to the two light quark flavors [2].\r\nReferences\r\n1.

          "description": "Relativistic hydrodynamics has been plagued with the problem of causality for a long time. While the proposal of MIS theories resulted in the restoration of causality, it introduced new degrees of freedom with no thermodynamic origin. Recent formulations of first-order hydrodynamics theories of BDNK type, where the hydrodynamic fields have generalized definitions, are both causal, and use only thermodynamically meaningful variables. Looking at the increasing interest in the formulation of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, mostly due to the recent discovery of the spin polarization phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions, we attempt to build a theory of relativistic spin hydrodynamics with such general definitions of the hydrodynamic fields from kinetic theories - first using the extended relaxation time approximation and then using the novel relaxation time approximation.\r\n\r\nPartly based on: arxiv:2408.14462.",

          "description": "The jet quenching phenomenon describes the energy loss and structural modification of jets produced in heavy-ion collisions due to interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Jets are evolving objects with complex structures, offering various observables for studying the quenching effects. However, the extent of jet modification by QGP varies due to multiple factors, including the initial jet creation point within the QGP and the types of parton energy loss. In this study, we use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network trained on jet substructure that includes the parton shower history. The LSTM output provides a jet-by-jet quenching level prediction. Using photon-jet samples from Monte Carlo simulations, we confirmed that these predictions strongly correlate with jet energy loss. Various detector limitations and their impacts on the training results are examined in simulation. Additionally, our ML tool identifies “fake quenching” modifications in pp reference, providing insights into fragmentation bias when studying modifications to jet observables. This study may help disentangle the complex mechanisms of jet quenching and enhance our understanding of the unique QGP system.",

          "description": "The $p_T$-spectrum of the charged particles produced can be described through the fragmentation of color strings by assuming the Schwinger mechanism with heavy-tailed distributions describing the string tension fluctuations. In particular, we discuss the string tension fluctuations described by the $q$-Gaussian distribution and the one derived for the QCD-based Hagedorn function. As a result of the latter, the physics involved in the Hagedorn function can be understood under the string fragmentation scheme. Consequently, the system created in the collision departs from the thermal description, which is corroborated by deriving the temperature fluctuations of these approaches. By analyzing the Higgs boson produced in pp collision at $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV we found that it exhibits the largest possible deviation from the thermal behavior, as well as that its formation occurs in a small region of the system with a very high temperature.",

          "description": "We introduce the ``target jet\" in the forward region of the ion in deep inelastic scattering (DIS) events with a jet radius which depends on the DIS kinematics in order to separate the current and target regions in the laboratory frame. We show that target jet substructure and its correlation with the substructure of the leading jet is sensitive to the internal structure of nucleon and ion, thereby motivating the design of forward detectors to fulfill target jet substructure phenomenology at the future Electron Ion Collider. Combining target jet charge and leading jet charge significantly improves the identification of the hard scattering flavor structure in electron-proton collisions. Furthermore, forward neutron tagging allows an isolation of an almost pure up-quark jet sample, which could be used to enhance sensitivities to flavor-dependent effects such as Sivers asymmetry. We demonstrate the connections between target jet energy flow observables and parton distributions, as well as the mapping between forward nuclei tagging and details of nuclear breakup process such as the location of the DIS nucleon.",

          "description": "The conventional weakly-coupled description of finite-temperature plasmas lead to the appearance of quasi-particles with thermal masses. By incorporating contributions from both the (chromo)electric scale $gT$ and (chromo)magnetic scale $g^2T$, we establish thermal sum rules of quark spectral function for strongly-coupled QCD that respect Fermi-Dirac statistics as required by quantum mechanics. In sharp contrast to weakly-coupled theories, whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (singularities) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling. This reflects the breaking and restoration of Lorentz symmetry in these regimes. The thermal mass vanishes at large coupling in line with phenomenological predictions from Dyson-Schwinger equations and gauge/gravity duality. This result provides new insights into the emergence and mechanism of the QCD transition.",

          "description": "In this talk, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton–proton and peripheral ion–ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is *negative* — that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions [1].\r\n\r\nWe present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. For both models, we first study the elliptic flow response to initial geometrical deformations in a simplified setup using toy models. This allows us to examine the dynamical origin of the negative sign of elliptic flow through its dependence on the ratio of system size to interaction length. We then proceed to look at more realistic scenarios, using the Angantyr model [2] in PYTHIA [3] for the case of string shoving, as well as the parton cascade ALPACA [4] based on the effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe [5]. Both models show a clear transition between negative and positive elliptic flow as a function of system size for the examined small collision systems.\r\n\r\nThe negative sign of elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.\r\n\r\n[1] C.

          "description": "We present a detailed numerical and analytical study of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of Model G, the dynamical universality class relevant to the chiral phase transition. We quench the system from the high temperature, unbroken phase to the broken phase and study the real-time dynamics of the Goldstone modes, i.e. pions. Strikingly, the non-equilibrium evolution of the two-point functions exhibit a regime of exponential growth, a parametric enhancement, and subsequent slow relaxation to equilibrium. We analyze this response using mean-field theory and dynamical critical scaling. The same behavior persists in continuous ramps through the chiral phase transition, and the dynamics exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling. We relate the exponential growth of the two-point functions to a parametric enhancement of soft pion yields relative to thermal equilibrium.",

We study the anisotropic momentum, and angular momentum, diffusion of heavy quarks in this stage. \r\nWe find that the boost-invariant system retains a large amount of anisotropy even for values of the\r\nproper time which are\r\nquite larger than the typical timescale \r\nof the problem, namely the inverse saturation scale\r\n$\\tau=1/Q_s$. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of rapidity-dependent fluctuations leads to a partial tendency to isotropization of the system, and the amount\r\nof isotropization increases with increasing magnitudes of such fluctuations.",

Temperature and energy are two important scales in jet thermalization. In this study, we discretize the collision kernel of scalar theory to directly compute the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the evolution operator, enabling an analysis of the roles of temperature and energy scales. The initial jet is simplified to a Gaussian wave packet for computational efficiency, with transformation matrices introduced for both scales to explore how different settings influence jet thermalization. Our findings highlight the impact of distinct temperature and energy scales on the QGP's non-equilibrium evolution, offering new insights into the thermalization process in high-temperature QCD matter.",

          "description": "We investigate the dissipation rate of a scalar field in the vicinity of the phase transition and the ordered phase, specifically within the universality class of model A. This dissipation rate holds significant physical relevance, particularly in the context of interpreting effective potentials as inputs for dynamical transport simulations, such as hydrodynamics. To comprehensively understand the use of effective potentials and other calculation inputs, such as the functional renormalization group, we conduct a detailed analysis of field dependencies. We solve the functional renormalization group equations on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour to determine the effective potential and dissipation rate for both finite and infinite volumes. Furthermore, we conduct a finite-size scaling analysis to calculate the dynamic critical exponent \r\nz\r\n. Our extracted value closely matches existing values from the literature.",

          "description": "Multiplicity distributions in e+e- and proton-proton collisions analyzed via the combinants method exhibit oscillatory behavior of the modified combinants. The possible sources of these oscillations and their impact on our understanding of the multiparticle production mechanism were discussed [1-5]. The set of combinants, Cj provides a similar measure of fluctuations as the set of cumulant factorial moments, Kq, which are very sensitive to the details of the multiplicity distribution and were frequently used in phenomenological analyses of data. However, while cumulants are best suited to the study of the densely populated region of phase space, combinants are better suited for the study of sparsely populated regions because the calculation of Cj requires only a finite number of probabilities P(N<j). The observed oscillations of the modified combinants are of physical origin and are not experimental artifacts. Modified combinants evaluated from models exhibit oscillatory behavior, though the oscillation period differs from experimental data [6].\r\nIn this presentation, we discuss how this approach can be used in nuclear collisions. We demonstrate how correlation functions can be related to combinants and illustrate how the information about just the sign of these correlation functions can be used in analyses of multiplicity distributions in nuclear collisions. It is argued that measuring couplings of the genuine multi-particle correlation functions could provide cleaner information on possible non-trivial dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n[1] M.

A particular formulation of BS correlation: $C_{BS}=-3\\langle BS \\rangle_c/\\langle S \\rangle^2_c$ (where $\\langle BS \\rangle_c$ is the mix-cumulant of baryon and strangeness number and $\\langle S \\rangle^2_c$ is the second order cumulant of strangeness) has been predicted to be unity for an ideal Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). In contrast, their calculation from the hadron-resonance-gas (HRG) model yields a value around 0.6 at vanishing $\\mu_B$.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we report a study on BS correlation ($C_{BS}$) in p+p and Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV using UrQMD and PYTHIA model. Results on transverse momentum, rapidity acceptance, and multiplicity dependence of calculations will be presented. A systematic study on the effect of multi-strange baryons on the BS correlation will be reported. These results serve as important baselines for experimental data at RHIC.",

          "description": "The initial longitudinal structure of QGP is essential for understanding its formation, evolution, and properties in heavy-ion collisions. However, current flow decorrelation methods are limited by non-flow contamination, restricting access to the QGP's full longitudinal profile. By comparing collisions involving nuclei of similar masses but different deformations, we introduce a new approach that varies the initial conditions independent of non-flow. This method enabled us to uncover multiple components of the longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$) [1] and to develop a novel technique for extracting flow decorrelations across the entire rapidity range [2]. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach using full 3D hydrodynamic and transport models. We reveal that while deformation enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it leaves the long-range component of its longitudinal profile unchanged. Additionally, we discovered two distinct components of the longitudinal structure: a global twisted geometry and localized rapidity fluctuations contributing to short- and medium-range flow decorrelations. This study presents a new way to disentangle long- and short-range flow decorrelations from non-flow backgrounds, providing a concrete example of how leveraging the structure differences between isobar nuclei can help us gain new insights into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] Sources of longitudinal flow decorrelations in high-energy nuclear collisions, https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15006\r\n\r\n[2] Longitudinal Structure of Quark-Gluon Plasma Unveiled Through Nuclear Deformations, https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08749",

Dijet invariant mass measurements in small systems provide a baseline for dijet studies in Pb--Pb collisions, in which dijet properties can act as sensitive probes of jet quenching in the quark-gluon plasma. For this analysis, charged-particle jets are reconstructed with the resolution parameter $R=0.4$. Using the excellent low transverse momentum reach of ALICE, the dijet invariant mass spectrum and the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm{pA}}$ are presented in a mass range from 75 to 150 GeV/$c^2$, which is the lowest mass range reported to date. The results are compared to different Monte Carlo simulations using nuclear PDFs, which suggest that these measurements probe nuclear matter in the antishadowing regime.",

          "description": "Much has been learned about the quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, but one of the most challenging issues that still needs to be addressed is that it reaches thermal equilibrium much earlier than theoretically expected. Color glass condensation (CGC) is a strong candidate for the mechanism by which this occurs, but experimental verification has not yet been successful. In the ALICE experiment, with the aim of experimentally confirming CGC, we are developing Forward Calorimeter (FoCal), which consists of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadron calorimeter, to precisely measure the position and energy of direct photons and photons from $\\pi^0$ decay, which can be the signals of CGC, in the forward region with small x. The FoCal electromagnetic calorimeter consists of low-granularity pad types and high-granularity pixel types, and we are developing a pad type electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E pad). Since FoCal will be installed at forward region of the beam axis where many neutrons will be irradiated, a p-type silicon sensor which has high neutron tolerance is used. To evaluate the performance of the sensor, a neutron irradiation test was conducted at RIKEN-RANS and a beam test experiment was conducted at TOHOKU-ELPH with positrons of various energies injected. In the ALICE experiment, a maximum neutron irradiation amount of about $10^{14} n_{eq}/cm^2$ is expected at the location where FoCal will be installed. In the RANS test, the dose to the silicon sensor was estimated by analyzing the indium foil dose, which has high sensitivity to neutron irradiation, placing around the silicon sensor. The results of the estimation indicate that the neutron dose to the sensor was about $6 × 10^{13} n_{eq}/cm$. The MIP (Minimum Ionizing Particle) signal of neutron-irradiated and of non-irradiated sensors were detected in the beam test data to evaluate the performance change of the sensors. In this poster, we will report on the development status of FoCal-E and discuss the results of the performance evaluation of the silicon sensor using these tests.",

          "description": "Lattice QCD calculations predict that a strongly-coupled QCD matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), can be formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at extremely high temperatures and energy densities. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks ($c, b$) are predominantly produced in the initial hard scattering process before the hot QCD medium forms. Their final-state dynamics, therefore, encode information about the evolution of the system, making them effective probes to the properties of the hot QCD medium. Charmonia, bound states of a charm and an anti-charm quark, are of particular interest. In high-energy hadronic collisions, inclusive $J/\\psi$ production consists of both prompt and non-prompt components. The prompt component includes $J/\\psi$ produced directly or from the decays of higher-mass charmonium states (e.g., $\\psi$(2S) or $\\chi_c$), while the non-prompt component originates from the weak decays of bottom hadrons. Therefore, the study of the production and properties of non-prompt $J/\\psi$ would provide valuable insights into those of the beauty hadrons.\r\n\r\nThe Time Projection Chamber and Inner Tracking System of the ALICE detector were recently upgraded, allowing a $\\sim50$ times increase in read-out rate in Run3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this poster, we will study the separation capability of the prompt and non-prompt $J/\\psi$ components in the ALICE detector. The performance of the non-prompt $J/\\psi$ measurements in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ in ALICE during LHC Run3 will be presented.",

          "description": "Measurements of high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at the LHC have revealed that small collision systems show the onset of phenomena typical of heavy-ion collisions. Some of these signatures, such as strangeness enhancement and collective flow, suggest that light-flavor hadron production arises from complex mechanisms whose relative contributions evolve smoothly from low to high multiplicity collisions. In this context, pp collisions cannot only be seen as a simple incoherent sum of parton-parton scatterings, contrary to the modelization in most Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA. Moreover, these signatures have historically been attributed to the strongly interacting medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. However, creating a medium in smaller collision systems challenges the current theoretical frameworks.\r\n\r\nStudies on multi-differential strange particle production in small systems can be utilized to disentangle the various final state effects at play and represent an essential baseline for heavy-ion studies. This poster presents new results from ALICE on light-flavor particle production and exotic resonances as a function of the transverse spherocity in pp collisions measured at center-of-mass energies of  13 TeV. Events that are either \"isotropic\" (dominated by multiple soft processes) or \"jet-like\" (dominated by one or few hard scatterings) can be selected utilizing narrow selections in multiplicity and spherocity. The experimental results are compared with predictions from various state-of-the-art Monte Carlo generators.",

However, it is difficult to obtain large statistics with such experiments and the interpretation is model dependent, because of the involvement of many-body forces in the system.\r\nThe ALICE Collaboration has demonstrated that the femtoscopy method excels in accessing multi-strange interacting systems with high precision. Using the dataset from high-multiplicity $\\mathrm{p\\kern-0.05em p}$ collisions collected during the Run 2 data-taking period of the LHC, the measured $\\mathrm{p}$--$\\Xi^-$ and $\\mathrm{p}$--$\\Omega^-$ correlation functions were used to test Lattice QCD calculations. Since the start of Run 3 in 2022 the ALICE Collaboration has been collecting new data with significant gain in the number of available candidates for two-body analyses. These data also allow for the first time to perform three-body femtoscopic measurements in the strangeness S=-2 sector.\r\nThis contribution presents preliminary results on the $\\mathrm{p}$--$\\Xi^-$ and $\\mathrm{p}$--$\\mathrm{p}$--$\\Xi^-$ correlations in $\\mathrm{p\\kern-0.05em p}$ collisions obtained with the data collected in the first three years of Run 3.

          "description": "Outgoing high-$p_{\\rm T}$ partons produced from hard scatterings early in high-energy collisions lead to the creation of jets. Photons are produced copiously in these interactions - directly emitted by the quarks as prompt photons, or through the decay of instable particles. They are valuable probes to study jet fragmentation and nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDF).\r\n\r\nAngular correlations between trigger hadrons, which serve as proxies for the jets, and their associated photons are extracted from ALICE simulations. The photons are reconstructed from conversions in the ALICE material into electrons and positrons using the Photon Conversion Method (PCM). Since direct photons cannot be distinguished individually, their spectra are derived using a statistical approach. The decay photon spectra are derived from neutral hadron measurements, and subtracted from the inclusive measurements to extract the direct photon spectra. In this analysis, proton-proton collisions are simulated in Monte Carlo, using stand-alone PYTHIA at leading order (LO), and PYTHIA in combination with POWHEG at next-to-leading order (NLO), and compared with each other. While prompt photons are well defined at LO, ambiguities are introduced at NLO. This analysis aims to understand better the production mechanisms of prompt photons and hence the nPDF at low $p_{\\rm T}$.",

This study investigates the in-medium modification of jet observables relative to the event plane as a function of certain event properties (event shape engineering), such as the ellipticity of the event. The analysis focuses on jets reconstructed with a resolution parameter of $R = 0.2,0.4$ and examines the centrality interval of 30--50\\%. Our aim is to better quantify the correlation between the path length traversed by jets in the QGP and their energy loss, providing deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of jet-medium interactions.",

          "description": "The ALICE Experiment will upgrade the innermost three layers of its Inner Tracking System (ITS) during the next LHC Long Shutdown (LS3). It is planned to partially replace the existing conventional setup using individual chips on staves by a novel concept, where wafer-scale sensors are bent to half-cylinders allowing for a tracker with an extraordinarily low material budget of $0.07\\%~X/X_0$ per layer. The sensor chip will be based on Monolithic Active Pixels and fabricated in $65~\\mathrm{nm}$ CMOS technology exploiting stitching. During R&D, two stitched sensor prototypes, MOSS and MOST, were designed, where the first is less densely designed and the latter follows a more densely integrated in-pixel layout combined with a less dense power grid and power switches in the matrix. In the case of in-pixel short circuits, small regions of the matrix can be detached from the power grid restoring the retaining part of the overall functionality. The MOST readout is based on global high-speed lines spanning the entire approximately $25~\\mathrm{cm}$ long chip, which have successfully been operated. Procedures have been designed to select detector-grade ITS3 chips on wafer level using impedance measurements, powering tests, and functional tests. For MOSS, above $95\\%$ of the chip area can be operated. The majority of faults can be traced down to anomalous cross-connections in the topmost metal layers by correlating the grid design with thermal hotspots during power ramping. Several beam tests have proven efficient operation of MOSS prototypes, also under radiation load. The full size and full functionality  prototype for the final production sensor, MOSAIX is currently under development, heavily profiting from studies done on MOSS and MOST prototypes. This contribution gives an overview of latest results including in-beam efficiencies obtained with the two large scale prototypes and an outlook of the next generation prototype.",

          "description": "Due to the large mass of beauty-quarks, their production is well described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. As such, beauty jets are a powerful tool for constraining these pQCD calculations and for understanding the fragmentation of coloured massive partons. One of the main challenges in measurements of beauty jets is their accurate identification from the sample of inclusively measured jets. Using the significant upgrades to the tracking and data acquisition rate of the ALICE detector in Run3, we present high precision measurements of the beauty-jet cross section at low transverse momentum in pp collisions, using a variety of tagging methods. These methods include the impact parameter method, which utilises the displacement of tracks from the primary vertex; the secondary-vertex method, which identifies long-lived beauty hadrons by reconstructing the secondary vertex of their decay; and a machine learning approach that integrates features from both the impact parameter and secondary vertex methods to enhance tagging efficiency.",

The two-particle correlations method is used, where heavy-flavor candidates are correlated with hadrons.\r\n\r\nHeavy-flavor candidates are reconstructed in the Time Projection Chamber\r\n(TPC) of the ALICE detector and are correlated with hadrons from the forward region. This can be done thanks to the newest additions of the ALICE detector for Run 3, the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) and the FV0 subsystem of the Fast Interaction Trigger.\r\n\r\nUsing hadrons from the forward region allows us to increase the ∆η gap in the two-dimensional correlation function to eliminate the near-side jet peak, and most of other non-flow contributions.\r\n\r\nTo do so, a newly developed “3x2PC” method using TPC-MFT, TPC-FV0 and\r\nMFT-FV0 correlations will be used along with template fit to extract the $v_2$ coefficient.\r\n\r\nThe results presented will mostly focus on correlations with heavy-flavor candidates reconstructed in the TPC, and hadrons from the MFT in proton-proton collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV.",

          "description": "The study of hadronic resonances provides valuable information about the final state interactions and the system evolution in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. Due to their short lifespan, comparable with the duration of the hadronic phase, resonances can be affected by the competing re-scattering and regeneration mechanisms. In particular, their decay daughters interact elastically with other hadrons, altering their transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distributions and affecting the measured resonance yields. Measurements of the ratio of yields of hadronic resonances to their ground state particles across various charged-particle multiplicities provide time information between chemical and kinetic freezeout. The ALICE experiment in the LHC Run 3 is best suited for resonance measurements because of its excellent tracking and PID capabilities over a broad momentum range.\r\n  \r\n  In this contribution, we present the new ALICE results on resonance production from LHC Run 3 data collected in 2022 with the upgraded ALICE detector, making use of the higher statistics compared to previous data-taking periods. The results will be compared to similar measurements from data collected during LHC Run 2. The contribution focuses on $p_{T}$ distributions of the hadronic resonances, their $p_{T}$-integrated yields, and the ratios of $p_{T}$-integrated resonance yields to those of long-lived particles. The experimental results will be compared with the available theoretical predictions, which may offer new perspectives on the underlying dynamics in the hadronic phase.",

          "description": "The study of heavy-flavour (charm and beauty) production in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC provides a stringent test for perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. Furthermore, studies in pp collisions serve as a necessary baseline for the same measurements in proton-nucleus (p-A) and nucleus-nucleus (A-A) collisions, in order to investigate the influence of cold- and hot-nuclear-matter effects on heavy-flavour production. In ALICE, measurements of open heavy-flavour can be performed at midrapidity and forward rapidity via semi-electronic and semi-muonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons, respectively. In the LHC Run 3, the presence of Muon Forward Tracker provides vertexing capabilities to the Muon Spectrometer and allows us to separate the open charm and beauty components. The study of the production of muon decaying from open heavy-flavour as a function of charged-particle multiplicity ($N_{\\rm{ch}}$) in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = $ 13.6 TeV from Run 3 with ALICE can provide more insight on the interplay between the soft and hard physics and help in setting constraints to the phenomenological models to explain the underlying physics. In this contribution, the recent results of open heavy-flavour decay lepton production and the status of the measurements of the production of heavy-flavour decay muons as a function of multiplicity with ALICE will be presented.",

          "description": "In high-energy proton-proton collisions, dimuon measurements are important to study the particle production, thanks to the high purity muon identification and smaller background compared to dielectron measurements. In the low (~ 1.2GeV/c2) and intermediate (1.2 ~ 3.1 GeV/c2) invariant mass regions, the contribution to the dimuon spectrum from vector mesons and open heavy flavor hadrons is expected to be relevant. In addition, the signals of chiral symmetry restoration and thermal dimuons may also appear in these mass region.\r\n In the ALICE experiment, data acquisition of pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV is ongoing. Since the start of Run3 in 2022, the muon spectrometer has been upgraded with the installation of the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), an up-to-date silicon pixel detector placed near the collision point. This upgrade improves angular resolution and enables more precise reconstruction of secondary vertices. \r\n In this contribution, the study of the dimuon spectrum in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV will be shown. The combinatorial background was evaluated using two methods: the like-sign method and the event-mixing method. By fitting the like-sign distribution with the event-mixing distribution and simulated correlated sources, a more precise subtraction of the combinatorial background was achieved. To identify the sources of the dimuons, the decay vertex measurement was employed. This approach demonstrates the possibility of distinguishing dimuons originating from vector-mesons, b-quarks, and c-quarks based on their distinct decay topologies and lifetimes.",

          "description": "Measurements of charm-hadron production provide a fundamental test to validate the perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation.\r\nHowever, in recent years, an enhanced production of charm baryons relative to mesons was observed compared to $\\mathrm{e}^{+}\\mathrm{e}^{-}$ collisions, challenging the assumption of independent fragmentation adopted in pQCD calculations via the factorization theorem.\r\nThe observation has initiated a review of theory frameworks to explain the measurements by considering different process with respect to $\\mathrm{e}^{+}\\mathrm{e}^{-}$ collisions. \r\nIn particular, the measurements of charm baryons containing strangeness, such as $\\Xi_{\\mathrm{c}}^{0,+}$ and $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{c}}^{0}$, might have good constraint power for the theory calculations, as their predictions undershoot the measurements even though they include different hadronization scenarios to describe the measurements.\r\nTherefore, precise measurements of charm baryons containing strangeness across wide $\\it{p}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range are crucial to constrain the theory calculations.\r\n\r\nAt the LHC, a new data sample is being collected during Run 3 data-taking period, started in 2022 with upgraded ALICE detector.\r\nThe new dataset has improved resolution, thanks to the upgraded tracking detector during last LHC long shutdown 2 (LS 2), as well as a larger sample achieved by continuous readout of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector.\r\nPrecise measurements over an extended $\\it{p}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range using the new dataset are anticipated to provide further ingredients to understand hadronization mechanism of charm quarks.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, a measurement of $\\Xi_{\\mathrm{c}}^{+}$ baryon in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{\\it{s}}$ = 13.6 TeV, collected with ALICE detector, will be presented.\r\nThe $\\Xi_{\\mathrm{c}}^{+}$ baryon is reconstructed via its hadronic decay channel, $\\Xi_{\\mathrm{c}}^{+} \\rightarrow \\Xi^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}$, at midrapidity.\r\nA machine learning-based background rejection approach exploiting Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm will be introduced.\r\nThe resulting $\\it{p}_{\\mathrm{T}}$-differential production cross section of $\\Xi_{\\mathrm{c}}^{+}$ baryon will be presented and compared with state-of-the-art models implementing different hadronization mechanisms.",

          "description": "A new high-precision forward calorimeter (FoCal) will be installed in the ALICE experiment at the LHC during Long Shutdown 3 for data-taking during LHC Run 4, currently scheduled for 2030-2033. FoCal consists of a Si+W sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with longitudinal and transverse segmentations (FoCal-E) and a conventional Cu+scintillating-fiber hadronic calorimeter (FoCal-H). FoCal has a front face of approximately 90 $\\times$ 90 cm$^2$ and is placed at *z* = 7 m from the nominal interaction point. It covers the pseudo-rapidity range of 3.2 < η < 5.8. FoCal has unique capabilities to measure the direct photon production at the forward rapidity that probes the gluon distribution in protons and nuclei at small-*x*. Furthermore, FoCal will enable to carry out inclusive and correlation measurements of photons, neutral mesons, and jets in hadronic pp and p-Pb collisions as well as J/ψ production in the ultra-peripheral p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions.\r\n\r\nThe key component for FoCal-E is the large-size Silicon pad sensor with the high radiation tolerance. The estimated radiation dose in the innermost part of FoCal-E is approximately equal to 7 $\\times$ 10$^1$$^3$ 1 MeV *n*$_\\text{e}$$_\\text{q}$ / cm$^2$ over the full Run 4 period. Some p- and n-substrate silicon pad sensors were manufactured by way of trial and those characteristics were studied through irradiation tests at the RIKEN RANS facility in Japan and beam tests including temperature dependence. We try to operate the sensors at room temperature across an increase of the leakage current by radiation damage. Finally, the p-substrate silicon PIN photodiode array from the 6-inch double-sided polished wafer with ⟨100⟩ orientation by Hamamatsu Photonics K. K. has been proven to be able to operate in such environment. Mass production will begin soon and a new probe station for the quality assessment (QA) of all delivered sensors is ready as well. We would like to present performance of the Silicon pad sensors and our QA plan.",

          "description": "Understanding phase transitions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter. Key transitions include the deconfinement phase, marked by fluctuations in conserved quantities, and the chiral phase, characterized by particle ratio fluctuations that indicate chiral symmetry restoration. Kaon isospin fluctuations were studied in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV using the robust νdyn observable. Results indicate behaviour distinct from model predictions by HIJING, AMPT, and EPOS–LHC, suggesting possible signatures of Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCCs) in strange kaon production at LHC energies. A similar study in pp collisions could serve as a baseline for further investigation of kaon isospin fluctuations in small systems.\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of νdyn[K+,K−] and νdyn[K0\r\ns ,K±] in different multiplicity classes in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV will be presented. This provides insights into the origin of kaon isospin fluctuations corresponding to their production mechanism.",

A  comparative analysis with ALICE Run 2 results enables an assessment of particle spectra and ratio evolution across different collision energies and systems.\r\n\r\nThrough precise measurements of particle production, this work aims to deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between transverse momentum, centrality, and collision dynamics in Pb-Pb interactions at LHC energies. The results contribute to the broader understanding of the quark-gluon plasma and the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Ida Storehaug, for the ALICE Collaboration\r\n\r\nThe $\\text{B}^\\pm$ meson is the most frequently produced beauty meson in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC. Measuring its production cross-section is important for two reasons. First, it allows for testing  of perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Second, the $\\text{B}^\\pm$ meson cross-section measurement provides an essential reference for measurements of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\text{AA}}$) in heavy-ion collisions. Here, we present the first preliminary results from ALICE on the $\\text{B}^\\pm$ meson cross-section measured in the $\\text{J}/\\psi + \\text{K}^\\pm$ channel, covering the previously unexplored region at low pT and midrapidity (|y|<0.9). Achieving this measurement for the first time in Run 3 has been made possible by two critical advancements: the high statistics from increased luminosity recorded by ALICE in Run 3, and the improved vertex resolution provided by the upgraded Inner Tracking System, which enables the reconstruction of $\\text{B}^\\pm$ meson candidates.",

          "description": "The production cross sections and polarization measurements are essential to understand the heavy quarkonium production mechanism and to enhance our understanding of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in vacuum as well as in medium. Theoretical models like non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), which include a color octet contribution, remain quite successful in explaining the charmonium production cross section at large transverse momenta and obtained in the past years a fair agreement with the data provided by experimental measurements on quarkonium polarization. Due to its higher mass, bottomonia satisfy better a non-relativistic theoretical treatment. Therefore, the corresponding polarization measurements in pp collisions provide a good testing ground for NRQCD. In particular, the large feed-down contribution to the observed bottomonia yield may dilute the expected polarization. This contribution can be further understood with more precise and differential measurements of $\\Upsilon$ (nS) polarization. Finally, this measurement in pp will be an important baseline for a similar measurement in heavy-ion collisions. Indeed, in PbPb collisions, the presence of a strong magnetic field in the initial stage or a modification of the relative contribution between direct and feed-down bottomonium production may lead to a different measured polarization. The Run 3 upgrade to the ALICE detector with higher luminosity and interaction rate opens new opportunities to study the polarization of $\\Upsilon$ states with good precision. In this poster, performances on $\\Upsilon\\rightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$ signal extraction at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4.0) using pp collision at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV are presented, and the status and prospects about $\\Upsilon$ (1S) polarization measurement are discussed.",

The upgraded ITS2 enables higher tracking resolution, while the improvements to the TPC allow for continuous readout, significantly boosting resolution and data acquisition. Using these improvements, we present the first measurement in ALICE of the charged-particle jet cross section in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6\\ \\mathrm{TeV}$, using the anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ algorithm with different resolution parameters at midrapidity. The analysis includes a detailed study of the event multiplicity dependence, as well as the underlying event to ensure accurate jet reconstruction.

Since weak bosons do not interact with QGP constituents by the strong force, the measurements are also important to understand the dynamics in the small system.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, final results of the production cross section of W$^{\\pm}$ bosons, reconstructed via their leptonic decays, and of Z$^{0}$ bosons, reconstructed by electron-positron pairs, at midrapidity ($|\\eta|$ $<$ 0.6) in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV collected during the LHC Run 2 are presented. The results will be compared with pQCD calculations using different sets of  parton distribution functions.

          "description": "The measurement of the Drell-Yan (DY) production at forward rapidity in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the LHC with the upgraded ALICE detector in Run 3 provides a unique tool for probing the PDFs and partonic structure of hadrons and nuclei. There is a lack of a hard and clear probe of nuclear matter at relatively small Bjorken-*x* (down to 10<sup>-5</sup>), which could provide information about initial stages in collisions involving heavy ions. In principle, the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) are not well known for x < 10<sup>-4</sup>. The low-mass DY dimuon (M<sub>*μ*<sup>+</sup>*μ*<sup>-</sup></sub> > 4 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>) measurements at forward rapidity with the upgraded ALICE detector will allow us to gain knowledge about small-*x* physics at the LHC. These measurements in pp collisions will serve as a reference for the future proton-lead (p-Pb) data. Moreover, in p-Pb collisions, at very small *x*, the ratio of the nuclear modification factors (R<sub>pPb</sub>) of DY and J/*ψ* can provide important constraints on gluon densities. In this contribution, the comparison of the ALICE pp experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations based on the POWHEG box combined with Pythia8 will be presented. The mass and transverse momentum distributions of the *μ*<sup>+</sup>*μ*<sup>-</sup> pair will be shown along with other background contributions.",

The fragmentation properties can be investigated from the measurement of the energy fraction of strange particles within their original partons.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, measurement of the mean $p_{\\rm T}$ fractions of leading ${\\rm K}_{\\rm S}^{0}$ mesons and $\\Lambda$ ($\\overline{\\Lambda}$) baryons in mini-jets (leading-$\\left\\langle z\\right\\rangle$) as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV is presented, using a new correlation method.

          "description": "A jet is a spray of collimated hadrons originating from the fragmentation of an energetic parton. In heavy-ion collisions, jets traverse the colored medium and lose energy via induced gluon radiation and elastic scattering, which modify jet yields and structure. When the overlap of the colliding nuclei is small, the transverse profile of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is expected to become more elliptical in shape. This geometrical shape results in different QGP path lengths for partons emitted at different angles, resulting in an azimuthal anisotropy of the energy loss. This anisotropy alters the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ differential yield of jets and is quantified by the second-order flow coefficient, $v_2$, of the jets. Therefore, measurements of jet $v_2$ are expected to be sensitive to QGP properties and to the path length dependence of energy loss. Based on the high statistics data samples collected during Run 3, using ALICE upgraded detectors, we present the first analysis of inclusive charged-particle jet $v_2$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm(NN)}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The low $p_{\\rm{T}}$ reach of this measurement, which is unique to ALICE, is especially important in constraining theoretical models and elucidating the mechanisms which generate jet $v_2$. The results will be also compared to existing jet $v_2$ measurements.",

          "description": "The study of multiplicity-dependent yields ratio of light-flavour particles like kaons, and protons to pions offers valuable insights into mechanisms hadron production. The $K/\\pi$ and $p/\\pi$ ratios are crucial in understanding how particle production scales with multiplicity across different systems. In particular, these ratios reveal whether strange and baryonic particle production increases smoothly from small to large systems or exhibits sharp transitions, providing hints about collective behaviour and the underlying production mechanisms. With the higher luminosity data of LHC Run 3 and the newly developed online and offline (O$^2$) framework, it becomes possible to reach multiplicities comparable to those in peripheral heavy-ion collisions, providing a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between small and large systems. This study presents the first multiplicity-dependent $\\pi$, $K$, and $p$ production results using the ALICE TPC and TOF detectors in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Furthermore, the results on particle yield ratios evolving with transverse momentum ($p_T$) and charged-particle multiplicity density ($\\textrm{d}\\it{N}_\\textrm{ch}/\\textrm{d}\\eta$) will be presented with Run~3 data and compared with state-of-the-art QCD-inspired models.",

          "description": "Energy-energy correlators (EECs), which are energy-weighted cross-sections of particle pairs, offer incisive probes into QCD dynamics, across the full scale of jet evolution, by separating energy scales in the jet fragmentation through the angular distance of the resulting particle pairs.  Charged EECs probe the energy flux carried by pairs of the same or opposite electric charges. The interplay between energy distribution and charge conservation enables charged EECs to provide novel constraints on hadronization mechanisms. We present the first measurements of two-point charged energy correlators of inclusive jets in proton-proton collisions at 5.02 TeV using the ALICE detector, and compare with hadronization models to investigate different confinement mechanisms. We also present prospects for measurements in proton-lead collisions, examining cold nuclear matter effects on jet evolution.",

          "description": "The 'ALICE 3' project is a proposed upgrade of the ALICE detector, which involves a complete replacement of the installation at Point 2. Crucial to the physics programme are high-precision measurements of heavy-flavour observables that require large data samples as well as state-of-the-art tracking performance. As a consequence, performance studies of the operating conditions of ALICE 3 that employ full simulation chains are very computationally demanding, especially in what concerns particle transport and detector response simulation. In this context, finding alternative representations of certain steps of full simulations is extremely useful. Such techniques are called `fast simulations' and reduce computing requirements by at least one order of magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we will present the current status of fast simulations of the ALICE 3 detector, including studies in which different tracker and particle identification setups are considered. We also elaborate on how current fast simulations make efficient use of resources by running entirely in physical memory and not storing anything except for the desired physics performance quantities. Lastly, we will discuss the performance study of multi-charm baryons, which is not computationally feasible with full simulations alone, as a test case of the fast simulation machinery.",

          "description": "Recent measurements of the self-normalised yield as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV showed a faster than linear increase for both light-flavour and heavy-flavour hadrons, which is found to be more pronounced for high\r\n$p_{\\rm{T}}$ particles. Models accounting for multiparton interactions (MPI) and color-reconnection (CR) effects describe the trends observed in data. On the other hand, it is pointed out that the \\mbox{autocorrelation} between particles produced in association with the measured hadrons and the charged-particle multiplicity plays a role in the observed yield enhancement. Since W$^{\\pm}$ bosons are insensitive to strong interaction, their production is expected to be less sensitive to CR effects than hadron production. Additionally, they are less correlated with the charged-particle multiplicity because they are mainly produced in isolation, i.e. without additional associated charged particles, reducing the impact of autocorrelation effects. Therefore, their measurements give insight into the multiplicity dependence of particle production in pp collisions.\r\n\r\nThis poster presents the final results of the ALICE Collaboration on the multiplicity dependence of $e^{\\pm}$ production from W$^{\\pm}$ bosons and associated hadrons at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, based on data from Run 2.",

A well-known characteristic of the critical behaviour of the system undergoing phase transition is that it shows fluctuations of all scales. Local multiplicity fluctuations are analyzed using normalized factorial moments (NFM) $F_{\\rm{q}}$ for $q={\\rm2,\\,3,\\,4\\,and\\,5}$.  For the systems with dynamical fluctuations $F_{\\rm{q}}$ shows scaling behaviour with increasing  numbers of bins $M$ whereas scaling is also characteristic of the systems with self-similar and fractal nature. $F_{\\rm{q}}$ moments show scaling behaviour as the binning in the phase space region increases.\r\n\r\nFor the second-order phase transition in the Ginzburg-Landau formalism  $F_{\\rm{q}}$ for $q > $ 2 shows a linear dependence on the second-order normalized factorial moments ($F_{\\rm{2}}$), termed as F-scaling.  The scaling exponent $\\nu$, which quantifies the fluctuations in the particle density  distributions, was determined for various $p_{\\rm{T}}$ intervals  and bin widths in the soft-$p_{\\rm{T}}$ region. Observations and results from this study and comparison with Pb--Pb results at LHC energies will be discussed.",

In the vdM scan, the two beam bunches are moved in opposite directions along the horizontal or vertical axis. The visible cross section is obtained through the vdM scan by measuring the rate of visible processes as a function of the separation between beams using FIT and ZDC.

          "description": "Mean transverse momentum ($ \\langle \\it{p}_{\\rm T} \\rangle$) fluctuations are dynamic indicators of system properties, arising from correlations among the transverse momenta of final-state particles, such as those due to resonance decays and jets. Consequently, event-by-event $ \\langle \\it{p}_{\\rm T} \\rangle$ fluctuations in pp collisions serve as a model-independent baseline to explore non-trivial fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions. Studying these fluctuations for identified particles (pions, kaons, and protons) provides insights into the production mechanisms and dynamics. Pions and kaons are mesons with kaons containing strange quarks, and both differ in quark composition from protons, which are baryons. The strength of the correlator will be compared among these particles. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the event-by-event $ \\langle \\it{p}_{\\rm T} \\rangle$ fluctuations of identified particles produced in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV are measured as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity using the ALICE detector at the LHC with Run 3 data. Non-statistical fluctuations are observed in pp collision systems, indicating correlated particle emission. A significant reduction in dynamical fluctuations is noted with increasing multiplicity for both inclusive charged particles and identified particles.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production in hadronic collisions is a complex process, driven by hard-scale phenomena, such as the creation of quark-antiquark pairs during the initial hard scatterings. Studying the ψ(2S) to J/ψ ratio as a function of charged particle multiplicity provides valuable insights into the mechanisms governing quarkonium formation in high-energy collisions. Since ψ(2S) is an excited state of charmonium with a lower binding energy and was shown to have in Pb-Pb collisions a higher suppression rate than J/ψ, examining their relative production in high-multiplicity pp collisions is of particular interest. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the ψ(2S)/J/ψ production ratio as a function of charged particle multiplicity in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{\\rm{s}}$ = 13.6 TeV, using data collected by the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). By examining this ratio across different multiplicity classes, we aim to explore the potential influences of a particle-rich environment on quarkonium production. The experimental results will be compared with the available theoretical models.",

FoCal-H, the hadronic calorimeter segment of this upgrade, is designed as a scintillating-fiber calorimeter. Its front-end electronics utilize the H2GCROC ASIC to read out signals from SiPMs. This ASIC features 72 channels and delivers both energy and timing information for input signals, with key functionalities such as Time-over-Threshold (ToT) measurement and a current conveyor stage, essential for efficient hadronic calorimeter readout.\r\n\r\nThe H2GCROC performance was evaluated in 2024 with the FoCal-H prototype during beam tests conducted at the SPS beamline. These tests employed a fully customized hardware system based on the Xilinx KCU105 evaluation board and software built with the PySide framework. We will present an overview of the FoCal-H project, including the detailed analysis of energy resolution, response linearity, and timing performance observed in the beam tests.",

          "description": "The ALICE Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) detector upgrade is designed to probe hadronic matter, its gluon density and the parton distribution functions at Bjørken-$x$ in the order of and smaller than 10⁻⁶. Located 7$\\,\\mathrm{m}$ away from the LHC interaction point, it will cover a pseudo-rapidity range of 3.2 < η < 5.8. The calorimeter will be composed of a 20-layer Si-W sampling electromagnetic calorimeter and a copper-scintillating fibre hadronic calorimeter in \"spaghetti\" design with SiPM readout. Datataking is planned for LHC Run 4, starting from 2030.\r\nOne of the central and novel features of the FoCal detector are the two high-granularity pixel layers in the electromagnetic calorimeter. These layers, located at layer 5 and 10, are used to identify two photon showers with narrow opening angle from decays of neutral mesons, and thus to enhance the signal of isolated photons. In order to achieve this, two electromagnetic showers need to be resolved on the mm-scale. Nearly 2000 ALPIDE MAPS chips with a pixel size of ~29 x 27 µm² will be installed per layer, organized in aluminum carriers which house so-called strings with 15 chips in a row (i.e. transversal length of 45cm). These strings will be produced with flexible printed-circuit boards, to which the ALPIDEs will be assembled and connected with Single-Point TAB bonding technology.\r\nThis poster will give a comprehensive overview of the FoCal pixel layer project. We will present the expected performance for the two-shower discrimination power, its contribution to the detector's physics performance and put prototype results from testbeams into context. Furthermore the readout scheme and the trigger concept, the expected data rates and (in-)efficiencies will be subject to this contribution. Lastly, we will report on the plan for production readiness as well as the current status of prototyping.",

In heavy-ion collisions, the measurements of jets traversing the hot medium provide critical insights into the Quark-Gluon plasma, which manifest themselves in jet energy loss and substructure modifications. The measurement presented here are based on the high statistics data samples collected during Run 3, taking advantage of the major upgrades to the ALICE detector. In addition, we also calculate the jet nuclear modification factor by taking the ratio of jet pT spectra from central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to peripheral Pb-Pb collision and pp baselines. The measurements will quantify jet quenching effects, enhancing our understanding of the jet energy loss mechanisms.",

The Forward Detector (FD) will be part of the ALICE 3 covering forward pseudorapidity 4 < |eta| < 7. FD will provide an interaction trigger, beam luminosity, initial vertex position, and a forward multiplicity. Its design should allow for smooth operations before and during stable beams. Offline mode will provide the precise collision time for the TOF-based particle identification, collision centrality, and reaction plane. It will also participate in the selection of diffractive and ultra-peripheral collisions. FD will operate in a high radiation environment (~ 10^14 1-MeV-neq/cm^2), requiring a special detector and FEE design. It will require dedicated fast front-end electronics (FEE) to read out events every 25 ns. In this contribution, I will cover FD requirements and design concept studies.",

          "description": "The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions exhibits properties of a mostly perfect fluid. Experimentally, this was established by measuring azimuthal anisotropies in the final state, known as elliptic flow and higher order harmonics such as triangular flow. These Fourier harmonic coefficients have been extensively measured using inclusive charged particles or identified particles in the soft sector. Interestingly, measuring such coefficients using hard probes, such as quarkonia, brings additional information about heavy-quark production and their thermalization within the QGP. While the suppression of loosely bound quarkonia in QGP was already observed in the first measurements at the SPS, the $J/\\psi$ flow has been studied at the LHCusing Run1 and Run 2 data. These measurements shed new light on quarkonium production and confirm the existence of regeneration mechanisms. Thanks to the new ALICE data-taking strategy in LHC Run 3, new opportunities for more precise and refined measurements are now possible. In particular, multiparticle cumulant analysis can be carried out to extract $J/\\psi$ flow enabling access to flow fluctuations. In this poster, preliminary results on $J/\\psi$ $v_2$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=5.36$ $TeV$ at forward rapidity (2.5 < $y$ < 4) will be presented and discussed using various measurement techniques including, for the first time, multiparticle cumulants.",

The measurements are carried out using the final-state charged particles with transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) ranges $0.2 \\leq p_{\\rm T}\\leq 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|\\eta| \\leq 0.8$.  Investigations of the different charge pairs correlation functions reveal significant changes in the near-side and away-side correlation peaks from the events with hard jet-like topologies to soft isotropic topologies. These results would improve our understanding of the jet contribution and related underlying event activities in small systems, while also establishing an essential baseline for heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "The Standard Model describes ordinary hadrons, such as mesons (quark pairs) and baryons (three-quark structures). However, QCD predicts the existence of several exotic yet unseen states. These include two-quark, four-quark, molecular, hybrid states, and glueballs. In particular, the glueball, a unique bound state composed entirely of gluons, is particularly interesting. Lattice QCD calculations predict that the lightest scalar glueballs have a mass range between 1500 and 1700 MeV/c$^2$, with quantum numbers J$^{PC}$ = $0^{++}$. However, their experimental search is challenging due to their mixing with scalar mesonic states in the nearby mass range that share the same quantum numbers. The excellent particle identification capabilities of the ALICE detector and the unprecedented amount of data collected with pp collisions in Run 3 provide a unique opportunity to explore the experimental search for glueballs and learn about their internal structure, testing QCD predictions in the process. This contribution presents the measurement of resonances at midrapidity in the mass range of 1000–3000 MeV/c$^2$, using the $\\mathrm{K_S^0K_S^0}$ and $\\mathrm{K^+K^-}$ decay channels for proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV with ALICE.",

          "description": "Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. An important final state observable for understanding these late-stage effects is the measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), which originates from the anisotropic expansion of the system driven by the initial spatial asymmetry in the collision geometry. Late-stage hadronic rescattering can alter the momentum distributions of resonances, thereby influencing their elliptic flow. Measuring the elliptic flow of resonances like $K^{*0}$ and $\\phi$, and comparing them to the elliptic flow of the other hadrons, provides deeper insights into the impact of final state effects. This contribution will present new elliptic flow measurements for $K^{*0}$ and $\\phi$ resonances in Pb−Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.36 TeV.",

          "description": "Short-lived resonances are ideal probes to study the properties of the hadron gas phase created in heavy-ion collisions in the post-hadronization phase. Since the resonance lifetime is comparable to that of the hadron gas phase, their yields are affected by the competing rescattering and regeneration effects. These can be studied experimentally by measuring the yield ratios of resonances to the corresponding long-lived hadrons as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity, a proxy of the system size. In this context, the $\\rho(770)^0$ resonance is particularly interesting due to its very short lifetime of about 1.3 fm/$c$ for the study in small collision systems, corresponding to a very short duration of the hadron gas phase. This study serves as a fundamental reference for measurements in heavy-ion collisions. This contribution presents the study of the $\\rho(770)^0$ production in pp collisions at 13.6 TeV with the ALICE detector as a function of multiplicity. The results are discussed together with existing measurements in other collision systems in the context of the state-of-the-art phenomenological models used to describe particle production at LHC energy.",

          "description": "Recent measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios at the LHC have shown a substantial enhancement of charm-baryon production in pp collisions as compared to electron-positron and electron-proton collisions. This evidence currently could be interpreted as a modification of the charm hadronization mechanism in hadronic collisions, disproving the assumption of universality of charm fragmentation across different collision systems. Charm hadronization can be investigated by measuring charm-baryon production in pp collisions over a wide range of transverse momenta, rapidities, and energies. In addition, by performing the measurements as a function of the multiplicity of the collision, further information, such as the dependence of the hadronization process on the color-charge density, can be assessed. In this poster, we report the result of the analysis of the $\\Xi_{\\rm c}^{0}$ baryon, reconstructed via the semileptonic decay channel ($\\Xi_{\\rm c}^{0}\\to \\Xi^{-}{\\rm e}^{+}\\nu_{\\rm e}$) in pp collisions by using the LHC Run 2 data collected with the ALICE apparatus. The measurements of the baryon-to-meson ($\\Xi_{\\rm c}^{0}/{\\rm D}^{0}$) yield ratio as a function of the event multiplicity and of the $\\Xi_{\\rm c}^{0}$ branching-fraction ratio between semileptonic and hadronic ($\\Xi_{\\rm c}^{0}\\to \\Xi^{-}\\pi^{+}$) channels in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV will be shown.",

          "description": "Heavy flavour hadrons are key probes for the investigation of the initial stage as well as the evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions. In fact, the heavy quarks possess masses larger than the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) scale parameters and therefore are mainly produced in hard scattering processes with large momentum transfer $Q^2$. For the same reason, their production in proton-proton (pp) collisions can be described by perturbative QCD calculations. In addition, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadrons as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions provides insights in the interplay between soft and hard processes and multi-parton interactions.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the first measurement of $D^{*\\pm}$ production in different multiplicity classes using the large data sample of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run3, are presented. This includes the measurement of the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential production cross section as well as the yield in different charged-particle multiplicity classes. Also, these results will be compared with lower LHC energies measurements.",

          "description": "The observation of collectivity and strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions at LHC energies has prompted discussions on the possible dynamical similarities between small systems and heavy-ion collisions. However, these phenomena alone do not conclusively indicate the formation of thermalized QCD matter. Higher-order cumulants ($\\kappa_n$) of net-baryon distributions provide a more sensitive probe for the nature of thermalization in such collisions. Lattice QCD calculations, which consider a thermalized system of quarks and gluons, predict negative values for higher-order cumulants, $\\kappa_5$ and $\\kappa_6$, of the net-baryon number in the crossover regime at small baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_\\mathrm{B} \\leq 110$ MeV). At LHC energies, pp collisions can achieve the highest multiplicities, allowing for tests of these lattice QCD predictions. We present the multiplicity dependence of cumulants of the net-proton number distributions up to the 6th order in pp collisions at top LHC energies, where the net-proton number serves as a proxy for the net-baryon number. The results are compared with corresponding results at lower collision energies from the STAR experiment at RHIC and with theoretical predictions from lattice QCD, the Thermal-FIST model, and the PYTHIA event generator.",

Experimental correlation functions were obtained for several centrality ranges and one-dimensional proton source sizes were extracted by using a modified Lednick\\'y's model. The radii exhibit a $k_\\mathrm{T}$-dependence that is similar to the one observed with pion and kaon femtoscopy and typical for heavy-ion collisions.

          "description": "Charm-quark hadronization is not completely understood in proton--proton (pp) and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. In recent years, measurements of charm-baryon production at the LHC have raised  questions on the modeling of heavy-quark hadronization. The relative abundances of charm baryons and mesons, assessed via measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios, represent an important tool to understand the charm hadronization process from pp to heavy-ion collisions. While qualitatively in agreement with recent measurements of $\\Xi_{c}^{0,+}$/D$^0$ production ratio performed in pp collisions, models based on string fragmentation beyond leading colour approximation, statistical hadronization, or hadronization via coalescence are not able to quantitatively describe the data. Moreover, the comparison of measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios performed at midrapidity by ALICE and forward rapidity by LHCb seems to suggest a rapidity dependence, not predicted by model calculations or Monte Carlo generators. However, the significant uncertainties in the branching ratios of the various decay channels employed, particularly the $\\Xi_{c}^+ \\rightarrow {\\rm p K}^- \\pi^+$ channel used by LHCb, prevent drawing definitive conclusions.\r\nIn this contribution, the measurement of the $\\Xi_{c}^+$ baryon production relative to one of the D mesons and $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ baryon obtained by exploiting the large datasets of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 3 will be presented. The $\\Xi_{c}^+$ and $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ baryons have been reconstructed via their decay channel in a proton, a charged kaon, and a charged pion. The results will be compared with the results obtained by LHCb in the same decay channel and also with theoretical predictions of state of the art models.",

          "description": "The production of light (anti)nuclei is typically investigated by comparing experimental data with phenomenological models implementing statistical hadronization or coalescence approaches. In this context, the ALICE experiment has performed a broad set of precision measurements in different collision systems (pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb) since the beginning of its operations. In this contribution, the production mechanisms of light (anti)nuclei are investigated exploring nuclei-proton azimuthal correlations. ALICE measures, for baryon–baryon and anti-baryon–anti-baryon pairs, a near-side anti-correlation structure, which is not reproduced by commonly used Monte Carlo models like PYTHIA or EPOS, indicating a fundamental flaw in the production mechanism of baryons in these models. The results presented in this contribution further test this paradigm by exploring deuteron-proton azimuthal correlations using Run 3 pp collisions and employing event generators such as PYTHIA, specifically tuned to model the production of light bound states through a coalescence afterburner.",

          "description": "Quarkonia, which are bound states of heavy-flavor quark-antiquark pairs, have long been considered crucial probes for studying the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). In a simplified picture, the production of quarkonium is suppressed due to color screening within the QGP, formed during nucleus–nucleus collisions. A key observable in this context is the azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonia, providing valuable insights into the collective dynamics of particles in a strongly interacting medium. The measurement of this anisotropy is achieved through harmonic coefficients derived from the Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distribution. In non-central collisions, the coefficient $v_2$ of the second harmonic measures the strength of the so-called elliptic flow and is the most important source of information on the degree of thermalization of the medium.\r\nDue to the large mass of the beauty quark that may prevent its thermalization, the $\\Upsilon(\\mathrm{1S})$, a bound $b\\overline{b}$ state, is expected to exhibit a lower $v_2$ with respect to the $J/\\psi$, a $c\\overline{c}$ bound state.\r\nFor these reasons, a study of the $\\Upsilon(\\mathrm{1S})$ flow with the latest data collected in ALICE from the recent LHC data-taking period may provide interesting insights on the degree of thermalization of the beauty quark. This contribution will present the first measurement of $v_2$ for $\\Upsilon(\\mathrm{1S})$ studied through its decay into $\\mu^{+}$$\\mu^{-}$ pairs at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.36 TeV.",

          "description": "The analysis of azimuthal-correlation distribution between $\\rm{D^{0}}$ mesons and charged particles is very important for studying charm-quark production, occuring in the early stages of high-energy collisions via hard scattering. Following their production, charm quarks undergo a fragmentation process which results in a spray of charged hadrons after hadronization, typically collinear to the charm quark. This process can be characterized by studying the near-side peak of the aforementioned azimuthal-correlation distributions. The measurement of the peak yield and width offers insights into the amount of particles produced from the charm fragmentation and their radial displacement with respect to the charm quark, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we present $p_{\\rm{T}}$-differential measurements of the azimuthal-correlation distribution between $\\rm{D^{0}}$ mesons and charged particles in pp collisions at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 13.6 TeV using the ALICE detector. Furthermore, comparisons with previous studies at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 5.02 TeV, $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 7 TeV, and $\\rm{\\sqrt{s}=}$ 13 TeV suggest that the PYTHIA8 and POWHEG+PYTHIA8 models provide the best description of the data. The new measurement on Run 3 data will allow more precise and differential results, with extended transverse momentum reach, to further constraint the models and better characterize the charm fragmentation process.",

          "description": "ALICE data recorded from pp collisions at $\\sqrt{\\it s}=13$ TeV are analyzed to study the mean transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) fluctuations. The study is motivated by the idea that non-monotonic changes in $p_{\\rm T}$ correlations with varying energy, if observed, may be taken as an indicator for the QGP formation. The mean $p_{\\rm T}$ fluctuations are studied in terms of the two-particle correlator, $\\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\\rm T})_m$, which measures the strength of such fluctuations in units of mean $p_{\\rm T}$. The dependence of $\\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\\rm T})_m$ on particle multiplicity in varying $p_{\\rm T}$ window widths and positions has been analyzed. A study of soft, intermediate and hard $p_{\\rm T}$ would significantly impact on understanding of equilibrium and thermal (radial flow), as well as non-thermal (jets/minijets) sources for $p_{\\rm T}$ fluctuations.\r\n\r\nA decreasing trend in correlator values with increasing charged particle multiplicity has been observed, following a power-law pattern. The dependence of the power--law coefficient on different $p_{\\rm T}$ ranges has also been analyzed. To further investigate collective effects, within a common multiplicity range, correlators have been studied across different collision systems, such as p--Pb and Pb--Pb at $\\sqrt{\\it s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV and Xe--Xe at $\\sqrt{\\it s_{\\rm NN}}=5.44$ TeV. The findings are compared with predictions from Monte Carlo models, like PYTHIA (pQCD string) and EPOS (core–corona), to gain further insight.",

Additionally, studying the double production of D mesons in the same collision allows us to investigate double charm production via single (SPS) and double parton scattering (DPS). Like-sign meson pairs are expected to be predominantly produced by DPS processes, while opposite-sign pairs are more likely to be created via SPS.

The flow coefficients are measured with multi-particle cumulants,  including two-, four-, and more-than-six-particle cumulants, providing unprecedented sensitivity to the initial conditions.

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is created, and anisotropic flow is one of the critical measurements to understand the detailed medium properties of the QGP. The anisotropic flow of light and strange particles scales approximately with the number of constituent quarks. The scaling behavior is interpreted as the collective flow developing in the partonic phase. Resonance particles, whose quark contents are the same as their ground state particles but have different mass and spin, may not follow the scaling behavior because of interactions of their daughter particles during the hadronic phase. Previous measurements in ALICE show that the relative yield of $\\mathrm{K^\\pm(892)}$ to $\\mathrm{K}$ gradually decreases as a function of particle multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, if flow coefficients between resonance and stable particles are compared, we can study the impact of interactions at the hadronic phase on the collective flow. Such investigation could enhance our understanding of the time evolution of the QGP, especially the hadronic phase.\r\n\r\nThis poster aims to study the rescattering effects of $\\mathrm{K^\\pm(892)}$ in the hadronic phase by measuring its anisotropic flow coefficients and comparing them with the ones of longer-lived particles in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.36$ TeV measured with the ALICE apparatus.",

          "description": "Quarkonium are considered as an important tool to test our understanding of strong interaction as their production in hadronic collisions involve an interplay of both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects. A complete understanding of the production mechanism of quarkonia in elementary proton-proton collisions remains a challenge. None of the theoretical models of quarkonium production has been able to fully explain simultaneously the measured cross-section and  polarization. The polarization  is therefore a crucial observable for distinguishing between different production models. In this poster , we will present the the study of inclusive J/$\\psi$ polarization produced in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC. The analysis is carried out by reconstructing  J/$\\psi$ mesons via their dimuon decay channel (J/$\\psi$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\mu^{+}$ $\\mu^{-}$), in the forward rapidity region (2.5 $<$ y $<$ 4).",

          "description": "Due to large masses of the heavy quarks, perturbative quantum chromodynamics is applicable at the parton level. But at the hadronization level, there are several models that can be tested by precise measurements of heavy quarkonia.  In addition, various types of phenomena associated with the presence of a deconfined medium show a smooth evolution from small colliding systems to large systems. among them, the sequential dissociation of the states $\\Upsilon$(nS) can be used as thermometer of the medium with excited states of bottomonium being less tightly bound than the ground state and more easily dissociating at high temperature. To understand the system-size-dependent behavior of the medium created in collisions, measurements of the $\\Upsilon$(nS) production ratios should be differential with respect to charged-particle multiplicity, as this serves as a characterization of the initial state in hadronic collisions. In this study, We present $\\Upsilon$(nS) production ratios in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13.6\\,$TeV obtained with ALICE RUN 3 data. $\\Upsilon$(nS) are reconstructed in the dielectron decay channel at rapidity $|\\eta| < 0.9 $. Results of $p_T$ differential cross section ratio and charge-particle multiplicity are discussed.",

          "description": "Exotic hadrons, such as tetraquarks, fall outside the traditional classification of mesons and baryons. Their production mechanisms remain poorly understood, although statistical, hydrodynamical, and coalescence models have attempted to predict their behavior. The first observation of such a particle was made by the Belle Collaboration in 2003, with the discovery of the X(3872). This study aims to measure the X(3872) exotic hadron in pp collisions using Run 3 data collected by the ALICE Experiment. During Long Shutdown 2, the ALICE Collaboration upgraded its sub-detectors to enhance data rate, resolution, track reconstruction, and particle identification. The current data-taking period, called Run 3, features much higher statistics in its measurements. The analysis focuses on the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ decay channel, where the J/ψ decays into electron-positron pairs. To improve the significance of the X(3872) signal, machine learning techniques have been applied, specifically through a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier. This poster presents the invariant mass spectrum of the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ channel, along with the distribution of key kinematic variables, using both real data and Monte Carlo simulations generated with Pythia and EvtGen. Measuring the X(3872) with the ALICE Experiment is particularly valuable because it provides access to data at low transverse momentum, a region that other experiments have not extensively explored. This low-momentum analysis is crucial, as it may help determine whether the X(3872) is a compact tetraquark state or a loosely bound molecule of mesons.",

          "description": "The relative increase in the production of strange hadrons with respect to non-strange hadrons in heavy-ion collisions was historically considered one of the signatures of QGP formation. However, recent measurements in proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p--Pb) collisions have shown features that are reminiscent of those observed in lead-lead (Pb--Pb) collisions, i.e. an increase in the production of strange hadrons relative to pions with the charged particle multiplicity in the event.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of strange hadron production in different collision systems are presented. These results include transverse-momentum spectra, integrated yields, and baryon-to-meson ratios. These observables are studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in different collision systems and centre-of-mass energies. Recent measurements of strange hadrons as a function of multiplicity and effective energy in pp collisions and their production yields in and out of jets are also presented to further characterise the study of strangeness production.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions is an important tool for studying perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Charmonia are bound states of charm and anti-charm quarks and their production process can be factorized into two stages: the heavy quark production and the formation of the bound state. The former happens within initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfers, and can be well described by perturbative QCD. The second one, which involves long distances and soft momentum scales, is a typical non-perturbative process. Measurements of J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) cross section in pp collisions are crucial for studying charmonium production mechanisms and testing different QCD-based model calculations. They can also provide a reference for investigating the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions and the cold nuclear matter effects in proton-nucleus collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the results of inclusive J/$\\psi$ production cross section as well as the $\\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\\psi$ ratios as functions of $p_{\\rm T}$ and multiplicity at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$) in pp collisions at the center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV will be shown. The analysis is based on the data collected by the upgraded ALICE detector during LHC Run 3, which offers significantly higher statistics compared to Run 1 and 2.",

This contribution presents recent results on light-flavour\r\n(multi-)strange hadron production in pp collisions at √s = 0.9 TeV and 13.6 TeV, collected during ALICE Run 3.

          "description": "The azimuthal correlations of $\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$ mesons with charged particles in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions offer a powerful tool for investigating charm-quark production and hadronization mechanisms. By measuring the azimuthal-angle distribution between the direction of the tagged $\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$ meson and those of the other charm hadronization products, it is possible to perform a multi-differential characterization of the charm hadronization process and obtain ininsight into the charm-jet structure. Compared to studies involving non-strange D mesons, the measurement of the $\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$ meson allows us to explore a potential influence of strangeness on the charm hadronization process. Additionally, measurements in pp collisions serve as a reference for interpreting results from proton-nucleus (p--Pb) and nucleus-nucleus (Pb--Pb) collisions.\r\nIn Pb--Pb collisions, a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state is produced. Since charm quarks are produced in the early stages of the collision, before the QGP formation, they interact with the medium constituents through radiative and collisional processes, resulting in energy loss and modification of their original direction. As a result, sizable modifications to azimuthal correlation distributions are expected.\r\nIn this contribution, the azimuthal correlation distribution of prompt $\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$ mesons with charged particles measured using data collected by ALICE during Run 3 at the LHC will be presented. $\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$ mesons in the transverse momentum range of 3 < $p_{\\text{T}}$($\\text{D}_{\\text{s}}^{+}$) < 36 GeV/c, reconstructed at midrapidity, are correlated with charged particles selected in different intervals of transverse momentum  and |$\\eta$| < 0.8. Quantitative information on the correlation pattern is obtained by measuring observables such as the integral and the widths of the correlation peaks. The results obtained from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV will be presented and compared to state-of-the-art model predictions. Performance obtained from the analysis of the Pb--Pb data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.36 TeV will be also shown.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production in high-energy lead-lead (Pb-Pb) collisions is a key tool for exploring both the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations.\r\n\r\nCharmonia are bound states consisting of a charm and an anti-charm quark. Their production process can be divided into two stages: the creation of the heavy quarks and the formation of the bound state. The first stage occurs during initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfer, which can be accurately described using perturbative QCD. The second stage, involving long-distance interactions and soft momentum scales, is a non-perturbative process. Studying the production of $\\psi$(2S) in Pb-Pb collisions is important for understanding how quarkonium states are modified in the quark-gluon plasma. The $\\psi$(2S) is more loosely bound than the J/$\\psi$, and its amount of  suppression in the medium can provide insight into the effects of the deconfined medium. The double ratio of $\\psi$(2S) to J/$\\psi$ in Pb-Pb relative to pp collisions helps to quantify the differential suppression of these two states, offering a clearer picture of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and its impact on different charmonium states.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the analysis status of inclusive J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) production at forward rapidity (2.5 $<$ $\\mid$y$\\mid$ $<$ 4), in Pb-Pb collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2023 by the upgraded ALICE detector during LHC Run 3, which provides higher statistics compared to previous data-taking periods. The $\\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\\psi$ double ratio will also be reported. The results will be compared to similar measurements from data collected during LHC Run 2.",

          "description": "Quarkonia in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions are important probes for studying the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in vacuum. Understanding the production mechanism of J/$\\psi$, a bound state of a charm and anti-charm quark, is crucial to constrain both  perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of QCD calculations. Different theoretical models have been developed aiming to describe the whole production mechanism from the partonic interaction to the heavy-quark pair hadronisation into a quarkonium state. All approaches are based on the factorisation hypothesis between hard and soft scales. The polarization of quarkonia in pp collisions is a powerful observable to discriminate among several QCD-based model calculations of quarkonium production. Furthermore, J/$\\psi$ polarization measurement in pp collisions  can also provide a reference for investigating the fate of charmonium in the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. In this poster, we will present the performance and analysis status of the inclusive J/$\\psi$ polarization measurement via the dielectron decay channel (J/$\\psi$ $\\rightarrow$ $e^{+}e^{-}$) at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$) in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV. This analysis is based on data collected by the upgraded ALICE detector and benefits from the high luminosity collected during the first three years of LHC Run 3. It offers significantly higher statistics compared to the one available from previous pp data collected during the Run 2 of LHC, allowing for the first J/$\\psi$ polarization measurement at midrapidity. This analysis will be discussed together with previous J/$\\psi$ measurements in pp collisions from ALICE based on Run 2 data.",

          "description": "The ALICE experiment changed its data-taking strategy from triggered to continuous detector readout and underwent several detectors upgrades, in order to cope with the LHC Run3 luminosity increase and maximize the amount of data collected. Among the aforementioned upgrades, the installation of the new muon forward tracker (MFT) enriches the study of quarkonium production previously carried out with the ALICE muon spectrometer at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4). In particular, thanks to its high spatial resolution, the MFT allows to identify the quarkonia directly produced at the collision (prompt) from those coming from beauty hadron decays (non-prompt). This separation is critical to enlarge our knowledge of heavy-quark production both in pp and heavy-ion collisions, including access to charmonia decaying from b-hadrons and clearer analysis of the quarkonia regeneration mechanism. Experimentally, the prompt/non-prompt separation performance relies on highly efficient track matching between the MFT and the muon spectrometer, together with the precise determination of the secondary vertex. It can be performed using the pseudo-proper decay time $\\tau$ at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 3.6) along the beam axis. In this poster, prompt and non-prompt $J/\\psi$ separation performances and preliminary results of the prompt and non-prompt $J/\\psi$ fraction at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 3.6) in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV will be presented.",

          "description": "Hadronic resonances play a crucial role in probing the characteristics of the hadronic phase in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Exploring the dynamics of the hadronic phase reveals the roles of rescattering and regeneration in resonance production. In particular, rescattering reduces the resonance yields and may alter their transverse momentum, while regeneration can lead to their enhancement. By analyzing the ratios of resonance yields to those of long-lived particles across various charged-particle multiplicities, valuable insights into hadronic interactions and system evolution are obtained.  Recent results from high-multiplicity pp and p–Pb collisions exhibit QGP-like signatures, including strangeness enhancement and collective expansion, closely resembling those in Pb–Pb collisions. These measurements of resonance production in high-multiplicity pp collisions could provide insights into the production mechanisms and potential existence of a hadronic phase in smaller collision systems.\r\n\r\nThis contribution presents the latest measurements of $\\Lambda(1520)$, $\\rm K^{*0}(892)$, and $\\rm \\phi(1020)$ resonance production in high-multiplicity pp collisions, focusing on the $p_{\\rm T}$-integrated yield ($\\frac{dN}{dy}$), mean transverse momentum ($\\langle p_{\\rm T} \\rangle$), and particle yield ratios as functions of charged-particle multiplicity.",

          "description": "The event classifiers based on particle multiplicity or event topologies such as transverse spherocity and underlying events have been extensively used at ALICE to probe the origin of the observed Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) like phenomena in high multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions. The drawback of using the multiplicity-based classifiers is that selecting high multiplicity events may bias the sample towards hard processes dominated by multi-jet scatterings, making it difficult to pinpoint the origin of observed QGP-like signatures in pp collisions. New ALICE measurements show that, among the available event classifiers, charged particle flattenicity has the largest sensitivity to inherent multi-partonic interactions and less sensitivity to final state hard-scatterings, offering the possibility to select softer events with enhanced radial flow signatures.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we explore the event-shape dependence of strange hadron production as a function of the charged particle flattenicity, defined in ALICE using the charged particle multiplicity in $2.2<|\\eta|<5.0$ and $-3.4<|\\eta|<-2.3$  intervals. The contribution discusses the production of $\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda}$ and $K^{0}_{S}$ in different intervals of charged particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV with ALICE. $p_{\\rm T}$-integrated and $p_{\\rm T}$-differential baryon-to-meson ratio, $(\\Lambda+\\bar{\\Lambda})/2K^{0}_{S}$, will also be shown for different intervals of charged particle flattenicity. Comparisons with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generators will be shown to interpret the results in light of the multi-partonic interactions.",

The high-multiplicity events in small collision systems, such as pp and p–Pb, are of particular interest for gaining further insights into particle production mechanisms. In particular, to disentangle the various effects, it is essential to perform precise measurements in small systems of particle production at multiplicities that are close to the ones obtained in AA. This contribution will discuss new results on identified light-flavour particle production measured in high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, bridging the gap in multiplicity between small and large systems. The results will also be compared with theoretical models and to measurements in AA collisions at the same multiplicity.",

This new experimental apparatus will feature exceptional pointing resolution and excellent Particle Identification (PID). A key component will be a Time-Of-Flight system utilizing silicon sensors, achieving an outstanding time resolution of 20 ps.\r\nTo meet these ambitious goals, several silicon technologies are under investigation, particularly fully depleted CMOS sensors with additional gain. A significant R&D effort is essential, as the time resolution of CMOS sensors needs to be pushed significantly beyond the current state of the art to satisfy the stringent requirements of future experiments. Notably, recent developments have integrated Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD) technology into the design of fully depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS).\r\nThis poster will focus on two main aspects: the Monte Carlo simulation carried out to design the latest production of a Monolithic sensor with additional gain produced with a commercial 110 nm technology, and the experimental results concerning timing resolution obtained from laboratory tests and in a test beam conducted at the CERN Proton Synchrotron in October 2024.\r\nFollowing this discussion, an overview of the next steps in the R&D will be presented.",

          "description": "Correlated electron-positron pairs (dielectrons) present a unique probe to study the properties of the medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. They are produced in all stages of the collision and leave the system without loss of information as they do not interact strongly with the medium. However, at LHC energies, the thermal dielectrons emitted in the early stages of the collision from the quark-gluon-plasma are outnumbered by a large contribution of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$-pairs from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour (HF) hadrons.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade of the ALICE detector installed during the Long Shutdown 2 is crucial to boost the precision of thermal radiation measurement. The continuous readout of the TPC allows for higher data acquisition rate of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions. Moreover, the new ITS with its higher granularity and closer location to the interaction point improves the pointing resolution by a factor of 2 compared to that in Run 2, leading to a better topological separation of prompt thermal radiation and e$^{+}$e$^{-}$-pairs from HF hadron decays, and to smaller background from photon conversions in the detector material.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the status of the analysis of a large data set of Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV, recorded with the upgraded ALICE detector in Run 3, is presented. The electron and positron identification capabilities are evaluated and the impact of the detector upgrades on the dielectron analysis will be shown.",

          "description": "The simultaneous description of the elliptic flow and the production rate of direct photons in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions remains a major theoretical challenge, commonly referred to as the “direct-photon puzzle”. To distinguish between the elliptic flow of direct photons and photons originating from hadronic decays, primarily from π0 mesons, a precise measurement of the π0 flow is crucial. Furthermore, measurements of elliptic flow of different baryons and mesons can help to better understand underlying production mechanisms. During LHC Run 3, the ALICE experiment collected more than 100x more Pb–Pb collisions compared to Run 2, opening up new opportunities to study all these effects in greater detail.\r\n\r\nIn ALICE, the π0 can be reconstructed using various methods. For high transverse momentum π0 mesons, these methods rely on measuring decay photons with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal). In this poster the current status of the measurement of elliptic flow of π0 mesons in Pb–Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.36 TeV will be presented.",

          "description": "SiPM (Silicon PhotoMultiplier) sensors are one of the technologies under study for the outer timing layer of ALICE 3, a next-generation multipurpose detector at the LHC which will replace the present ALICE experiment for Run 5 and beyond.\r\n\r\nSiPMs are usually coupled to scintillators or Cherenkov radiators. Nonetheless, in recent studies it has been shown that SiPMs can directly detect charged particles due to the emission of Cherenkov light in the standard protection layer placed on top of the SiPM.\r\n\r\nNUV-HD-LFv2 SiPMs, produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler with 3.20 x 3.12 mm$^2$ area and with different thickness of protection layers, have been tested in a beam-test setup at CERN PS.  The telescope is made of four sensors: two SiPMs under test and two LGAD detectors (1x1 mm$^2$ 25 um and 35 um thick sensors). The latter are used as timing reference and the coincidence of the two defines the trigger for the beam particles. The main results, obtained with a 4 GHz digital oscilloscope, confirm a very high efficiency above 99% and a noise below 1% for a threshold over 6-10 photoelectrons.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the performances after irradiation in terms of timing response and Dark Count Rate will be presented. They have been evaluated for NUV-HD-RH SiPMs of 1 x 1 mm$^2$ area, proving the possibility to maintain excellent timing performance close to 20 ps and low level of dark counts once an appropriate threshold is applied to the signal.\r\n\r\nIn the last beam test, SiPMs were also studied in a new and complete front-end and readout electronics chain made by a LIROC discriminator and a picoTDC with 3.05 ps bin size. In this poster, the efficiency with this setup will be reported for matrices made of 9 SiPMs, confirming to be above 95% at the lowest threshold achievable.",

In this poster, we present the first multi-particle cumulant of $p_T$ correlations of its mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis as a function of event centrality for Au+Au collisions in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.1, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 54.4 GeV at high statistics of the first and second phase of RHIC Beam Energy Scan.

          "description": "The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions can be studied using hard probes, such as $D^0$ meson-tagged jets created at early stage of the collision. The jet yield and its substructure are modified by interactions with the medium, compared to vacuum propagation. This phenomenon is known as jet quenching.\r\n\r\nThe generalized angularities  $\\lambda_{\\alpha}^{\\kappa}$ characterize the jet substructure, and they can distinguish jets initiated by light and heavy quarks, and gluons, where the different choice of $\\kappa$ and $\\alpha$ parameters tunes the discriminating power of the observable. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor $ R_{\\text{CP}}$ of $D^0$ jets as a function of the generalized angularities in heavy-ion collisions open ways to investigate modifications of heavy quark fragmentation function and jet substructure in the QGP.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we report the measurement of $ D^0 $ meson-tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $ \\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200 \\, \\text{GeV} $ by the STAR experiment at RHIC. We present for the first time distributions of different angularities, such as girth $ \\lambda_{1}^{1}$, thrust $ \\lambda_{2}^1 $, momentum dispersion $ \\sqrt{\\lambda_{0}^{2}} $, or Les Houches Angularity $ \\lambda_{0.5}^{1} $. We also show the nuclear modification factor $ R_{\\text{CP}} $ as a function of these generalized angularities to explore potential modifications of heavy-flavor jets in the medium. These results could help distinguish between different models of jet quenching and in-medium energy loss of heavy flavor quarks.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions offer a unique environment for exploring quantum interference at an unprecedented femtometer scale through photon-nuclear interactions in photoproduction.  In exclusive $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ production, the resonance and continuum $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ components arise from distinct production mechanisms in the $\\gamma {\\rm A}$ interaction. The continuum $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ photoproduction is dominated by Drell-S$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$ding process, in which a virtual $\\pi^{+}/\\pi^{-}$ is diffraction-scattered on the nucleus.  The $\\sim$5% difference in the elastic scattering cross sections of $\\pi^{-} {\\rm A}$ and $\\pi^{+} {\\rm A}$ around a $\\gamma {\\rm p}$ center-of-mass energy of approximately 12 GeV in photoproduction in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions may result in destructive interference. In contrast to $\\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, the Entanglement Enabled Spin Interference (EESI) in Drell-S$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$ding process may differ due to the absence of the intermediate $\\rho^{0}$ and the specific dynamics of the virtual pion-nucleus interaction.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the first measurement of the diffractive $p_{T}$ spectrum and the spin interference pattern through ${\\rm A_{2\\Delta\\phi}}$ for the Drell-S$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$ding process in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV at STAR. The results indicate an obvious difference in $p_{T}$ spectrum compared to $\\rho^{0}$ photoproduction. We also observe ${\\rm A_{2\\Delta\\phi}}$ with no clear mass dependence for $p_{T} < 0.1$ GeV/c and a notablely stronger interference at the same ${\\rm M_{\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}}}$ in the Drell-S$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$ding process compared to $\\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, which provides a unique opportunity to explore the effect of production mechanism on the EESI.",

          "description": "Charge-dependent directed flow can reveal the influence of electromagnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions. For instance, Faraday induction is predicted to contribute negatively to $\\Delta (dv_1/dy)$, defined as the difference in the slope of rapidity-odd directed flow ($dv_1/dy$), between positively and negatively charged particles. Recent STAR data from peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 and 27 GeV supported this scenario. In this poster, we present the STAR BES-II results of $v_1$ and $\\Delta v_1$ for $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $p(\\bar{p})$  and $\\Lambda(\\bar{\\Lambda})$ as functions of rapidity, transverse momentum ($p_T$), and centrality at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 17.3, 14.6, 11.5, 9.2 and 7.7 GeV. In peripheral collisions, the sign of $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ is consistent with the expectation from the dominance of Faraday+Coulomb effect over Hall+transported quark effect, and $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ becomes more negative at lower collision energies, as expected from a longer lifetime of the electromagnetic field and/or a shorter lifetime of the fireball at these energies. We also discuss the expected electromagnetic-field effects on the constituent quarks in $\\Lambda$ and ${\\bar \\Lambda}$, and consequently on their $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ within the coalescence framework.",

Although these isobars have the same mass number, their differing proton and neutron numbers may lead to distinct charge distributions and neutron density profiles, which could be reflected in differences in Coulomb dissociation. As a process driven by the strong electromagnetic fields generated during ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), Coulomb dissociation can lead to neutron emission through photon exchange between the ions. In the STAR experiment, neutron emission can be measured by utilizing the Zero-Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs). \r\n\r\nIn this poster, we present new measurements on neutron emission from $^{96}_{44}\\text{Ru}+^{96}_{44}\\text{Ru}$ and $^{96}_{40}\\text{Zr}+^{96}_{40}\\text{Zr}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. By analyzing these results, we aim to gain deeper insights into the nuclear structure properties of isobaric nuclei, such as neutron skin thickness and nuclear radii.

The data were recorded in 2014 with an online High Tower trigger which requires at least 4.2 GeV energy deposited in one Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) tower. \r\n\r\nJets are reconstructed from charged-particle tracks in the Time Projection Chamber and neutral energy measured by the BEMC using the anti-$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ algorithm, with resolution parameters $R$ = 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4. The combinatorial jets in heavy-ion collisions are suppressed by requiring a high-transverse-momentum ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) leading charged or neutral constituent in accepted jet candidates. The bias imposed by this requirement is estimated, and the unbiased region is identified. Inclusive jet distributions are corrected for background fluctuations and detector effects using unfolding techniques, and reported up to jet $p_{\\mathrm{T}}=$ 50 GeV/$c$, extending significantly the kinematic reach of existing measurements with charged-particle jets. \r\n\r\nThese distributions are compared to those in $p$+$p$ collisions, and the medium-induced modification to the inclusive jet yield is discussed and compared with state-of-the-art models of jet quenching.",

          "description": "In this work, we compare two multi-stage approaches for RHIC BES energies that both model the hot and dense part of the medium evolution with fluid dynamics, while have different strategies for the early-stage dynamics and baryon stopping. This work is important in the context of RHIC Beam Energy Scan program and future FAIR experiments, exploring the phase diagram of QCD and locating its possible critical point. At such energies, the nuclear inter-penetration time is large, therefore constraining the early-stage dynamics, that is most sensitive to the EoS at high baryon densities, is essential.\r\n\r\nThe first approach is dynamical fluidization, where the fluid is generated from a transport approach (SMASH) based on sufficient local energy density in the hadronic state by fluidizing hadrons, realizing a dynamic core-corona scenario. The fireball fluid is in this case generated with both energy and baryon currents, thus is not baryon-free.\r\n\r\nThe second approach is represented by MUlti Fluid simulation for Fast IoN collisions (MUFFIN) model, that treats the colliding nuclei as two cold baryon-rich fluids with the third fireball fluid emerging from their friction baryon-less (in the current implementation).\r\n\r\nFirst the friction terms in the multifluid model and their counterparts, source terms in the dynamical fluidization approach are compared, exploring how the transport approach can inform the friction term formulation. The difference in the formation of the central fireball fluid is also studied, specifically the energy and baryon density distributions and their effect on the resulting spectra, primarily net-proton distributions.",

This observable is increasingly used across various systems due to its ability to probe jets over a broad phase space, including low transverse momenta ($p_{\\rm T}$) and large radii. Measurements of h+jet in relatively smaller isobar collision systems (Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru) compared to other collision systems at RHIC provide important insights into the energy density and path length dependencies of parton energy loss. In this poster, we will report the measurement of h+jet yields for the charged-particle jets with radii ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 in isobar collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The anti-$k_\\mathrm{T}$ jet reconstruction algorithm is used, with mixed-event technique applied to remove uncorrelated combinatorial background present in heavy-ion collisions. The trigger hadrons are selected with $p_{\\rm T}$ between 7 and 25 GeV/$c$. Results of fully corrected per-trigger jet yield integrated over a recoil region and its relative suppression in central to peripheral collisions at mid-rapidity as a function of jet $p_{\\rm T}$ will be presented.",

We also make comparisons to transport model calculations and thermal model predictions.\r\n\r\nIn central collisions, the ($p_{T}$) correlations show a decrease as a function of collision energy from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV onwards and then an increase from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV. By further investigating this non-monotonous behaviour, we aim to deepen our understanding of how the system evolves across different energy regimes, and whether this non-monotonicity could signal the possible existence of a QCD critical point.",

          "description": "The main goal of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program is to explore the phase structure of strongly interacting nuclear matter and search for the possible QCD critical point (CP) in high-energy nuclear collisions. Over more than a decade, the Beam Energy Scan programs (BES-I and BES-II) at RHIC covered a wide range of collision energy, from $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 3.0 GeV to 200 GeV corresponding to a wide range of baryonic chemical potential $\\mu_{B}=$ 750 MeV to 25 MeV. The STAR detector, with some crucial upgrades, was the main apparatus used in the scan. Higher-order fluctuations of (net-)proton numbers, serving as sensitive probes for the QCD phase structure including CP, have been measured with the highest precision to date.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will focus on the physics of phase boundary and QCD critical point. The precision measurement from BES-II, which examines net-proton, proton and antiproton number cumulants and factorial cumulants in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3, 19.6 and 27 GeV, will be presented. Specifically, the collision centrality and energy dependence of the cumulants up to the fourth order will be included. The new experimental results will be discussed within the framework of non-critical model calculations.",

          "description": "Dielectron production can occur in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions via the Breit-Wheeler process, in which the linearly polarized photons from the heavy ion fields interact to produce low transverse momentum dielectron pairs. This production is sensitive to the electromagnetic field distributions from the heavily Lorentz-contracted nuclei, which are directly dependent on the charge radius and shape of the atomic nucleus sourcing the photons. This can result in a non-isotropic azimuthal production, as well as shifts in the momentum-dependent production cross sections between different sourcing nuclei. Additionally, Sudakov radiation can result in an azimuthal modulation at higher pair momentum, so nuclear shape effects and constraints on the angular effects of soft photon radiation can both be measured for the first time.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, results will be presented of the first Breit-Wheeler measurement in U+U ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV, with comparisons to Au+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, to explore both nuclear shape effects on the cross sections, and the effects of both nuclear shape and Sudakov radiation on the azimuthal modulation strengths. Comparisons between gold and uranium show a sensitivity to nuclear shape differences at pair $p_{T}$ less than 60 MeV/c in both the cross sections and the angular modulations. Similarly, by measuring these modulations at pair $p_{T}$ above 60 MeV/c, qualitative results are observed that are in agreement with theory predictions for the effects of Sudakov radiation (Shao, et al. 2023).",

          "description": "The interplay of various  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  photoproduction mechanisms creates a rich environment to explore the Entanglement Enabled Spin Interference (EESI) effect in different contexts. The resonance and continuum  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production originate from distinct  $\\gamma A$  and  $\\gamma \\gamma$  processes offering unique opportunities to investigate production mechanisms and interference dynamics. The continuum $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production is dominated by single virtual $\\pi^+ / \\pi^-$  nucleus scattering in the Drell-Söding process, which has never been precisely measured. Due to the absence of the intermediate $\\rho^0$  and its unique production mechanism, the Drell-Söding measurement could provide a new and unprecedented insight into the entanglement purity and interference dynamics. The $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ process also contributes to the continuum  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  production. EESI between the $\\gamma \\gamma $ and $\\gamma A$ pathways produces a clean  $A_{1\\Delta \\phi}$ signal that can be used to isolate the hadronic light-by-light process from the dominant Drell-Söding process for the first time: a result that may provide new theoretical constraints on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In addition, the measurement of  $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$  photoproduction in peripheral collisions could investigate the possible decoherence caused by interactions with the created medium and the impact parameter dependence of EESI as well as decoherence due to breakup of the nucleus.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurement of the diffractive $p_T$  spectrum and the EESI through  $A_{2\\Delta \\phi}$  for the Drell-Söding process and the first measurement to utilize EESI observables to isolate the  $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ in ultraperipheral $Au+Au$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We also report the first measurement to study the impact of the quark-gluon medium on the coherence of the EESI system in peripheral $Au+Au$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV.",

To study these effects, we measure two novel jet observables, the CollinearDrop (CD) jet mass and the charge correlation ratio ($r_c$), with jets reconstructed in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV at the STAR experiment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present measurements of the CD jet mass, which is related to the  difference of the jet mass and the SoftDrop groomed mass, and so is by construction sensitive to soft radiation within jets. We compare the measurements with predictions from the NLL SCET calculations and event generator simulations. A multi-dimensional unfolding technique, MultiFold, allows us to further access the fully corrected correlations among the CD jet mass and the SoftDrop jet observables to probe the interplay between different stages of the parton shower. Our measurement indicates that there is a correlation between the amount of early-stage non-perturbative radiation and the time at which the first hard splitting happens. \r\n\r\nWe also present the $r_c$ measurement that probes the contributions of string-like hadronization, by distinguishing the charge signs of leading and subleading charged particles within jets. Compared with event generator predictions, our measurement shows that both PYTHIA and HERWIG over-predict the string-like correlation between the leading hadrons. Finally, we discuss the physics implications from these model comparisons.",

          "description": "In proton-proton collisions, hard-scattered partons will undergo perturbative fragmentation and hadronization, resulting in a collimated collection of hadrons that can be measured as a jet. Two- and three-point energy correlators have been shown experimentally in proton-proton collisions to describe both the perturbative and non-perturbative evolution of a jet, with a transition between the two at a fixed energy scale. In heavy-ion collisions, the medium has been seen to quench jets and modify their substructure. Energy correlators can potentially isolate these modifications to identifiable angular scales, including the onset of effects such as color coherence and the medium wake.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the first measurement of N-point energy correlators in isobar collisions (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) at RHIC at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be shown. Additionally, measurements of charge-weighted energy correlators in proton-proton collisions by STAR have revealed that the behavior governing two-point charge conservation across hadronization is not well described by current Monte-Carlo models at angles below the hadronization regime. In this talk, we also present the first measurement of charge-weighted energy correlators in isobar collisions, which helps to identify modifications to the hadronization process in the presence of the medium.",

          "description": "Studying its path-length dependence is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of parton energy loss in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. A path-length asymmetry along impact parameter direction ($x$) exists for hard probes in heavy-ion collisions at finite rapidity, as the QGP bulk is tilted in reaction plane, while the hard scattering profile is not [2]. Previous measurements of $v_1$ (= $\\langle p_x/p_T \\rangle$) of $D^0$-mesons have demonstrated sensitivity of hard produced partons to this path-length asymmetry [2,3]. Measurements of jet $v_1$ will provide access to path-length dependent energy loss of partons in the QGP. The jet $v_1$ measurements do not get contributions from event-by-event geometry fluctuations, unlike measurements relative to the second order event plane. Measurements therefore of in- and out-of-plane yield ratios of hard probes in events with different second-order eccentricities offer complementary information on this effect in the QGP. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the first measurement of inclusive charged jet and high-$p_T$ charged hadron $v_1$ in Au+Au and Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr (isobar) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR. Jet $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and radius dependence of jet $v_1$ will be shown. We will also present an evaluation of the initial path-length asymmetry from the tilted bulk, utilizing models describing the measured pseudorapidity dependence of particle production in asymmetric collisions and discuss future opportunities with event shape engineering (ESE) for the first order anisotropy. In addition, measurements of ratios of in-and out-of-plane yields of high momentum probes in events selected to have different second order eccentricities, using ESE, in Au + Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV will be shown.  \r\n\r\n[1] ALICE Collaboration Phys.

The $\\gamma$ and $\\pi^{0}$ triggers have transverse energy in the interval [11,15] GeV, and recoil jets are reported in the $p_T$ interval [10,20] GeV/c. Marked medium-induced acoplanarity is observed with both triggers for recoil jets with R=0.5 but not R=0.2, similar to a recent measurement at the LHC.

          "description": "Investigating the presence of an electromagnetic (EM) field in the \r\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) has gained significant interest in heavy-ion \r\ncollision studies. The EM field is a prerequisite for observing the chiral magnetic effect (CME) and could offer insight into the conductivity of QGP. Affecting positively and negatively charged quarks differently, the fleeting EM field contributes to the splitting between their directed flows ($v_1$) and eventually between particles and anti-particles. Features of initial baryon configuration may also impact the $v_1$ splitting between baryons and anti-baryons. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_1(y)$ and $\\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ for $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, and $p$($\\bar{p}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7-19.6 GeV and in U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$193 GeV, as well as of $\\Lambda^0$($\\bar{\\Lambda}^0$) and $\\Xi^-$($\\bar{\\Xi}^+$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7-27 GeV. \r\n\r\nWith the exception of $\\pi^{\\pm}$ at top RHIC energies, negative values of $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$ and $p$($\\bar{p}$) $\\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ are observed in peripheral collisions in both Au+Au and U+U collisions. Clear system-size dependence can be observed for $p$($\\bar{p}$) $\\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ with an ordering of U+U $>$ Au+Au $>$ isobar but not for $\\pi^{\\pm}$ and $K^{\\pm}$. The measured $\\Lambda^0 (\\bar{\\Lambda}^0)$ $\\Delta \\left(dv_1/dy \\right)$ is compared with $p(\\bar{p})$ $\\Delta \\left(dv_1/dy\\right)$ and the difference between $p (\\bar{p})$  $\\Delta \\left( dv_1/dy \\right)$ and $K^{\\pm}$ $\\Delta \\left(dv_1/dy\\right)$, motivated by the coalescence picture. These measurements are discussed with the expectation of EM-field effects dominated by Faraday induction and the Coulomb effect.\r\n\r\nAt lower RHIC energies, quarks transported to mid-rapidity become crucial in anisotropic flow measurements . In this talk, we also present measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\\pi^{\\pm}$ and $\\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7-27 GeV. The ratio $(v_2^{\\pi^-} - \\frac{2}{3}v_2^{\\bar{p}})/(v_2^{\\pi^+}-\\frac{2}{3}v_2^{\\bar{p}})$ is compared to the $d/u$ ratio of the colliding nuclei, in view of a generalized coalescence sum rule that accounts for the difference between transported and pair-produced quarks.",

          "description": "Jets originating from hard-scattered partons from the early stages of heavy-ion collisions travel through the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and are modified or quenched relative to a p+p collision baseline. Moments of the jet’s transverse momentum, $p_{\\text{T}}$, profile in the $ \\eta - \\varphi $ plane relative to the jet axis, called generalized jet angularities $\\lambda_\\alpha^\\kappa$, are an important class of jet substructure observables to study in-medium modifications of the jet’s radiation and fragmentation patterns. While previous measurements of these angularities were performed for inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, similar measurements at RHIC will probe jet quenching in complementary regions of phase space, offering new insights. Performing these measurements for inclusive and $D^0$ meson-tagged jets in Au+Au collisions will provide new opportunities to investigate in-medium modifications of jet substructure and quark fragmentation for both light and heavy flavors.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we report on the first measurements of nuclear modification factor as a function of  different generalized angularities for heavy flavor jets in heavy-ion collisions. The fully-corrected generalized jet angularities, such as Les Houches Angularity $\\lambda^1_{0.5}$, girth $\\lambda^1_1$, or thrust $\\lambda_2^1$ are measured for both inclusive and $D^0$ meson-tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC. These results can provide insight into mass-dependent effects and will help distinguish between various models of jet quenching, and light and heavy flavor quark in-medium energy loss.",

          "description": "The $J/\\psi$ meson, consisting of a charm quark and its antiquark, serves as an exceptional testing ground of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  However, our understanding of its underlying production mechanism remains incomplete. One of the principal challenges lies in experimentally disentangling perturbative from non-perturbative process contributions. The recently proposed $J/\\psi$-energy correlator[1] observable shows a remarkable ability to distinguish between soft and hard processes, thereby establishing the observable as a potent tool for investigating  $J/\\psi$ production mechanism. Theoretical calculations [1] further indicate that the  $J/\\psi$-energy correlator, observed within the  $J/\\psi$ helicity frame, possesses a strong discriminatory power against existing models.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the first measurement of the $J/\\psi$-energy correlator in hadron collisions. The study is conducted by reconstructing the $J/\\psi$ via its di-electron decay channel at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$), within the transverse momentum range of $5<p_T<10$ GeV/$c$, in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV at RHIC-STAR experiment. By comparing  $J/\\psi$ energy correlator with different model calculations,  we aim to provide a robust basis for distinguishing among the existing $J/\\psi$   production models.\r\n\r\n[1] An-Ping Chen, Xiaohui Liu, and Yan-Qing Ma.

          "description": "Studying heavy-flavor quarks can enhance our understanding of parton interactions with the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Due to their significant mass, heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are primarily produced during the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions, where hard scatterings dominate, allowing them to experience the entire evolution of the QGP. One approach to investigate heavy-quark transport properties in QGP is through the measurement of heavy-flavor electrons (HFE), which are electrons emitted from the semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present measurements of HFE yield and central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factor as functions of transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV by the STAR experiment - making this the first such result at this energy. Strong HFE suppression has been observed in central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. This measurement at energies below the RHIC top energy provides new insights into the heavy-quark transport coefficient dependence on QGP temperature and collision system baryon chemical potential, and complements existing results at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and the recent HFE elliptic flow measurements at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV. The obtained results will also be compared with available model predictions.",

          "description": "Strangeness production serves as a sensitive probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, it is proposed that the $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios in different colliding systems may reveal the minimum colliding system size required to produce the QGP. In Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV significant $\\Omega$ enhancement over $\\phi$ has been observed at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_T$) in central collisions, which can be explained by their production through the coalescence of strange quarks in the QGP. In addition, an intriguingly smooth increase in (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity was first reported at LHC energies, and it is critical to investigate this ratio at RHIC energies. Finally, strange hadron to strange anti-hadron ratio can be used to constrain the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at chemical freeze-out temperature. The versatility of RHIC to change the size of the colliding ions provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate strangeness production as a function of system size. In 2021, STAR collected a large O+O dataset at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. O+O is a unique symmetric small system allowing for a more straightforward geometry mapping with centrality than with asymmetric small systems. In addition, the high-quality O+O dataset will allow us to precisely map the (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, measurements on strange hadrons ($K^0_s$,$\\phi$, $\\Lambda$,$\\overline{\\Lambda}$,$\\Xi$,$\\overline{\\Xi}$,$\\Omega$,$\\overline{\\Omega}$) in O+O and Au+Au collisions will be presented, including their $p_T$ spectra, nuclear modification factors $R_{CP}$ and antibaryon-to-baryon ratios. Additionally, we will compare the centrality dependence of the $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios in five different collisions systems at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV : Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru, $d$+Au. Finally, we will investigate the (multi)strange hadron to pion yield ratio as a function of multiplicity for these aforementioned collision systems.",

          "description": "The foundation of modern physics is built on our understanding of the symmetries of nature. Of these symmetries, the universal symmetry of CPT is one of the most fundamental, underpinning both Quantum Field Theory and the General Theory of Relativity. CPT symmetry requires that all systems are invariant under a simultaneous reversal of charge, parity and time direction. This symmetry further requires that the mass of every type of matter be exactly the same as its anti-matter counterpart. \r\n\r\nUsing the data of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr isobar collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV collected by the STAR experiment in 2018, we report the mass difference between three nuclei and their anti-matter counterparts -  $^{3}H$, $^{3}He$, and $^{4}He$ - to test CPT symmetry.

In experiments, femtoscopic (momentum) correlations are utilized to gain information about the space-time geometry of the particle emitting source. In this talk we present recent two-pion femtoscopic measurements performed by the STAR experiment, at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 3.2, 3.9, 7.7, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 54.4, and 200 GeV, and their description with calculations based on Lévy-distributed sources. The obtained results indicate how the source shape changes with collision energy, centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the source parameters. The comparison of data to Monte-Carlo simulations at these energies is also discussed. We furthermore discuss the implications of this comparison on various stages of the evolution, and in particular, the explanation of the non-Gaussian nature of the 3D correlations at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.",

The mid-rapidity $v_1$ slope, $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$, of hyper-nuclei shows a similar energy and particle mass dependence to that of light-nuclei and the trends can be reproduced qualitatively by calculations of a hadronic transport model plus coalescence afterburner implying that these clusters are formed in a similar way in heavy-ion collisions. In addition, we will also present the measurement of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of light-nuclei from mid-central Au+Au collisions in the same energy range. The elliptic flow results indicate an out-of-plane expansion ($v_2 < 0$) at the lowest collision energy, whereas in-plane expansions ($v_2 > 0$) are evident at all other collision energies. These new results will be discussed within the framework of transport model calculations.",

          "description": "In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the initial strong magnetic (B) field can give rise to a broad range of phenomena, such as the splitting of Landau levels under strong B-fields, which has significant implications in QCD [1]. The neutral ($K^{*0}$) and charged ($K^{*\\pm}$) vector mesons have similar masses and isospin; however, their quark magnetic moments differ by a factor of five, making them ideal probes for studying Landau level splitting and potential isospin symmetry breaking in the presence of B-fields [2]. The recent observation of isospin violation in neutral and charged kaons by NA61/SHINE challenges the assumption of isospin symmetry in QCD, though the cause remains unknown [3]. A difference in $K^{*0,\\pm}$ yields due to B-field can feeddown  ($K^{*0} \\rightarrow K^{\\pm} + \\pi^{\\mp}$, $K^{*\\pm} \\rightarrow K_{S}^{0} +\\pi^{\\pm}$) into the inclusive neutral and charged kaon yields, and contribute to the above apparent isospin violation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the invariant mass peak position and its width, transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra, yields ($dN/dy$), and $\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$ of $K^{*0,\\pm}$ mesons near mid-rapidity, utilizing collisions involving isospin-asymmetric nuclei (Au+Au, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and isospin-symmetric nuclei (O+O), as well as p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We report on particle ratios, including $K^{*\\pm}/K^{*0}$ and $K^{\\pm}/K_{S}^{0}$, as a function of $p_{T}$ and centrality in various heavy-ion collision systems. Results from p+p collisions, which are expected to have no B-field effect,  serve as a good baseline. Additionally, results from BES-II Au+Au collisions ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 - 19.6$ GeV) will be presented to study the energy dependence of the above ratios. This study offers comprehensive insights into Landau levels, isospin violation, and late-stage B-fields in QCD medium.\r\n\r\n[1] F. Bruckmann et. al., Phys. Rev. C 96, 074506 (2017) \r\n[2] K.

          "description": "In non-central heavy-ion collisions, large orbital angular momentum and strong vorticity fields are produced and predicted to polarize quark spins. Unexpectedly large global spin alignment ($\\rho_{00}$) values for ${\\phi}$(1020) mesons have been reported in the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) in Au+Au collisions [1]. These values exceed conventional expectations based on global hyperon polarization induced by orbital angular momentum, suggesting the possible presence of a strong force field for $\\phi$ mesons [2].\r\n\r\nPrevious $\\rho_{00}$ measurements use a 1D angular distribution in $\\theta^*$ (polar angle of a daughter kaon in the $\\phi$ meson's rest frame with respect to the orthogonal of the harmonic event plane). We will use both angular dimensions $\\theta^*$ and $\\beta$ of a daughter kaon in the $\\phi$ meson's rest frame, where $\\beta$ is the azimuthal angle within the harmonic event plane, measured relative to the positive beam axis. This technique enables off-diagonal element extraction with fewer assumptions regarding the decay daughter distributions. We will present differential measurements of $\\phi$-meson $\\rho_{00}$ and off-diagonal spin density matrix elements, using data from the second phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-19.6$ GeV collected by STAR. Results will be shown as functions of rapidity (y), centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{T}$). Additionally, we will present differential helicity frame spin alignment results to test their predicted relation with global spin alignment [3].\r\n\r\nWe will also present $\\rho_{00}$ results using two alternative extraction methods: (i) $\\langle\\cos^2\\theta^*\\rangle$ and (ii) $\\langle\\cos2\\phi^* \\rangle$ (where $\\phi^*$ is the projection of $\\theta^*$ onto the transverse plane) as a function of the kaon pair invariant mass. For these approaches, we explore data-driven methods to correct for detector acceptance and efficiency. We further investigate the $\\phi$ meson local spin alignment in Au+Au as well as d+Au collisions at 200 GeV, where the quantization axis lies along the beam axis.\r\n\r\nThe results presented in this talk can help clarify the possible link of global spin alignment to vector meson fields and their contributions to the evolution of nuclear matter.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration., Nature 614, 244–248 (2023)\r\n[2] X.L.

          "description": "The femtoscopy technique, applied to nucleus-nucleus collisions, is a powerful method for studying the properties of particle-emitting sources and providing precise insights into the final-state interactions of the produced hadrons. Through femtoscopy data analysis, key conclusions can be drawn about the existence of bound states, the nature of molecular states, and even the dynamics of three-body interactions by examining correlations involving deuteron-hadron pairs.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the mechanisms of light nuclei formation in high-energy collisions are addressed by comparing femtoscopy data from proton-proton (pp) collisions to a model for particle emission, CECA. By incorporating a time delay in the deuteron emission, a fit to the K$^+$d correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration reveals a maximum value between 2 to 5 fm/$c$, indicating that deuterons in pp collisions at the LHC cannot form as compact, non-interacting objects.\r\n\r\n[1] O.

The investigation of the soft and hard processes involved in quarkonium formation is key in constraining the theoretical models and helping to differentiate between them.\r\n\r\nThis poster presents the preliminary measurements of the $\\Upsilon$ meson production in the dielectron decay channel in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV at RHIC recorded by the STAR experiment. This includes the transverse momentum and mid-rapidity spectra of the combined $\\Upsilon$(1S+2S+3S) states, as well as the integrated production cross-section. The progress of measuring the dependence of self-normalised $\\Upsilon$ meson yield on the self-normalised charged particle multiplicity is presented. This measurement is used to study the interplay of soft and hard processes during quarkonium formation. The analysis uses a significantly larger data sample than previous STAR measurements, up to 10 times the integrated luminosity, which improves the precision of the measurement.",

Dielectrons are an ideal probe for understanding the properties of the QGP and its evolution, as they are emitted throughout the whole evolution of the collision and do not interact strongly with the hot and dense medium. By measuring the invariant mass distribution of thermal dielectrons, it is possible to extract the average temperature of the hot QCD medium at different stages of the evolution.\r\n\r\nThe RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program offers a unique opportunity to study dielectron production across a wide range of collision energies. In this presentation, we will present new measurements of the dielectron invariant mass spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 17.3 \\mathrm{\\,GeV}$ with the STAR experiment.

          "description": "Elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in the forward and backward rapidity regions, are sensitive to the equation of state of hot and dense nuclear matter as well as the initial conditions in heavy-ion collisions. According to hydrodynamic models, the rapidity dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ has a strong constraining power on the temperature dependence of specific shear viscosity ($\\eta/s$). However, such flow data in the forward/backward regions as well as at lower collisions energies are scarce or even not available for $v_3$. In the second phase of the beam energy scan program (BESII) at RHIC-STAR, data from Au+Au collisions at lower collision energies were taken with the inner TPC ($|\\eta|<1.5$) and Event Plane Detector (EPD, $2.1<|\\eta|<5.1$) upgrades. At low energy, the EPD covers both participant and spectator regions, allowing us to study the rapidity dependence of azimuthal anisotropy in detail.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, precision measurement of elliptic flow in a wide range of rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{{NN}}}$ = 19.6 GeV will be reported and compared to the previous result by the PHOBOS experiment. The first measurement of triangular flow will be also presented over such a wide rapidity range in 19.6 GeV Au+Au collisions. These results will be compared to theoretical models and provide important input to constrain the temperature and baryon chemical potential dependence of $\\eta/s$.",

          "description": "Jet quenching, a key probe for studying the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions, involves modifications to the energy and substructure of high-energy parton showers within the QGP. While the jet quenching phenomenon has been well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions, it is not observed in smaller $p$+A collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon, and O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems. We present the first measurement of jet yield in O+O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV, utilizing both inclusive jet and semi-inclusive hadron+jet, including results for different centralities with jet $R$ from 0.2 to 0.5. For semi-inclusive measurement, we select recoil jets with a high-$p_T$ trigger hadron in the range of $p_T$ = 7 – 30 GeV. Mixed event technique is used to correct for the uncorrelation background contribution in heavy-ion collisions. These results are compared to similar measurements in collision systems of various sizes, providing valuable insight into how the system size affects the QGP properties.",

          "description": "Dielectrons, emitted during the evolution of the hot and dense QCD medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, offer an effective probe of the hot medium, as they are non-strongly interacting. The dielectron emission rate is proportional to the medium's electromagnetic spectral function. In the dielectron mass region $M_{ee} < 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$, the spectral function probes the in-medium $\\rho$ meson propagator which is sensitive to the medium’s properties including the total baryon density and the temperature. Measuring thermal dielectron production allows us to investigate the microscopic interaction mechanism between the electromagnetic current and the medium, along with exploring various medium properties. \r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will report STAR measurements of thermal dielectrons produced in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV. The results will include the electron angular distributions in the virtual photon rest frame, thermal dielectron invariant mass spectra, excess yields and temperature measurements. In addition, these new preliminary results will be compared to the results from STAR BES-I and theoretical model calculations for the discussions of the physics implications.",

          "description": "Bayesian inference in heavy-ion physics often produces varying estimates of model parameters when varying the physics model and/or the prior assumptions, reflecting a lack of accounting for theoretical uncertainties. Traditionally, a good model-to-data fit is seen as success, with inferred parameters assumed to reflect underlying physics. However, theories have limitations and extending a theory beyond its scope without including model uncertainties not only leads to incorrect parameter estimates, rendering them as mere fitting variables, but also reduces the utility of the data. To address this we propose a statistical framework that accounts for theoretical uncertainties in multistage heavy-ion models. We test this framework using \"measurements\" of $p_T$-differential observables obtained from a \"true\" theory - a $2+1$d hydrodynamic simulation with a known fixed value for the specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$ that employs a Grad 14-moment particlization prescription. We use these observables to calibrate via Bayesian inference a different hydrodynamic simulation model that uses a parametrization of $(\\eta/s)(T)$ as a function of the temperature and applies a different particlization ansatz. Our Bayesian inference framework allows for theoretical uncertainties by including model discrepancy in its statistical modeling. We compare the inferred values for the specific shear viscosity with and without the uncertainty model, demonstrating its impact on posterior inference of $\\eta/s$.",

          "description": "We present a novel fully-covariant and causal description of a viscous, resistive plasma within the approximation of single-fluid magnetohydrodynamics. The physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (RHIC's), but this approach could be of interest also for astrophysical and cosmological problems, since our formulation is valid for a general coordinate system with a non-trivial metric tensor. Our method is based on a generalization of the well-known Müller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory to explicitly include electromagnetic effects in the constitutive relations, by requiring that the new contributions to the entropy current locally satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The latter condition allows us to retrieve some of the terms appearing in the evolution equations for the dissipative fields derived from more microscopic methods, which rely on kinetic theory, such as the relaxation-time (RTA) or the 14-moment approximations for a single quark flavour. Finally, we extend our treatment to the more general situation of multiple conserved charges, which in RHIC's can be identified with the baryon number, the electric charge and the strangeness of the system and which arise from the independent conservation of the three light-quark flavours $u$, $d$ and $s$. In this case other possible tensorial structures appear in the non-ideal component of the entropy four-current, leading to a non-negative rate of entropy production.",

          "description": "In this contribution we present preliminary results on the dielectron production in p+p interactions at 1.58 GeV beam energy measured with the High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES). The HADES RICH detector has been upgraded with a new photon detection camera which strongly enhances the electron efficiency and conversion pair rejection. With this upgrade, a signal-to-background ratio above 1 is achieved over the entire dielectron spectrum. For this work, 0.5 billion collisions have been analyzed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by analyzing elastic p+p collisions, a normalization procedure for differential cross sections has been established. Additionally, collisions with an empty target and thereby the target vessel provide a p+Mylar spectrum and allow the extraction of a p+n spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe p+p and p+n dielectron spectra can serve as a reference for the understanding and interpretation of Ag+Ag collisions which have been measured in HADES at the same energy. A precise understanding of the dielectron production in elementary reactions is needed to disentangle the various contributions to the measured dielectron yield in Ag+Ag collisions. This NN baseline enables the determination of the medium temperature and the excess ratio.",

          "description": "Event-by-event fluctuations in the number of different particle species produced in high-energy nuclear collisions encode essential information about the phase structure of the matter created in such collisions. In this contribution, we present a novel fuzzy-logic-based approach for reconstructing arbitrary-order moments of multiplicity distributions [1]. The proposed method provides a robust alternative to traditional cut-based (binary) particle identification techniques, enabling a more precise reconstruction of higher-order moments in particle multiplicity distributions. By leveraging fuzzy logic, this approach addresses the uncertainties inherent in overlapping detector signals, thereby enhancing the reliability of the measurements. The mathematical framework developed here is shown to be effective across various simulation models, demonstrating its versatility. Furthermore, we test the method’s robustness by introducing correlations in particle production using the Metropolis algorithm, which verifies its applicability even in complex, correlated scenarios. This framework opens new avenues for conducting more accurate event-by-event analyses in high-energy nuclear physics experiments, offering insights into the phase structure of the matter produced.\r\n\r\n[1] A.

          "description": "The High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) [1] installed at the GSI institute in Darmstadt  registers  products  of  heavy  ion  collisions  at  energies  of  a  few  GeV  per  nucleon.   The nuclear  matter  produced  in  such  collisions  reaches  extreme  densities  and  temperatures  [2,  3,  4], comparable to those found in neutron stars, especially during their mergers [5].  By measuring the kinematic distributions of emitted particles and comparing them to transport model calculations – many aspects of the nuclear matter can be understood.\r\n\r\nParticles  containing  the  (anti)strange  quark  are  of  particular  interest,  as  they  are  produced sparsely in this energy regime and act as good probes of their interaction with the medium.  For charged K mesons it is predicted that due to their interaction in nuclear matter, their effective mass and decay constant should change [6].  This phenomenon was investigated by other experiments, but so far without a definitive conclusion [7].  Another interesting particle species is the Λ baryon, due to its predicted role in the so-called hyperon puzzle [8], where its interaction potential with nucleonic matter is an important piece of the “puzzle”.\r\n\r\nIt is predicted that the transverse flow – anisotropies in particle emission in the azimuthal angle (around the beam axis) – of strange hadrons should be sensitive to their interaction with the nuclear medium surrounding them during the collision [7, 9].  As such, studying the transverse flow of these particles may bring a significant advantage in our understanding of hadronic matter in the studied energy range.\r\n\r\nThis contribution will contain preliminary maps of $v_n$ coefficients in the momentum phase space of strange hadrons – K$^\\pm$ mesons and Λ baryons – emitted from Ag+Ag collisions at a beam energy of 1.58 GeV/nucleon. The work is in progress, however, the results may already provide insight into the kaon-nucleon interaction.  The transverse flow of Λ baryons is the first such result in this energy regime.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]  G. Agakichievet al., Eur. Phys. J. A41, 243-277 (2009)\r\n[2]  C. Hartnacket al., Phys.

By measuring changes in particle yields as a function of energy, one can explore the properties of matter at the phase transition. The NA61/SHINE experiment, a fixed-target project at the SPS facility at CERN, conducted a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by varying both the beam momentum (from 13 to 150/158 GeV/c) and the size of the colliding ions (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This approach offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of the phase transition.\r\nA key objective of the NA61/SHINE program is to investigate the properties at the onset of deconfinement (specifically, the energy threshold for the transition from a hadron gas to quark-gluon plasma) by measuring the strangeness-to-entropy ratio in the produced system. This presentation will discuss the latest results on charged hadron production, focusing on kaons, pions, and their ratios in Pb+Pb interactions. The NA61/SHINE results will be compared with available world data, providing a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the phase transition.",

The program's primary scientific goals include the search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter and the investigation of phenomena related to the onset of deconfinement and fireball formation. In recent years, the program has expanded to include lead-lead (Pb+Pb) collisions, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms of open charm production.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will summarize the recent NA61/SHINE results on the strong interaction program. The discussion will cover results related to particle spectra and yields, as well as fluctuations and correlations. In particular, new results on kaon and pion production in Xe+La and Pb+Pb collisions will be presented, as well as on resonance ($K^*$, $\\phi$) and $\\Lambda$ hyperon production in Ar+Sc collisions. The first results on the direct measurement of open charm production at the SPS energies will also be shown.

          "description": "We investigate the event multiplicity dependence of heavy-flavor jet production in p+p collisions at RHIC, focusing on the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI). Due to differences in mass and color charge, heavy-flavor jets are expected to fragment differently from jets originating from light partons. While jet quenching, a key signature of the quark-gluon plasma in AA collisions, is unlikely in small systems due to limited volume, MPI in high-multiplicity events in p+p collisions could still modify jet characteristics. Thus, studying heavy-flavor jet modification in high-multiplicity p+p collisions is of significant interest. In 2024, the sPHENIX experiment at RHIC achieved high-statistics p+p data collection, equipped with full hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters and precision silicon pixel and strip detectors near the interaction point. This setup enables, for the first time, a detailed investigation of heavy-flavor jet modifications due to MPI in p+p collisions. The latest progress from this study will be presented.",

          "description": "sPHENIX is a second generation RHIC experiment, designed for precise measurements of QGP properties and the nature of the proton spin structure. The Intermediate Si Tracker (INTT) is a two-layer cylindrical tracker using Si strip sensors, with strip size is 78 um x 1.6 cm. The INTT plays a key role for the charged particle tracking and the determination of a collision time. For these purposes, the INTT has capability to process data in each beam crossing.\r\nThe collision time is necessary not only for solving the pile-up of multiple collisions in a time frame, but also for determining the spin direction of the collision in polarized p+p data-taking. The INTT can also determine the collision vertex using reconstructed tracklets.\r\n sPHENIX recorded 200 GeV p+p and Au+Au collision data in 2024. The INTT was operated in extended trigger mode and streaming mode. These modes allowed us to collect more collision data in addition to the triggered events.\r\nIn this poster, we will report the INTT operation in 2024, and discuss the INTT performance including the track reconstruction, the vertex determination, MIP measurements, and the capability of the collision time determination.",

From this inaugural dataset, the anisotropic flow (v_n) of charged hadrons has been measured for the first time in the sPHENIX detector using the event plane method. Anisotropic flow is a hallmark signature of the formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, and the use of charged hadrons  as the species of interest offers an important opportunity to benchmark the performances of both the sPHENIX Intermediate silicon tracker (INTT) and the sPHENIX Event Plane Detector (sEPD). This talk will present the status of measuring charged hadron v_2 in different centrality classes with a comparison to previous experimental results at RHIC.",

          "description": "Accurate measurements of $J/\\psi$ production are crucial to advancing the heavy flavor program in sPHENIX. During Run 2024, sPHENIX has collected 13pb$^{-1}$ of data, utilizing both tracking and calorimetry detectors with 1.5mrad crossing angle and $|z_{vertex}|<10~$cm in 200GeV $p+p$ collisions. Experimentally, it remains a challenge to measure $J/\\psi$ particles due to the low production rate, as well as the high single particle background at low $p_T$, limiting electron identification capabilities. We propose to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)specialized in image recognition, on sPHENIX $p+p$ 200GeV simulation data to enhance electron identification capabilities and expand the electron identification from prompt $J/\\psi$ decays down to 1GeV electrons. This approach could increase the measurable $J/\\psi$ sample by up to a factor 5, compared to traditional techniques effective for electrons with energies above 2GeV. We will present details of the CNN implementation and training, as well as its performance on both simulations and data collected by sPHENIX.",

          "description": "The sPHENIX experiment is a fully hermetic jet detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which includes electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry. Jets formed in the initial parton scattering of p+p and heavy ion collisions are probes for the energy loss mechanisms in the QGP. sPHENIX, with a wide rapidity range of the calorimeter system, |eta| < 1.1, is designed to catch a majority of produced dijet pairs. The p+p data set contains 107 pb^-1 of sampled luminosity utilizing a series of high-pT jet triggers. In this poster, this data set is used to analyze dijet correlations including the azimuthal decorrelation and dijet asymmetry, which are important measurements to quantify the effect of the medium on jet energy loss. The results will be interpreted as a baseline vacuum pQCD measurement for the flagship jet program in Au+Au.",

          "description": "The objective of electron identification (eID) in the sPHENIX experiment is to accurately distinguish electrons from quarkonium (such as J/psi and Upsilon) di-electron decay events while effectively suppressing hadron background, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio crucial for studying Upsilon and J/psi suppression within the Quark-Gluon Plasma. We compare traditional cut-based methods with machine learning-based Multi-Variable Analysis (MVA) techniques, showing significant improvements in eID accuracy and hadron rejection through Monte Carlo simulations. We have demonstrated through sPHENIX simulation data studies that machine learning algorithms, such as Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN), improve hadron rejection, thus enabling more precise electron selection for di-electron reconstruction. Building on these results, the next phase involves applying machine learning-based eID to sPHENIX experimental data, with the goal of selecting suitable electrons for Upsilon and J/psi reconstruction. This approach will enable better isolation of Upsilon and J/psi signals from background events, providing clearer insights into Upsilon and J/psi production and suppression in heavy-ion collisions.",

Measurements of long-range correlations are important to evaluate the interplay between the role of initial and final state effects. The sPHENIX experiment at RHIC began operations in 2023 and took p+p collision data over a period of five months in 2024. In this poster, we will present the status of measurements of long-range two-particle correlations for different charged particle multiplicities in p+p collisions at  √s = 200 GeV. This measurement utilizes tracks reconstructed by Monolithic Active Pixel Vertex Detector (MVTX) and Intermediate silicon tracker (INTT) at central rapidity and the sPHENIX Event Plane Detector (sEPD). The correlation of the sEPDs at backward and forward rapidity allows for unprecedented $\\Delta\\eta$ ranges to be explored (up to Δη ~ 9.8).",

Jets, produced in hard scatterings early in the collisions, provide an ideal probe for the full evolution of the QGP. Jets produced back-to-back with photons are an ideal probe of the QGP as the photons do not interact with the medium and provide an unquenched tag of the jet kinematics. Measurements of photon-jet pairs in proton-proton collisions provide a baseline for quenching measurements in Au+Au, and allow for a data-driven measurement of the jet energy scale. In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data with high-pT jet and photon triggers. This poster will present the status of measuring photon-jet production in this dataset.",

          "description": "The sPHENIX experiment operating at RHIC aims to make high precision measurements of jets and heavy flavor observables for a wide selection of nuclear collision systems. Its tracking system is composed primarily of 4 subsystems that work in tandem to reconstruct the path of ionizing radiation through the detector geometry. Starting with the innermost detector and moving radially outward, the MVTX yields precise vertexing information and the finest position resolution, the INTT provides precise timing resolution on the order of tens of nanoseconds to associate tracks with the bunch crossing which produced them, the TPC works as the primary tracker which gives the majority of track clusters and is the foundation of the momentum resolution obtained, and the TPOT helps correct for static and dynamic space charge distortions in the TPC. It is crucial that we are able to understand the acceptance and efficiency of this tracking system as a whole in order to produce meaningful physics results. We employ a tag-and-probe scheme applied to several decay modes as a means of using data to determine the efficiency of the sPHENIX tracking system. Additionally, we compare the results of this measurement with a large truth-associated simulated sample of the same decay modes in order to validate our observations.",

          "description": "sPHENIX, located at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory, is a multipurpose proton and ion collider detector, and a central piece of its physics program is the measurement of open heavy flavor production in both pp and AuAu collision systems. Production of D mesons, both prompt and as cascade decays from B mesons, provide clean probes of the Quark Gluon Plasma. In sPEHNIX, these charm hadrons will be reconstructed via their decays to charged particles and their associated reconstructed tracks originating from a secondary vertex. The reconstruction of these secondary vertices is required to distinguish open heavy flavor events from background processes, and in sPHENIX this is achieved with the MAPS Vertex Detector (MVTX). The MVTX is a Monolithic Activated Pixel Sensor (MAPS) detector consisting of three layers of 48 staves total, each with 9 sensor chips providing coverage of |η| < 1. To ensure the track reconstruction and vertexing achieves optimum performance, it is necessary to ensure the MAPS chips, staves, layers, and half detector components are aligned to a precision of O(10 μm). The relative alignment of the MVTX is thus performed using a combination of collision data from sPHENIX run 24 with 200 GeV pp collisions for high statistics and cosmic ray events to constrain bulk transformations and weak modes. The alignment is performed iteratively through a combination of 3D Distance of Closest Approach minimization and use of global alignment fit package, Millepede II. The results of the MVTX alignment is shown, including representative event displays, and residual distributions demonstrating the achieved precision of the MVTX alignment.",

          "description": "Heavy-flavor jets produced in high-energy collisions are a unique probe to test the pertubative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and are one of the major science portfolios for the new sPHENIX experiment. Searching for charm and bottom jets is one of most challenging measurements in collider experiments due to their rare production rate and extensive backgrounds. The sPHENIX experiment has collected $13.3~pb^{-1}$ of triggered full-system (i.e, tracking+calorimeter) data with 1.5~mrad crossing angle and $|z_{vertex}|<10~$cm in 200 GeV $p+p$ collisions of Run~2024. We will present the heavy flavor jet studies using both the traditional selection methods and new Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in sPHENIX 200 GeV $p$+$p$ simulation. A Graph Neural Network (GNN) is used to tag the jet flavor, and is expected to significantly enhance the jet identification performance especially for bottom and charm jets. We will also discuss the ongoing studies of sPHENIX Run~2024 data quality assurance (QA) and calibration such as tracking qualities related with the heavy flavor jet measurements.",

          "description": "The directed flow ($v_1$) is a sensitive probe of the initial state conditions in heavy-ion collisions. One key initial condition is the presence of a strong electromagnetic field, which induces charge splitting between particles and antiparticles and has important implications for the QCD phase transition and the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Another crucial aspect of the initial state is the deposition of baryon charge, which can be specifically probed through the directed flow of baryons, offering insights into baryon transport within the QGP [2].\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we shall present measurements of directed flow $(v_1)$ for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, and $p(\\bar{p})$ in Au+Au, isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, and U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV, as recorded by the STAR experiment at RHIC. For the first time, we observe a clear system size dependence in the slope, $dv_1/dy$, for $p (\\bar{p})$ and the difference in slope between particle and antiparticle, $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$, while the sum of the slopes for baryons ($p+\\bar{p}$) shows no such dependence. In contrast, neither the difference nor the sum of the $v_1$ slopes for mesons ($\\pi^\\pm$ and $K^\\pm$) shows system size dependence [3]. This behavior is qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic model, providing insights into baryon deposition and transport. Additionally, the observed $\\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ pattern across different systems may also help constrain the strength of electromagnetic fields and the conductivity of the medium. \r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, Phys.

          "description": "A significant $\\phi$-meson global spin alignment ($\\rho_{00}$) signal was measured in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\le62$ GeV [1]. Conventional physics mechanisms such as $s(\\bar{s})$ spin polarization fail to accommodate this $\\rho_{00}$ signal, motivating further exploration into its origin. Recently, studies from a general framework using the gauge/gravity duality predict that in heavy ion collisions, there could be non-zero helicity-frame spin alignment generated by the relative motion of $s\\bar{s}$ pairs to the thermal background. This helicity frame spin alignment could lead to significant global $\\rho_{00}$ [2]. It has also been shown that both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of a vector meson's spin density matrix are sensitive to local spin correlations between the quark and anti-quark [3]. In this talk, we explore the relationships between $\\phi$-meson global and helicity-frame spin density matrix elements through Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a new method to extract $\\rho_{00}$ simultaneously with the off-diagonal elements from the 2-dimensional angular dimensions, i.e., the polar and azimuthal angles of the direction of a daughter kaon's momentum in the $\\phi$-meson's rest frame with respect to the chosen spin-quantization axis. This 2-dimensional method allows us to consider possible effects from finite geometric acceptance and detector efficiencies, which could couple to the spin density matrix elements and non-trivially influence the extraction of these elements. The effects of finite elliptic flow and various kinematic selections are also examined. The studies discussed in this talk follow our recent work in [4].\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration., Nature 614, 244–248 (2023).\r\n[2] X.L.

Correlations and tension of constraints on $\\hat{q}$ due to the different probes and different kinematic ranges are explored to elucidate the information carried by various observables. This study tests the theoretical description of jet quenching in various ways, and enables quantitative comparison of different model formulations of jet quenching. identifying those aspects of the formulation which are not consistent with data. Observable sensitivity is explored, providing insight into which measurements are most discriminative of model parameters. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of jet interactions in matter and their theoretical description, and point to next steps in the field for comprehensive understanding of jet quenching as a probe of the QGP.\r\n\r\n[1]: R.

          "description": "In small collision systems like O-O, the initial energy density profile and pressure gradients driving anisotropic flow are expected to exhibit greater fluctuations compared to larger systems such as Pb–Pb. This emphasizes the significance of initial nuclear geometry and raises questions about the applicability of hydrodynamic evolution in this regime. Investigating collective signals in these small systems can provide critical insights into the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma.\r\nTo explore this, we compare several models: the hadronic transport model SMASH, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid approach, and Angantyr, which serves as a baseline without collective effects. Our setup allows to compare calculations with and without hydrodynamic evolution on equal footing. We calculate the elliptic and triangular flow coefficients as a function of centrality and multiplicity in O-O collisions at sqrt(s)=7TeV, using both Woods-Saxon and alpha-clustered nuclear configurations. Our results demonstrate that the impact of nuclear configuration on these observables is highly model-dependent.",

          "description": "The first harmonic coefficient of the Fourier expansion of the final-state momentum-space azimuthal distribution of produced particles is called directed flow ($v_{1}$). It describes the collective sideward motion of emitted particles. $v_{1}$ is sensitive to the equation of state of nuclear matter, making it a useful probe for studying the phase transition. Results from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan-I (BES-I) program on directed flow shows that the proton and net-proton slope parameter $\\frac{dv_{1}}{dy}|_{y=0}$ exhibits a minimum between 11.5 and 19.6 GeV. Additionally, the net-proton $\\frac{dv_{1}}{dy}|_{y=0}$ changes sign twice between 7.7 and 39 GeV.\r\n\r\n In this poster, we will present measurements of the directed flow of $\\pi^{+}$,$\\pi^{-}$,$K^{+}$,$K^{-}$ and $K_s^{0}$ in Au+Au collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan-II (BES-II) program. The rapidity and centrality dependence of $v_{1}$, as well as the energy dependence of the $v_{1}$ slope, will be discussed. These results will also be compared with predictions from the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model.",

The key observable in femtoscopy is the two-particle correlation function, which provides crucial insights into the space-time dynamics of the emitting source as well as final-state interaction effects. Among the less explored interactions is the hyperon-hyperon (YY) interaction, which remains poorly understood both theoretically and experimentally. Understanding the YY interaction is vital not only for advancing our knowledge of the equation of state in neutron star interiors but also for the search for exotic hadrons, which could offer deeper insights into the strong force and nuclear matter under extreme conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the first measurements of $\\Lambda$-$\\Lambda$ correlation function in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR Beam Energy Scan II will be presented. Using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz model, the physics parameters including source size, scattering length and effective range will be extracted.

Our focus is concentrated on the attractor behaviour in the momentum moments of the distribution function and in the anisotropic flows $v_n$, with particular attention on the impact of Glasma initial correlations in momentum space on the $v_n(p_T)$ going from $pp$, to $pA$ and $AA$ collisions.  We study how the interplay of the transverse system size $R$ and the mean free path $\\lambda_{\\text{mfp}}$ allows to define an equivalence relationship between different simulations and how their ratio compares to the well-known opacity parameter $\\hat \\gamma$. Finally, we show first results in the non-conformal case (finite mass) and for a temperature-dependent $\\eta/s$, discussing when they imply deviations from universality.\r\n\r\nV. Nugara, S.

          "description": "Recent CMS measurements of high-multiplicity jets have revealed intriguing structures in two-particle correlations within jets containing over 80 charged tracks, potentially indicating the presence of final-state interactions beyond those modeled in existing parton shower frameworks. We investigate two mechanisms of final-state interaction that may become significant when the phase-space density of partons in a jet reaches high levels: (1) two-to-two partonic rescattering and (2) two-to-one merging of parton pairs with small invariant mass. These processes are implemented approximately after the PYTHIA8 shower, with careful modeling of spacetime structure and tracking of color flow in the final-state interactions. Our results show an increase in two-particle correlations at high multiplicity, suggesting a potential link to CMS observations. This study could provide new insights into the behavior of QCD hard processes under high-multiplicity conditions.",

          "description": "Based on a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to thermodynamics of QCD we explain why the abundances of hadrons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model with a sudden chemical freeze-out at a well-defined hadronization temperature despite the fact that state of the art results of lattice QCD indicate a smooth chiral crossover. The hadrons are treated as color singlet multiquark clusters in medium with a background gluon field in the Polyakov gauge coupled to the underlying chiral quark dynamics. The confining aspect of QCD is accounted for by a large vacuum quark mass motivated by a confining density functional approach. At low temperatures the HRG phase appears as a statistical ensemble of the multiquark clusters. Restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperatures triggers their Mott dissociation and deconfinement of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While perfectly reproducing the smooth behavior of entropy density [1] and chiral condensate of lattice QCD [2], the approach indicates an abrupt switching between the hadrons and partons. This is manifested by a rapid change of the ratio of baryon number susceptibilities $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ from the value of HRG to the one of QGP [2]. We report for the first time that $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ shall not be mistaken for a measure of the fraction of hadrons in the system. Its deviation from unity below the chiral restoration temperature can actually quantify a repulsive residual interactions in the HRG. We associate it with the effects of Pauli blocking and model by a temperature dependent correction to the phase shift of baryons, in accordance with lattice QCD results on $\\chi^B_4/\\chi^B_2$ [2]. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

          "description": "The dual-radiator RICH (dRICH) detector of the ePIC experiment at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will make use of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) sensors for the detection of the Cherenkov light emitted by particles crossing its radiators. The photodetector will cover $\\sim$ 3 m$^{2}$ with 3$\\times$3 mm$^{2}$ pixels, for a total of more than 300k readout channels. This will be the first application of SiPMs for single-photon detection in a HEP experiment. SiPMs are chosen for their low cost and immunity to high magnetic fields ($\\sim$ 1 T at the dRICH location). However, they are not radiation hard, demanding careful testing and attention to preserve single-photon counting capabilities and to maintain the dark count rates (DCR) under control over the years of running of the ePIC experiment. DCR control is achieved with operation at low temperature and recovery of the radiation damage via high-temperature annealing cycles. The exploitation of the SiPM precise timing with fast TDC electronics helps to reduce further the effect of DCR as background signal.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present an overview of the ePIC-dRICH detector system, designed to provide continuous hadron identification in a broad momentum range from $\\sim$ 3 GeV/c to $\\sim$ 50 GeV/c in the forward region (1.5 < $\\eta$ < 3.5). The current status of the R&D performed for the operation of the SiPM optical readout subsystem will be reviewed. Focus will be given to recent beam test results of a large-area prototype SiPM readout plane consisting of a total of up to 2048 3$\\times$3 mm$^{2}$ sensors. The photodetector prototype is modular and based on a novel EIC-driven photodetection unit (PDU) developed by INFN, which integrates 256 SiPM pixel sensors, cooling and TDC electronics in a volume of $\\sim$ 5$\\times$5$\\times$14 cm$^{3}$. Several PDU modules have been built and successfully tested with particle beams at CERN-PS in October 2023 and in May 2024. The data have been collected with a complete chain of front-end and readout electronics based on the ALCOR chip, developed by INFN Torino.",

          "description": "In this work, we study the real-time dynamics of scalar field theory towards thermalization at finite temperature. We first evaluate thermal expectations for observables such as energy density and pressure at finite temperature to extract the property of the system at thermal equilibrium. Specifically, we formulate the scalar fields with both free and $\\phi^4$ interaction components and compare the harmonic oscillator and field operator bases on qubits. Using initial conditions at different energies, we study non-equilibrium effects of the thermal system  in 1+1 dimensions towards equilibrium for various observables, and study their dependences on the system size, number of qubits, choices of bases, as well as initial configurations. In particular, we present our numerical computations using quantum simulator and compared them with exact diagonalization and available analytical calculations.",

          "description": "Quarkonia are golden probes for studying the properties of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. Various measurements for different quarkonium species at RHIC and the LHC indicate that their suppression levels follow the ordering of their binding energies. Additionally, recombination effects are substantial in nucleus-nucleus collisions, particularly charmonium states. However, questions still remain about disentangling the various in-medium effects and how they contribute to the final observables.\r\nOn the other hand, quarkonium production in small systems is another complex topic, with recent unexpected experimental results. \r\nSHINCHON (Simulation for Heavy IoN Collision with Heavy-quark and ONia) is a simulation framework that tries to address these challenges with tracking the quarkonium survival probabilities during the space-time evolution of the medium. The interaction mechanisms are based on theoretical calculations of gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering. These effects are embedded within a hydrodynamical event generator (superSONIC) that uses initial geometry information from Glauber MC. The hydrodynamical setup reproduces observed event multiplicity and flow harmonics in data. SHINCHON qualitatively describes the modification of bottomonium states in Pb–Pb and Au-Au collisions found in data, including nuclear absorption effects at RHIC energies [1,2]. \r\nFor small systems, we present the modifications in p-Pb collisions in comparison with data and provide predictions for p-O and O-O collisions [1]. Lastly, we discuss the factors affecting the relative modifications of excited and ground states for both charmonia and bottomonia, motivated by recent experimental results.\r\n\r\n[1] SHINCHON Collaboration, Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 5, 054905, arXiv:2209.12303 [nucl-th]\r\n[2] SHINCHON Collaboration, arXiv:2405.11689 [nucl-th]",

          "description": "The CBM experiment at the future FAIR facility is a multipurpose forward spectrometer designed to operate at high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, implementing a triggerless, free-streaming readout system. CBM aims to study the properties of strongly interacting matter at high baryon net density, where phenomena such as a first-order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter and a chiral phase transition are anticipated.\r\nAs the primary tracking detector of the CBM experiment, the Silicon Tracking System (STS) is engineered to efficiently reconstruct trajectories of charged particles, achieving a momentum resolution better than 2% within a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to be capable of identifying complex decay topologies. The STS consists of 876 modules arranged in eight tracking stations, keeping a low material budget of less than 10% X₀. The core component of STS is the detector module, which integrates double-sided, double-metal silicon microstrip sensors connected via low-mass microcables to custom-developed readout ASICs mounted on two front-end electronics boards.\r\nCurrently, the STS project is focused on the series production of modules and ladders for the final detector. This phase involves precise assembly and rigorous quality control procedures at every fabrication step. Comprehensive functional and thermal stress testing is conducted on fully assembled modules to ensure their reliability before integration onto carbon-fiber ladders. Simultaneously, the operational capabilities of the STS modules are assessed in various application scenarios, including high-intensity nucleus-nucleus collisions at GSI facilities and the E16 experiment at J-PARC, which serve as platforms for performance evaluation.\r\nThis report offers an overview of the CBM STS module and ladder production process, presents results from functional testing, and shares insights gained from operational deployments across different experimental setups.",

          "description": "We extensively investigate the mean transverse momentum fluctuations concerning centrality and energy dependences in Au–Au collisions at 3.0–19.6 GeV using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. Inspired by prior research, we have adjusted the key parameter, the Lund string fragmentation parameter bL, to manifest an approximately linear dependence on the impact parameter. Consequently, the mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩ appropriately demonstrates a dependence on centrality classes. In addition, the dependence of bL on the impact parameter systematically increases with rising beam energy. This adjustment enables the AMPT model to reasonably describe the energy dependence of mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩. The improved AMPT provides a reliable platform to calculate pT fluctuations by qualitatively describing the data production of pion^± in 0–5% centrality around midrapidity (|y|< 0.1) at available incident energies. In line with previous findings, power-law dependences of pT cumulants of all orders on collision centrality N_{part} are observed at higher energies. Furthermore, the scaled cumulants normalized by the mean ⟨pT⟩ are computed, and the corresponding variances align well with the trends observed in experimental measurements. Then, the scaled cumulants also are applied using two subevent methods, where the component of short-range correlation is suppressed compared to the calculations performed using the standard method. Our cumulant method exhibits a robust framework for investigating high-order transverse momentum fluctuations.",

          "description": "Neutron Stars (NSs) make a unique physical laboratory with extreme physical conditions that are irreproducible in experiments and capable of inducing a hadron-to-quark deconfinement phase transition in their interior. Given the high densities reached by the cold nuclear matter in NSs, it is speculated that NS cores may contain deconfined quark matter (QM). State-of-the-art inputs from multi-disciplinary physics (like the chiral effective field theory, astrophysical observations, and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)) can constrain QM in NSs. We show this by imposing new constraints on the widely accepted phenomenological MIT Bag model for QM, allowing for a mixed phase, and further using them to comment on the phase of matter in NS cores. We also find that the pQCD constraint is crucial in constraining the strong interaction coupling at NS energies. If the deconfined QM is more stable than ordinary nuclear matter, such a phase transition is known to form exotic compact objects known as Strange Stars (SSs) made of strange quark matter. We discuss various observational signatures and how the future gravitational wave detectors and the upcoming electromagnetic telescopes can be used to probe quark matter in neutron stars. This is also important from the point of view of fundamental physics as it holds the potential to settle the long-standing problem of the true ground state of matter in the universe.",

          "description": "Quark gluon plasma (QGP), when viewed at length scales of order the inverse of its temperature, behaves as a strongly coupled liquid. However, when it is probed at shorter length scales or with sufficiently high momentum transfer, asymptotic freedom mandates the presence of quark-like and gluon-like quasi-particles. High energy partons within jets can trigger these high-momentum exchanges, making jets valuable probes for revealing the presence of such quasi-particles. In this talk, we describe an implementation of such elastic scatterings within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model. High-energy partons in jets undergo elastic Molière scatterings with quasi-particles in the medium. A jet parton that scatters is deflected, kicking a medium parton, which recoils. Subsequently, as both of these partons propagate further through the medium they each lose energy and momentum to the medium, producing hydrodynamic wakes in the droplet of QGP. That is, elastic scattering results in modifications to both the parton shower and to the wake that the shower excites in the droplet of QGP.\r\n\r\nEnergy-energy-correlators (EECs) characterize the substructure of energy flow within jets. Using two-point and three-point EEC observables we are able to reveal the relevant angular regions at which (modified) parton showers and wakes in the QGP each dominate, offering a new way with which to visualize and constrain the corresponding dynamics. We compare our calculations to recent CMS measurements of two-point EECs of charged-particle tracks in anti-$k_t$ $R = 0.4$ jets. We show that our calculations agree with the CMS measurements only when elastic scattering is included and when the elastically scattered recoil-partons produce their own wakes.",

          "description": "We begin by using Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce experimental results published by ATLAS in 2023 on $R_{AA}$ for $R=1$ jets in Pb+Pb collisions. These jets are identified by first reconstructing anti-$k_t$ $R=0.2$ subjets and then re-clustering them. Following ATLAS, we investigate how $R_{AA}$ for these large-radius jets depends on the angle between the two subjets involved in the final clustering step of the $R=1$ jet. We also study the dependence of $R_{AA}$ for these jets on the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), defined such that the medium can only resolve partons in the jet shower that are separated by more than this length scale. Our investigation suggests that measurements like those pioneered by ATLAS can constrain the resolution length of QGP.\r\n\r\nWe also use this setup to analyze the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two $R=0.2$ subjets, produced in gamma-jet events, and identified as above. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in the droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when two hard subjets are 0.8 to 1.0 radians apart, a single broad wake is produced. When the two subjets are even farther apart, the presence of two sub-wakes is revealed. In our Monte Carlo study, the new observables that we introduce allow us to visualize how jet structure shapes jet wakes unambiguously. We close by showing that similar clarity may be achieved experimentally by measuring the jet shape observables we have introduced using only those hadrons with low transverse momenta.",

          "description": "Energy correlators have come to the forefront for studying high energy particle collisions. Their natural separation of physical effects at different scales have made them very attractive for studying a wide range of phenomena in high energy particle physics. E.g. the most precise measurement of the strong coupling from jet substructure has been obtained using energy correlators. Recently, we introduced a new parameterization that features a simpler phase space and preserves the information on orientation of the particles. Concretely, our new parameterization reduces the computational cost of computing an N-point correlator on a jet with M particles to M^2 log(M), independent of the value of N. This computational speed up would be very beneficial in aiding the ongoing studies of energy correlators in the medium where M is typically very large. Finally, I will also introduce resolved N-point energy correlators that encode angular correlations between greater number of particles and demonstrate the superior visualization our approach offers in this regard.",

          "description": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a novel transport phenomenon that offers the unique opportunity for experimental observation of transitions between different vacuum topological sectors of QCD. A measurement of the CME signal also helps probe the dynamical magnetic field as well as chiral symmetry restoration, which are key ingredients of the phenomenon. Significant efforts have been made to search for the CME in heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. Very recently (2024) the STAR Collaboration reported interesting new measurements from Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) data and extracted CME signals over a broad energy range. The results show a strong signal (~3 sigma) around the intermediate energy range which approaches zero at both low and high energy. Such a highly nontrivial pattern calls for theoretical understanding. This talk presents much-needed calculations aimed at deciphering the interpretations of these new data, based on an improved event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD) framework that is suitable for BES-II energies and well-calibrated with experimental data on bulk properties. At each specific beam energy, we then generate a large sample of EBE-AVFD simulation events and compute the inclusive correlation observables as well as the background-removed signal contributions. We further utilize Bayesian analysis to extract the key parameters, such as magnetic field lifetime and initial axial charge, from the latest experimental measurements. This allows us to map out the beam energy dependence of those key parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for how the dynamical magnetic field lifetime as well as the chiral symmetry restoration evolve with beam energy in heavy ion collisions.",

          "description": "Shear and bulk viscosities are two key transport coefficients that characterize the fundamental properties of quark-gluon plasma. They quantify the response of the energy-momentum tensor to the shear flow and divergent flow, serving as crucial input parameters for the phenomenological and transport models that interpret experimental data, e.g. the elliptic flow $v_2$. \r\n\r\n  However, calculating these inherently non-perturbative viscosities within lattice QCD presents challenges due to strong ultraviolet fluctuations in the relevant operators. The traditional approach using the multi-level algorithm has the limitation that it applies only in the quenched approximation, as done in [1, 2]. Recently, the gradient flow method was introduced to address this issue [3], opening the path to studies in full QCD. However, [3] examined only a single temperature, $1.5T_c$. \r\n\r\n  In this talk, we present results extending [3] to a wide temperature range from $0.76T_c $ to $2.25T_c $,  with particular focus on the phase transition region and high-temperature regime. The former helps us to understand how the system behaves under the critical change, a topic of wide concern in the community. The latter allows us to compare against the NLO perturbative estimate, which becomes more reliable at high temperature.  The methodology developed in this study positions us well for a full QCD calculation in the near future.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] N. Astrakhantsev, V. Braguta, and A. Kotov, J.

          "description": "We present new opportunities to explore the structure of light nuclei leveraging the ability of future facilities to perform collisions with polarized deuterons and other light ions. First, we study diffractive vector meson production at small-x in the collision of electrons and polarized deuterons as anticipated at the Electron Ion Collider. We consider the polarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which results in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when the deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section exhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized deuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius provides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave function at small-x. We further study anisotropic flow with respect to the polarization axis in Pb+d collisions which will be possible at SMOGII at the LHC. This measurement is sensitive to the spatial structure of the deuteron via the conversion of initial geometry to observable momentum distributions by final state effects. Both measurements will provide new independent insight into the spatial structure of polarized deuterons. The same methods can be applied to other light ions, such as $^3$He, $^7$Li, or $^{7,9}$Be.\r\n\r\nRef: H. Mäntysaari, F. Salazar, B. Schenke, C. Shen, W.

          "description": "A major source of uncertainty in the study of heavy-ion collision originates from the early time dynamics which includes initial state and pre-equilibrium dynamics. Among these, pre-equilibrium dynamics link the initial particle production in classical field simulations to subsequent hydrodynamic evolution and a (3+1)D framework is necessary to achieve a complete description of the dynamics. The state-of-art framework, \\kompost, provides a pre-equilibrium dynamics in transverse plane by using non-equilibrium Green's functions, calculated in QCD kinetic theory, to propagate the initial energy-momentum tensor to the hydrodynamic phase. In this work, we extend the \\kompost\\ to include non-boost-invariant response to initial condition which is essential to understand the longitudinal structure of heavy-ion collisions.",

Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on the total resulting anisotropic flow. We validate the ability of our proposed observable to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in RTA kinetic theory. As a proof of concept, we extract the degree of hydrodynamization for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC from experimental data.",

          "description": "Although calculations of QCD thermodynamics from first-principle lattice simulations are limited to zero net-density due to the fermion sign problem, it is possible to extend the equation of state (EoS) to finite values of the $B$, $Q$, $S$ chemical potentials via expansions around zero chemical potentials. Taylor expansion around $μ_i = 0$ with $i = B, Q, S$ enables to cover with confidence the region up to $\\frac{μ_i}{T} < 2.5$, and is usually limited at 450 MeV in any chemical potential. Thanks to a new method based on a T'-expansion scheme, it was however possible to extend the reach of the extrapolation in the $(T, μ_B)$ plane, up to a baryo-chemical potential around $\\frac{μ_B}{T} = 3.5$. We present here a generalization of this scheme in which all three chemical potentials can be varied independently. We base our construction on continuum-estimated susceptibilities, obtained with the 4stout action on lattices with up to Nτ = 16, 20 and 24 time slices, depending on the quantity considered. As a result, we are able to offer a substantially larger coverage of the four dimensional QCD phase diagram compared to extrapolations based on the Taylor expansion.",

          "description": "We use a potential model to investigate the phenomenology of quarkonium in a thermal rotating medium, where vorticity and spin density are not necessarily in equilibrium. We find that the quarkonium spin density matrix, as well as the binding energy and melting temperature, are sensitive to both the vorticity and the lack of equilibrium between vorticity and spin. This means that quarkonium spin alignment is a sensitive probe for vorticity and spin within the hydrodynamic phase.\r\nFurthermore the melting temperature dependence provides a potential new mechanism, ``distillation``, to polarize specifically quarkonium states (including the phi, if it can be considered as such) and potentially explain the dependence of quarkonium suppression in rapidity.\r\nInformation unequivocably pointing to spin-orbit non-equilibrium dynamics can be obtained from a combined study of quarkonium relative abundance and spin alignment, as well as experimentally obtainable off-diagonal density matrix elements. \r\n\r\nBased on\r\n\r\n[1] Kayman J.

          "description": "It has recently been realized that in the ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, mean transverse momentum of hadrons contains the information of the fundamental thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, in nucleus-nucleus collisions the linear correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the charged multiplicity is attributed to the QCD speed of sound,  which promotes theoretical and experimental investigations. However, these studies suffer from the contamination of fluctuations, either physical or non-physical. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we focus on the ultra-central collisions of small colliding system, such as proton-lead, where effects of fluctuations are more pronounced in comparison to the nucleus-nucleus collision systems. Following the standard strategy, via event-by-event hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the QCD speed of sound by analyzing the variation of the mean transverse momentum with particle multiplicity in the mid-rapidity region. Although a linear correlations is realized in our results, between the mean transverse momentum and the effective temperature as well as between the charged particle multiplicity and the total entropy, the extracted speed of sound is significantly suppressed due to the presence of fluctuations. To remove such suppression from fluctuations, we propose a systematic subtraction scheme via the corrections captured by the measured variance of the mean transverse momentum (or the effective temperature), etc. \r\n\r\nGiven the consistent extraction of the speed of sound in small colliding systems, our results support the correlation between mean transverse momentum and charged multiplicity from QCD thermodynamics, which further provides an alternative and direct signature of QGP thermalization.",

          "description": "We derive expressions for the vector and tensor components of the spin polarization of massive vector bosons at local thermodynamic equilibrium, considering second-order spacetime gradients of thermodynamic fields—temperature, chemical potential, and flow velocity—in a relativistic fluid. A set of Feynman rules is developed to compute the Wigner function and matrix-valued spin-dependent distribution (MVSD) functions at each gradient order. Due to time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment—defined as the 00-component of tensor polarization—appears at second order in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We analyze the physical implications of the various contributions to vector and tensor polarization, identifying that spin alignment can arise from the curl of the rotational component of thermal vorticity and the gradient of the acceleration component, contributions previously unexplored. These formulae predict a contribution to the spin alignment which can be compared with observations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions via numerical simulations.",

          "description": "We show analytically that the small system corrections to thermodynamics quantities such as pressure and energy density are large, order 30%, for massless free scalar field theory in systems of size and temperature relevant for high-energy nuclear collisions.  These analytic expectations are confirmed by quenched lattice QCD calculations of pressure and energy density in an anisotropic system and in the equation of state in a small system.  We then lay the theoretical foundations for the analytic evaluation of the small system corrections to the NLO $\\phi^4$ theory equation of state: we introduce a new regularization scheme appropriate for systems without the symmetries necessary for dimensional regularization, and then apply this regularization scheme to determine the finite system size corrections to the running of the coupling.  An estimate of the effect of small system corrections on the equation state are again large, order 50%. These small system corrections to thermodynamic quantities therefore must be taken into account when comparing hydrodynamics calculations to collective observables in small systems such as central pA and high-multiplicity pp collisions.",

          "description": "The properties of light vector mesons in hot and dense matter have long been studied as a probe for the chiral symmetry restoration. Various theoretical predictions and experimental results indicate spectral changes of vector mesons in medium. Precise measurements of the mass spectrum of vector mesons at finite density are very informative. The J-PARC E16 experiment aims to measure the mass spectra of $\\rho$, $\\omega$, and $\\phi$ mesons at normal nuclear density. Vector mesons are produced in 30 GeV proton-nucleus reactions and their invariant mass spectra are reconstructed via electron-positron decays with a mass resolution of 5.8 MeV/c$^{2}$. Several types of experimental targets, carbon, copper, and lead, are used to measure the nuclear mass-number dependence. To obtain extremely high statistics, we use a high intensity beam of 1 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ proton/spill (2-sec spill length and 4.24-sec cycle) supplied at the J-PARC high momentum beamline. \r\nWe started the first commissioning run of the newly constructed beamline and spectrometer in 2020. As reported in QM2023, the detectors were successfully operated in the high-rate environment with sufficient performance. However, the time microstructure of the beam was observed deteriorating DAQ efficiency and increasing fake triggers. To address this issue, we developed the DAQ with reduced busy time and re-optimized the trigger condition with the new beam optics in the beamtime performed from April to June 2024. Concurrently, we collected the preliminary data of vector mesons with the improved beam/trigger/DAQ conditions, ahead of the first physics run planned in 2025. The successful operation of the overall system was confirmed, observing the mass spectrum of $\\omega$ mesons for the first time with the J-PARC E16 experiment. In this presentation, the commissioning results will be summarized and detailed spectra of the $\\omega$ mesons on copper/carbon targets will be discussed. The expected results of the coming physics run will also be presented.",

          "description": "Significant efforts have been made within the heavy-ion collision community to locate the QCD critical endpoint (CEP).  Recent lattice QCD studies using imaginary chemical potentials, based on simulations at temperatures above 120 MeV and utilizing Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, suggest that the critical temperature at the CEP, $ T_c^{CEP}$, should be around 110 MeV [\\[1\\]][1]. Predictions from effective theories, such as AdS/CFT [\\[2\\]][2], the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) [\\[3\\]][3], and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE) [\\[4\\]][4], align with this lattice result.\r\n\r\nIn our study, we conduct direct lattice QCD simulations with imaginary chemical potential at a low temperature of 107 MeV, using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) at the physical pion mass on $N_t=10$ lattices. We obtain up to 4th order baryon number fluctuations for each of the 24 values of imaginary baryon chemical potentials ranging from zero to $i\\pi$. This enables us to apply multi-point Padé approximants and compute Fourier coefficients of the baryon number density in the complex chemical potential plane. Through these analyses, we examine indications of CEP through the prospective Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane at this low temperature.\r\n \r\n[1] David A.

          "description": "Recent heavy-ion collision experiments at intermediate energies are intensively focused on probing the QCD phase diagram to reveal critical behavior associated with the possible critical point. In these collisions, the produced fireball exhibits significant inhomogeneity along the rapidity direction, covering a broad region of the QCD phase diagram. This spatial variation offers a unique opportunity to study critical phenomena in greater detail. **To capitalize on this opportunity, we focus on studying higher-order cumulants of conserved charges beyond mid-rapidity region—the rapidity scan method that complements the traditional beam energy scan approach.**\r\n\r\nHowever, to accurately identify critical signals, it is essential to establish a complete baseline that accounts for non-critical background effects. **In this talk, we present our work on establishing such a baseline for rapidity scans.** Our studies reveal that conservation effects of baryon number can cause cumulant measurements to mimic critical behavior, potentially leading to false positives [1]. To overcome this challenge, **we introduce a novel observable—the cross-cumulant—for rapidity scans, designed to be sensitive to critical fluctuations while being less affected by conservation effects.** Using hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate how cross-cumulants can effectively distinguish genuine critical signals from background effects. Our results indicate that cross-cumulants provide a powerful tool for future experiments aiming to explore the QCD critical point through rapidity scans. We discuss the implications of our findings for ongoing and upcoming heavy-ion collision programs, and outline how this method can enhance the search for critical phenomena in the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

          "description": "A key physical target of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to understand the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and search for the critical endpoint (CEP). The primary experimental approach to locating the CEP is measuring the baryon number fluctuations. In the energy region currently being studied, the baryon number is primarily carried by protons and neutrons. Due to experimental limitations, we cannot measure the uncharged neutrons directly. Thus, in experiments, baryon number fluctuations are approximated by measuring proton number fluctuations. We have discovered a method to extract the missing neutron information from the bound states of protons and neutrons, i.e., from light nuclei. This allows us to accurately reconstruct baryon number fluctuations by measuring light nuclei and protons. We analytically calculated the relationship between light nuclei number fluctuations and baryon number fluctuations. Furthermore, we validated it using transport models. This result is vital in the search for CEP. Additionally, it inspires us how to reconstruct the losing neutron information through light nuclei.",

          "description": "The development of collective dynamics in collisions involving small atomic nuclei at RHIC and the LHC is still a hot research topic. In the first part of the talk [1] we explore the applicability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems, using viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH). VAH is a form of relativistic fluid dynamics specifically designed to handle the large pressure anisotropies that occur during the early evolution stage at high collision energies. We explore its applicability across the entire spectrum of available collision systems, including p+p, p+Pb, p+Au, d+Au, $^3$He+Au, O+O, Xe+Xe, Au+Au, and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and/or the LHC. We show that for systems smaller than O+O the pressure anisotropy never becomes small enough to be reliably described by standard viscous fluid dynamics. In the second part of the talk [2] we use VAH to study a number of flow observables in p+p and p+Pb collisions at the LHC, with a particular focus on solving the sign problem of $c_2\\{4\\}$ that has plagued traditional viscous hydrodynamic simulations. \r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] S.

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) is a main scientific pillar of FAIR, the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, currently being constructed in Darmstadt, Germany. CBM will study the phase diagram of baryonic matter in regions of moderate temperature and large baryonic chemical potential, reaching net baryon densities several times larger than ordinary nuclear matter. Some primary objectives of the experiment are the experimental validation of a 1$^{st}$ order phase transition and the search for signs of possible chiral symmetry restoration.\r\nDileptons are one key observable for the CBM physics program, giving access to the early, high density phase of the evolution of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions with centre of mass energies $\\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ ranging from 2.9 GeV to 4.9 GeV.\r\nA large focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is part of the CBM day-1 detector setup for efficient identification of electrons and suppression of pion background up to 6-8 GeV/c momentum range. The RICH will be using a CO2 gas radiator (pion threshold 4.65 GeV/c) and a 13 m$^2$ segmented spherical mirror. Hamamatsu H12700 multianode photomultipliers will be used for Cherenkov photon detection in combination with the newly developed FPGA-TDC based DIRICH readout chain, which aims for exceptional timing precision limited only by a transient time spread of 350 ps of the MAPMTs.\r\nThe mechanical design of the detector is currently being finalized and construction of several key detector components has already started. The two photon cameras have been assembled and are currently being tested in conjunction with the closed-loop air cooling system. A large prototype of the mirror system has been built, and major parts of the readout electronic components were produced already. The fully free streaming readout has been successfully demonstrated in the miniCBM campaigns at GSI. All 1100 MAPMTs were individually characterized, providing the largest database of series measurements for this type of MAPMT.\r\nIn the presentation we give an overview along with the status of the CBM RICH detector project.\r\n$^∗$ Work supported by BMBF (05P21PXFC1, 05P24PX1, 05P21RGFC1, 05P24RG6).",

          "description": "We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\\perp$, $b_\\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small- $x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.",

          "description": "The fourth-order cumulant of quadrangular flow ($\\bf{v}_4$), $C_4\\{4\\}$, exhibits a distinct trend in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energy [1]: negative for 0-20% centrality, changes sign and becomes positive around 20-30% centrality, and remains positive throughout the remaining centrality range. This measurement, made over half a decade ago, remains unexplained. We attribute the observed sign change to a complex interplay between the linear and non-linear components of $\\bf{v}_4$. We discover that the linear component has a significant reaction plane component, a novel insight that successfully reproduces the striking trend of $C_4\\{4\\}$ using a Gaussian model of eccentricity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the potential for similar sign-changing behavior across different collision systems.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Aaboud et al.

          "description": "We study the dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma. Concretely, we calculate the complete momentum broadening probability distribution due to interactions with the plasma. This calculation includes and goes beyond the classic results for the drag coefficient $\\eta_D$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\\kappa_T$, $\\kappa_L$, and also allows one to read off the value of $\\hat{q}$ for light-like particles. We use this probability distribution to derive the Kolmogorov equation (a generalized Fokker-Planck equation) that determines how the momentum distribution of heavy quarks evolves as they propagate through a thermal plasma. Our results display previously unquantified features about the dynamics of heavy quarks, such as the correlation between momentum broadening and energy loss, along with all of the higher order moments of the momentum broadening distribution. Most strikingly, we show that even though $\\kappa_L$ and $\\eta_D$ do not satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation, the stationary solution to the aforementioned Kolmogorov equation is, in fact, a Boltzmann distribution. All of the higher order moments of the broadening distribution contribute in an essential fashion to achieving kinetic equilibrium.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the many similarities between QCD at temperatures around $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$ and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, not least in the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$ as evidenced by recent lattice QCD calculations, we expect that this calculation in strongly coupled SYM plasma will serve as a useful reference point from which to gain intuition into the strongly coupled dynamics of QCD.",

          "description": "There have been recent proposals that the speed of sound of the quark-gluon plasma can be measured from multiplicity and mean transverse momentum ($p_T$) measurements in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions, based on thermodynamics arguments and numerical simulations [1]. The CMS Collaboration has used this approach to extract values of the speed of sound remarkably consistent with lattice QCD calculations [2]. We use a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions based inviscid relativistic hydrodynamics to study the relation between the speed of sound and the hadronic multiplicity and average energy.  We derive an analytical expression for the speed of sound in terms of the total particle multiplicity and average energy, which we relate to the original proposal. We discuss the role of rapidity and $p_T$ cuts in breaking the relation between the true speed of sound and the one obtained from multiplicity and $p_T$ measurements, finding corrections that depends on the system's lifetime and initial conditions [3].\r\n\r\n[1] F.

          "description": "We explore the thermodynamic geometry in the context of the chiral phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics. In particular the thermodynamic curvature, $R$, provides insights into the system's fluctuations and critical behavior and thus can be considered as an alternative way to approach the study of critical phenomena. Building upon previous studies, we incorporate bosonic fluctuations through the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique, a non-perturbative approach suitable for investigating critical phenomena, reformulating the flow equation into an advection-diffusion type equation within the local potential approximation for the effective average action.\r\nWe study how the sign of $R$ changes near the chiral crossover and the critical point, providing insights into the underlying dynamics of the phase transition. The results indicate that $R$ exhibits a peak close to the chiral crossover and that the inclusion of fluctuations generally lowers the  magnitude peak these peaks. At low chemical potential, $R$ remains negative, showing that the inclusion of bosonic fluctuations prevents the system from overcoming the  fermionic repulsion among quarks. We further explore the low-Chemical potential regime by artificially lowering the pion mass, approaching the chiral limit where the crossover transitions to a second-order phase change.\r\nAs the baryion Chemical potential increases towards the critical point, R develops shaprer peaks and undergoes a sign change, consistent with findings from mean-field theory. Thus, our analysis supports the idea that the thermodynamic curvature R is sensitive to the chiral crossovers and chiral phase transition, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior near criticality.",

          "description": "Measurements of heavy baryon production in pp, pA and AA collisions from RHIC to top LHC energies have recently attracted more and more attention, currently representing a challenge for the heavy-quark hadronization theoretical understanding. \r\nAn hybrid coalescence plus fragmentation approach has been able to correctly predict the large baryon over meson ratio $\\Lambda_c/D^0\\sim O(1)$ \r\nobserved in both AA collisions at RHIC and LHC [2] as well as in pp collisions at $5.02$ and $13 \\rm \\;TeV$. The ratio obtained is, in general, quite larger than the one measured and expected in $e^+e^-$, $ep$ collisions.\r\nFurthermore, with the same approach, also a quite large $\\Xi_c/D^0\\sim 0.15$ and $\\Omega_c/D^0\\sim 0.05$ has been predicted in $pp$ collisions at $5.02 \\rm \\;TeV$, and appears to be in quite good agreement with the early ALICE measurements [3]. \r\nGiven such successful predictions, we present here a critical assessment of the elements of the hadronization modeling that are mainly driving heavy baryon enhancement, moreover we discuss the extensions of the approach applied in order to supply the prediction for the multi-charmed baryon production, i.e. $\\Xi_{cc}$, $\\Omega_{cc}$ and $\\Omega_{ccc}$, over a wide system size scan from $PbPb$ to $KrKr$, $ArAr$ and $OO$ [4], and the bottomed hadron production in $pp$ and $PbPb$ collisions [5][6]. Furthermore we present a new extension of the same approach for charm and bottom quarkonia in $pp$ collisions, i.e. $J/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$, $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(2S)$[7]. \r\nWe can compare the coalescence prediction with the SHM one and on the other hand we can  investigate the impact on the production coming from non-equilibrium features in the heavy quark distribution.\r\nIn fact, the model can acquire the heavy quark distribution from a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach or from a Langevin one with a space transport coefficient $D_s$ in agreement with lattice QCD data.\r\n\r\n[1] V.

          "description": "In this presentation, we investigate femtoscopy correlation functions to access the interactions of protons across various hadrons with different baryon numbers. Beginning with the proton-pion system, we apply the results of the unitarized chiral effective theory into the TROY (T-matrix-based Routine for HAdrOn FemtoscopY) framework to predict measurable correlation functions in high-multiplicity p+p collisions. Next, we explore the proton-omega baryon correlation (B=2) employing an effective theory that incorporates both the baryon octet and decuplet in combination with the Schrödinger equation. In this case we incorporate the $^3S_1$ channel, not included in the recent ALICE analysis, and leading to a potential impact of additional inelastic channels. Finally, we address the proton-deuteron (B=3) correlation function using an effective potential in higher partial waves to model correlation functions for both p+p (ALICE) and Au+Au (STAR) collisions. We obtain a reasonable description of the experimental data with a two-body dynamics challenging previous claims in the literature about the nature of the proton-deuteron interaction at low energies.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n 1.

          "description": "The early far-from equilibrium dynamics of the pre-hydrodynamic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions can be characterized by distinct stages, during each of which the system loses some memory of its initial condition, until only the hydrodynamic modes remain. In QCD kinetic theory, this attractor behavior has been described in terms of self-similar scaling solutions for the particle distribution function during each stage, even at times well before hydrodynamization. Studying a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit in terms of an effective Hamiltonian evolution, we have shown that, after an appropriate coordinate rescaling, the pre-hydrodynamic plasma can be described by the adiabatic evolution of a time-dependent ground state, which is the attractor. This adiabatic formulation yields a unified description of both early- and late-time attractors, including the evolution from one attractor to another. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive physical explanation for the emergence of the attractor behavior itself. The first explicit construction realizing all of these goals employed a kinetic theory including only elastic scatterings, leading to unrealistically long hydrodynamization times. In this talk I will present the unified adiabatic description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors, introduce inelastic scatterings, show that their inclusion dramatically reduces the hydrodynamization time, and discuss their further consequences.",

We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.\r\n\r\nRef.

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, jets deposit energy into the quark-gluon plasma, shaping its dynamics and driving it out of equilibrium. This interplay, known as the medium response, is a tool for understanding QCD thermalization. Current studies on medium response mainly examine energy distribution around jets and modifications to jet substructure.\r\nIn this work, we introduce a novel approach by focusing on the medium response of jets with a distinct 2-prong structure. In contrast to initial state anisotropy, 2-prong jets generate both spacial and momentum space anisotropy in the plasma. We show that in weak coupling models, the original 2-prong jet structure remains largely intact resulting in large elliptic flow within jets. In contrast, in strong-coupling scenarios, the spacial anisotropy induced azimuthal inversion reduces the flow. Jet substructure-induced flow therefore serves as a tool to constrain the nature of medium response, giving a complementary way to constrain QGP transport properties creating synergy between the jet and collective dynamics community.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide exciting new ways to probe nuclear structures.  In this talk, we present model-to-data comparisons for the collisions of very-deformed nuclei (U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV) and slightly-deformed nuclei (Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV) at RHIC. For theoretical calculations, we use a multistage model consisting of boost-invariant IP-Glasma initial state, MUSIC hydrodynamics, and a hadronic transport cascade generated by iS3D & SMASH. Two different Woods-Saxon parametrizations per U and Au are used, allowing for comparisons within our model. In doing so, we achieve a consistent description of existing bulk and flow measurements favouring more modern parameter sets. We also present our prediction for the $v_2-\\langle p_T \\rangle$ correlation [arXiv:2308.09816], which were later found to match very well the experimental result by STAR [arXiv:2401.06625], thus demonstrating that momentum-flow correlations are sensitive probes of nuclear deformation. We will also report on the fitted values of the xenon deformation parameters through our (3+1)D calculations of Xe+Xe collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN} = 5.44$ TeV.",

          "description": "The states of matter produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions can be highly anisotropic. If such a feature is sufficiently pronounced, one should expect the final particle distribution inside jets to reflect it in the form of non-trivial angle correlations. In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\\bar q$ state branching from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. \r\nWe find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution, from azimuthally dependent energy-energy correlators and from final state transverse spin polarization measures. We further discuss how to incorporate these effects into the description of other hard probes of the medium.",

          "description": "We explore the emergence of collective behavior in a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma using relativistic kinetic theory. To model the plasma formed in central high-energy nuclear collisions, we consider a system that expands boost-invariantly along the longitudinal (beam) direction and develops azimuthally symmetric transverse flow. Using the Boltzmann equation and a special set of moments of the kinetic distribution function, we analyze the interplay between longitudinal and transverse dynamics of the matter, describing the transition from early-time far-off-equilibrium regime to near equilibrium hydrodynamic regime. We show that, while the rapid longitudinal expansion of the system strongly hinders the approach to hydrodynamic regime, only a few scatterings among particles can reproduce hydrodynamic-like behavior in the transverse plane. We discuss the implications of this behavior for understanding collective phenomena in heavy-ion collisions and also in small systems.",

          "description": "We discuss the thermodynamics of dense nuclear matter in the so-called parity-doublet model, in an extended mean-field approximation. Special emphasis is given to the phase structure at zero temperature and large baryon densities. The model includes the nucleon and its chiral partner. It also accommodates a nucleon mass that is compatible with the chiral symmetry of QCD, in contrast to many other relativistic model calculations. This residual nucleon mass delays the chiral symmetry restoration to densities typically greater than ten times the saturation density. We consider isospin-symmetric and isospin-asymmetric matter, continuously increasing the neutron excess all the way to pure neutron matter. We eventually compute the equation of state of neutron matter and the speed of sound, and confront the results in a semi-quantitative analysis to neutron-star observations and microscopic many-body calculations. Based on arXiv:2408.01302 and more recent developments.",

          "description": "To understand the surprising accuracy of hydrodynamic predictions for the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions, many have turned to studying attractor solutions in the underlying kinetic theory. Aside from experimentally motivated assumptions such as Bjorken flow, ignoring the presence of spatial gradients has often been helpful to facilitate theoretical calculations. We challenge this simplification by introducing spatial transverse gradients in the system, thereby extending the approach of [1], and show how these facilitate the thermalisation of the system by coupling different spherical harmonic modes in momentum space on a new timescale inversely related to the strength of the gradients. We further demonstrate the influence of the gradients on the attractor solutions and relate the dynamics of the system to the eigenspectrum of an effective non-hermitian Hamiltonian.\r\n \r\nReferences: [1] Brewer, Jasmine, Weiyao Ke, Li Yan, and Yi Yin. \"Far-from-equilibrium slow modes and momentum anisotropy in an expanding plasma.\" Physical Review D 109, no. 9 (2024): L091504.",

          "description": "Collision of heavy nuclei at ultra-relativistic energies offer a unique opportunity to study the formation dynamics of light nuclei. Being loosely bound systems via residual strong interactions, their existence in the hot and dense medium, is very unlikely and possess interesting questions on their production mechanism in these energetic collisions. In the present contribution we will describe a ``thermo-coalescence'' model, a hybrid mechanism to describe the light nuclei production at ultra-relativistic energies. In this approach the transverse momentum distribution of protons are first fitted following a hydro-inspired boost-invariant blast-wave model. The extracted parameters are then used to describe the spectra of light nuclei using a coalescence prescription. Analysis of the measured yield and spectra of the deuterons  and tritons produced in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions at LHC for various centralities will be discussed in detail",

          "description": "We investigate the interplay between saturation dynamics and fluctuating hotspots on midrapidity flow observables in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies using the new Monte Carlo EKRT (MC-EKRT) initial-state event generator [1,2]. We demonstrate that this type of analysis can be efficiently and accurately performed using pre-trained neural networks [3] to predict flow observables directly from the initial energy-density profiles, despite the networks having no prior information about the MC-EKRT initial state, or hotspots, during the training phase. We show that saturation intensity significantly affects the ratio between the flow coefficients $v_3$ and $v_2$. Incorporating fluctuating hotspots into the nucleon structure enhances saturation effects, and improves the agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the collision-energy dependence of the flow coefficients obtained using the MC-EKRT initial states with hotspots is improved in comparison with the earlier event-by-event EKRT model. Additionally, we show that the minijet-multiplicity originating fluctuations of the saturation scale present in MC-EKRT, along with the inclusion of hotspots, are essential for accurately describing the large-multiplicity tail of the measured charged-hadron distributions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[1] H.

We study the realtime properties of pions at finite temperature and density in QCD in order to elucidate the nature of this regime. We show that the moat regime arises from particle-hole-like excitations near the Fermi surface. This gives rise to a characteristic enhancement of the pion's spectral function at nonzero spacelike momentum.",

          "description": "Self similar evolution in time, also known as a nonthermal fixed point, is one of the stages of thermalization in QCD under the assumption of very weak coupling. This arises in models of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions and cold atomic gases, for the latter this has been experimentally realized. Nonthermal fixed points are characterized by a universal scaling function and power law exponents. Using QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle approximation, we study how these systems approach the universal regime. Simulations of isotropic, homogeneous gluon gases show that perturbations on top of the scaling function decay following power laws while oscillating, i.e. damped oscillations characterized by complex frequencies. Similar to how quasinormal modes in black hole spacetimes dictate thermalization in strongly coupled quantum field theories via AdS/CFT, we refer to these frequencies as the quasinormal modes of a nonthermal fixed point. We calculate the spectrum of quasinormal modes and find qualitative agreements with the results of time evolution in kinetic theory. This research indicates the first evidence of new physical phenomena around nonthermal fixed points. We expect these to appear in weak coupling models of nuclear collisions at very early times and to be observable in existing cold atom experiments.",

          "description": "Heavy quarks are formed in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions and hence carry comprehensive information about the entire evolution of the initial non-equilibrium glasma phase to a quark-gluon plasma phase, its subsequent hydrodynamic evolution and hadronization at later stages. One of the quantities of interest to model this evolution and to compare with experimental observations is the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\\kappa$, which determines how strongly these interact with the medium. We estimate $\\kappa$ relevant for the pre-thermalization stage in a highly occupied state of SU(2) gauge fields inspired from the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. For this we implement for the the first time, relativistic evolution of heavy quarks in the mass range of charm and bottom quarks in a background of over-populated SU(2) gauge fields which are evolved using classical-statistical real-time lattice techniques. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, in out-of-equilibrium conditions, we find that the momentum distribution of heavy quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features at initial times eventually going over to a diffusive regime, where we extract the momentum diffusion coefficient [1]. We find a sizeable discrepancy between the results, calculated earlier in the static limit. We further discuss our results to provide an estimate of kinetic equilibration times for charm and bottom quarks relevant for heavy-ion experiments.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Harshit Pandey, Soeren Schlichting, and Sayantan Sharma.

          "description": "<br>\r\n\r\nWe discuss a new numerical method for the determination the QCD critical point from first principle lattice QCD calculations. The analysis exploits the universal scaling of the Lee-Yang edge that has been obtained from lattice QCD calculations of cumulants of the baryon number density at imaginary chemical potentials. Using a multi-point Pade approximation [1] we identify the closest pole of the approximation in the complex chemical potential plane, which is identified with the Lee-Yang edge. Compared to our previous analysis [2], we have doubled the number of simulation points in the imaginary chemical potential direction for our Nt=6 calculations and added one new Nt=8 calculation at T=120 MeV. In this talk we discuss the systematic and statistical error budget of the analysis. We also comment on a new strategy to perform the analytic continuation of the baryon number density and higher cumulants to the real domain by using a numerical version of the Cauchy integration formula.\r\n\r\n**Referenzes:**\r\n\r\n 1.

          "description": "We utilize 3+1-d stochastic hydrodynamics to study correlations and fluctuations of baryon charge in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The baryon charge fluctuations are important observables to probe the QCD phase diagram, while a dynamical description through stochastic hydrodynamics remains challenging due to numerical instabilities and high computation demands. In this work, we employ a linearized approach, allowing us to separately simulate the background energy-momentum evolution of a charge-neutral fluid and the stochastic baryon fluctuation/diffusion processes, which largely reduces computation cost while maintaining sufficient precision.\r\nWe implement this linearized stochastic charge evolution in the viscous hydrodynamic code MUSIC, and find that it nicely describes the two-point correlation of 1+1-d analytical solutions for various EoS and transport coefficients. In particular, the hydrodynamic calculations demonstrate how different rapidity separations\r\nprobe charge fluctuations originating at different times of the evolution, which is valuable for extracting critical signals with sizeable initial state fluctuations. We also investigate the net baryon correlations after the Cooper-Frye freeze-out, which show good consistency with the analytical calculations and indicate that this fluctuation-induced correlations are sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient.",

          "description": "Many phenomena are expected, such as the transition to the deconfined phase and color superconductivity(CSC), in ultra-high density matter. Heavy ion collision with $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ <$\\sim$5 GeV is expected to be most advantageous to generate and study such ultra-high densities($\\rho>3\\rho_{0}$).\r\nJ-PARC Heavy Ion Project(J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project aimed at studying the ultra-high density matter by using a heavy ion beam with the most suitable energy(1-12 AGeV). While the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, the J-PARC HI will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible with only adding the injector. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme at the latter stage of the injector are being studied in detail by the J-PARC facility.\r\nWe have the staging plan of the project divided into two stages. The main difference between each stage is whether the booster ring is a reuse of the KEK-Proton Synchrotron or newly constructed. Even in the early stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of 10$^{8}$Hz. In the final stage, the world’s highest intensity heavy ion beam of 10$^{11}$Hz is expected. \r\nThe primary goal of the first stage is considered to observe non-confined phases in high-density regions by temperature measurement via di-electron radiation. To achieve this, we have already proposed an upgrade plan for the J-PARC E16 experiment. As an additional step, we believe it is important to discover an anomalous increase in low-mass electron pairs, which is expected to be a sign of the onset of CSC. To observe this effect, we are considering a detector system with emphasis on wide acceptance and measurement of soft processes. By emphasizing measurement of soft processes with wide acceptance, it becomes possible to access important themes such as fluctuations and multi-particle correlations for not only di-electron, and it will also be complementary to CBM. This talk will present simulation results on key physics opportunities in the detectors considered.",

          "description": "Unravelling the hadronization mechanism in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) remains challenging due to its non-perturbative nature, often modelled in Monte Carlo event generators (such as PYTHIA and HERWIG) with parameters tuned to experimental data.  While jets were originally proposed to circumvent non-perturbative effects and probe QCD at perturbative scales, we show that their substructure can be a powerful tool to investigate hadronization. In this study, we employ the charge correlation ratio, which evaluates the probability of jet production with same-sign or opposite-sign leading charged particles charges, already shown to be sensitive to hadronization effects. We find that this sensitivity can be enhanced by selections on jet substructure, particularly by analysing the relative placement of splittings that resolve the leading charged particles within the clustering tree. Our findings reveal remarkable differences between widely used hadronization models (Lund string and cluster fragmentation), contributing to a better understanding of the hadronization process and opening new avenues for exploring non-perturbative QCD.",

Zhou\r\n\r\nThe equation-of-state (EoS) at high baryon density is crucial for understanding the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The directed flow of protons and $\\Lambda$ baryons has long been proposed as a sensitive observable for probing the high-density EoS. Recent data from the STAR experiment in Au+Au collisions at 3 GeV, particularly on the transverse momentum, rapidity distributions, and collective flow of light nuclei and hypernuclei, provide a valuable opportunity to further explore properties of high baryon density matter.\r\n\r\nWe employ the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) model to investigate the sensitivity of various observables to different equation-of-state scenarios. We consider two static EoS models, labeled \"soft\" and \"hard\", which differ in compressibility modulus, as well as a momentum-dependent soft EoS model. In PHQMD, (hyper)nuclei are formed dynamically throughout the entire heavy-ion collision by the potential interaction between nucleons, which is sensitive to the EoS. In this talk, by comparing PHQMD simulations with STAR experimental data on particle spectra and flow at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 3 GeV, we find that the production of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as well as their collective flow, are sensitive to the choice of the EoS. By analyzing these observables, we can gain valuable information about the underlying nuclear interactions and the properties of dense matter. Our results demonstrate the potential of hypernuclei as powerful probes of the high-density EoS and provide important insights for future experiments like CBM at FAIR.",

          "description": "Progress in the theoretical understanding of parton branching dynamics within an expanding QGP relies on detailed and fair comparisons with experimental data for reconstructed jets. Such validation is only meaningful when the computed object, whether derived analytically or through event generation, accounts for the complexity of experimentally reconstructed jets. The reconstruction of jets in heavy ion collisions requires an inherently imperfect subtraction, of the large and fluctuating Underlying Event (UE), meaning reconstructed jets inevitably retain some level of UE contamination. To accurately identify jet quenching effects, that is, modifications of the branching dynamics by interaction with QGP leading to changes on jet observables, comparisons should be made against a baseline that incorporates UE contamination in unmodified, vacuum-like jets. In practical terms, jet quenching effects are defined as effects absent in vacuum jet samples embedded within a realistic heavy-ion background, where subtraction is carried out analogously to that in the heavy-ion case and aligned as closely as possible to what is done experimentally. Using the extensively validated JEWEL event generator, we present selected results from a broad survey examining the sensitivity of commonly used jet observables to UE effects in jet quenching studies. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of Machine Learning studies aimed at classifying significantly modified jets against a vacuum-like jet reference, where UE contamination is accounted for. Additionally we present Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) distributions in Pb-Pb jets, first in the signal-only case, and then with medium response and UE contamination effects both separately and combined. Finally, we analyze the EEC observable based on a supervised analysis cut, evaluating whether the model effectively targets jets most distinct from vacuum-like jets, and thus most likely to be quenched.",

          "description": "The spectral functions of chiral partners should become degenerate when the QCD chiral symmetry is restored. The axial-vector spectra are experimentally more challenging to construct than those of vector mesons that directly couple to virtual photons and then to dileptons. Chiral mixing of the vector with axial-vector mesons is thus a key phenomenon to probe in-medium modifications of vector spectrum due to the onset of chiral symmetry restoration carried by the axial-vector counterpart. The mixing effect is expected to be stronger at higher density due to a mechanism driven by chiral anomalies [1, 2], in striking contrast to the vanishing mixing at chiral crossover driven by thermal pions [3]. This feature encourages us to perform the experimental search in the high-density regime, where the recent experimental trend has begun to shift toward.  \r\n\r\nWe propose that experiments at medium energies with paying attention to the new mixing mechanism, may provide a direct evidence of the chiral symmetry restoration. In this presentation, we focus on the density-induced mixing and the spectral functions of $\\phi$ and its chiral partner $f_1(1420)$. We present the invariant mass distribution of dileptons using a transport approach developed in [4, 5] under the conditions of the J-PARC E16 experiment as a prime example.\r\n\r\nWe find that the $f_1(1420)$ meson is visible with about 2 $\\sigma$ credibility in dilepton production in a range of mixing strength in our study when the expected statistics at E16 Run-2 are utilized [6]. We advocate that the E16 experiment at J-PARC has discovery potential for the mass degeneracy of chiral partners at finite density as a signature of chiral symmetry restoration.\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\n[1] C.

          "description": "Ultrarelativistic isobar collisions have been proposed as a useful tool for investigating nuclear structures. The complete description of these high-energy collisions involves a hydrodynamic expansion preceded by a pre-thermal equilibrium phase. Because hydrodynamic simulations are time-consuming, isobar nuclear structure has been discussed a lot in terms of geometrical estimators such as excentricities, where the pre-thermal phase was ignored. In this presentation, we study the impact of a free-streaming phase on observables and point out some for which it is relevant. The discussion in terms of geometrical estimators follows arXiv:2305.03703v3. In addition, the first results from full hydrodynamic simulations are presented to assess the geometric estimators that were used",

          "description": "An excess of charged versus neutral kaons has been recently reported by the NA61/SHINE collaboration. Similar excesses were also present in previous experiments, even if with larger errors. Models for hadron productions in heavy ion collisions systematically underestimate the measured charge-to-neutral kaon ratio. In fact, using well-established models for hadron production, we demonstrate that known isospin-symmetry breaking effects and the initial nuclei containing more neutrons than protons lead only to a small (few percent) deviation of the charged-to-neutral kaon ratio from unity at high energies. The significance of the isospin-symmetry violation beyond the known effects is 4.7σ when the compilation of world data with uncertainties quoted by the experiments is used. New systematic, high-precision measurements and theoretical efforts are needed to establish the origin of the observed large isospin-symmetry breaking.",

          "description": "Heavy quark-antiquark bound states such as  $c\\bar{c}$ and $b\\bar{b}$, serve as essential tools for probing the properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, its finite momentum behaviour remains largely unexplored, despite its experimental significance. Here, we present a finite-momentum lattice QCD study of quakonia dynamics by observing its finite-momentum spectral function. We obtained the spectral function in threshold region by solving the Schrödinger equation with finite-momentum perturbative potential. We will model this spectral function with perturbative vacuum part to describe the lattice correlators in 2+1 flavor QCD at temperatures of 1.20 $T_c$, 1.40 $T_c$, and 1.62 $T_c$ for pseudoscalar channel.",

          "description": "NA61/SHINE is a multipurpose fixed-target experiment located at CERN SPS. One of its main goals is to study the onsets of fireball and deconfinement and the properties of strongly interacting matter. For this purpose, a unique two-dimensional scan in collision energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.1 - 17.3$ GeV) and system size was performed. Results for p+p, Be+Be, and Ar+Sc collisions were already published by NA61/SHINE, and results for Pb+Pb were published by NA49. The ''horn'' in the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio measured in Pb+Pb collisions is not present in Ar+Sc collisions. Therefore, the results for Xe+La collisions, with a size between Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb, are crucial for the understanding of the system size dependence.\r\nThis talk presents new results on spectra of hadrons produced in central Xe+La collisions. The beam energy dependence of the measured quantities will be presented. The kinematic distributions and the multiplicities of identified hadrons will be compared with NA61/SHINE results for other systems, NA49 results, as well as  available world data.",

However, tension remains between experimental data and theories that assume no dynamics for spin. Building on the success of hydrodynamics in describing the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma, relativistic theories of spin hydrodynamics have been developed to assess whether spin dynamics is relevant to heavy-ion phenomenology. These theories treat spin as a dynamical degree of freedom that evolves through the conservation of total angular momentum. Despite significant progress in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, our understanding of relativistic causality and the stability of thermal equilibria--both of which are crucial for numerical simulations--remains limited. As a step toward addressing this issue in a unified framework, we demonstrate that non-dissipative relativistic spin fluids fit naturally into the framework of so-called divergence-type hydrodynamic theories [2], which have desirable mathematical properties. In particular, a perfect spin fluid can be fully specified by a scalar generating function. This formulation makes it straightforward to assess whether a given theory is compatible with causality and stability. When the generating function is based on a generalized Boltzmann distribution, we show that the theory is both causal and stable and is therefore suitable for numerical implementation. Furthermore, it reproduces existing results when expanded up to second order in $\\hbar$. Finally, retaining all orders in $\\hbar$, we calculate the relevant components of the stress-energy and spin tensors, such as spin-induced pressure anistropy.\r\n\r\n[1] L.

          "description": "The virtual photons emitted during the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions can escape the strongly interacting matter and be measured. This study shows that their polarization can reveal much about the nature of their production mechanism. We present the results of a comprehensive investigation of dilepton polarization generated  by a quark-gluon plasma produced  in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We compare the polarization results predicted by leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rate calculated with thermal field theory [1] and highlight the differences. The rates are integrated using a state-of- the-art multi-stage framework which includes IP-Glasma+KøMPøST+MUSIC+URQMD [2], and this end-to-end realistic dynamical approach is used to compute the polarization coefficients, like $\\lambda_\\theta$, that can be compared to experimental measurements. We observe sizeable differences between LO and NLO results: both in overall sign and in magnitude. On non-perturbative grounds, the NLO results can be confirmed by a new correlator recently studied on the lattice [3]. Furthermore, the behaviour of $\\lambda_\\theta$ in the limit of small invariant masses indicates that the inclusion of the NLO corrections is mandatory to recover the correct transverse polarization. Our study confirms the important role played by dileptons as probes of early time dynamics. \r\n\r\n[1] Jessica Churchill, Lipei Du, Charles Gale, Greg Jackson, and Sangyong Jeon, Phys. Rev.

Previous studies in homogeneous and boost invariant systems have shown rapid hydrodynamisation and entropy production during the first $1~\\text{fm}/c$. In this work, we relax the assumption of boost invariance and study the early time dynamics for realistic rapidity profiles of initial quark and gluon distributions. Using state-of-the-art 3D initial-state models, we study thermalisation, hydrodynamisation and chemical equilibration of the QGP as a function of rapidity. In addition, we look at the rapidity evolution of initial state perturbations and charge diffusion.",

At large number of colors, the potential is argued to consist in a real part plus a constant imaginary term.  The former is calculated using as input at zero temperature lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. For its extension to finite temperatures, we adapt an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty. In this framework, which can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the X(3872) and to other exotic states, we qualitatively estimate  the temperature range for the formation of the heavy tetraquark and propose a picture for its in-medium dissociation. We then introduce a dynamic coalescence model to better understand how this particle forms and persist inside the thermal medium.",

          "description": "In this work, we study the localization properties of the eigenstates of non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory both with and without dynamical quark flavors in a gauge invariant manner, using first-principles lattice gauge theory techniques. We use the eigenspectrum of a probe (overlap) Dirac operator to understand the properties of thermal gauge ensembles of 2+1 flavor QCD generated using domain wall fermions as well as pure SU(3) gauge theory. Focusing on the infrared part of eigenspectrum that lie within the non-perturbative magnetic scale, we propose suitable observables that allow us to unambiguously categorize  different regions of the eigenspectrum. While most of these so-called magnetic modes are completely delocalized and chaotic, with nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations similar to random matrices of a Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), few eigenmodes with fractal-like properties start to appear at temperatures just near and above the chiral crossover temperature. We show that their fractal dimensions carry information about the universality class of the chiral transition in QCD. \r\n\r\nHaving demonstrated that at sufficiently high temperatures, the non-Abelian plasma is gluon dominated with large occupation numbers in the infra-red and exhibits properties similar to a chaotic system, we discuss its consequences for heavy-ion experiments. Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state of SU(3) gluons inspired by the Color \r\nGlass Condensate effective theory, a real-time classical-statistical evolution leads to a self-similar scaling regime where we show that infrared magnetic modes are also over-occupied and chaotic. Thus by matching the evolving magnetic scale in this non-equilibrium scaling regime with that of a typical thermal state of QCD, we estimate a thermalization time of $\\sim  1.44$ fm/c.\r\n\r\nReference: Understanding the approach to thermalization from the eigenspectrum of non-Abelian gauge theories, Harshit Pandey, Ravi Shanker, Sayantan Sharma, arXiv:2407.09253 [hep-lat]",

          "description": "We investigate the evolution of charm quarks in hot QCD matter within the well-grounded quasiparticle approach [1]. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is composed of the quasiparticle excitations with dynamically generated masses that are linked to the lattice QCD equation of state. \r\n\r\nUtilizing the kinetic rate equation, we study the thermal production of charm quark pairs $(c\\bar{c})$ in hot QCD matter with various quark content and distinct evolution scenarios. The QGP with $N_f=2+1$ quark flavors contains the charm-quark \"impurities\", while in the $N_f=2+1+1$ case, the charm quarks contribute to the QCD equation of state above $T=300$ MeV.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the system with $N_f=2+1$ is described by hydrodynamic simulations of viscous fluid in 2+1 dimensions [2], with temperature-dependent shear viscosity computed in the quasiparticle approach [1]. To illustrate how the kinetics of charm quarks depends on the evolution and transport properties of hot QCD matter, we additionally study the production of the $c\\bar{c}$  pairs in perfect fluid propagating longitudinally [3].\r\n\r\nOur systematic study reveals that within the statistical errors, the number of the $c\\bar{c}$ pairs remains unchanged through the entire evolution of perfect QGP propagating in one dimension. This observation agrees with the prediction of the Statistical Hadronization Model [4]. In viscous QGP expanding in 2+1 dimensions, a slight decrease in the number of charm quarks is observed as the system approaches the pseudocritical temperature. This indicates the influence of the dissipative phenomena on the production of heavy flavors in hot QCD [5].\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n[1] V. Mykhaylova, C.

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment, being built at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR)[1] accelerator complex in Darmstadt, Germany, aims to study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the realm of high net baryon densities and moderate temperatures. The SIS-100 accelerator ring at FAIR will deliver accelerated ions up to beam kinetic energies 29 GeV for protons and 11 A GeV for heavy-ions. The identification of muon pairs coming from the decay of J/ψ mesons is recognized as a crucial physics observable for analyzing the hot and dense matter formed during collisions. The Muon Chamber (MuCh)[2] detector system is being built to identify the muon pairs in a background mostly populated by muons from weak decay of pions and kaons produced in the collisions.\r\n\r\n Simulation results on the physics performance of reconstructing for J/ψ mesons through the di-muon decay channel will be presented for p+Au collisions at 29 GeV and Au+Au collisions at 10 A GeV using various machine learning models. These results will then be compared with those obtained from traditional di-muon cut-based analysis method. The traditional cut-based approach for distinguishing signal from background relies on track selection criteria such as number of hits associated with a reconstructed global track in the Silicon Tracking System (STS), Muon Chamber (MuCh), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), and Time of Flight (TOF) detector, along with χ² values for the Vertex, STS, and MuCh, and a 2σ TOF mass cut. These same parameters are also used for both training and testing the machine learning models. The performance of the Boosted Decision Tree Gradient (BDTG) model [3] in enhancing reconstruction efficiency (ϵ) while maintaining the Signal-to-Background ratio (S/B) will be reported.",

          "description": "Unlike the earlier paradigm in physics, recent advancements in machine learning focus on uncovering physical law through data-driven approaches. In this talk, we leverage well-trained feedback neural networks (FNNs), combined with phenomenological models and reliable nuclear mass data from AME2020 and AME2016, to predict atomic masses with exceptional accuracy and extrapolation capabilities, surpassing traditional theoretical predictions. Using this framework, we accurately determine the masses of superheavy nuclei. Additionally, we also employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can handle noisy input data by training the generator and discriminator against each other, to obtain the relationship between the initial condition features ($\\epsilon_n$) of quark-gluon plasma and final-state momentum distribution ($v_n$) under ultra-central collisions of identical heavy ions, as derived from transport and/or hydrodynamic model simulations and low-energy deformation data. Accounting for initial state fluctuations and hadronic evolution, we use $\\epsilon_n$ and $v_n$ as independent variables to infer the deformation characteristics of the two colliding nuclei. Our GAN model effectively recovers physical information lost during blinded process, providing a novel approach to learn heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Recent advances in quantum technologies and computation have conduced to novel theoretical developments, which have found applications in various research fields, including high-energy physics. This work presents an open quantum systems approach for studying the suppression of quarkonia [1], which has been considered for many decades a crucial probe for unraveling the main features of hot and dense QCD matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We describe the dissociation and regeneration of quarkonia bound states by means of the quantum Lindblad master equation, which is solved numerically through the so-called MonteCarlo Wave Function (MCWF) method [2]. For a realistic environment evolution we couple the Lindblad equation to a full relativistic Boltzmann transport approach for the description of the QGP [3]. Within this unified framework we study the impact of different medium evolution on the dissociation of quarkonia with the aim to identify the main physical characteristics which enhance the quantum decoherence of QCD bound states. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transport coefficients on the Lindblad evolution, with the purpose to merge the state-of-the-art knowledge of heavy quark spatial diffusion coefficient estimated by lattice QCD and phenomenological models to open quantum systems approach for quarkonia [4]. Finally, we present our results for the nuclear modification factor of quarkonia and compare to experimental measurements at RHIC and LHC.",

          "description": "Light nuclei production is expected to be sensitive to a QCD phase transition at large net-baryon densities which are accessible in heavy-ion collisions. I will present results of a study with the UrQMD transport model supplied with a density dependent equation of state including a first-order phase transition. These results include the time evolution of the cumulants up to third order of the baryon number, proton number, and light nuclei number at $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}=2-3A$ GeV. While a significant deviation from Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number is observed in coordinate space, no significant measurable signal is seen in a finite rapidity window. Relative to the baryon number fluctuations, the proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. In addition, the coordinate space fluctuations and strong correlations lead to an enhancement of cluster production for a phase transition compared to a crossover scenario. This enhancement, however, is small and limited to the dense stage of the collision before the system actually freezes out.\r\n\r\nRef.: arXiv:2411.08444 [hep-ph]",

          "description": "The collision of a proton and a lead nucleus is asymmetric in nature, leading to an asymmetric rapidity distribution (more particles produced in the Pb-going side) of the produced particles at ultrarelativistic energies. We study multiplicity in such collision as a function of pseudorapidity, and centrality defined from the energy deposited in a calorimeter. In particular, we focus on the ultracentral regime (high-multiplicity collisions), where the asymmetry is more pronounced. We show that in this region, fluctuations of the multiplicity and the centrality estimator are predominantly due to quantum fluctuations, with impact parameter fluctuations playing negligible role. The joint probability distribution of multiplicity and the centrality estimator can be well approximated by a correlated gamma distribution. We show that this simple model can reproduce existing ATLAS data, and we make quantitative predictions for two more centrality bins in the ultracentral regime, namely $0-0.1\\%$ and $0-0.01\\%$, which could be verified experimentally. Predictions for more central events (e.g. $0-0.001\\%$) are also possible by the same model. We also argue that by repeating the same analysis with a different centrality estimator, direct information can be obtained about the rapidity decorrelation in particle production. \r\n\r\nBased on Samanta, Ollitrault, Phys.

          "description": "This study presents the first application of Bayesian inference to a hybrid model that combines hadronic transport as an initial state with a shear and bulk viscosity dependent on both temperature and baryochemical potential. Typically, the extraction of nuclear matter properties, such as viscosities, from experimental data involves Bayesian inference on theoretical models with parametric initial conditions, which leads to high-dimensional priors and reduces the strength of constraints. By integrating the SMASH transport code with the vHLLE hydrodynamic framework and a chiral mean field model equation of state in the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid \\textsuperscript{1} model, applied within the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200, we reduce reliance on parametric assumptions, while leveraging a physically motivated initial state.\r\n\r\nDespite the use of hadronic transport for initial conditions, some parametric uncertainty remains. This study offers new insights into the impact of initial state smearing and the lifetime of the pre-equilibrium state on observables. In particular, we provide updated constraints on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependencies of the shear and bulk viscosity. We also investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic phase's lifetime on observables and the role of cross-sections in the final state rescattering. Our analysis covers a diverse range of experimental data, including both midrapidity and rapidity-dependent measurements, to assess the impact of model parameters on the robustness of the inferred results.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] https://github.com/smash-transport/smash-vhlle-hybrid",

          "description": "In 2017, the STAR collaboration at RHIC unveiled the global polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons, establishing a connection between angular momentum in heavy-ion collisions and the vorticity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, a comprehensive understanding of how spin-states - and thus polarization - evolve throughout the hadronic phase presents a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of spin-flip processes during (in)elastic scatterings on $\\Lambda$ polarization in the hadronic rescattering phase.\r\nWe incorporate spin-flip cross sections, derived from both s- and t-channel processes as calculated by Sung, Ko, and Lee [arXiv:2404.15890v1], into the SMASH-vHLLE hybrid approach. This integration enables a dynamic representation of spin states within the hadronic transport regime. Our research systematically implements spin-flip effects in hadronic transport simulations, yielding critical insights into the late-stage evolution of polarization in heavy-ion collisions. The findings hold direct relevance for interpreting experimental results from RHIC and the LHC, advancing our understanding of spin dynamics in the context of QCD.",

          "description": "To date, holographic calculations have provided separate descriptions for the rates of energy loss for either ultrarelativistic massless quarks and gluons or infinitely massive quarks in strongly coupled N=4 SYM plasma. We present a unified description of heavy quark energy loss by combining the limits of zero mass $M \\to 0$ and infinite mass $M \\rightarrow \\infty$ in such a way that ensures continuity in both the energy $E(x)$ and its derivative $E'(x)$ with respect to the distance traveled. At early times, when the heavy quark is relativistic, our model aligns with the $ M \\to 0 $ limit, while at late times, when the quark is being dragged by the medium, it approaches the $ M \\to \\infty $ limit. We implement this unified description within the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model and incorporate a local color-neutralization mechanism occurring through the recombination of the heavy quark with a nearby opposite color charge (either a light antiquark or a diquark) from the surrounding flowing medium—a process that contributes significantly to the transverse momentum $p_T$ at low $p_T$. By turning recombination off and on we isolate the effect of transverse flow on the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons; we compare these observables as well as the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of b- and c-jets to available experimental data. We also investigate the mass dependence of heavy quark energy loss. Furthermore, we explore jet substructure observables and angular distributions of heavy quarks within jets, offering new probes into heavy quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma.",

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), Darmstadt, offers a unique opportunity to study the model-predicted first-order transition from hadronic phase to Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase with high precision by using its exceptionally high collision rates of up to 10 MHz, far surpassing previous experiments.\r\nEvent-by-event fluctuations in nuclear collisions allow us to probe the correlation length ($\\xi$) of the system, which captures how variables change together over space and time. Near a critical point, this correlation length becomes significant, even diverging in an infinite system, making fluctuation measurements a powerful tool in the search for the QCD critical point. The non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis times variance, $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ (or $C_{4}/C_{2}$) of the net-proton (serving as a proxy for net-baryon) distribution on collision energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) is proposed as an indicator of the QCD critical point, due to its connection with the system's correlation length and susceptibilities. In this work, we present the results on net-proton fluctuations for Au+Au collisions in the range of collision energy 3.5-19.6 GeV using the newly developed Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (PHQMD) model [1]. This study provides novel insights into fluctuation behavior within the CBM energy range. The results have been compared with those obtained using the acceptance of Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment. Additionally, we calculate the cumulant ratios of net-kaon multiplicity distributions, as net-kaon fluctuations serve as effective indicators of net- strangeness fluctuations. PHQMD is a versatile model for studying heavy-ion collisions and cluster formation across diverse energies, integrating Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) for QGP interactions and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) for baryon dynamics.\r\nOur results tried to establish a baseline for understanding the fluctuations, aiding in the search for potential critical behaviors near the critical endpoint on the phase diagram in the CBM energy range.\r\nRef: 1.

          "description": "We investigate the dynamics of heavy quarks during the initial stages of relativistic nuclear collisions. The initial pre-equilibrium stage of heavy-ion collisions, commonly known as Glasma, evolves according to the classical Yang-Mills (CYM) equations. Heavy quarks are coupled to the evolving Glasma fields via relativistic kinetic theory. We compute the momentum broadening as well as the angular momentum fluctuations of charm and beauty quarks in the early stage, which turn out to be anisotropic due to the anisotropy of the background gluon fields. We observe that transverse momentum broadening for heavy quarks evolves as  $\\sigma_p \\propto t^2$  in the presence of background Glasma fields. This non-Markovian diffusion of heavy quarks in the early stages is explained by the memory effect present in the gluon fields. Furthermore, we also estimate the HQ spatial diffusion coefficient  $2 \\pi T D_x$  in the pre-equilibrium phase.    The    $D_x$  obtained in the pre-equilibrium phase is quite close to the value obtained within pQCD in the QGP phase. Notably,  $D_x$   follows a continuous evolution from the pre-equilibrium phase to the QGP phase.",

          "description": "The global spin alignment of $\\phi$ meson has been observed by the STAR collaboration in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. However, the measured positive deviation from 1/3 of the spin alignment is orders of magnitude larger than contributions of traditional mechanisms like vorticity or magnetic fields. We proposed that the anisotropy of local strong field fluctuation in meson's rest frame is a new mechanism that can incorporate the observed spin alignment. In heavy-ion collisions, such an anisotropy may arise from a faster longitudinal expansion of the QGP than transverse expansion, and from motion of the meson relative to the QGP. Our discussions are based on a relativistic spin kinetic theory derived from Kadanoff-Baym equations, with an effective quark-meson model for the strong interaction. The vector meson in our model is generated from quark-antiquark coalescence, where quark and antiquark are polarized by the local strong field. We calculated the spin alignment of the $\\phi$ meson and showed its relation to the anisotropy of field fluctuations with respect to the spin quantization direction, while the strength of fluctuation can be extracted from experimental data as functions of collision energies. The transverse momentum dependence of $\\phi$ meson's spin alignment is then calculated with our model, which agrees with the STAR's data. We further predicted azimuthal angle dependence and rapidity dependence that can be verified by future experiments.",

          "description": "Heavy quarks (HQ) are considered to be excellent probes of the hot QCD matter produced in the high-energy heavy-ion collisions. HQ diffusion coefficient is one of the fundamental transport properties of the hot QCD matter. In this work, we have calculated the HQ momentum ($\\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients in an ambient background weak magnetic field via evaluating the scattering rate of HQ's with light thermal partons. To that end, we calculate the HQ self-energy in the presence of a weak magnetic field by using the HQ potential as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator. The information about the magnetic field comes in via the HQ potential, wherein, the light thermal partons are assumed to occupy all Landau levels. In this potential formulation, one can consider a non-perturbative ansatz for the gluon propagator which produces a string-like confining effect in coordinate space, thus allowing for the calculation of non-perturbative contribution to the HQ transport coefficients.  We have computed the heavy quark diffusion coefficients at both zero and finite momentum, observing that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low momentum and low temperature. Our spatial diffusion coefficient, $2\\pi T D_s$, shows good agreement with recent LQCD results. These findings can be used to calculate the heavy quark directed flow at RHIC and LHC energies.",

          "description": "A central ingredient in the description of QCD jets in the quark-gluon plasma is the gluon emission probability off a quark leg. Despite its critical importance, this object has only been computed under a set of approximations concerning both the kinematics of the process and the description of the medium. In this talk we will present new results that go significantly beyond the state-of-the-art by following a twofold approach. First, we formulate the problem in coordinate space and obtain the splitting function with exact kinematics and finite-$N_c$ corrections by solving a system of Schrödinger-like equations [1]. We also explore a momentum space formulation that results in a set of Dyson-like equations. The latter approach significantly helps to extend the medium description beyond the harmonic oscillator approximation [2]. In both cases, we will present numerical routines that are fast, efficient and flexible.  We establish the size of both kinematic corrections and refinements on the medium description. The resultant improvements in the emission spectrum allow for precise calculations of many in-medium jet observables, including energy-energy correlators, which are also shown and confronted with experimental data. \r\n\r\n[1] JHEP 09 (2023) 049\r\n[2] JHEP 07 (2020) 114",

Unlike the widely used staggered fermions, which suffer from taste violations that lead to unphysical behavior-such as scalar screening masses failing to reach their physical values at low temperatures-Möbius domain wall fermions preserve near-exact chiral symmetry. We compare our results with those obtained using staggered fermions to offer new insights into the role of axial U(1) symmetry in the QCD phase transition.",

          "description": "The simultaneous description of jet observables such as the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ as a function of transverse momentum is a challenge both in large and small colliding systems. For large systems there is the complication of the hydrodynamic background and response, whereas in small systems so far no measurable jet quenching could be identified. This motivates the development of a versatile framework that combines state-of-the-art jet quenching and hydrodynamic models together with a sophisticated analysis framework including background subtraction. In this work we present a combined *Trajectum*, JEWEL and Rivet analysis for $^{16}$O$^{16}$O, $^{20}$Ne$^{20}$Ne and PbPb, including event-shape-engineering, an analysis of the influence of the hydrodynamic fluid velocities and diverse jet substructure observables. Our results reveal that jet substructure observables are sensitive to both event-by-event fluctuations and the underlying flow of the medium. The full analysis and plugin (also compatible with the MUSIC code), designed for ease of use, is publicly accessible and extends the versatility of JEWEL for jet-quenching studies.",

          "description": "We argue that the actual production mechanism of deuterons and larger nuclear clusters - coalescence or direct thermal production - can be resolved with the help of elliptic flow. Coalescence is sensitive to the spatial extension of cluster wave function and therefore reflects the change of the size of producing homogeneity region when looking at cluster production in different azimuthal directions. We verify this idea with the help of Monte Carlo model that simulates emission of  hadrons from a parametrised freeze-out hypersurface. The model is tuned on pt spectra and elliptic flow of hadrons, and includes decays of resonances. Comparison of v2 predictions for deuterons for the two mechanisms from a hybrid dynamical model (TRENTO + vHLLE + SMASH) is also presented.",

          "description": "In this talk, we will discuss the effects of color decoherence and virtuality evolution on jet quenching observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. First, we will show that the jet multiplicity, calculated according to the color coherence picture, provides a reasonable description of inclusive jet data up to $p_T \\sim 1$ TeV in pp collisions at the LHC. Building on this understanding of the virtuality evolution of vacuum jets, we combine the color coherence picture (angular ordering) with color decoherence in QCD matter at a virtuality determined by the interplay between vacuum evolution and medium-induced momentum broadening. Using radiative energy loss calculated within the BDMPS formalism and modeling QCD bulk matter with the (2+1)-dimensional OSU hydrodynamic code, we perform a detailed calculation of the inclusive jet modification factor $R_{AA}$ in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Our results demonstrate that the observed $R_{AA}$ spectrum at high $p_T$, which requires larger energy loss than at lower $p_T$, is correlated with jet multiplicity as predicted by the virtuality evolution of jets. This study indicates that virtuality evolution and color decoherence play critical roles in providing a comprehensive understanding of jet quenching.",

          "description": "Shock waves in matter produced under extreme conditions drive complex processes like energy transfer, particle acceleration, and plasma instability. Magnetic fields alter the shock wave properties of matter produced in heavy ion collisions and astrophysics, influencing energy density, pressure, and turbulence in these extreme conditions. How magnetic fields impact shock wave evolution in both quark-gluon plasma from heavy ion collisions and in astrophysical processes like neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernovae can be examined through simulations. This study explores how magnetic fields shape shock wave behaviour in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), with applications in heavy ion collisions and astrophysics. The findings of this work offer insights into the fundamental interactions of shock waves in magnetised, relativistic fluid for Heavy-Ion Collisions and Astrophysics applications.",

          "description": "Heavy-Quarkonia evolution in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) can be studied using the framework of open quantum systems. The density matrix of the quarkonia satisfies a simple Lindblad-type equation if one assumes that the binding energy $E_b$ is much smaller than the medium temperature $T$. This approximation does not hold for a significant part of the QGP evolution. We study the evolution of quarkonia in the regime when $E_b \\sim T$ by solving general master equations for the density matrix, which include the effects of memory. We calculate suppression of $\\Upsilon$ states at CMS and RHIC energies. For the background medium, we use results from a realistic viscous 2+1 hydrodynamic simulation, which gives a good description of the phenomenology of the soft particles.",

          "description": "Relativistic kinetic theory has been used to describe many aspects of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. To provide smooth initial condition for the hydrodynamic phase from the early stages. To take into account the interaction in the final stage of the evolution, before the chemical and kinetic freeze-out, or directly to replace hydrodynamics in the description of the strongly interacting medium produced in the collision. It has also been used extensively to obtain the transport coefficients of second order hydrodynamics and its generalizations. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is a limiting case for the evolution the Wigner distribution, the quantum precursor of the distribution function. Relativistic kinetic theory is supposed to work for asymptotically weak interactions and small quantum corrections. If the weak interaction assumption is already debatable for a strongly interacting liquid (close to a perfect fluid), more recently it has been shown that the quantum corrections are not small for a free gas[1]. The action scale of the system (compared to the Plank constant) sets the size of these corrections, and a semiclassical expansion is a safe approximation for cold and dilute systems. This is not the case for a hotter and smaller system, like at the beginning of the expansion of the medium. Besides significantly changing the energy density and pressure, hence showing that the quantum corrections are not relevant only for the polarization of spinning particles, the analytic structure of the integrands seem to preclude a semiclassical series to recover the exact results.\r\nThese off-shell effects, though, can be taken into account with a generalization of the hydrodynamic expansion [2], recovering second order hydrodynamics (and its transport coefficients), and providing an quantum generalization of the evolution of the non-hydrodynamic modes.\r\n\r\n[1] LT, Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 7, 076022\r\n[2] LT, Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 3, 036015",

In this work, I show how astrophysical observables will be modified in the presence of extra compactified dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe interior of a compact star is modeled as a multidimensional interacting degenerate Fermi gas, embedded in a static, spherically symmetric spacetime with extra compactified spatial dimensions. The equation of state of this extreme medium is given and compared to the standard models of superdense matter. The modification of the mass-radius relation of compact stars is calculated and compared to realistic star models and astrophysical observation data. The interaction strength has been determined for this extraordinary matter. Constraints on the size of the extra dimension have been estimated based on pulsar measurements [1,2].\r\n\r\n[1] A.

          "description": "A hybrid framework of spin hydrodynamics is proposed that combines the results of kinetic theory for particles with spin 1/2 with the Israel-Stewart method of introducing non-equilibrium dynamics. The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in non-equilibrium processes. They are responsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved. \r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n1) \"Generalized thermodynamic relations for perfect spin hydrodynamics\", arXiv:2405.03263 [hep-ph] by W.

          "description": "We present a microscopic model to study the formation, as well as dissociation and recombination processes of charmonium states in the quark gluon plasma. In this classical approach, heavy quarks are described as Brownian particles in a background medium of light constituents. The heavy-quark dynamics are modelled by a Fokker-Planck equation with constant transport coefficients, which is then implemented through relativistic Langevin simulations. The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential, enabling the formation of charmonium states. These bound states may dissociate due to screening effects of the potential and through scatterings with plasma particles. Using box simulations at fixed temperature and volume, we demonstrate the full equilibration of the system with equilibrium charmonium yields consistent with the Statistical Hadronization Model. In order to model the phenomenology of a heavy-ion collision, we then implement a dynamical description, where the evolution of the expanding medium is parametrized by a boost invariant fireball. This allows us to study the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of the charm and anticharm quarks, as well as of charmonia, at RHIC and LHC energy, and compare the results to experimental data.",

          "description": "Understanding the applicability of fluid-dynamical models to describe the hot and dense matter produced in the early stages of hadronic collisions is a fundamental problem in the field. In particular, it is not clear to what degree this *hydrodynamization* process requires proximity to a local equilibrium state. In this contribution, we study this problem in kinetic theory considering an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing strong longitudinal expansion, assuming Bjorken flow. We solve the Boltzmann equation using a relativistic generalization of the method of moments [1], where the single-particle distribution is reconstructed via a moment expansion. We first demonstrate that this traditional moment expansion actually diverges for this system and that this series must be resummed [2]. We then compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium, even though the energy-momentum tensor is well described by fluid dynamics. We further show the 14-moment approximation [3], widely employed in simulations of heavy ion collisions, does not provide a good approximation for the momentum distribution of this system. We quantity this effect computing the emission of photons in the quark-gluon plasma [4] and verify if this deviation from equilibrium can be observed.\r\n\r\n[1] G. S. Denicol, H. Niemi, E.

          "description": "Elecromagnetic probes, such as dileptons, can provide a clear information about the properties of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions since they are undisturbed by the strong final state  interaction. The dileptons are emitted during the whole evolution of the expanding system from many different sources -  from hadron decays to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) thermal radiation, so the consistent description of dilepton production requires an application of dynamical models. \r\n\r\nIn this work we investigate the dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions as well as in proton-proton and proton-nucleus reactions from low invariant energies of a one GeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies of a few TeV (LHC). Our study is based on the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach - a microscopic, non-equilibrium transport approach that incorporates both hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom and provides a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, covering the entire process from the initial out-of-equilibrium nucleon-nucleon collisions, through the formation and interactions of the quark-gluon plasma, and extending to the hadronization and final-state off-shell interactions of the produced hadrons. \r\n\r\nThe main dilepton sources  in the PHSD are  the hadronic decays and bremstrahlung, thermal QGP radiation (including $q+\\bar q \\to e^+e^-$,  $q+\\bar q \\to g+ e^+e^-$,  $q+g \\to q+ e^+e^-$ processes), primary Drell-Yan production (computed here dynamically in the PHSD framework)  and semileptonic decays from correlated charm and bottom pairs. We find that the PHSD provides a good description of the dilepton data of the HADES, STAR and ALICE experiments. We investigate the influence of in-medium effects such as a collisional broadening of the vector meson spectral functions  and present the excitation function of the dilepton \"excess\" in invariant mass range $0.4<M<0.75$ GeV  as well as it's centrality dependence for different energies.\r\n\r\nFor the 1st time we report on the $\\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP thermal radiation - calculated in the PHSD within the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) used for the description of the non-perturbative QGP -  and show that its influence increases with decreasing bombarding energy, where  $\\mu_B$ becomes larger. We present the excitation function of dileptons produced from  thermal QGP - including the $\\mu_B$ dependence of quasiparticle thermal masses and widths and their interactions - versus correlated charm  that  the QGP overshines the correlated charm at invariant energies $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 30$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions. This  gives an access to the thermal QGP dileptons at BES-RHIC and future FAIR experiments. Furthermore, we study the contribution of the QGP to the dilepton spectra for p+p reactions at LHC energies and find that it increases with increasing collision energy. Thus, after subtracting the contributions of correlated charm and bottom pairs from dilepton experimental data it might become accessible, too.",

Since in the case of vector mesons, this degree of coherence can be experimentally ascertained by measuring off-diagonal matrix elements,  We suggest that a measurement of azimuthal dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements of the vector meson and quarkonium spin density matrix can falsify and constrain this picture.\r\n\r\nBased on\r\n[1] Kayman J.

          "description": "This work aims to shed light on the puzzle of small systems constituted by the absence of jet quenching but the\r\npresence of a non-zero v$_2$ of high pt particles. This is done using the JEWEL event generator with a brick-like medium\r\ndefinition mimicking a small collision system. We concentrate on two observables: R$_AA$, which measures the energy loss of jets, and v$_2$ of high p$_\\perp$ particles, which quantifies the azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles. By extracting R$_{AA}$ and v$_2$ as a function of number of scatterings (N$_{scat}$) in the brick-like medium, we obtain answers that\r\nare largely independent of any assumptions about the medium evolution and expansion.\r\n\r\nWhat we have found is that the observables do not depend only on the number of interactions but also on the screening mass ($m_D$), which controls  how much energy and momentum are transferred at each interaction. In fact, R$_AA$ and v$_2$ scale with $m_D^2 \\cdot N_{scat}$. The results also strongly indicate that more interactions\r\n(and thus more energy/momentum transfer) are required to create a visible R$_AA$ signal than a v$_2$ signal. This in turn\r\nhelps appease the years long debate on how it is possible that no jet quenching signs have been seen in collisions of\r\nsmall systems while an azimuthal anisotropy of hard particles is observed and thus allows the community\r\nto move on to study the modification of jets in small systems using more suitable observables.",

          "description": "Heavy-ion collisions in the energy regime of $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2 - 20 GeV, are relevant for the study of dense baryonic matter and the hunt for the critical end point of QCD. In this energy regime the well established hybrids of single-fluid hydrodynamics coupled to transport afterburners are reaching their limitation due to long interpenetration times and an intricate time evolution.\r\n\r\nTo address this shortcoming we present Frisco3, a novel 3-fluid hydrodynamical simulation model of relativistic heavy-ion reactions with a continuous transition from the fluid phase to the regime of free streaming hadrons, applicable at RHIC-FXT, GSI and FAIR energies. The time evolution of the reaction is consistently described in terms of three coupled ideal fluids, resembling the two nuclei, which couple to the third fluid, the fireball, via a local friction rate, and a continuous drain term, which is determined by the local thermal emissivity and the survival probability of produced hadrons given by their momentum differential, temperature and density dependent scattering rate in the medium. The model thus overcomes the conventional issues of i) single-fluid hydrodynamics loosing applicability at lower energies due to small Lorentz-contraction, long interpenetration times and an intricate geometry. Instead the fireball fluid is continuously generated by friction of the projectile and target fluids, thus capturing the time dependent equilibration of the system. (ii) The model avoids the common Cooper-Frye decoupling. Instead of an ad-hoc freeze-out hyper-surface the freeze-out is dynamically determined by local scattering and expansion rates and thus avoids common issues of Cooper-Frye regarding conservation laws, feedback to the fluid phase or reheating. Frisco3 moreover conserves energy, momenta and charges exactly on an event-by-event basis at any time in the evolution.\r\n\r\nWe will present first benchmarking results on hadron multiplicities, rapidity and transverse momentum spectra for Au+Au collisions ranging from 2.4 GeV to 20 GeV center of mass energy, in comparison to recently measured data by HADES and STAR. We will further present freeze-out properties and will relate them to the phase diagram.",

          "description": "NA61/SHINE is a multi-purpose, fixed-target hadron spectrometer at the CERN SPS. Its research program includes studies of strong interactions as well as reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. A significant advantage of NA61/SHINE over collider experiments is its extended coverage of phase space available for particle production. This includes the entire projectile hemisphere of the collision, with no low-$p_T$ cut-off.\r\n\r\nThe energy and system-size dependence of strangeness production plays an essential role in studies of the transition from confined to deconfined matter. At the same time, resonance production is a key observable to study the dynamics of colliding systems at high density. With its zero net strangeness and its valence structure composed predominantly of $s$ and $\\bar{s}$ valence quarks, the $\\phi$(1020) meson will not be sensitive to strangeness-related effects in a purely hadronic scenario, but will behave like a doubly-strange particle in a partonic system. On the other hand, the $K^*$(892)$^0$ meson brings information on the time evolution of the hadronic phase, with the $K^*$(892)$^0$ to charged kaon production ratio allowing to estimate the time between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents the first-ever results on $\\phi$(1020) and $K^*$(892)$^0$ meson production in *intermediate-size* systems at the CERN SPS, that is, central Ar+Sc collisions at beam momenta of 40$A$, 75$A$, and 150$A$ GeV/$c$ ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8.8, 11.9, and 16.8 GeV, respectively). The presented results include transverse momentum and transverse mass spectra, double-differential rapidity-$p_T$ distributions, $p_T$-integrated rapidity spectra, mean multiplicities, and particle ratios. These are compared to data on Pb+Pb and $p$+$p$ collisions. The discussion of open and hidden strangeness production enhancement, as well as the time between freeze-outs and rescattering is included in the talk. We also show the comparison with several microscopic models, demonstrating their overall failure in describing these new measurements.",

          "description": "An understanding of the energy loss of fast partons passing through the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is important for the interpretation of experimental data on jet attenuation in the QGP created in heavy-ion collisions, as well as for the study of the modification of the QGP itself. However, gaining this knowledge is a challenging task, since it is related to the non-perturbative regime of QCD, for which only limited information from lattice QCD is currently available.\r\n\r\nTo work around this issue, we employ the dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). The DQPM describes the non-perturbative nature of the strongly-interacting QGP at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential based on a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons), whose properties are adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. Using the DQPM propagators, we can explicitly derive the scattering amplitudes for the elastic ($2\\to 2$) and inelastic ($2\\to 3$) radiative interactions without approximations, allowing us to study both the transport properties of the QGP and jet energy loss in the medium.\r\n\r\nWe report the following findings:\r\n1. We have obtained energy and temperature dependencies of the total elastic and radiative cross sections. We have found that, while elastic cross sections dominate at low energies and high temperatures, radiative cross sections increase at low temperatures and high energies, becoming comparable or even dominant.\r\n2. We have found that the interaction rate and relaxation time in the QGP are primarily governed by elastic scattering, suggesting that inelastic processes are suppressed in the non-perturbative thermalized thermal medium.\r\n3. We have obtained the jet transport coefficients, such as the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length $\\hat{q}$ and the energy loss per unit length $dE/dx$, and found their strong dependencies on the medium temperature, jet momentum and the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.\r\n4. We have examined the ratio of $\\hat{q}$ to shear viscosity $\\eta$ and shown that the scaling $\\eta/s \\approx 1.25 T^3/\\hat{q}$ is valid in the weak coupling regime at high temperatures, but is violated in the strong coupling regime at low temperatures.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

          "description": "Azimuthal anisotropy quantified as anisotropic flow coefficients are important observables that can provide key information about the collectivity of the system formed during heavy-ion collisions. The anisotropic flow coefficients are sensitive to both the geometrical configuration of the collision overlap region and the transport properties of the medium. Recently, hints of collectivity in small collision systems like pp and p--Pb have been reported, which are traditionally used for baseline measurements to study the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) signatures and cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-ion collisions. This makes O--O and p--O collisions interesting, as they bridge the multiplicity gap between pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions and can provide pivotal information about the observed QGP signatures in small systems. In addition,  $^{16}\\rm{O}$ is a doubly magic nucleus and possesses $\\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration, where one can imagine four $\\alpha$-particles arranging themselves at the corners of a randomly-rotated regular tetrahedron.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we shall present the effect of the presence of the $\\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration of $^{16}\\rm{O}$ on elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), triangular flow ($v_{3}$) and elliptic flow fluctuations in O--O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid CGC+hydro model based on IPGlasma+MUSIC+iSS+UrQMD framework. The results of  $\\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration of $^{16}\\rm{O}$ are also compared with the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. The results show an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ in the highest multiplicity regions for the $\\alpha$-cluster case as compared to the Woods-Saxon profile. Further, a strong increase in the value of  $v_{3}/v_{2}$ is observed when going from the top 10-20% to the top 0-10% multiplicity class for the case with $\\alpha$-clusters. Additionally, we find that the elliptic flow fluctuations show opposite trends with a decrease in final state multiplicity for $\\alpha$-cluster and Woods-Saxon nuclear density profiles. We conclude that the observables related to fluctuations are more sensitive and suited to study the effects of the $\\alpha$-clustered geometry in O--O collisions.",

          "description": "Bayesian statistical analysis is nowadays a well-established method for performing global fits of QCD matter properties and initial conditions to experimental data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. However, even when surrogate models such as Gaussian process emulators are used to reduce the number of simulations, the computational costs can still remain prohibitively large for producing sufficient training data for observables, such as rare flow correlators, which require a very large sample of events. These costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude by using neural networks to predict simulated event-by-event observables, whose event averages are then used in the training of the Gaussian process emulators. Here, we present results [1] of a Bayesian global analysis of four collision systems using EbyE-EKRT initial conditions and (2+1)D viscous fluid dynamical model with dynamical freeze-out [2]. The investigated systems are 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb, 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb, and 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. The statistical analysis is enhanced with deep convolutional neural networks, which are trained to predict the model output event-by-event for a given initial state profile [3], QCD matter properties and freeze-out conditions [4]. This combination of neural networks and Gaussian process emulators allows us to account for the statistics-expensive flow observables that provide further constraints for the temperature dependencies of shear and bulk viscosity, and for Knudsen number and system size -based freeze-out conditions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] J.

          "description": "Heavy-ion experiments provide a new opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the structure of nuclei. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify observables under circumstances that are minimally affected by the process that leads to the initial state of heavy-ion collisions from nuclear wave function. In this talk, we demonstrate that when assuming scale invariance, the effect of this stage on the initial energy or entropy density moments in ultracentral symmetric collisions is negligible for nucleon sizes of approximately 0.7 fm or larger for large nuclei. By borrowing cluster expansion method from statistical physics and using scale-invariance assumption, we calculate the average ellipticity of initial density at the presence of short-range correlation. We compare our calculations to Monte Carlo studies and assess the accuracy of various methods of short-range correlation sampling. Additionally, we find that the isobar ratio can constrain the initial-state parameters, in addition to deformation. Our study indicates that the isobar ratios in ultracentral collisions are especially sensitive to the fluctuation in the weight of the nuclei constituents and the two-body correlation among nucleons. This insight is crucial for drawing conclusions about nuclear deformations based on isobar ratios.\r\n\r\nBased on: S. M. A. Tabatabaee Mehr and S. F. Taghavi, Phys. Rev. C 110, 054901",

          "description": "The most recent measurements of femtoscopic correlations at NA61/SHINE, using intermediate collision systems, unravel that the shape of the particle emitting source exhibits non-Gaussian properties over the available energies. The measurements are based on alpha-stable symmetric Lévy sources, and we discuss the average pair transverse mass dependence of the source parameters. One of the parameters, the Lévy exponent, is of particular importance. The exponent not only describes the shape of the source, but also may be related to the critical point of the phase diagram. Its measurement, hence, may contribute to the search for and characterization of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram and the shape of the particle emitting source.\r\n\r\nMoreover, one of the most important goals of NA61/SHINE is to investigate and understand the phase structures of this strongly interacting matter. The investigation of the phase diagram can be achieved by varying the beam momentum (13A-150(8)A GeV/c) or by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Measuring the correlation functions in different systems at different energies enables us to perform a two-dimensional scan of the QCD phase diagram. The search in the collisions may then reveal the properties of sQGP and possible signs of the critical endpoint.",

          "description": "To bridge the gap between the theory of the QCD phase diagram and the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions it is important to understand the real-time dynamics of hot and dense QCD matter. One commonly employed low-energy effective theory for the QCD phase structure is the quark-meson model. In this talk, I will show how the real-time dynamics of the quark-meson model can be studied non-perturbatively using a formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour. As a particular application, we consider dissipative dynamics for the chiral order parameter and study the corresponding effects on static observables such as the phase diagram. We find that, unlike in classical systems, dissipation can potentially affect static observables through the contributions of non-zero Matsubara modes. We investigate these effects quantitatively within two phenomenological models for the temperature dependence of the pion damping.",

          "description": "Higher-order moments of conserved charge fluctuations, such as net-charge, net-baryon, and net-strangeness, are sensitive experimental probes for investigating the critical fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We calculate the cumulants and correlation functions of proton, antiproton, and net-proton multiplicity distributions in Au + Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7 GeV using a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The AMPT model can basically describe the trends of cumulants, cumulant ratios, (normalized) correlation functions of the proton and net-proton measured by the STAR experiment. The multiproton (baryon) correlations in the AMPT model are consistent with the expectation from baryon number conservation.  Since the physics of the QCD critical fluctuations is not included in the AMPT model, our results are expected to only provide a baseline for searching for the possible critical behaviors at the CEP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions[1]. Then, we incorporate critical fluctuations from the functional renormalization group (FRG) into the AMPT model in order to reveal the important effect of hadronic rescatterings on critical fluctuations. We observed apparent influences of hadronic rescatterings on the cumulant ratios of the net-baryon number fluctuations. The results demonstrate that hadronic rescatterings decrease C4/C2 in central collisions and increase C4/C2 in peripheral collisions, thereby bringing the model results with FRG closer to the STAR measurements. The effect of hadronic rescatterings is more significant for critical fluctuations than dynamical fluctuations.  Those study establishes a foundation for incorporating the fundamental dynamics of critical fluctuation into the framework of the AMPT model[2].\r\n\r\n[1] Qian Chen and Guo-Liang Ma.

Event generators like EPOS allow direct investigation of freeze-out coordinates, facilitating the analysis of the source function. EPOS, a Monte Carlo-based model, simulates high-energy nuclear and particle collisions, integrating Parton-Based Gribov-Regge theory for initial evolution, subsequent hydrodynamic evolution, and hadronization. In this talk, I will present an event-by-event analysis of the kaon-kaon and pion-pion source function in $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}}$ = 200  GeV Au+Au collisions using the EPOS model.

          "description": "Understanding the impact of nuclear structure in high-energy nuclear collisions is critical to advancing our knowledge of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation. In this study, we investigate the role of nuclear clustering, in particular the alpha-cluster structure in $\\rm ^{16}O$, using anisotropic flow observations from $\\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at RHIC energy. Through systematic simulations with an improved AMPT model, we show that a longer effective parton formation time is essential to match recent STAR experimental data. Importantly, the anisotropic flow coefficients serve as sensitive probes for distinguishing alpha-clustering configurations in $\\rm ^{16}O$ nuclei [1].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we extend this investigation to $\\rm ^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$ and $\\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at LHC energies, where we compare the results from the AMPT transport model with those from hydrodynamic models. The AMPT model, which accurately simulates non-equilibrium dynamics, shows significant deviations from hydrodynamic predictions, especially in key observables such as elliptic flow $v_{2}$, Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho (v_{2}^{2}\\{2\\},\\left \\langle p_{T} \\right \\rangle)$, and , symmetric cumulants SC(3,2), and four-particle cumulant $c_{2}\\{4\\}$. These discrepancies underscore the limitations of hydrodynamics, which assumes local thermal equilibrium, in small systems.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the transport model lies in its ability to capture the microscopic dynamics of particle collisions, making it more suitable for the study of small and intermediate collision systems such as $\\rm ^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$ and $\\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$, where non-equilibrium effects are significant. Unlike hydrodynamic models that assume local thermal equilibrium, the AMPT model effectively describes partonic interactions in systems with fewer particles, providing a more accurate description of initial state fluctuations and parton escape dynamics. \r\n\r\nThese results underscore the importance of transport models in the study of the complex dynamics of small and medium-sized nuclear systems, providing critical insights into the influence of nuclear clustering and improving the understanding of QGP formation at RHIC and the LHC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] X.L.

Thanks to their excellent signal-to-noise ratio, these observables enable a precise charting of the QCD phase diagram in the high-density region.\r\nWe present mixed baryon-strangeness fluctuations at $\\mu_B=0$ up to order 10 from high-statistics simulations with our 4HEX staggered action on a 16x8 lattice. With these we reconstruct the second strangeness susceptibility with a N4LO expansion.

          "description": "Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter has become one of the important research areas for both theoretical and experimental high-energy physics community. In the QCD phase diagram, which is characterised by temperature ($T$) and baryochemical potential ($\\mu_B$), a first-order phase transition is expected at high $\\mu_B$ and low T, which ends at a possible critical point. This is followed by a crossover transition from hadron to quark matter as predicted by lattice QCD calculations. In addition to the magnetic field, a huge amount of vorticity is expected to be produced in a non-central heavy ion collision. This vorticity or rotation ($\\omega$) can affect the evolution of the system and, hence, the phase diagram of the QCD matter. In this work, we study the effect of rotation on the phase diagram of hadronic matter. We find that rotation plays a similar role to baryochemical potential on the thermodynamic properties of hadron gas. The rotation adds a new kind of chemical potential called rotational chemical potential. Therefore, the phase transition can occur not only in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane but also in the $T-\\omega$ plane. We use an interacting hadron resonance gas model with van der Waals kind of attractive and repulsive interaction among the hadrons. We observe a liquid-gas phase transition under the effect of rotation, even at zero baryochemical potential. These results allow us to reinvestigate the QCD matter properties under the effect of rotation and study the phase diagram in the $T-\\mu_B-\\omega$ plane.",

          "description": "Strangeness production is a key signature of the formation of a hot and dense medium in heavy-ion collisions. Understanding the production mechanisms across different system sizes remains a significant challenge in this field. Hybrid approaches, particularly those based on transport theory and hydrodynamics, such as the core-corona picture, have been successfully applied in previous studies.\r\n\r\nCurrent and ongoing research utilizing the Lund string model within the Pythia8/Angantyr framework has taken a different approach to describe plasma-like signals, such as strangeness enhancement, through string interactions. This string framework does not assume a thermalized quark-gluon plasma and therefore serves as a valuable tool for investigating observables sensitive to collective behavior.\r\n\r\nInspired by the direction of string interactions, we employ the SMASH transport approach to examine whether a system size-dependent string tension can adequately describe experimental data on strangeness production. Additionally, we will explore potential methods for integrating medium-dependent string tension into SMASH.\r\n\r\nWhile past efforts have incorporated a constant in-medium string tension in transport models, this study is the first to evaluate string tension dynamically based on local conditions. This approach allows us to further assess which observables necessitate the formation of a quark-gluon plasma and which can be described without this assumption.",

          "description": "The Wiedemann-Franz law, a hallmark of non-relativistic electron transport, relates the thermal and electrical conductivities through a constant Lorenz ratio. This ratio remains fixed in conventional metals, consistent with Fermi gas and Fermi liquid theory. Interestingly, quarks or hadrons in the matter produced in RHIC or LHC experiments don't follow this law. This high-energy nuclear physics-based many-body system (QCD phase diagram) is expected in the temperature and (baryon) chemical potential within the order of MeV-GeV scales. In contrast, a condensed matter physics-based many-body system is expected within meV-eV temperature scales and Fermi energy(chemical potential). Though metals, having Fermi energy from 2eV to 10 eV, follow the WF law but graphene can reach the WF law violation domain by lowering its Fermi energy via the doping reduction technique. By drawing a parallel between graphene's Dirac fluid and hot quark matter, we aim to explore the transport behavior that emerges in strongly interacting, relativistic fluids across vastly different energy scales. We employed the Boltzmann transport theory to determine the thermal and electrical conductivities in graphene and ultra-relativistic quark matter. We observed a striking violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in both systems. The present work highlights the universal nature of transport phenomena in Dirac fluid and relativistic fluids, from the milli-electron volt (meV) scale in graphene to the mega-electron volt (MeV) scale in quark matter, providing insight into the fundamental physics governing both condensed matter and high-energy systems.",

          "description": "A net baryon density up to 2-6 times the nuclear saturation density and high magnetic fields are expected in the reaction zone of upcoming CBM/NICA experiments. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. The chiral effective model, based on the principles of chiral symmetry breaking and broken scale invariance, is employed to incorporate the in-medium effects of constituent quarks within hadrons. The classical and quantized versions of electrical conductivity and resistivity are studied in the relaxation time approximation framework of kinetic theory. Anisotropic electrical conductivity and resistivity tensors are investigated by considering cyclotron motion and Landau quantization. In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the Landau quantization of perpendicular momenta results in quantized anisotropic transport coefficients of the system. Two interesting macroscopic manifestations of Landau quantization are the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) [1]. In this work, we explore the possibility of SdH/QHE type oscillations in low temperature and high magnetic field conditions present in the interior of the dense neutron stars, as well as in future facilities of CBM/NICA experiments. Finally, we also present a quantitative estimate of the same in the interior of a neutron star where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] Dey, J., Bandyopadhyay, A., Gupta, A., Pujari, N., & Ghosh, S.

          "description": "The equation of state (EoS) at finite baryon chemical potential remains an elusive target for direct lattice QCD calculations, constituting a highly challenging topic. To address this issue, we have developed a novel Deep-learning quasi-parton model, which is constructed using three deep neural networks, to capture the fundamental properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Each neural network represents three distinct quasi-particle masses that are contingent upon the temperature (T) and baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$). The resulting EoS derived from the quasi-particle model demonstrates strong agreement with lattice QCD results using Taylor expansion techniques. This provides a robust framework for approximating the EoS of QCD matter at finite baryon chemical potentials, thereby enhancing our theoretical understanding of QCD matter under extreme conditions.",

Recent findings challenge the traditional view of nuclei as fixed configurations, revealing that nuclear deformation—characterized by shape parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$—can lead to multiple configurations. We distinguish between three scenarios: type A, where two distinct separate shapes correspond to specific states, and type B, where differently deformed shapes mix into a given state, and other extreme cases (EC) where the potential well is low such that we cannot distinguish between type A and B. Utilizing a two-state mixing model and observables such as electric quadrupole $B(E2)$ and monopole $\\rho(E0)$ transitions, we analyze the relationship between low- and high-energy nuclear structure transitions. For this means, we use a mixture distribution highlighting the role of shape coexistence in nuclear dynamics. We show that shape coexistence observables are a linear combination of canonical observables  $\\alpha_i\\mathcal{O}(\\beta_2^{(i)})$, with $\\alpha_i$ being the different state level possibilities measured by two mixing model. We find that the mixing interaction of bound states leads to an enhancement in the observables such that $\\mathcal{O}_{A}<\\mathcal{O}_{EC}<\\mathcal{O}_{B}$. Furthermore, we show that the shape fluctuation is a spacial case where we either have only one minimum or a maximally mixing of bound states. Consequently, this work enhances our understanding of nuclear structure and its evolution across energy regimes, providing a coherent framework for interpreting experimental results in high-energy nuclear physics.",

          "description": "We present a calculation of the spin alignment for unflavored vector mesons in thermalized quark-gluon plasma based on the Kubo formula in linear response theory. This is achieved by expanding the system to the first order of the coupling constant and the spatial gradient. The effect strongly relies on the vector meson’s spectral functions which are determined by the interaction and medium properties. The spectral functions are calculated for the one-quark-loop self-energy with meson-quark interaction. The numerical results show that the correction to the spin alignment from the thermal shear tensor is of the order 10^−4 ∼ 10^−5 for the chosen values of quark-meson coupling constant, if the magnitude of thermal shear tensor is 10^−2.",

We initialize the QCD medium in a gluon-dominated state and account dynamically for chemical equilibration during the hydrodynamic phase through time-dependent fugacities. We present results from complete heavy-ion collision simulations using this model, showing that hadronic and electromagnetic observables are sensitive to quark equilibration times. We examine the effects of strange flavor equilibration on strange hadron production and explore the impact of quark chemical equilibration on QGP transport properties. Additionally, we present preliminary results from a Bayesian model-to-data comparison aimed at simultaneously constraining equilibration times and transport coefficients of the QGP.",

          "description": "Despite the success of hydrodynamic models in describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions, questions persist about their regime of validity. Non-linear causality conditions provide a clear criterion for assessing the applicability of models. If the evolution of a system violates causality, it cannot reliably represent the underlying relativistic theory. It is now known that state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations enter an acausal regime, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological consequences of enforcing causality constraints in modern Bayesian parameter estimations of heavy-ion collisions. We find that, while only a small fraction of the system’s energy typically enters an acausal regime at the onset of hydrodynamic evolution, strictly limiting this fraction impacts the inferred initial conditions of the system. This leads to notable shifts in the preferred parameters for QGP properties, including a substantial reduction in the favored values of bulk viscosity. These results underscore the importance of refining theoretical models of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions to ensure more accurate representations of QGP properties.\r\nBased on: arXiv:2409.17127",

          "description": "In recent years, analyses using RHIC-BES data have been actively conducted to explore the high baryon number density region in the QCD phase diagram. Meanwhile, even in high-energy collisions, such as RHIC and LHC energies, the presence of high baryon number density matter in the forward rapidity region has been suggested [1]. This implies that, in addition to the analysis of BES data, a rapidity scan—analyzing data along the collision axis in such high-energy collisions—could serve as complementary ways to explore the high baryon number density region in the phase diagram. However, a model that provides a comprehensive description of the collision, from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ and from midrapidity to forward rapidity, is essential for precise studies of the rapidity scan. Furthermore, since it is not at all trivial whether the produced matter has reached equilibrium in the forward rapidity region, a model capable of describing the dynamical evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components is required.\r\n\r\nThe state-of-the-art dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI) model [2] is a novel framework that dynamically describes the space-time evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components including their interactions. Consequently, it has a great success in comprehensively describing experimental data of high-energy collisions from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ at midrapidity. Thus, the DCCI model would be a strong candidate for rapidity scan studies. In this study, we extended the DCCI model by including baryon number current within the ideal hydrodynamics and modeled the dynamical deposition of baryon number into the fluid, enabling us to describe a gradual thermalization process of baryon number alongside the fluid formation through the dynamical initialization. Using this model, we aimed to clarify the baryon number distribution of each core (equilibrium) and corona (non-equilibrium) component across the entire system at the LHC energy. Specifically, we determined which regions of the QCD phase diagram are accessible with the rapidity scan at the LHC energy and showed which rapidity regions of high-energy collisions are comparable to the baryon number densities achieved in low-energy collisions. This study strongly supports the existence of high baryon number density as equilibrated matter in the forward rapidity region at the LHC energy.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Li and J. I. Kapusta, Phys. Rev.

The comprehensive data collected by NA61/SHINE during a two-dimensional scan in beam momentum and system size allow for a systematic search for the critical point - a search for a non-monotonic dependence of various correlation and fluctuation observables on collision energy and size of colliding nuclei.\r\n\r\nIntermittency analysis, a statistical tool employed in heavy ion collisions, studies scaled factorial moments (SFMs) of multiplicity distributions in 2D transverse momentum space. This method helps detect power-law fluctuations and probe different aspects of the QCD phase diagram. While proton intermittency has been traditionally used to locate the critical point, recent efforts have extended this analysis to negatively charged hadrons to gain further insights into QCD interactions.\r\n\r\nThis contribution presents an overview of the results obtained from proton intermittency in Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb interactions and negatively charged hadron intermittency analyses in Xe+La interactions. The presentation will cover methodologies used to address the impact of background noise and the effects of short-range correlations, which may produce misleading power-law signals.",

          "description": "We study the evolution of the spin alignment of neutral $\\rho$ mesons in a pion gas using spin kinetic or Boltzmann equations. The $\\rho\\pi\\pi$ coupling is given by the chiral effective theory. The collision terms at the leading and next-to-leading order in spin Boltzmann equations are derived. The evolution of the spin density matrix of the neutral $\\rho$ meson is simulated with different initial conditions. The numerical results show that the interaction of pions and neutral $\\rho$ mesons creates very small spin alignment in the central rapidity region if there is no $\\rho$ meson in the system at the initial time. Such a small spin alignment in the central rapidity region will decay rapidly toward zero in later time. If there are $\\rho$ mesons with a sizable spin alignment at the initial time the spin alignment will also decrease rapidly. We studied the effect on $\\rho_{00}$ from the elliptic flow of pions in the blast wave model. With vanishing spin alignment at the initial time, the deviation of $\\rho_{00}$ from 1/3 is positive but very small.The effect of tensor polarizations of $\\rho$ mesons on $\\gamma$ correlator observables for CME has also been investigated.",

We show that in central collisions the resulting thermal vorticity configuration effectively manifests as the formation of two vortex rings in the forward and backward rapidity regions. As a result, the local polarization of $\\Lambda$ hyperons exhibits an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the azimuthal angle, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the collision system. In contrast, in non-central collisions, the directed flow significantly alters this pattern, preventing full cancellation of the opposing contributions to the polarization and resulting in a non-zero global polarization, highlighting the polarization sensitivity to the collision geometry and collective flow. We propose the measurement of the azimuthal-angle dependence of local polarization with respect to the reaction plane as a novel probe to investigate the internal structure and evolution of the fireball in central and semi-central heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Various approaches to exploring QCD Equation of State (EoS) using modern machine learning/deep learning techniques are presented. In the first part, various existing experimental measurements are used in a Bayesian framework [1] to constrain the density dependent potentials in UrQMD [2] for densities from 2 to 6 times saturation densities ($n_0$). It is shown that while the observables used in the study tightly constrain the EoS from 2- 4.5 $n_0$, the constraints on the EoS beyond 3 $n_0$ are highly sensitive to the choice of observations, highlighting the importance of future experiments.\r\nThe second part discusses novel AI based analysis techniques for next generation experiments. We show that DL based models can accurately identify different types of QCD transitions, directly using experimental information such as hits/tracks of particles in the detectors [3]. These methods outperform conventional methods and can be used in experiments for online event characterisation or analysis. We also present a more robust approach using generative models. A point cloud diffusion model capable of ultra fast generation of event-by-event collision output is presented [4]. The model is able to generate realistic collision events with 26 distinct hadron types. The model can be used as a versatile alternative to conventional surrogate models such as the Gaussian process, for a comprehensive Bayesian inference. By being differentiable, such methods can also be directly used for various inverse problems or parameter estimation tasks in experiments. The point cloud representation also makes the model easily adaptable not only to other model calculations or for detector simulations but also in other fields such as cosmic ray air shower simulations.\r\n\r\n[1] Omana Kuttan, M., Steinheimer, J., Zhou, K., & Stoecker, H., QCD Equation of State of Dense Nuclear Matter from a Bayesian Analysis of Heavy-Ion Collision Data.

          "description": "We study the finite temperature equation of state by using an effective lagrangian in which a dilaton field reproduces the breaking of scale symmetry in QCD. \r\nWe start by extending a previous investigation in the pure gauge sector $SU(3)_c$  [1], where the dynamics of the gluon condensate, expressed in terms of a dilaton lagrangian, is dominated below the critical phase transition temperature by the dilaton field, while at greater temperatures the condensate evaporates in the form of quasi-free gluons. \r\nIn this context, we study the role of the thermal fluctuations of the dilaton field, through the  technique proposed in Ref.s  [2,3]. This approach  enables the reproduction of the lattice QCD results for the  thermodynamic quantities such as pressure and energy [4].\r\nMoreover, we have extended the study to the equation of state with additional degrees of freedom, namely the $\\sigma$, $\\pi$, $\\omega$ and $\\rho$ mesons and nucleons, at finite chemical potential by means of an effective lagrangian which incorporates broken scale in addition to explicitly broken chiral symmetry [5,6]. \r\nBeyond the mean-field approximation, we study the relevance of the thermal fluctuations of the scalar glueball, other than the contribution of the $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ meson fields, and investigate the thermodynamic nature of the phase transition.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] A.

          "description": "The global spin alignment of the vector meson has been observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, but its theoretical origin is still on hot debates. Here we propose to apply the light front framework to explain this phenomenon since the light front form explicitly describes the hadron spin including both the quark spin and the orbital angular momentum. After applying the light front spinor, the spin alignment in the polarization of vector mesons with ρ00 > 1/3 can be naturally manifested and in particular, the obtained spin alignment for ϕ meson is in good agreement with the experimental data. This implies that to explain the spin alignment, it is important to properly include the contribution from the gluon interactions that are presented in terms of the orbital angular momentum of the hadron bound state.\r\n\r\n[1] B.

          "description": "Neutrino transport plays a critical role in the evolution of neutron star mergers and the cooling of neutron stars. In this work, the quark core in a hybrid star is modeled with a three-flavor NJL-type model that allows for color superconductivity ([arXiv:2408.06704][1]). The rich phase structure of dense quark matter heavily influences neutrino transport.\tWe calculate the direct Urca  neutrino opacities of quark matter in the unpaired and in the two-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase. At low temperatures, the contribution of the gapped quarks can be neglected and we show how the self-consistently calculated quark masses determine the density-window in which the direct Urca process is kinematically allowed. While the direct Urca window for the process $\\nu+d\\to u + e^-$ is closed at $T=0$, the process $\\nu+s\\to u + e^-$ has a direct Urca threshold. To investigate the scenario of neutron star mergers, in which the temperature rises to 50-100 MeV, we take into account pair-breaking effects in the 2SC phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06704",

To this end we employ Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE) in a 2+1 flavor scenario that has been tested successfully elsewhere in the QCD phase diagram. The equation of state for quark-gluon matter can be used as input for the hydrostatic equilibrium equation of cold neutron stars. Two paths were explored for the calculations. First, employing an effective action expansion derived by functional methods, the pressure at finite and zero chemical potential can be compared or, second, the number density can be calculated and further integrated to yield the pressure. The latter option has already been proved useful in computing quark and baryon number fluctuations at finite temperature. Both methods are compared and some physical consequences are discussed.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to probe the deformation of colliding nuclei. The quadrupole deformation parameter ($\\beta_2$) has been extensively studied through the flow coefficient $v_2$ in such collisions, as well as through low-energy measurements of the electric quadrupole transition probabilities, B(E2). In contrast, the hexadecapole deformation ($\\beta_4$) has often been neglected in modeling heavy-ion collisions, primarily due to large experimental and theoretical uncertainties. In this poster, we present measurements of the non-linear response coefficient between $v_4$ and $v_2$, ($\\chi_{4,22}$), in Au+Au and U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 193 GeV, respectively. A deviation from 1 of the ratio of $\\chi_{4,22}$ between U+U and Au+Au collisions would suggest sizeable hexadecapole deformation in Uranium-238. These results will be compared with iEBE-VISHNU hydrodynamic and AMPT model studies, which incorporate the $\\beta_4$ value of Uranium-238 from nuclear structure theory calculations.",

          "description": "Two-particle correlation functions of hadrons are sensitive to mechanisms of particle production and transport in elementary particle collisions. The production of quarks is determined by coupling terms of the QCD Lagrangian. These nominally conserves  quark flavors in addition to  energy, momentum, and electric charge:  flavor  currents are conserved  at the level of quarks and gluons. The production of quarks with flavor $\\rm f$ must then be balanced by the production of anti-quarks with anti-flavor $\\rm \\bar f$. Given flavor conversion $\\rm f\\rightarrow f'$ is governed by \\emph{weak} interaction processes, one can expect that the hadrons produced in the final state of A-A collisions is also flavor balanced. Indeed, one expects that the breaking of flavor balancing should be approximately limited to weak processes occurring on  a time scale longer than the lifetime of the QGP produced in A--A collisions. That implies that one can study competing processes of particle production and their subsequent transport based flavor correlation functions. Charge and strangeness  balance functions have been measured at SPS, RHIC, and LHC. In  this phenomenological study, the usefulness of flavor balancing measurements based on  two-particle correlation functions is explored based on simulations of  proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV with the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator. Flavor  balancing is studied with a broad  variety of hadron pairs, such as $\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}-\\mathrm{K}^{-}$, $\\Lambda-\\bar{p}$, $\\Lambda-\\bar{\\Lambda}$, etc, to explore dependencies, in particular, on the number of balanced flavors in produced hadrons. \r\n\r\nPYTHIA describes the phenomenology of particle production in nuclear collisions with   2-to-2 parton scattering, multiple partonic interactions (MPI) and Lund String Fragmentation. Additional processes involving  Color Reconnection and Rope Hadronization have also been incorporated to better explain the experimental data observed in collider experiments. This work explores the effects of the MONASH tune with MPI Color Reconnection  on the the normalized two-particle number cumulant $R_{2}$, computed for several hadron pairs,  as a function of the multiplicity of $\\rm pp$ collisions. It is found that the amplitudes of the $R_{2}$ hadron correlation functions   increases monotonically with the number of balanced flavors in both minimum bias and multiplicity dependent analyses.  Mapping Pythia particle production mechanisms to the results of this study will shed light on the actual mechanisms in place in nuclear collision.",

          "description": "For cold, ultra-dense matter, color superconductivity is characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs of quarks through gluon exchange, yielding a frequency-dependent superconducting gap on the order of 100 MeV. Conversely, the phenomenon of confinement is characterized by the fundamental particles confined within hadrons at low to intermediate energies. In this regime, lattice QCD has shown that gluon two-point correlation functions in Landau gauge display a finite zero-momentum value, suggesting the dynamical generation of an infrared mass scale for the gluon and a nontrivial spectral structure.\r\nIn this work, we investigate how an infrared massive gluon might affect color superconductivity and use this phenomenon as a testing ground for confining models. In particular, we analyze superconductivity using a Yukawa model in which we replace the conventional bosonic propagator of the mediator with a confining propagator. This propagator has a structure similar to those found in Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ), Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ), and Curci-Ferrari models. In these models, the gluon includes an explicit mass parameter linked to nonperturbative effects and may exhibit nonstandard analytical structures, such as complex-conjugated poles. Considering low temperature and high chemical potentials, we derive the superconducting gap with frequency dependence. Our results reveal two phases in the system concerning the mass parameter: one phase exhibits superconductivity with a low-frequency peak, consistent with literature on color superconductivity (low-mass regime), while the other phase without superconductivity, displaying a \"plateau\" characteristic of BCS superconductivity in the point-like approximation (high-mass regime). Solving the integral gap equation we further observe a reduction in the superconducting gap across all confining models as the mass parameter increases. We also obtain results with renormalization group improvement in an infrared-safe scheme specifically for a massive Curci-Ferrari version of the gluon. Finally, we discuss the extension of this analysis to the gauge theory case.",

In particular, we measure the non-equilibrium behavior of the system under a quench protocol in which the symmetry-breaking external field is changed\r\nat a constant rate through the critical point. Using the well-established Kibble-Zurek scaling theory we compute non-equilibrium scaling functions of cumulants of the order parameter up to fourth order. Together with the static critical exponents and the dynamic critical exponent, these fully describe the universal non-equilibrium evolution of the system near the critical point. We further extend the analysis to include finite-size effects and observe good collapse of our data onto two-dimensional universal non-equilibrium and finite-size scaling functions.",

In this work, we investigate the stability of such phases within a low-energy effective theory, where the free energy F was calculated as the spatial derivative expansion of an order parameter Φ out of the Landau- Ginsburg-theory. We calculated equilibrium behaviour of the field through numerical simulations on in 2D, using lattice Monte-Carlo methods. In form of spatial modulations on the lattice, we found MOAT regime and inhomogeneous phase, in addition to the homogeneous symmetric and broken phases, following predictions from mean-field-theory. The analysis was made with the 2 point Correlation function and cluster-size distribution.",

          "description": "When the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) forms during high-energy collisions, the dimensions of the produced droplet are dependent on the overlap region of the colliding nuclei, enabling the QGP to encode information about the initial conditions of nuclear collisions and even the structure of the colliding nuclei. The system of particles produced in the final state exhibit collective behavior, and studying these dynamics can provide unique insight into such initial conditions of the collision. The collective azimuthal flow, quantified as $v_n$, can be used to study the shape of the overlap region. The mean transverse momentum, $\\left[ p_T \\right]$, additionally provides information about the initial size and energy of the system. The joint analysis of these two observables, characterized by the multi-particle cumulant $C(v_n^m, \\left[ p_T^k \\right])$, provides further information on the relationship between the initial size and shape, and therefore on the nuclear structure. Thus far, the focus has been on three-particle cumulants of this type, but this has proven limited in recent studies and the need for higher order cumulants has emerged, especially in the case of nuclear isotopes that lie within the region of a potential second-order shape phase transition such as $^{128-132}$Xe. In this poster, the algorithms required to calculate such higher order, multi-particle cumulants between $v_n$ and $\\left[ p_T \\right]$ are presented explicitly for the first time, formulated using an advanced framework. The use of these cumulants as a measure of collective dynamics is then demonstrated using the parton transport model for Xe-Xe collisions at the LHC.",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, the differences in shape between the positive and negative pion transverse momentum spectra at low $p_T$ can be used to study the Coulomb final-state interaction. The charged pions, as the most abundantly produced and lightest species, are the particles most strongly influenced by the Coulomb field generated by the positive net-charge of the stopped participant protons. The effects of the Coulomb interaction on charged pion production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.4 GeV are investigated. From the $\\pi^{\\pm}$ transverse momentum spectra measured with HADES experiment, the negative-to-positive pion ratios as a function of transverse momentum are obtained and used to analyze the Coulomb interaction. The “coulomb kick” (a momentum change due to Coulomb interaction) and initial pion ratio for different rapidity intervals were obtained. In order to study the non-equilibrium degree of these collisions, the $p_T$ spectra are studied using Tsallis distribution as a parametrization. The rapidity dependence of the Tsallis fit parameters, Tsallis temperature, and non-extensivity parameter, a parameter characterizing the degree of non-equilibrium for the system produced in these collisions will be presented. These results are connected with the kinetic freeze-out dynamics.",

Since KøMPøST is based on the dynamics of a kinetic theory description to implement a macroscopic evolution of the energy-momentum tensor, we assess its applicability by comparing KøMPøST results to fully microscopic calculations in kinetic theory in  the relaxation time approximation (RTA)~[2].  We find that KøMPøST accurately describes the full 2+1D evolution of the energy-momentum tensor in the pre-equilibrium stage with the exception of the components related to elliptic flow. We investigate possible error sources and  attempt to modify KøMPøST in order to bring it into agreement with the full kinetic theory solution.\r\n[1] KoMPoST, Phys.Rev.C 99 (2019) 3, 034910\r\n[2] Ambrus, Werthmann, Schlichting, \"[Opacity dependence of transverse flow, preequilibrium, and applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions][a]\" Phys.Rev.D 107 (2023) 9, 094013\r\n\r\n\r\n  [a]: https://inspirehep.net/literature/2601272",

          "description": "The initial condition in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is sensitive to the nuclear structure of the colliding nuclei. Experimental observations in U+U and isobar collisions have revealed nuclear structure effects, such as deformation or neutron skin. For smaller colliding systems such as $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne collisions, where the number of nucleons is limited, cluster models are typically used to describe the nuclear structure. We study the $5\\alpha$ and $\\alpha$+$^{16}$O cluster structure inside $^{20}$Ne within the microscopic Brink cluster model. Our study presents a full analytical calculation of eccentricities $\\varepsilon_{n}$ and $\\varepsilon_{n}$-related observables in most central Ne+Ne collisions. We demonstrate that the normalized symmetric cumulant $\\rm NSC(3,2)$ and the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho (\\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\\delta d_{\\perp}/d_{\\perp} )$ can enable us to study which potential cluster configuration is more significant in $^{20}$Ne. Our findings offer a novel strategy for identifying cluster structures inside $^{20}$Ne through the future Ne+Ne collision experiment at the LHC.",

          "description": "In high energy nuclear collisions, the majority of the charm and beauty quark production occurs via perturbative hard scattering on a short timescales and undergoes transport through a medium (which depends on the system), experiencing drag, diffusion, scattering, or recombination into bound states. Investigating these processes requires methods sensitive to both the production cross section and transport effects. Balance functions, first developed at RHIC and now used at the LHC, are statistical observables that measure correlations between particle pairs,  capturing the final snapshot of accumulated charge-dependent interactions. Early-stage quarks have more time to separate, leading to a broader balance function, while late emission allows less time for separation, resulting in narrower correlations. Shifts in the \\( \\Delta \\phi \\) offers insights into the medium's expansion rate relative to particle initial momentum. \r\n\\newline\r\n\\newline\r\nHeavy-flavor hadrons can provide insights into pre{-}hadronization effects, while light hadrons tend to have their initial parton-level correlations diluted. We propose exploring the possibility of measuring balance functions for particle pairs, including charm particles, in pp collisions with PYTHIA, with the particle pairs to be studied including $ \\mathrm{p}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\Lambda}_c^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\Lambda}^0 $, $ \\mathrm{\\Omega}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{D}^{\\pm} $, $ \\mathrm{\\pi}^{\\pm} $, and $ \\mathrm{K}^{\\pm} $, to distinguish baryon number transport from electric charge effects. With Run 3 data, studying these observables in small systems is  feasible. PYTHIA simulates both perturbative and non perturbative QCD effects in pp collisions, including  multiparton interaction, color reconnection, and junction formation, impacting baryon transport through color line rearrangements. Mechanisms like shoving and ropes further modify balance functions by affecting final-state correlations. This study aims to compare the findings with competing models, including those that adopt a thermal approach, to assess their effectiveness in describing these correlations.",

          "description": "In high-energy physics, accurately predicting cross sections of reaction processes relies heavily on the parton fragmentation functions (FFs). Conventional methods often require parameterized forms and additional calculations to ensure the FFs conform to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations, which can be cumbersome and may not fully capture the complexity of FFs across varying energy scales. Here, we introduce a novel approach to determining parton fragmentation functions using a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not require prior parameterized forms and directly integrates the DGLAP evolution equations into the neural network architecture, allowing the FFs to automatically satisfy these equations without additional calculations. We present new sets of parton FFs obtained for hadrons in electron-positron annihilation processes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in pQCD using this innovative technique. To validate our approach, we calculate proton-(anti)proton hadron spectra using the extracted FFs and demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align well with experimental data across various energy scales ($\\sqrt{s}$ = 130, 200, 500, 630, 900, 1800, 2760, 5020, 5440, 7000 GeV). Our findings indicate that the PINN method not only simplifies the extraction process but also enhances the universal applicability of FFs across different energy scales. By eliminating the need for parameterized forms and additional DGLAP evolution, our approach represents a significant step forward in the field, paving the way for more robust and versatile predictions in high-energy physics, including the potential exploration of new research avenues in heavy ion collisions.",

The analysis of transverse momentum spectra of produced particles provide insights into the particle production mechanisms as well as the freeze-out conditions of the system created in these collisions. We present the study of the kinetic freeze-out properties of non-strange hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $\\rm p$, $\\overline{\\rm p}$, d, $\\overline{\\rm d}$) along with strange hadrons ( (${\\rm K}^{0}_{\\rm{S}}$, $\\rm \\Lambda$, $\\rm \\overline{\\Lambda}$, $\\rm \\Xi^{-}$, $\\rm \\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$, $\\phi$, $\\rm \\Omega^{-}$, and $\\rm \\overline{\\Omega}^{+}$) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC-BES energies. The energy and centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters, i.e., kinetic freeze-out temperature and collective flow velocity, extracted using the Blast-Wave model, for non-strange and strange hadrons will be presented. The average transverse momentum $<p_T>$ of strange hadrons as a function of system centrality and reduced hadron mass, $m/n_{q}$, will be also presented. We observe in central Au-Au collisions that $<p_T>$ as a function of reduced mass is higher for baryons than that for mesons, although it increases linearly with $m/n_{q}$. However, for peripheral events, there is an approximate scaling of average $p_T$ with the reduced hadron mass. These results will be compared with AMPT simulations, default and string-melting versions, in order to understand the importance of partonic degrees of freedom in collectivity observables.",

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is one of the experimental pillars at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). \r\nThe Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the central detector for track reconstruction and momentum measurement. It is designed to measure heavy ion collisions at interaction rates up to $10~MHz$. It comprises approximately 900 double-sided silicon strip sensors with 1024 strips per side, arranged in 8 tracking stations in a magnetic field of $1~Tm$.\r\n \r\nIn the context of the FAIR Phase-0 program, the mCBM setup at SIS18/GSI is a small-scale precursor of the full CBM experiment. It consists of pre-series productions of all major CBM detector subsystems, aiming to verify CBM's concepts of free-streaming readout electronics, data transport, and online reconstruction. The mini-STS (mSTS) setup consists of 11 sensors arranged in 2 stations and no magnetic field.\r\n\r\nHeavy ion collisions in the $1-2~AGeV/c$ range were measured with an average collision rate of $500~kHz$. The primary and secondary vertexes are reconstructed using the two layers of the mSTS detector, with tracks reconstructed as straight lines. Hit reconstruction efficiency was estimated using correlations with downstream detectors. This contribution will present the performance of hit, track, and vertex reconstruction from measurements of heavy ion collisions.",

          "description": "Recently, it has been shown that investigating the structure of atomic nuclei is essential for correct description of fluctuations imprinted into the initial stage of a heavy-ion collision event. In fact, the examination of the $N$-body density distributions has shown to be crucial for better understanding deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) and nucleus-nucleus collisions [1].\r\nMotivated by the recent interest to represent quantitatively the structure properties of the incoming nuclei, we present a new sampling algorithm which takes on account quantum correlations of the nuclear many-body wave function. Using the nuclear shell model (NSM) as a proof of concept model, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method algorithm was implemented in order to generate nucleon positions, according to the full $N$-nucleon probability distribution. We benchmark it by comparing our numerical results to the analytic one- and two-body densities. By using this algorithm, quantum correlations in the nucleus are then imprinted into the positions. Additionally, the usage of the NSM permits the extension of this algorithm to large systems, such as Au and Pb, which are still prohibitively expensive for full $\\textit{ab-initio}$ computations.\r\nWe explore the impact of these new sources of fluctuation on the creation of long-range correlations by exploring initial state observables sensitive to the $N$-body densities, such as the initial eccentricities, extracted from the novel McDIPPER model [2].",

          "description": "Stochastic hydrodynamics provides a dynamical framework for the evolution of fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions. Due to the small volume of the system, thermal fluctuations can become sizeable and probe the equation of state of the system, being particularly sensitive to a possible QCD critical endpoint.\r\nOur present numerical setup can simulate stochastic non-relativistic hydrodynamics in a box, taking only equations of state and transport coefficients as input parameters. Fluctuations are sampled in a Metropolis update step. Since the acceptance probability depends specifically on the change in entropy, the setup is particularly stable and robust to the typical problem of unphysical entropy production. Additionally, approximations or microscopic assumptions about the fluctuations are not necessary.\r\nApart from the details of the numerical setup, we present macroscopic and microscopic numerical test cases for equilibration properties and fluctuation-dissipation relations, as well as an outlook on renormalization of transport coefficients and the extension to stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics.",

          "description": "The Silicon Tracking System (STS) in the upcoming heavy-ion CBM experiment is tailored for an unprecedented 10 MHz beam-target interaction rate. A unique integration strategy was employed to maintain a material budget within 2 - 8\\% $X_0$ while ensuring ample granularity, spatial precision, and timing accuracy. The read-out electronics sit external to the sensitive volume, connected to double-sided double-metal silicon sensors through ultra-thin micro cables. Each double-sided silicon strip sensor is connected to two Front-End Boards (FEBs), featuring eight custom-designed STS-XYTER ASICs (SMX) per FEB.\r\n\r\nPost-assembly, rigorous quality control tests, including time and amplitude calibration of all module ASICs, ensure reliable performance, operational refinement, and accurate data interpretation. Operating at room temperature to -20 °C (coolant) and -10 °C (effective), FEBs undergo mechanical stress due to temperature fluctuations. The burn-in test exposes modules to varying temperatures and power cycles, identifying weaknesses and evaluating electronics robustness and module functionality.\r\n\r\nPost-testing, modules are affixed to carbon fiber ladders, hosting up to 10 modules each, and undergo further assessments to verify sustained functionality and performance. This study outlines the status and outcomes of tests on the modules and ladders of the STS detector's series production, providing valuable insights into its development and performance capabilities.",

          "description": "The nucleon density distribution within colliding nuclei is typically modeled using the two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. This conventional approach overlooks the fine radial structures arising from the quantal shell filling patterns of protons and neutrons. In this study, we incorporate these fine radial variations by utilizing density profiles from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional theory. We extensively compare the WS parametrization with detailed radial profiles across nuclei possessing qualitatively different density distributions. Our analysis reveals consistent deviations in heavy-ion observables—such as initial eccentricity and participant distributions—that cannot be captured by simply readjusting WS parameters. These deviations exhibit similar behaviors across different nuclei and depend on collision centrality and specific observables. The exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to initial state variations offers a promising avenue to detect these fine radial effects. Our findings complement studies on nuclear deformation effects and highlight the necessity of incorporating realistic nuclear density profiles in advanced hydrodynamic simulations and in the extraction of the quark-gluon plasma's transport properties.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Z.

          "description": "Virtual photons emitted from heavy-ion collisions preserve essential information about the fireball, where high baryon densities induce significant medium effects on the spectral function of vector mesons.\r\nWhile short-lived $\\rho$ mesons predominantly decay within the fireball, radiating thermal dileptons, a substantial fraction of $\\omega$ mesons decay outside the fireball due to their longer lifetime. These decays contribute to the freeze-out cocktail with the vacuum line shape of the vector mesons. High-statistics data from Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.55$ GeV, measured by the HADES collaboration, may allow for the isolation of these two different contributions and enable studies of in-medium modifications of the $\\omega$ meson spectral function in the experimental data.\r\nThis poster presents a framework that describes the vector meson freeze-out contributions using the shining method, while the thermal dilepton spectrum is determined via the coarse-graining model. By combining these two approaches, we aim to achieve a precise theoretical description of the invariant mass spectrum of thermal dileptons in heavy-ion collisions within the few GeV energy range. Our results will be compared with the available data from HADES.",

Using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework and the dipole picture for vector meson production, we examine the coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections' dependencies on momentum transfer in the dilute and dense limits.

          "description": "The measurements of Lambda transverse polarization, i.e. the polarization in the direction transverse to the lambda production plane, have a long history. The unexpected observation of significant Lambda hyperon polarization in inclusive p+p and p+A collisions using unpolarized beams triggered theoretical efforts to describe this effect. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the origin of hyperon polarization. Several models have successfully explained the behavior of some hyperons, but none have been able to account for the behavior of the entire hyperon family.\r\n\r\nNA61/SHINE is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS with large acceptance and high particle identification capabilities. The first feasibility studies have shown that the properties of the magnetic field used by NA61/SHINE, together with high statistics of collected p+p collisions at beam momentum 158 GeV/c, offer possibilities to study Lambda polarization in several bins of pT and xF. Current studies concentrate on the extraction of Lambda yields based on an invariant mass distribution of selected pairs of proton and negatively charged pion.

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is an upcoming fixed target experiment being built at the Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR).\r\nThe CBM experiment is designed to characterize the QCD medium at high net baryon densities and moderate temperatures.\r\nDi-electrons interact electromagnetically and are unaffected by strong medium effects.\r\nHence, they are used as a penetrating probe to understand the QCD medium produced in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. \r\nThe identification of electrons with minimal pion contamination is crucial for these kinds of investigations.\r\nThe CBM experiment uses a Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) in combination with a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) for electron-pion separation, and a Time of Flight \r\n(TOF) detector for identification of other high-mass hadrons.\r\n\r\nThe current RICH reconstruction algorithm employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a conventional electron identifier, which utilizes ring and track parameters as inputs.\r\nIn a recent upgrade, a new XGBoost model was implemented, adding additional input features, replacing the conventional ANN.\r\nThe output of the RICH XGBoost model serves as a probability measure for selecting electrons.\r\nSimilarly, TRD and TOF have their own measures for the electron identification.\r\nCurrently, a global electron identifier using the information from RICH, TRD, and TOF is developed using tree-based ensemble models.\r\nA momentum independent training strategy is used to train the model, as it is foreseen to work for different collision energies (Au-Au systems up to 11 AGeV beam energy) and centralities.\r\n\r\nThis contribution will focus on the design aspects and performance analysis of the global electron identifier model with corresponding feature optimization.\r\n\r\n$^*$This work is supported by BMBF (05P21PXFC1, 05P24PX1).",

On the experimental side, RHIC has successfully completed the second phase of its beam energy scan programme, covering the center-of-mass energy from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV to 19.6 GeV. This energy interval corresponds to the values of the baryonic chemical potential from $\\mu_B \\sim$ 750 down to about 200 MeV. Future experiment CBM at FAIR, on the other hand will focus on the energy region $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.5 GeV to 4.9 GeV corresponding to the chemical potential interval 800 $\\ge \\mu_B \\ge$ 500 MeV. In order to understand the energy dependence of the higher order cumulants  of the proton number distribution and to provide a non-critical baseline for measurements in the high net baryon density region, especially at the CBM energy range, we have performed systematic simulations of Au+Au collisions with the hadronic transport model UrQMD. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will report the results on the rapidity coverage and centrality dependence of the cumulant ratios $\\kappa_{3}/\\kappa_{1}, \\kappa_{4}/\\kappa_{2}, \\kappa_{5}/\\kappa_{1}$ and $\\kappa_{6}/\\kappa_{2}$ for collision energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.5 - 9.2 GeV. The resulting baselines will be compared with the corresponding measurements from the STAR experiment. In doing so, we will ensure that the collision centrality is determined in the same way as in the experimental data. The artifacts of volume/participant fluctuations on the  measured cumulants will also be discussed.",

          "description": "The measurement of strangeness production is a key tool for understanding the hot, dense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The production of strange hadrons is enhanced in heavy-ion collisions due to thermal gluon saturation, while it is suppressed in small systems due to canonical suppression, as supported by canonical models. Despite being one of the earliest signatures of quark-gluon plasma formation, the strangeness enhancement is in debate till today. Hadronic resonances like \\(\\rho(770)^0\\), \\(K^*(890)^0\\), \\(\\phi(1020)\\), \\(\\Lambda(1520)\\), and \\(\\Xi(1530)^0\\) are sensitive probes of the hadronic phase, the stage between chemical and kinetic freeze-out. Their yields, relative to stable particles, alter with collision centrality depending on their lifetimes, and offer insights into the properties of hadronic phase. Moreover, baryon-to-meson ratios provide valuable information on different production mechanisms involved in their formation, which further requires theoretical exploration. This study presents the ratio of strange to non-strange hadrons, resonance-to-non-resonance ratios, hadronic phase lifetime estimates, and baryon-to-meson  \\(\\it{p}_{T}\\) differential ratios in pp collisions at \\(\\sqrt{\\it{s}} = 13.6\\) TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at \\(\\sqrt{\\it{s}_{\\text{NN}}} = 5.36\\) TeV using the EPOS4 hydrodynamical model, the highest energies recorded at the LHC, offering a basis for future data comparisons.",

The observation of these phenomena, which are expected to exist only in large systems (e.g., Pb$-$Pb and Xe$-$Xe), require further investigations to understand the origin of observed collectivity in small systems and its modeling in Monte Carlo simulations.\\par\r\nLHC RUN 3 has a plan for $\\rm{^{16}}$O$-$$\\rm{^{16}}$O and p$-$$\\rm{^{16}}$O collisions at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV and 9.9 TeV respectively. O-O collisions have multiplicity range overlapping with both p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions. The transition of apparent collectivity from large to small systems will be better understood in a region of similar multiplicity density between $\\rm{^{16}}$O$-$$\\rm{^{16}}$O and Pb$-$Pb. \\par \r\nIn present work, we utilize JETSCAPE framework to study the anisotropic flow coefficients ($\\rm{v_{n}}$) of identified particles produced in $\\rm{^{16}}$O$-$$\\rm{^{16}}$O collisions at $\\rm{\\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV.",

          "description": "The use of neural networks in high-energy physics has rapidly expanded, particularly in jet tagging applications. This study explores two parallel methods, both leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify jets produced in high-energy collisions by differentiating between heavy quark (charm, bottom), light quark (up, down, strange), and gluon jets. The first method constructs image-like representations based on the kinematics of charged decay products, allowing CNNs to analyze visual patterns characteristic of each jet type. The second approach utilizes Energy Flow Polynomials (EFPs) as structured input features to encode jets' energy distribution and substructure, feeding this data into CNNs to enhance classification. Both approaches independently demonstrate strong classification performance, highlighting the versatility of CNN architectures in jet tagging and advancing our understanding of jet substructures through complementary representations.",

          "description": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) at FAIR is designed to\r\nexplore the QCD phase diagram at high net baryon densities and moderate\r\ntemperatures by means of heavy ion collisions with energies from 2-11 AGeV beam energy (Au+Au collisions) and interaction rates up to 10 MHz, provided by the SIS100 accelerator. Leptons as penetrating probes not taking part in the strong interaction leave the fireball without being modified, thus carrying information from the dense baryonic matter. However, di-leptons are rare probes, therefore calling for high efficiency and high purity identification capabilities. In CBM, electron identification will be performed by a Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH), a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and a Time-of-Flight detector (ToF). In this poster, feasibility studies of di-electron spectroscopy from low mass vector meson decays for central collisions at 8 AGeV beam energy will be presented. Special emphasis is put on the application of Fast Simulations to achieve higher statistics for the rare di-electrons in order to evaluate the feasibility of e.g. measurement of the fireball temperature in the intermediate di-lepton mass region beyond 1 GeV/$c^2$.",

          "description": "Under the extreme conditions of relativistic heavy-ion-collisions hypernuclei are created with large abundancies. Hypernuclei measurements provide insights into the equation-of-state of hadronic matter at high net-baryon densities, as well as into hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-interactions. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt offers the ideal conditions to explore the production of hypernuclei. The excitation function of hypernuclei production is predicted to exhibit a maximum in the FAIR energy range. In combination with the foreseen high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, an exceptionally high statistics of hypernuclei will be collected and even very rare double hypernuclei like ${}^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}He$ are expected with sizeable statistics. \r\n\r\nFor the evaluation of the CBM performance with respect to hypernuclei measurements their reconstruction in the 3-body decay channels is especially important as, e.g., it is assumed that the rare ${}^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}He$ can decay into three daughters. To evaluate performance indicators like efficiency and signal-to-background ratio as well as the systematic uncertainties of this type of decay, $^{3}_{\\Lambda}H\\rightarrow d+p+\\pi^-$, which is abundant enough to provide robust results, was studied in detail. Systematical uncertainties were estimated based on simulations with different transport models (e.g. PHQMD), taking into account the extrapolation of the measurements to the full rapidity and transverse momentum range, as well as possible systematic effects of the reconstruction procedures. The experimental sensitivity to properties of hypernuclei, such as their lifetime, was evaluated. In addition, performance studies on the improvement of the reconstruction of ${}^{5}_{\\Lambda}He$ by using information provided by the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) will be shown. \r\n\r\nWork supported by DFG-grant BL 982/3-1 and BMBF-grant 05P21RFFC3.",

          "description": "Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars.  Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm.  This large $\\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\\Lambda \\text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights into the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.",

          "description": "Energy-energy correlators and their three point counterpart have recently been of great interest to the heavy ion jet community as they directly provide the virtuality scale and are relatively simple to calculate. Recent measurements of the two point correlator in PbPb collisions compared to pp collisions by CMS show interesting trends, even when accounting for the energy loss causing a shift in virtuality. This talk will present results from a systematic Monte Carlo study using PYTHIA as a vacuum reference and adding ANGANTYR for the underlying event. This study highlights the impact of uncorrelated particles and how they can be removed via ensemble-based background subtraction. We then incorporate energy loss with various models (e.g. JEWEL and JETSCAPE) at RHIC energies to investigate the potential of disentangling the different in-medium effects within the ENCs. Finally, we include detector effects and discuss the feasibility of observing these medium effects at sPHENIX and STAR.",

          "description": "We will present results for the heavy quark, i.e. top-right, corner of the Columbia plot. They were derived using a 1-loop Polyakov loop potential in the center-symmetric Landau gauge, supplemented by a minimal (1 parameter), phenomenological, Curci-Ferrari extension to the Faddeev-Popov terms, which we employ to account for the effect of Gribov copies. This model has been validated in the pure Yang-Mills case, which gives results matching lattice simulations. A further test of the model includes whether it can accurately predict the behavior of QCD with heavy quarks, which we now found to be the case. We will present these findings, that suggest that the center-symmetric Curci-Ferrari model allows access to IR QCD physics. We will also discuss the dependence of our results on the choice of renormalization scheme and scale, which we verified to be small as part of the new work.",

          "description": "The dilepton production yield is sensitive to the nuclear density within the partonic and hadronic matter, which can be influenced by the initial states of the nuclei. The production of dileptons in the Au+Au and U+U collision systems is studied at relativistic heavy-ion collisions with different initial nuclear deformation profiles. Moreover, the contributions of dileptons from both quark-antiquark pairs in the partonic phase and $\\rho^0$-meson decay in the hadronic phase are considered. We compare the dilepton production with the STAR data in Au+Au collision system at 200 GeV and use these results as a baseline for the U+U systems. The difference in multiplicity distributions resulting from the different deformation factor $\\beta_2$, leads to a greater suppression of dilepton production in systems with a larger $|\\beta_2|$, especially in the most central collisions. It was found that the integrated dilepton yield from the partonic phase is more sensitive to the $|\\beta_2|$ than that from the $\\rho^0$ decay in the U+U system. Furthermore, it has a two-order polynomial function tendency as a function of $\\beta_2$ in both the low- and intermediate-mass regions of the dilepton, which can serve as a probe to extract the deformation factor of the Uranium nucleus.",

          "description": "The study of heavy quark (HQ) dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions at facilities like RHIC and LHC has provided crucial insights into QGP properties. Due to their large masses, HQs evolve over the QGP’s short lifetime while retaining information about their interaction with the medium. Typically, HQ evolution is studied using the Langevin equation under the assumption of normal diffusion, where mean-square displacement (MSD) increases linearly with time [1]. However, this approach fails to fully capture the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) simultaneously—a challenge known as the $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle [2].\r\n\r\nIn this work, we address heavy flavor $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle employing the anomalous (super-) diffusion of HQs in the QGP through a fractional Langevin equation (FLE) approach [3], considering a hydrodynamically expanding medium. Unlike the standard Langevin equation, the FLE replaces integer-order derivatives with Caputo fractional derivatives [4], allowing for a broader range of diffusion behaviours, including super-diffusion, where the MSD of HQs increases faster than linearly with time. This model is highly relevant for heavy particles moving through a complex medium like the QGP, where strong correlations and long-range interactions lead to memory effects in particle motion. Our results demonstrate that due to super-diffusion, the HQ energy loss is significantly enhanced in the QGP medium, captures the $R_{AA}$ correctly and contributes to higher values of elliptic flow as the strong interactions with the medium induce greater momentum anisotropy.\r\n\r\n\r\n1: M.

          "description": "We have estimated the induced electric field in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) due to its thermoelectric effects. At present, the relativistic heavy-ion collisions are capable of creating QGP, a locally thermalized medium composed of quarks and gluons. \r\nDuring the space-time evolution of the QGP medium, interesting thermoelectric phenomena occur due to the presence of electrically charged particles (quarks) in the QGP medium. These phenomena result in the generation of an electromagnetic (EM) field within the medium, even in central heavy-ion collisions. In peripheral collisions, the presence of a spectator current at the early stage generates a transient magnetic field and disrupts the isotropy of the induced electric field. For numerical estimation of the induced electric field, we used a quasiparticle-based model that incorporates the lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) equation of state (EoS) for QGP. The cooling rates used in our calculations are derived from Gubser hydrodynamic flow, while the thermoelectric coefficients—such as Seebeck, magneto-Seebeck, and Nernst coefficients—are crucial for estimating the induced electric field. Furthermore, we explore the effects of an external time-varying magnetic field on the induced electric field and also consider the quantum effects of Landau quantization. Our findings reveal that the space-time profile of the induced electric field is zero at the center and increases away from the center. During the early stages of QGP evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of approximately $eE \\approx 1~m_\\pi^2$, which gradually weakens over time.",

Utilizing the linear Boltzmann transport model that treats light and heavy flavor parton scatterings with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) on an equal basis, we provide a simultaneous description of the suppression factors of inclusive jets and heavy-flavor tagged jets observed at the LHC. We find that while the suppression factor of jets does not explicitly reveal flavor dependence due to significant gluon contributions in both inclusive and heavy-flavor jets, jet flavor does influence their substructures, such as the longitudinal and transverse distributions of energetic particles within jets. Additionally, we explore the jet axis decorrelation, defined as the angle between the standard jet axis and the winner-take-all (WTA) axis, which is expected to be sensitive to interactions between the hardest particle inside a jet and the QGP. The observed differences in the jet axis decorrelation between light and heavy flavor jets highlight not only the mass dependent diffusion of hard partons in a thermal medium, but also provide a valuable opportunity to investigate the distinct broadening effects experienced by quarks and gluons inside the QGP.",

          "description": "We estimate the diffusion coefficient matrix for baryon number, strangeness, electric charge, and charm quantum numbers in an interacting hadron gas. For the first time, this study provides insights into the charm current and estimates the diffusion matrix coefficient for charmed states, treating them as part of a quasi-thermalized medium. We analyze the diffusion matrix coefficient as a function of temperature and center-of-mass energy, assuming van der Waals-like interactions among hadrons, which include both attractive and repulsive forces. The diffusion coefficients are determined using the relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation, showing good agreement with existing model calculations in the hadronic regime. We observe that at low $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, hadrons carrying conserved charges such as baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$) diffuse more rapidly compared to charmed hadrons. As a result, charm fluctuations generated in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions remain significant until freeze-out. In experiments, the net proton number cumulants are typically used as a proxy for net baryon fluctuations. However, the greater diffusion of baryons could lead to a smearing of the critical point signal. Thus,  we propose using net charm number fluctuations as a new probe to locate the QCD critical point.",

          "description": "The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is an effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cut-off artifacts emerging near cut-off energy scales. In this presentation, I focus on a Renormalization Group (RG) treatment that successfully eliminates these artifacts(arXiv number: [2408.06704][1]). Our study reveals a substantial change in the previously established phase diagram of neutral CSC matter. The RG-consistent treatment not only eliminates cut-off artifacts but also aligns with an earlier Ginzburg-Landau analysis, suggesting the appearance of a so-called dSC phase in the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) melting pattern. The new model offers improved phenomenological aspects of speed of sound, demonstrating reliability at higher densities, which is crucial for investigating potential CSC phases in neutron star mergers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://%20https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06704",

          "description": "The studies of heavy flavor (charm or bottom) hadrons in relativistic collisions provide an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). As the majority of the heavy flavor particles are produced in the initial stages of the heavy-ion collisions, they experience the whole QCD medium evolution. The lightest open charm meson, $D^{0}$, and hidden charm vector meson, J/$\\psi$, are particularly useful as they are abundantly produced as compared to other open and hidden charm hadrons, respectively. The $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons that are either directly formed during initial scattering or as the decay products of higher charm stages are referred to as the prompt production, which is essential to probe the QCD medium. On the other hand, the non-prompt $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons are usually formed as the decay products of beauty hadrons and can provide a key understanding of beauty hadrons.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) models to segregate the prompt and non-prompt productions of $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ mesons in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the\r\ntrack-level information of the particles like an experimental environment. We have used the PYTHIA8 event generator to simulate the events for the study, which provides a good qualitative description of experimental measurements. We have considered the $D^{0}\\rightarrow\\pi^{+}K^{-}$ and J/$\\psi\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay channels for our study. To separate prompt from non-prompt sector of charmonia and open charm mesons, topological production of $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$ are considered.  We have used XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest models for $D^{0}$ related studies, whereas for  J/$\\psi$, we have used XGBoost and LighGBM models. For $D^{0}$, we have used invariant mass ($m_{\\pi K}$ ), pseudoproper time ($t_z$ ), pseudoproper decay length ($c_{\\tau}$ ), and distance of closest approach ($\\rm{DCA}_{D_{0}}$ )  as the training inputs. For J/$\\psi$ meson, the input sample is chosen keeping ALICE Run 3 muon forward tracker upgrade in mind, which includes, invariant mass ($m_{\\mu\\mu}$ ), transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and $c_{\\tau}$. The machine learning models provide up to 99\\% accuracy to dissect the prompt and non-prompt production of both $D^{0}$ and J/$\\psi$. Transverse momentum, rapidity and multiplicity differential comparisons between the true and predicted values are compared to evaluate the performance of the models. Experimental comparisons are also made wherever applicable. The ML methods used in the present study can replace the traditionally used fitting method with the added advantage of track label identification. The present ML-based identification of prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons can be useful in experiments that require precise measurements.",

          "description": "We discuss the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the linear sigma model coupled to the Polyakov loop in an attempt to resolve discrepancies between the first-principle based numerical and model-based analytical results. Working in a homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density, and angular frequency. We demonstrate that in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. We enforce the causality constraint by implementing the spectral boundary conditions and obtain a splitting between the deconfinement and chiral transitions as a boundary effect [1].  We also investigate the Tolman-Ehrenfest law within this consistent framework for the rotating strongly interacting matter in the cylindrical geometry.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop\".

          "description": "Particles produced in high-energy collisions (e.g. protons on protons) are described by power-law distributions. One such power-law distribution used extensively in the phenomenological studies originates from the nonadditive statistical mechanics proposed by C. Tsallis. In this report, we describe a nonadditive generalization of the conventional Bose-Einstein distribution using a single-mode harmonic oscillator. This approach eliminates the need of a regularization procedure proposed in previous works. The same formalism stemming from nonadditive statistics has also been applied to study the fermionic oscillator in a thermal bath. Finally, the results are utilized to study experimental observations like transverse momentum spectra produced in high-energy collisions",

          "description": "In heavy-ion collisions, azimuthal anisotropy of the final state clearly reflects the initial geometric configuration. Recent studies have shown that the anisotropic flow $v_n$ values are enhanced by nuclear deformation parameter $\\beta_n$, especially in ultra-central collisions. In mid-central collisions, the $v_n$ values are also influenced by half-height radius  $R_0$ and nuclear skin $a_0$. These influences can be well revealed by ratios of observables between two isobaric collision systems, $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions, which have different structures. While compared to isobar collisions, isobar+large nuclei, such as $^{96}$Ru+$^{197}$Au and $^{96}$Zr+$^{197}$Au collisions, provide a clearer approach to studying nuclear structure, as they involve a single elliptical or triangular shape rather than a superposition of two elliptic or triangular patterns. The results suggest even larger $v_2$ and $v_3$ difference between the two isobar+Au collisions. The infulence on flow fluctuation will also be discussed. The results can help to understand the nature of the initial state fluctuations and nuclear structure, providing valuable input for future experimental measurements.",

In this talk, we interface insights from ab initio nuclear structure calculations of $^{16}$O geometry with simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables, such as the elliptic flow, mean transverse momentum fluctuations, and flow decorrelations, exhibit strong sensitivity to the nuclear model input, responding to realistic nucleon clustering and short-range repulsive correlations [1,2].

          "description": "The NA60+ experiment, proposed for data taking in the next years, aims to explore the high baryochemical potential region within the QCD phase diagram, exploiting the high-intensity beams from CERN SPS. Through a beam-energy scan involving Pb-Pb and p-A collisions in the range 6.3 < $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ < 17.3, NA60+ is ideally positioned to access the high $\\mu_B$ region of the QCD phase space.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on prospects for measurements of hidden and open charm. Open charm particles will be identified through their decays into charged hadrons, with decay products from tracks reconstructed in the vertex telescope's silicon detectors. High-precision measurements of $D^0$, $D^+$, $D_s$ mesons, and $\\Lambda^+_c$ baryon will enable us to better constrain the transport properties of the QGP and understand charm-quark hadronisation.\r\n\r\nCharmonium states, detected via their dimuon decays, will be reconstructed by matching muon tracks between the vertex telescope and the muon spectrometer. Measurements of $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) across various collision energies will shed light on the onset of charmonium suppression within a deconfined medium, allowing us to correlate this suppression with the system temperature, measured by NA60+ using thermal dimuons, across various collision energies and in different collision systems.\r\n\r\nFinally, the competitiveness and complementarity of NA60+ heavy-flavour measurements in the landscape of the experiments foreseen at other facilities in the next decade will be discussed.",

In this talk, we present the new measures of fluctuations in the event-wise average transverse momentum, $\\langle p_T \\rangle$, which reflect event-by-event fluctuations of the size and entropy of the QGP initial source. We predict the longitudinal correlations and/or decorrelations, $R\\left(\\langle p_{T}\\rangle_{\\eta_1},\\langle p_{T}\\rangle_{\\eta_2}\\right)$, of the rapidity-dependent average transverse momentum $\\langle p_{T}\\rangle_{\\eta}$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using a full (3+1)D hydrodynamic framework. This study offers new insights into initial-state structure, the longitudinal profile of fluctuations, and the properties of QGP in heavy-ion collisions.",

The emergence of the first two terms, $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $q_\\mu$, is attributed to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, we also treat the spin density ($S^{\\mu \\nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable alongside energy density and particle density, leading to two additional transport coefficients characterized by the correlation between $S^{\\mu \\nu}$ and $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$ and vice-versa. Finally, we derive the evolution equations for the aforementioned tensors—$\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$, $q_\\mu$, $\\pi_{\\mu\\nu}$, and $\\Pi$.",

          "description": "The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behavior can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. Using kinetic theory in the (momentum dependent) relaxation time approximation I show how one can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with quasi-particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, I introduce the *non-analytic area density* that describes the properties of this region. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, I will identify two specific choices called *pictures* with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.",

          "description": "We use the parametric approach to analyze jet suppression measured using the nuclear modification factor of inclusive jets and jets from gamma-jet events. With minimum model assumptions, we quantify the magnitude of the average energy loss, its pt-dependence, and flavor dependence. Further, we quantify the impact of fluctuations in the energy loss and nuclear PDFs on the measured jet suppression. When employing the Glauber model to infer the information about the collision geometry, we quantify the path-length dependence of the average energy loss. The extracted path-length dependence should contribute to the discussion about the impact of medium expansion on the observed quantities and our ability to distinguish radiative and collisional energy loss based on its path-length dependence.\r\n\r\nComparison between the magnitude of the energy loss in 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions along with Glauber modeling allows also to perform a transparent extrapolation of the magnitude of energy loss expected to be measured in upcoming Oxygen-Oxygen collisions. These estimates then represent a basic prediction of the nuclear modification factor of jets to be seen in Oxygen-Oxygen collisions. The work presented in this talk is based on a new extension of modeling published in PLB 767 (2017) 10 and EPJC 76 (2016) 2, 50, which was recently submitted for publication.",

We then calculate the thermodynamic potential to one loop including quark loops. The phase diagram in the $\\mu_B-T$ plane is mapped out. We focus on the speed of sound $c_s$ at $T=0$. $c_s$ has a distinct peak of $c_s\\approx0.4$ at around $\\mu\\approx0.4$ GeV and approaches the conformal limit from above. This general behavior seems to be a generic feature of these types of effective models as the same behavior is found at finite isospin chemical potential.",

We utilize machine learning to input the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility into the holographic model. Then, using this machine learning-enhanced holographic model, we predict the heavy-quark potential and transport properties that are consistent with lattice QCD and experimental data. Furthermore, we employ Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct a holographic model based on heavy quarks, demonstrating KANs' potential to derive analytical expressions for high-energy physics applications. The mass spectrum and equation of state data are also inputted into the holographic model simultaneously. We aim to develop a consistent holographic model that integrates neural networks.",

Low-p⊥ theory and data  are, however, weakly sensitive to the commonly assumed forms of the temperature dependence of η/s, especially at high temperatures. To address this, we use high-p⊥ data and theory to impose further constraints on it. Our approach, based on the study of dynamical radiative and collisional energy loss of jet particles in the medium, yields promising results in constraining the temperature dependence of η/s. This demonstrates the utility of combining low-p⊥ and high-p⊥ methods to better constrain the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).",

          "description": "This work focuses on the effects of rotation on the transport coefficients and observables of the QGP medium. Since the noncentral heavy ion collisions possess finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, the rotation gets incited in the produced medium. The rotation could significantly alter the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the trace anomaly and the isothermal compressibility. We have determined the transport coefficients using a novel relaxation time approximation method within the kinetic theory approach in association with the finite angular velocity. We have compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation and with their counterparts in the nonrotating medium. It is observed that the introduction of angular velocity enhances the transport of both charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the novel relaxation time approximation estimates smaller values of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Additionally, the aforesaid observables get conspicuously modulated by the rotation of the medium. Our observation shows a decrease in the Knudsen number and an increase in the elliptic flow when rotation is incorporated into the medium. This suggests an enhancement in the interactions among the produced particles in heavy ion collisions, leading to faster thermalization of the medium. Thus, as angular velocity increases, the medium moves closer to equilibrium. Further, we have found an increasing trend of the trace anomaly with the rising angular velocity and its slope decreases as the temperature increases. Thus, at high temperatures, the rotation has a paltry impact on the trace anomaly. Overall, the rotation makes the constituents of the medium more interactive and as a result, the medium gets deviated away from the conformal symmetry. We have further observed that the introduction of rotation into the medium reduces the isothermal compressibility and allows the medium to exhibit nearly perfect fluid behavior. This suggests that, with the increasing angular velocity, it is difficult to compress the system. Consequently, the matter becomes stiffer as the rotation becomes more rapid.",

          "description": "In this work, we analyze the impact of open-heavy-flavor-production data in proton-lead collisions on the nCTEQ nuclear PDFs. For the theoretical predictions of this process, we use an existing next-to-leading-order calculation in a general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (GM-VFNS), which, as a pQCD alternative, we compare to the data-driven approach for open heavy-flavor production used in the most recent nCTEQ global nuclear PDF analyses. The latter uses a \"crystal-ball\" function, an effective hard-scattering matrix element that is fitted to data from proton-proton collisions and then used as the theoretical prediction in the proton-lead case. Since the crystal-ball function is given by an analytical formula, it provides the required performance for PDF fits out of the box.\r\nConversely, pQCD calculations are usually given as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which can take multiple CPU hours to reach a viable precision. Thus, a significant speedup of the evaluation of the pQCD predictions is required to make the direct MC calculation feasible for global PDF analyses. This is achieved by \"gridding\" the hard-scattering cross sections, i.e., calculating them once and storing their interpolated values in look-up tables (grids). The physical predictions can then be obtained by convolving the grids with a PDF of choice, only taking up a small fraction of the runtime of the full calculation. One library providing this functionality is PineAPPL, which we use to grid the predictions for open heavy-flavor production in the GM-VFNS.",

          "description": "We present novel predictions for the heavy- and light-flavor nuclear modification factor $R_{AB}$ in small systems from a pQCD-based energy loss model, constrained by a comprehensive statistical analysis of central heavy-ion suppression data.  Our large-system-constrained results are validated by their consistency with the light-flavor photon-normalized $R_{AB} \\sim 0.75$ measured in central $d + \\mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX; however, they are inconsistent with the $R_{AB} \\sim 1.2$ measured in central $p + \\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS.   We show that, independent of a variety of energy loss models, one expects similar suppression in central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, underscoring the challenges in interpreting the measured enhancement in central $p+A$ collisions.  To better understand the theory expectation, we account for several theoretical uncertainties, resulting in a 50% uncertainty in the extracted value of the jet transport coefficient $\\hat{q}$ and highlighting concerns about the reliability of using hard probes to measure quark-gluon plasma properties.  We further show that using both heavy- and light-flavor observables to constrain the model can significantly decrease the impact of these uncertainties. Finally, we present predictions for heavy- and light-flavor $R_{AB}$ in minimum bias and central collisions of $p + \\mathrm{Pb}$, $p / d / {}^3\\mathrm{He} + \\mathrm{Au}$, and $\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{O}$, and discuss the implications of our statistical analysis on the scale at which the coupling runs.",

          "description": "Recent experimental results present collectivity also in small systems with high-multiplicity. Today these phenomena are not completely understood: it is an important question whether the presence of the QGP is necessary for the observed collectivity or not. Moreover, the connection between the experimental observables and theories is not trivial. In our phenomenological study we introduce the ‘Tsallis-thermometer’ as an indicator of quark-gluon plasma, that aims to describe the smooth transition from small to large collisional systems.\r\n\r\nThe Tsallis-thermometer is an excellent measure for locating collective effects in high-energy collisions from small to large system sizes. Scaling behaviors are inherited both from the QCD nature and from system size effects. Thermodynamical consistency helps us to measure EoS more accurately.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applications of the Tsallis-thermometer cover the fileds: \r\n\r\n(i) analysis of the transverse momentum distribution of identified hadrons within the thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-extensive statistics. A wide range of center-of-mass energies and average event multiplicities are studied for various hadron species. We demonstrate that the average event multiplicity is a key variable in the study of high-energy collisions. For this purpose the non-extensive statistical approach is more than appropriate. [1-4]\r\n\r\n(ii) The method also works well with geometry-selection of an event and correlates well with spherocity classified events. Results enable us to qualitatively define the underlying event definition beyond the CDF definition. [5]\r\n\r\n(iii) Tsallis-thermometer has also presented its success by determining the formation time of heavy flavour hadrons relative to light ones [6] \r\n\r\nIn this contribution a comprehensive summary on the power of Tsallis-thermometer will be presented in the liu of the results from the above studies.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] G.

          "description": "The equation of state of nuclear matter at 2-4 times nuclear saturation density is not very well determined by first principle methods. Heavy-ion collisions offer the opportunity to reach those high densities and collective flow measurements are sensitive to the properties of the medium. At 1-2 AGeV per nucleon beam energy transport approaches are the best choice for the theoretical description of the dynamic evolution of the system. In this work, we aim to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter by comparing calculations within the SMASH transport approach to directed and elliptic flow measurements for protons and deuterons performed by the FOPI and HADES collaboration in a systematic way. \r\n\r\nA momentum-dependent term is included in the potential for which we show that it is needed to describe flow data. We further incorporate a simple symmetry potential in the transport model and present constraints on the stiffness of the equation of state of nuclear matter at saturation density and on the symmetry potential. For the FOPI data, Z=1 nuclei are considered and differential directed and elliptic flow measurements are compared with the calculations using a chi-square analysis. For Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV, the HADES measurements, the constraints are obtained by performing a Bayesian analysis such that we can also provide an uncertainty for the estimated parameters. The posterior distribution is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for which we emulate the transport model with a Gaussian process to lower computational costs. We find that a relatively stiff equation of state is favoured in our analysis with a small uncertainty whereas the constraints obtained for the symmetry potential are rather loose. For the lower FOPI energy of Au+Au collisions at 0.4 AGeV a softer equation of state yields a better description of the collective flow data. This potential discrepancy can be attributed to the role of resonance excitations that effectively soften the equation of state of the formed medium in higher energy collisions. \r\n\r\nSee https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09889 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16927",

          "description": "The second harmonic cosine and sine modulations of the local spin polarization of $\\Lambda$($\\bar{\\Lambda}$) hyperons out-of-plane ($P_{y}$) and in-plane ($P_{z}$), denoted as $P_{2y}$ and $P_{2z}$, respectively, are newly proposed observables for probing spin Hall effect (SHE) in high-density baryonic region. $P_{2y}$ and $P_{2z}$ are measured in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3, 19.6 and 27 GeV from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan-II. A monotonic decrease of $P_{2y}$ for $\\Lambda$ with increasing collision energy, and smaller positive $P_{2z}$ with hints of sign change at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV are observed. However, $P_{2y}$ and $P_{2z}$ for $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ show no significant energy dependence within the large statistical uncertainties. The local polarization components are influenced by thermal vorticity, shear-induced effects, and baryon chemical potential. The measured $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ local polarization ($P_{2y,2z}^{\\text{local,}\\Lambda}$,$P_{2y,2z}^{\\text{local,}\\bar{\\Lambda}}$) offer a promising avenue for probing the SHE. These measurements provide valuable insights into the spin dynamics of QCD matter in high-density baryonic environments.",

          "description": "Charmonium production in hadronic collisions is an important experimental observable that sheds light on the heavy quark interaction with the nuclear medium. While the bound quarkonium states undergo dissociation and recombination in PbPb collisions, in pPb collisions they can experience a combination of initial- and final-state effects such as shadowing and comover breakup. A full description of charmonia production from small to intermediate system is hence crucial to disentangle these from medium effects. LHCb recently measured the ψ(2s)/J/ψ ratio as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions and forward and backward rapidities in pPb collisions. This measurement allows the study of small/large-x effects in the ratio and provides a better control of the time ψ(2s) state spends along co-moving particles",

          "description": "Heavy-ion collisions at energies of a few GeV involve significant baryon stopping in the fireball region, leading to the formation of a baryon-dominated system. This system is characterized by large values of the baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) at chemical freeze-out, as determined through statistical-chemical analysis of hadron yields. However, at these lower energies, the freeze-out parameters are less constrained compared to higher-energy collisions, due to the rare production of certain hadron states. This imposes stringent requirements on experiments to gather sufficient data.\r\nFurthermore, at lower collision energies, additional parameters beyond temperature ($T$), fireball volume ($V$), and baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) as well as the treatment of light nuclei become increasingly important.\r\nIn this study, we employ updated methods that account for higher-order efficiency corrections from HADES experiments at GSI. This approach allows for a systematic and unprecedented precision analysis of baryon stopping and the global properties of matter at freeze-out, based on Au+Au and Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.42 and  2.55\r\nGeV, respectively.",

          "description": "Relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy range provide an opportunity to investigate the properties of nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities, similar to the conditions in Neutron Stars (NS) and Neutron Star mergers. In recent decades, significant attention has been given to the presence of hyperons in NS and their influence on the Equation of State (EoS), which describes the dense nuclear matter, lies at the core of the so-called “hyperon puzzle.” The absence of precise measurements of nucleon-nucleon (NN), nucleon-hyperon (NY), and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions has hindered progress in resolving this enigmatic contradiction and constructing the universal EoS.\r\nThe femtoscopy technique is a method used to study interparticle interactions. It also provides a way to extract the space-time properties of the expanding fireball created in heavy-ion collisions. The interaction between two particles can be described using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz equation, which constrains two essential parameters: the scattering length ($f_0$) and the effective range ($d_0$). The definitive knowledge about those parameters for NN, NY, and YY systems may be the missing piece of the “hyperon puzzle.”\r\nIn this talk, the preliminary HADES results on femtoscopic observables of proton-proton (in Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.4 GeV), proton-lambda, and deuteron-lambda (in Ag-Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.55 GeV) will be presented. We introduce the one-dimensional femtoscopic radii dependence on pair transverse momentum and collision centrality. Additionally, the parameters describing the strong interaction for the femtoscopic systems (proton-proton, deuteron-lambda) under study will be outlined for the first time using the data collected by the HADES collaboration. We intend to compare the obtained values with past studies, including the spin-separated proton-lambda results shown at QM2023.",

          "description": "Heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy range allow the creation of strongly interacting matter under extreme net-baryon densities, conditions which are comparable to the ones in neutron star mergers. The precise investigation of the Equation-of-State (EoS) of this kind of matter is therefore of high relevance for the understanding of neutron stars.\r\nIn this contribution, we present new measurements by HADES, the High-Acceptance Dielectron Spectrometer located at the SIS18 at GSI in Darmstadt, which is currently the only experimental setup with the ability to measure rare and penetrating probes at the high-µB frontier of the QCD phase diagram. We present recent high statistics results on collective flow phenomena of protons and light nuclei in Au+Au and Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.42 and 2.55 GeV. In addition to the commonly discussed directed and elliptic flow, coefficients vn up to the 6th order are investigated for the first time in this energy regime. Their combined information allows to construct a full 3D-picture of the angular particle emission in momentum space and can provide more stringent constraints on the EoS. Furthermore, the event-by-event correlations between the different flow coefficients can be exploited for this purpose and will also be presented.\r\nAdditional sensitivity to the EoS is provided by a measurement of charged kaon flow, as K+ and K− are predicted to interact differently with dense nuclear matter. First results on a multi-differential analysis of their directed and elliptic flow will be discussed.\r\nThe multi-differential HADES flow data are confronted with various transport model approaches relevant for this energy region and current constraints e.g. derived via a Bayesian analysis on the EoS are discussed.",

          "description": "Dileptons are excellent probes for studying the hot, dense hadronic matter created in heavy-ion collisions, as they do not participate in the strong interaction in the medium and carry undisturbed information from all stages of the fireball evolution.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we present preliminary results on anisotropic flow of di-electrons produced in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.23$ GeV, recorded by the High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) situated at GSI Darmstadt in March 2024. This collision system exhibits similar conditions to those during the final stages of a neutron-star merger.\r\n\r\nOne key aspect of this dilepton flow study is the reconstruction of pure electron pairs.\r\nIn HADES, this is achieved by employing a hadron-blind Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. In a dense track multiplicity environment such as the one encountered in Au+Au collisions at this energy, one of the main background sources comes from mismatching RICH rings to incorrect track candidates. Recent advancements in the RICH calibration, using very selective time cuts that fully exploit the detector's excellent timing precision, have significantly improved the electron purity, yielding a more precise dilepton flow reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis poster will focus on the status and first steps towards deriving the elliptic flow coefficient ($v_2$) for di-electrons, extending towards multidifferential studies as a function e.g. of centrality, transverse momentum, rapidity or invariant mass.",

However, its implications for lower-energy jets at a collision energy of 200 GeV, as accessible at RHIC, remain largely unexplored. These lower-energy jets are more sensitive to non-perturbative effects such as hadronization and contributions from the underlying event, offering a unique opportunity to test and refine the current description of QCD jets.\r\nIn this talk, we present Monte Carlo predictions for light and heavy jets at 200 GeV for the sPHENIX experiment, focusing on two observables: jet angularities and the primary Lund Plane projection. We particularly explore the Dead Cone effect (suppressed collinear radiation around massive particles) and its possible signatures in the Lund Plane distributions, aiming to deepen our understanding of jet dynamics at intermediate energies.",

          "description": "In off-central heavy ion collisions (HIC), an appreciable amount of initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the colliding heavy nuclei can be transferred to the participants and subsequently to the nuclear medium formed [1]. This transferred OAM can give rise to local vorticity in the created matter. The transport coefficients of the matter formed in HIC give ample information about the medium formed and the underlying interactions. The transport properties, such as electrical conductivity, viscosities, and thermal conductivity of quantum chromodynamic (QCD) medium modifies in a rotating frame. By breaking the rotational symmetry of the medium, transport coefficients become anisotropic in a rotating frame. Similar to the Lorentz force in the presence of magnetic fields, the Coriolis force plays the equivalent role in a system with finite angular momentum. In a non-relativistic formulation, we have to introduce the Coriolis force in the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) as an external force. However, considering the relativistic equation of motion in a rotating frame, Coriolis force comes naturally in BTE at leading order in angular velocity. Here, we discuss how electrical conductivity [2,3] and the shear viscosity [4] of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic gas are modified in a rotating frame due to the influence of Coriolis force. The transport coefficients are evaluated with the help of covariant BTE in the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The QGP is modeled with a massless gas of light quarks and gluons rotating with a constant angular velocity Ω. Similarly, the hadronic gas is modeled by the ideal hadron resonance gas (IHRG) in a rotating frame, with the relaxation time calculated in a hard sphere-type scattering, treating the hard sphere scattering length as a tuning parameter. At first, we tune the relaxation time for electrical conductivity and shear viscosity in the QGP and hadronic phases without rotation (Ω=0). After the calibration of relaxation time, we show the variation of perpendicular, parallel, and Hall-type components of viscosity and conductivity as a function of angular velocity and temperature for both rotating QGP and IHRG.\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

          "description": "Unfolding, the process of correcting measured data for detector distortions, is essential for comparing collider experiments. As experimental measurements grow increasingly sophisticated, the demand for higher-dimensional unfolding methods has risen. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based unfolding approaches have emerged to address these challenges. In heavy-ion collisions, unfolding becomes particularly complex due to the presence of the underlying event. Traditionally, underlying event subtraction and unfolding are treated in separate steps. In this work, we demonstrate that ML-based unfolding methods not only outperform traditional techniques but can also integrate underlying event subtraction directly into the unfolding step, streamlining the analysis workflow.\r\n\r\nWe introduce OmniFold-HI, a heavy-ion-tailored version of the popular unfolding algorithm [1]. Our version accounts for detector acceptance, efficiency, combinatorial jets, and uncertainties, making it well-suited for real-world analyses. Furthermore, OmniFold-HI can handle an arbitrary number of observables, offering exceptional versatility. To showcase its capabilities, we apply OmniFold-HI to unfold a 15-dimensional jet substructure observable, with the presence of a high-multiplicity thermal background, and simulated detector effects. The unfolding performance is compared with traditional methods, and uncertainties are rigorously quantified. Our results are done by training and testing using distinct event generators illustrating model-independence. We also demonstrate that OmniFold-HI reproduces the maximum likelihood estimate and provide a mathematical proof of the ML-based unfolding algorithm.\r\n\r\n[1] Andreassen et. al, Phys. Rev.

          "description": "The matrix model for the two-color QCD coupled to a single quark (matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$) exhibits novel features, such as the Pauli-Gursey symmetry. Using variational methods, we numerically investigate matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$ in the limit of ultra-strong Yang-Mills coupling ($g_{YM} =\\infty$). The spectrum of the model has superselection sectors labelled by baryon number $B$ and spin $J$. We study sectors with $B=0,1,2$ and $J=0,1$, which may be organised as mesons, (anti-)diquarks and (anti-)tetraquarks. For each of these sectors, we study the properties of the respective ground states in both chiral and heavy quark limits, and uncover a rich quantum phase transition (QPT) structure.  We also investigate the division of the total spin between the glue and the quark and show that glue contribution is significant for several of these sectors.  For the $(B,J)=(0,0)$ sector, we find that the dominant glue contribution to the ground state comes from reducible connections. Finally, in the presence of non-trivial baryon chemical potential $\\mu$, we construct the phase diagram of the model. For sufficiently large $\\mu$, we find that the ground state of the theory may have non-zero spin, indicating a phase reminiscent of the LOFF phase in two-color QCD.",

          "description": "Equation of State at finite density in external magnetic fields aiming for an experimental setup\r\n\r\nProbing the QCD phase diagram is a challenging task both from a theoretical and an experimental standpoint. Moreover heavy ion collision experiments have shown, that strong magnetic fields arise, which may have a sizeable impact on the phase diagram. From the lattice QCD perspective the finite-magnetic-field case is unproblematic, while simulations at finite chemical potential suffer from the infamous sign problem. In this work, we investigate the QCD equation of state via lattice simulations at external magnetic field and non-zero chemical potential using analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential. The computations were done on a 32^3 x 8 lattice using the tree-level-improved Symanzik gauge action and 4-stout-improved staggered fermions with physical quark masses. Moreover, we tune the simulation parameters to an isospin-asymmetric and strangeness-neutral point using various expansion schemes to match experimental conditions.",

The fraction of virtual direct photons in the inclusive virtual photon spectrum is obtained from a fit to the dielectron invariant mass spectrum. In the limit of zero invariant mass, this fraction is equal to the relative contribution of real direct photons in the inclusive real photon spectrum. Contributions from decays of light-flavour neutral mesons are estimated using independent measurements in proton--proton collisions at the same energy and the same event class. The yield of direct photons in inelastic pp collisions is compared to perturbative QCD calculations. The integrated photon yield is studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity and is compared to the results from other experiments and theoretical calculations. The results show a significant increase of direct-photon yield with charged-particle multiplicity.",

          "description": "Accurate modeling and understanding of quarkonium production in AA collisions requires a formalism that preserves the quantum properties of a microscopic $Q\\bar{Q}$ systems while treating the interaction of such pairs with the QGP. The open quantum system approach has recently emerged as one of the most fruitful schemes to meet such requirements. However, the quantum master equations obtained so far in this approach and currently used to make predictions for the upsilon suppression at RHIC and LHC are derived assuming a strict ordering between the QGP temperature $T$ and the energy gaps ($\\Delta E$) of the upsilon bound states. This limits their predictive power as the QGP cooling interpolates between the quantum Brownian regime ($T\\gtrsim \\Delta E$) and the quantum optical regime ($T\\lesssim \\Delta E$). In our contribution, we derive and present a more general non-abelian quantum master equation of the Linblad type, which does not suffer from these limitations and thus allows to faithfully describe the quantum evolution of the $b\\bar{b}$ pairs during the whole QGP evolution. We also establish the contact with the QME previously obtained in the QBM and QO regimes and provide some concrete perspectives for its efficient solution.",

          "description": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions probes the topological sector of quantum chromodynamics, where parity and charge-parity symmetries are locally violated. We will present the STAR results on the CME search from the BES-II data at STAR using a novel Event-Shape Selection (ESS) method to suppress the flow-related background. EBE-AVFD simulations have shown that the ESS method can accurately disentangle the CME signal from the flow-related background in the measurement of charge separation observable $\\Delta\\gamma^{112}$. We use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions. After flow-related background suppression, a non-zero charge separation signal $\\Delta\\gamma^{112}_{\\rm ESS}$ is observed in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV at 20-50% centrality, each with significance over 3$\\sigma$. Below $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 10 GeV and at 200 GeV, $\\Delta\\gamma^{112}_{\\rm ESS}$ is consistent with zero. With the application of the ESS method, the background indicator $\\Delta\\gamma^{132}_{\\rm ESS}$ yields zero.",

          "description": "The concept of pseudo-gauge freedom, which is essential for defining conserved currents in effective field theories like relativistic hydrodynamics, continues to inspire significant debate and re-interpretation. In this talk, I will present recent insights that clarify the role and limitations of pseudo-gauge transformations and pseudo-gauge invariance in hydrodynamic systems.\r\n\r\nFor pseudo-gauge transformations connecting two symmetric energy-momentum tensors, we identify a necessary condition for the associated super-potential: it must satisfy a specific conservation law, referred to here as the \"STS condition.\" Notably, this constraint is challenging to fulfill in hydrodynamic frameworks based on standard variables like temperature, baryon chemical potential, and flow velocity. However, in a particular case—the boost-invariant flow—the STS condition is automatically satisfied. This allows for a non-trivial residual pseudo-gauge transformation characterized by a single scalar field. In this scenario, the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients exhibit pseudo-gauge dependence, yet a specific linear combination within the hydrodynamic equations remains pseudo-gauge invariant.\r\n\r\nThis finding sheds new light on the role of pseudo-gauge transformations, offering valuable implications for theoretical approaches and practical applications in high-energy physics.\r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n\"Dynamical constraints on pseudo-gauge transformations\", arXiv:2411.06249 [hep-ph] by Z.

          "description": "A recently formulated extension of perfect spin hydrodynamics, which includes second-order corrections in the spin polarization tensor to the energy-momentum tensor and baryon current, is studied in the case of a one-dimensional boost-invariant expansion. The presence of second-order corrections introduces feedback from spin dynamics on the hydrodynamic background, constraining possible spin polarization configurations. However, as long as the magnitude of the spin polarization tensor remains small (below unity in natural units), the permitted spin dynamics differs very little from that found in the case without the second-order corrections. \r\n\r\nBased on: Z.Drogosz, W.Florkowski, N.Łygan, R.Ryblewski, Boost-invariant spin hydrodynamics with spin feedback effects, arXiv:2411.06154 [hep-ph].",

          "description": "Recent experimental results on two-particle correlations within jets with extremely high multiplicities in pp collisions highlight a strong flow-like correlation among constituents. One of the hypotheses to describe this effect suggests the formation of a hot and dense QCD medium within the jet cone, a phenomenon previously thought to occur exclusively in heavy-ion collisions. One notable characteristic of such medium formation is the altered production ratio among different particle species. This is particularly relevant for short-lived, strongly decaying resonances, since their decay products can experience (pseudo-)elastic interactions with the formed hadrons after chemical freeze-out. In turn, this drastically alters the final-state yields of such particles. This contribution investigates this phenomenon by analyzing the yields of K* and Φ mesons within high-multiplicity jets in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV with LHC Run 3 data collected with ALICE. The measurement utilizes charged-particle jets, and per-jet yields of K* and Φ are investigated in and out of such jets. The focus on resonances is expected to provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of QCD medium creation and its influence on particle production patterns.",

          "description": "Energy-energy correlators (EECs) provide a powerful tool to study the evolution of scattered partons into final state hadrons. Defined as the energy-weighted cross section of the angle between particle pairs, EECs provide insight into the transition of the perturbative and non-perturbatives regimes of Quantum Chromodynamics. The transition between the two regimes corresponds to confinement, where hadron formation mechanisms remain poorly understood. This analysis aims to study EECs more differentially by examining  further pair correlations in each regime. We present first findings showcasing several new correlations, such as the momentum differences, between the pairs in inclusive jets in pp collisions, measured with ALICE. By studying these quantities in different ranges of the pair opening angle, we can experimentally elucidate differences in the evolution of the jet at different timescales in its fragmentation. We evaluate various hadronization mechanisms through comparisons with Monte Carlo models. This new kind of observable will also be instrumental in understanding the modification of EECs in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions.",

          "description": "The production of beauty quarks can be calculated within perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) due to their large mass, allowing for precise comparisons with experimental results. Beauty-quark tagged jets (b-jets) allow to experimentally reconstruct the kinematics of the scattered beauty quark and probe its subsequent shower evolution.\r\nNonetheless, traditional b-jet tagging algorithms (e.g. impact parameter or secondary vertex methods) are constrained in their performance due to the complexity of reconstructing the decay of beauty-hadrons. In this poster, we aim to enhance the efficiency and purity of b-jet tagging in pp collisions, especially in the low-$\\textit{p}_\\texttt{T}$ region, by applying a Graph Neural Network (GNN) tagging method, which is a high-performance deep learning approach capable of comprehensively assessing the relationships among jet constituent tracks and the topological structure of the decay. Combining this approach with the enhanced pointing resolution of the ALICE detector in Run 3, enables more precise b-jet analyses in the low-$\\textit{p}_\\texttt{T}$ region, both in pp and Pb–Pb collisions.\r\nWe will discuss the development status of the GNN b-jet tagging method and present the computed b-jet cross section using this method.",

In this poster, we present a new measurement of jet fragmentation in pp collisions, extending the precision of the previous measurement using the new high statistics data samples from Run 3. The results will also be presented differentially in event multiplicity, investigating potential medium effects in high multiplicity pp collisions. The $j_\\mathrm{T}$ distributions are characterized through fits that separately constrain the perturbative and hadronization components, providing a basis to probe modifications at early times in the evolution of the jet.",

A priori knowledge of the collision vertex position would allow discarding non-viable track seeds, reducing the overall computing requirements for the track reconstruction. Traditionally, the vertex position is estimated only after the track reconstruction, making the seed pre-selection unfeasible. The novel method proposed in this poster uses the Hough transform to estimate the interaction vertex position without the necessity to reconstruct the tracks first. While it does not replace the traditional tracks-based vertex reconstruction, it offers an admissible resolution that is usable for seed filtering. Moreover, numerical complexity of the algorithm scales linearly with the track multiplicity, making it ideal for high-multiplicity events.",

          "description": "EMCal-based photon and neutral meson measurements are key parts of both the physics and calibration methods at RHIC and the future EIC. With the advent of the Electron Ion Collider, which will involve many diverse calorimeter systems, and the switch to SiPM readouts which has been occuring over the past ~decade, new techniques in calorimeter calibrations are needed. These should address for example, gain tracing vs time, where siPM's can be more sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and also position dependencies in response, due to siPM light collection being less uniform than with traditional PMT's. We review EM calorimeter based meson measurements and several calibrations methods used for calibrating both hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters at RHIC, LHC, and elsewhere, and also explore some possibilities for use at the upcoming EIC Facility. This includes several novel techniques developed for use at RHIC by our group. We will discuss calorimeter systems being planned for the ePIC experiment and specifically how the various methods, including ours, can be used there.",

          "description": "Relativistic viscous hydrodynamics has been widely used as an effective theory of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) stage in high energy collisions. The analytical structure of hydrodynamics consists of a hydrodynamic and a non-hydrodynamic mode. The hydrodynamic mode is associated with an attractor solution and is considered to be the reason for the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics in explaining the soft sector observables. The non-hydrodynamic mode manifests as dissipative effects in the system. The shear relaxation time acts as a regulator of non-hydrodynamic mode. We exploit this feature to find the smallest size of QGP in peripheral proton-nucleus collisions using the state-of-the-art framework of JETSCAPE. As predicted by Paul Romatschke in Ref. [Eur. Phys. J. C (2017) 77:21], an abrupt increase in the second anisotropic flow coefficient in peripheral collisions for extreme values of shear relaxation time is a signature of breakdown of hydrodynamics. We find the threshold peripheral collisional centrality up to which we can safely employ hydrodynamics. We make a semi-quantitative estimate of the smallest volume and lifetime of QGP for the collision system of p+Pb at 5.02 TeV and p+Au at 200 GeV.",

          "description": "The measurement of the magnetic field created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is challenging, due to the fact that the magnetic field decays so drastically that in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma the field strength becomes rather weak. By incorporating the weak magnetic effect into the medium, and especially into the production formalism of dileptons from the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of dilepton polarization is studied through the dilepton angular distribution. We find that the anisotropic coefficients in the dilepton spectrum are quite sensitive to the orientation and strength of the weak field. Accordingly, these coefficients provide ideal probes for the magnetic field in realistic experiments.",

          "description": "Jets are collimated bunches of hadrons, and they serve as a useful tool for studying QCD. Jets are generated from the hard scattering processes of quarks and gluons in particle collisions, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These processes can be theoretically described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) and are well-modeled by Monte Carlo simulations such as PYTHIA and HERWIG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHeavy-flavor quarks are produced in the early stages of collisions, before the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed. These quarks interact with the medium and undergo hadronization. Therefore, heavy-flavor jets, which originate from heavy-flavor quarks, are a unique tool for studying the properties of the QGP. Furthermore, due to the dead-cone effect, heavy-flavor jets are relatively less contaminated by gluons compared to light-flavor jets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the properties of jets, studying the substructure within jets is essential. The Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) is a correlation function of the energy flow within a jet and is known as a robust observable against soft emissions or collinear splittings. Experimentally, the EEC is defined as the energy-weighted two-particle correlation as a function of the angular distance between pairs of particles. In this study, we use Monte Carlo simulations, such as PYTHIA and HERWIG, to investigate the flavor dependence of the EEC in proton-proton collisions. We expect to observe the heavy-flavor dead-cone effect in the EEC through this analysis.",

          "description": "This study aims to investigate the antishadowing effect in nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) by calculating the nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ for dijets produced in proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions. To achieve this aim, we used Monte Carlo simulations using PYTHIA and PYTHIA+POWHEG event generators. These tools allowed us to apply various nPDF sets to evaluate the impact of antishadowing on dijet production.\r\nAntishadowing refers to an enhancement of parton densities in nuclei at moderate momentum fractions. This enhancement significantly influences hard scattering processes in nuclear environments. Specifically, gluon antishadowing plays a crucial role in high-energy nuclear collisions, as gluons are key contributors to high-energy particle and jet production.\r\nThe $R_{pA}$ results from our simulations show a slight enhancement in the dijet spectrum, reflecting the contribution from the antishadowing region in the lead nPDF. Both PYTHIA and PYTHIA+POWEHG models demonstrate consistent results. These findings provide an important benchmark for comparison with LHC experimental data. Furthermore, they offer insights that help constrain gluon antishadowing in nPDFs, thereby improving our understanding of initial-state effects in nuclear collisions.",

          "description": "Searching dark portal particle is a hot topic in particle physics frontier. We present a simulation study of an experiment targeted for searching the scalar portal particles and vector portal particles at Huizhou $\\eta$ factory. The HIAF high-intensity proton beam and a high event-rate spectrometer are suggested for the experiment aimed for the discovery of new physics. Under the conservative estimation, $5.9\\times10^{11}$ $\\eta$ events could be produced in one month running of the experiment. The hadronic production of $\\eta$ meson $(p + {}^7\\mathrm{Li} \\rightarrow \\eta X)$ is simulated at beam energy of 1.8 GeV using GiBUU event generator. We tend to search for the light dark scalar particles in the rare decay channels \\(\\eta \\rightarrow S\\pi^0 \\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0\\) and \\(\\eta \\rightarrow S\\pi^0 \\rightarrow e^+ e^- \\pi^0\\) and light vector portal particles in the channel \\(\\eta \\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma^* \\rightarrow e^+ e^- \\gamma\\). The detection efficiencies of the channels and the spectrometer resolutions are studied in the simulation. We also present the projected upper limits of the decay branching ratios\r\nof the dark scalar particle and dark vector particle and the projected sensitivities to the model parameters.",

          "description": "The growing interest in the thermodynamic properties of strongly-interacting systems under rotation, particularly using lattice gauge techniques on the Euclidean manifold and with an imaginary angular velocity $\\Omega = i \\Omega_I$, has motivated the current study of Dirac fields under imaginary rotation. For $\\nu = \\beta \\Omega_I / 2 \\pi$ a rational number, the thermodynamics of free scalar fields \"fractalizes\" in the large volume limit, that is, it depends only on the denominator $q$ of the irreducible fraction $\\nu = p / q$. We consider the same problem for free, massless, fermions at finite temperature $T = \\beta^{-1}$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ and confirm that the thermodynamics fractalizes in the case $\\mu = 0$. Curiously, fractalization has no effect on the chemical potential $\\mu$, which dominates the thermodynamics at large values of $q$. The fractal behavior is shown analytically for the fermionic condensate, the charge currents and the energy-momentum tensor. For these observables, the values on the rotation axis and the large temperature behaviour are validated by analytic continuation and comparison with the results obtained in the case of real rotation. Enclosing the system in a fictitious cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L_z$ allows constructing averaged thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the Euler relation and also fractalize.",

Given the limitations of applying hydrodynamics to small systems, it is essential to develop alternative collective models that allow for better control over the degree of collectivity. In this poster, we present our latest advancements in solving a 2+1 dimensional Boltzmann equation using a relaxation time approximation. The evolution begins from a fluctuating initial state and ends with a freeze-out hypersurface. We present our results for systems with different opacities, ranging from free-streaming to the case close to ideal hydrodynamics.",

          "description": "In high-energy physics experiments, silicon detectors play an important role in the discovery of new physical phenomena. In the research and development of detectors with silicon pad sensors, a simple preamplifier is essential to evaluate the performance of silicon pad sensors. We have therefore developed a versatile readout circuit for detectors that can be used in both test beam and laboratory environments with a simple setup. This preamplifier is a simple design consisting of a charge-sensitive amplifier, a filter circuit, and an inverting amplifier. The main features of this preamplifier are wide frequency bandwidth, low noise, and ease of setup. An infrared laser system is used to verify the silicon pad (320-μm silicon thickness, 1 cm x 1 cm for the single cell) with the preamplifier we developed.\r\nIn this poster, we evaluate the performance of this preamplifier by measuring the minimum ionized particle (MIP) with a 320 μm silicon pad sensor using a 3 GeV/c positron beam at the PF-AR test beamline at KEK and a 0.8 GeV/c electron beam at ELPH at Tohoku University.",

          "description": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is produced. The transition is achieved when the system reaches a specific critical temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$). Lattice QCD calculations indicate that chiral symmetry (CS) restoration occurs around $T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ as well ($\\sim 156$ MeV). CS restoration can be investigated using resonances that are parity partners, i.e. particles that have the same quantum numbers except for parity, such as $\\mathrm{K^{*}(892)^0}$ and $\\mathrm{K_1(1270)}$. These resonances exhibit different masses, widths, and production yields in the vacuum. However, these discrepancies are expected to diminish at a temperature near those associated with CS restoration, resulting in a $\\mathrm{K_1}$ to $\\mathrm{K^*}$  production ratio higher than  the one predicted by the statistical hadronization model.\r\nThe ALICE experiment has excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities across a wide momentum range. Along with the large data sample collected in Run 3, the ALICE apparatus is perfectly suited for measuring hadronic resonances, including those with high mass and width. In this contribution, results on the $\\mathrm{K^{*}(892)^0}$ resonance production using LHC Run 3 data for Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV will be presented and compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, the preliminary study of the $\\mathrm{K_1}$ measurement with ALICE and plans for investigating CS restoration will be discussed.",

These measurements are conducted with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7, focusing on final-state charged particles with transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) in the range $0.15 \\leq p_{\\rm T}\\leq 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and pseudo-rapidity $|\\eta| \\leq 0.8$. Results show that $\\langle \\Delta p_{\\rm T} \\Delta p_{\\rm T}\\rangle$  displays a distinct declining trend with average charged particle multiplicity ($\\langle N_{\\rm ch} \\rangle$) in both models, with PYTHIA8 and HERWIG showing unique patterns. Positive finite skewness is observed in low-multiplicity events across both models, indicating asymmetry in the $\\langle p_{\\rm T} \\rangle$ distributions. Additionally, the transverse spherocity estimator ($S_{\\rm 0}$) is used to analyze the influence of hard scattering (jets) versus soft multi-partonic interactions (MPI) on these fluctuations. These comparative measurements provide insights into fluctuation dynamics in pp collisions, establishing an essential baseline for detecting non-trivial fluctuations in heavy-ion collision environments.",

          "description": "We study the minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution. The main focus lies on the stages directly after the supernova outward shock wave where neutrinos are captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is approximately $Y_L = 0.4$ and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped cases higher minimal masses than for the cases when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron stars. Thermal effects, in this work a given constant entropy per baryon, also increase the minimal mass.  Calculations of core-collapse supernovae impose a lower limit of approximately $1.2M_{\\odot}$ for neutron stars. Our determined values for the first evolution stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ is $M_{min} \\sim 0.62M_{\\odot}$ and for the stage after that with $Y_{\\nu} = 0$ and $s = 2$ we find $M_{min} \\sim 0.22M_{\\odot}$. We also study the case of an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf with a lepton fraction of $Y_L = 0.5$ and find large discrepancies in the results of different nuclear models studied. We furthermore examine the minimal mass dependence on the lepton fraction, which follows a similar relation for all equations of state studied.\r\nOur focus lies on incorporating color superconducting phases at higher densities.",

          "description": "In this talk, I will present our latest research building upon the findings of PLB 850 (2024) 138533, which demonstrated that the entropy current can be derived from first principles using the quantum statistical method, bypassing the need for assumed traditional local thermodynamic forms. Our study uncovers that the local thermodynamic relations, which have been conventionally used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin based on global thermodynamic equilibrium, are generally inadequate. We will present two specific examples to illustrate this: a system of massless and massive free fermions under rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Our findings reveal that the traditional local thermodynamic relations are incomplete when the spin tensor is considered. Notably, we show that the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential deviates from the spin density, acquiring corrections due to acceleration and rotation. These results suggest that for an accurate derivation of constitutive relations in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, the traditional thermodynamic relations must be extended.",

          "description": "Azimuthal anisotropy is by now a standard observation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, believed to primarily result from hydrodynamic expansion of the created hot and dense quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Ubiquitous observations of azimuthal anisotropy have also been made in small-system (proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and deuteron/$^{3}$He-nucleus) collisions. These observations, while prompting the exciting possibility of QGP droplet formation in those small systems, provoke skepticism on the belief that those anisotropies must stem from hydrodynamic origins. Unfortunately, the interaction strength cannot be arbitrarily tuned in nuclear collisions, which would elucidate the physics mechanisms of azimuthal anisotropy. We report an experimental research [1] on the anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in a harmonic potential of an elliptic shape, where the interactions can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. We also explore higher-order harmonic anisotropies, such as triangular anisotropy by preparing an initial triangular shape of the harmonic potential. It is found that the expansion anisotropy of cold atoms builds up quickly at small interaction strength, indicating that strong hydrodynamic interactions are not a prerequisite. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy as a function of the interaction strength is observed, quantitatively comparable between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics [1]. This observation suggests a universality in the expansion dynamics in interacting systems, independent of the physics nature of those interactions. The universality potentially unifies a variety of disciplines in nature, spanning from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting QGP of the early universe.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n[1] Li K., Song H-F., Sun Y-L., Xu H-J., Wang F-Q., Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma, arXiv:2405.02847.",

          "description": "Neutron stars offer a unique possibility to study matter under extreme conditions. The core of such an object can reach densities up to several $n_0$ which enables the possibility for a transition to quark matter. However the properties of such hybrid stars could be mimicked by dark matter and thus one needs a clear understanding of the properties for each object. To do so we study dark matter-admixed neutron stars and try to classify the differences and similarities. We are including bosonic, self-interacting dark matter with a sufficiently stiff self-interaction potential in the form of $V \\propto \\phi^n$ and find that these neutron stars become ultra-compact ($C \\geq 1/3$).  We furthermore study the stability of these configurations by investigating the onset of unstable radial modes. With their unique properties they could account for unusual mass-radius measurements, however the same is valid for quark stars, i.e. stars made off entirely quark matter. The discussion about the nature of these objects will be addressed in this talk.",

          "description": "Quarkonium production can be used to probe the matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, for theoretical understanding of the experimental results on quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions it is necessary to know if and which quarkonium states exist above the crossover temperature, $T_c$ and what are the in-medium masses and widths of different quarkonium states. In this talk we will focus on the lattice QCD study of in-medium bottomonium properties [1].\r\n\r\nIn-medium bottomonium properties are encoded in the spectral functions, which are related to the Euclidean time correlators calculable on the lattice. We will present lattice QCD studies of 1S, 2S, 3S, 1P, 2P and 3P bottomonium correlators for $T \\simeq 133-250$ MeV [1], where the 3P state is explored for the first time. These calculations are performed with non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for the bottom quark and on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds using highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near physical point. In our study we use correlators of extended bottomonium operators [2, 3] to gain optimized overlaps with specific states and to be more sensitive to thermal effects. Compared to the previous studies that are based on a single lattice spacing per temperature value and temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=12$, we use two lattice spacings and lattices with the temporal extent $N_{\\tau}=16-30$.\r\n\r\nWe find that all bottomonia states below the open beauty threshold exist above $T_c$, including 3P state. We will show the temperature dependence of the thermal widths and in-medium masses extracted from the bottomonium correlators with physically-motivated ansatzes for the spectral function. We find that, within estimated errors, the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration, while non-zero widths for different bottomonium states can be observed. These observations suggest excited bottomonium states still exist above $T_c$ and screening is not the likely source of bottomonium dissociation.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] H.-T. Ding, W.-P. Huang, R.

          "description": "We explored the astrophysical properties of compact stars in the framework of renormalization Group (RG)-consistent three-flavor color superconductivity (CSC) using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with a Renormalization Group (RG)-consistent approach. We analyzed how variations in the vector interaction coupling ($\\eta_V$) and diquark coupling ($\\eta_D$) affect the equation of state (EoS), gap parameters, the 2SC and CFL phases, and the speed of sound. Our results show that stronger diquark and vector couplings stiffen the EoS, leading to higher maximum masses for compact stars, satisfying the 2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ constraint from heavy neutron star observations. We found that the CFL phase is stable within our RG-consistent approach and that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal limit for non-vanishing vector couplings. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the mass-radius relationship of quark stars varies from self-bound configurations to gravitationally bound ones, with no absolutely stable configurations across the entire parameter space. Based on the observation that in a possible hybrid construction to our model,  2.0 $M_{\\odot}$ can be mostly reached if the pure quark branch can already support  2.0 $M_{\\odot}$,  we find the parameter range that satisfies this condition. We found that within all our studied parameters, the maximum mass configurations always have a CFL core.",

          "description": "Understanding nucleon-nucleon (N-N) and hyperon-nucleon (Y-N) interactions is essential for exploring the structure of exotic nuclei and constraining the equation of state (EoS) of nuclear matter. These interactions offer insights into the behavior of baryonic matter under extreme conditions, which are relevant to both nuclear physics and astrophysics.  By analyzing femtoscopic correlations of baryon pairs created in the heavy-ion collisions, one can derive valuable information regarding the size of the particle-emitting source and probe the characteristics of strong interactions. In recent years, Bayesian inference techniques have provided a comprehensive solution to efficiently study multi-parameter correlations in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present an application of Bayesian inference analysis to femtoscopic correlations in heavy-ion collisions. The analysis offers an efficient way to characterize the strong interactions between these particles, e.g. scattering length $f_0$ and effective range $d_0$ through the Lednick\\'y-Lyuboshitz model.  We validate the analysis framework through model simulations and apply the analysis to the experimental data at RHIC and LHC to obtain strong interaction parameters between baryon pairs. This analysis offers new insight into the understanding of baryon interactions.",

          "description": "The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a challenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on the phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the order of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of massless quark flavors. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out the chiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the crossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge coupling, the number of quark flavors, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Lattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for $N_f \\lesssim 8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^{tric}(N_f)$, at which the chiral transition changes from first order ($a>a_{tric}$) to second order ($a<a_{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is a lattice artifact, and in the continuum limit, the transition is of second order for all $N_f \\lesssim 8$. By determining the associated temperatures  $T(N_f^{tric},a ^{tric})$ at these tricritical points, we confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of flavors increases. The location of the tricritical point in the continuum limit $T(N_f^{tric},a=0)$ is still under investigation. Current simulations on finer lattices suggest that in the continuum limit, the transition temperature approaches $T(N_f^*,a=0)=0$ at $N_f^*  \\approx 8$. This implies that, on the one hand, $N_f=8$ marks the onset of the conformal window, and, on the other hand, for all $N_f<8$ the chiral transition is of second order.",

          "description": "Determining the type of excitations that can exist in a thermal medium is key to understanding how hadronic matter behaves at extreme temperatures. Here I report on a recent approach which utilises the non-perturbative constraints imposed by causality. By analysing finite-temperature lattice QCD data for spatial correlators of pseudo-scalar mesons comprised of light quarks, we find evidence for the existence of distinct low-energy stable particle-like excitations. These excitations are shown to be present around the chiral crossover region, which suggest that at high temperatures light pseudo-scalar mesons in QCD still have a bound-state-like structure.",

          "description": "The evolution of jets showers in high energy nuclear collisions is influenced in various ways by the presence of a surrounding medium. The interaction of jet constituents with the medium can happen during the partonic stage of the jet, during hadronization, and even during its hadronic stage. We will demonstrate how flow of the ambient medium in a direction transverse to the jet can introduce both dipole and quadrupole defomations. We analyze the corresponding n=1 and n=2 harmonic deformations of the transverse structure of jets using the method of Q-vectors. We discuss how the harmonic coefficients and their preferred angles evolve when the ambient environment of jets changes from the vacuum to a parton medium without flow and finally to a medium with various rates of transverse flow. We have conducted a systematic study using both partonic and hadronization effects of the medium on jets. While quadrupole deformations are naturally present even in the vacuum, we find that the existence of sizable dipole deformations, and a correlation of the angles of dipole and quadrupole deformations could constitute clear experimental signals for the presence and size of transverse flow.",

          "description": "In this talk, we will present our extended studies on the bottom-up thermalization for a system composed by quarks, antiquarks and gluons. We will begin by performing parametric estimates for three distinct stages prior to hydrodynamization in the weak-coupling/high-energy limit, completing the analysis for pure gluon systems conducted by Baier, Mueller, Schiff, and Son. The predicted scaling behaviours of physical quantities, including the quark (and antiquark) number density, are to be confirmed through detailed numerical solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Diffusion Approximation (BEDA). The simulation involves a novel GPU-based code capable to solve the BEDA for an arbitrary 3D setup. We will then extend our analysis to intermediate coupling regimes relevant to heavy-ion phenomenology, comparing the BEDA results with those from Effective Kinetic Theory. We will also briefly comment on the potential implications of our findings for dilepton production.",

          "description": "We present a new coherent jet energy loss model for heavy-ion collisions. It is implemented as a Monte Carlo perturbative final-state parton shower followed by elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. The model has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z and GLV predictions for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium, as well as the Improved Opacity Expansion. The realistic case for LHC energy with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. The model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind, and we present implementations within the EPOS4 and Pythia 8 Monte Carlo frameworks. These comes with an interface with full simulations of the quark-gluon-plasma with hydrodynamic evolution, such as vHLLE, along with subsequent hadronisation of the jet partons in order to produce realistic distributions that can be directly compared to LHC and RHIC data. Further theoretical developments to include colour coherency effects are also discussed.\r\n\r\nSUBA-Jet is presented in [arXiv:2404.14579 [hep-ph]][1].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14579",

          "description": "We study the impact of the glasma initial pre-equilibrium stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quarks spectra and correlations. Our main finding is that the effect of glasma on the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for the heavy quark transverse momentum spectrum is moderate, while $c\\overline{c}$ angular correlations are strongly affected by the glasma [1]. Such correlations are relevant for the experimentally measurable $D\\overline{D}$ angular correlations.   \r\n\r\nWe numerically evaluate the classical transport equations for heavy quarks in the glasma fields, which in turn are obtained from a numerical solution of the classical field equations of motion [2]. Within this approach, we simulate the transport of $Q\\overline{Q}$ pairs produced back-to-back in the glasma fields and extract their two particle correlations $\\mathcal{C}(\\Delta\\phi,\\Delta\\eta)$. We focus on the azimuthal correlations  $\\mathcal{C}(\\Delta\\phi)$ and evaluate the decorrelation width $\\sigma_{\\Delta\\phi}$ as a function of the initial quark $p_T$ and Glasma saturation momentum $Q_s$. We find that pairs with moderate $p_T$ in a glasma with sufficiently large $Q_s$ values exhibit a noticeable decorrelation already during the glasma stage. Further, we investigate how heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, initialized according to the FONLL heavy quark production cross section, are affected by the glasma fields. The strong glasma fields cause a shift in the initial spectra from low to higher $p_T$. Nevertheless, this effect on $R_{AA}$ is moderate in comparison with the nPDF contribution to the input FONLL spectra. \r\n\r\n[1] D. Avramescu, V. Greco, T. Lappi, H. Mäntysaari, D.

Our research delves into this phenomenon by examining the azimuthal asymmetry that arises from the multiple interactions of energetic leptons with the medium in UPC scenarios.\r\n\r\nWe have calculated the $\\cos2\\phi$ and $\\cos4\\phi$ asymmetries and discovered that they are significantly large.

          "description": "The structure of the QCD phase diagram is a fundamental question in nuclear and particle physics. Recent works suggest the possibility of inhomogeneous phases, where key properties of quark matter such as the chiral condensate or number density adopt periodic spatial patterns. Although progress has been made in studying these phases within QCD-inspired models, direct analysis in full QCD remains challenging. In the past few years, we have adapted the standard technique of stability analysis to be used in QCD via Dyson-Schwinger equations [PRD 108 (2023) 11, 114019], [PRD 110 (2024) 7, 074014]. However, in this talk, I will introduce a completely new method for stability analysis, which is based on an extension of the concept of chiral susceptibility to encompass inhomogeneous phases [arXiv:2411.02285]. As opposed to previous approaches, this method does not depend on any external input, providing a more conclusive analysis. I will demonstrate how this technique reproduces established results from the NJL model and present findings for QCD under a simple truncation.",

          "description": "The tau-algorithm provides a reliable method for extracting QCD parton formation time within jet algorithms. As demonstrated in [1], it effectively distinguishes between heavily modified jets and those with minimal medium-induced changes, offering a robust measure of energy loss independent of the initial jet scale [2], unlike other jet substructure methods. In this talk, we demonstrate the tau-algorithm’s application in probing energy loss within small systems, including high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions, to address the key question of whether a Quark-Gluon Plasma forms in such systems. Our findings impose stringent limits on the presence of QGP signatures in small systems. Additionally, we reveal how energy loss influences parton formation time, differentiating modifications occurring prior to and following the initial splitting. These insights underscore QCD parton formation time as an effective metric for in-medium path length, advancing new tomographic methods for QGP studies.\r\n\r\n[1] L. Apolinário, A. Cordeiro, K.

As the quark mass increases, both quantities approach a step-function behaviour. This suggests that the baryon number kurtosis remains an excellent probe of deconfinement even in the large quark mass limit. \r\n\r\nWe derive the scaling properties of the baryon number cumulants at the deconfinement critical point at zero and non-zero densities. Using the Landau-type potential we extract the mean-field critical exponents and confirm the results with the explicit numerical calculation. We also predict the full critical exponents using the scaling function approach.",

          "description": "The evolution of the strongly interacting medium formed in heavy-ion collison is modelled with multi-stage models. The models are driven by a large number of parameters that quantify the properties of the medium and the initial stage of the heavy-ion collision. The need to find model parameters which give the best description of the experimental data imposes a multidimensional optimization problem. The Bayesian analysis has shown to be successful in constraining the parameter values, and the combined inclusion of LHC Pb$-$Pb 5.02 and 2.76 TeV data with additional flow observables has greatly narrowed down the uncertainties [1].\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present our latest study in inferring the transport properties of QGP by including the RHIC Au$-$Au collision data in addition to the LHC data used in the previous studies [1]. Additionally, we now define the centrality separately for all parametrisations instead of using a singular definition for all of them. With the added Au$-$Au data and exclusive centrality calibration, the data now favour smaller values for nucleon width and minimum distance between nucleons. The model calculations with the $\\textit{maximum a posteriori}$ (MAP) parameters give notably better agreement with the data for the anisotropic flow and the identified particle yields than the previous results. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we quantify the sensitivities of newly developed flow observables, Asymmetric Cumulants and Symmetry Plane Correlations, highlighting the importance of measuring independent and sensitive observables. Finally, we explore alternative initial-state models with fewer parameters to improve the estimation and address the current model limitations. This is further studied by comparing the marginal likelihood of the models. These efforts require ongoing advancements in both theoretical frameworks and computational methods. \r\n\r\n[1] J.E.

          "description": "We propose a novel set of flow observables designed to probe event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges in relativistic high-energy collisions. We find that, in $\\rm Pb\\texttt{+}Pb$ collisions at the LHC $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, our observables are sensitive to local fluctuations in baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q), which in turn lead to measurable effects in the anisotropic flow of identified hadrons when two particles of interest (2POI) are considered. Using a newly developed framework, we demonstrate that the observables reduce to 0 or 1 in the absence of BSQ fluctuations but deviate from these values by up to 10\\% when such fluctuations are present. Future high luminosity runs at the LHC will provide the necessary statistics to conduct experimental analyses with multiple particles of interest. Experimental validation of our findings will therefore offer an opportunity to place additional constraints on the charge fluctuations produced in the initial states of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://inspirehep.net/literature/2787415",

Our algorithm is tested both by classical simulations and on real quantum computers. We observed the breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry. Our simulation results are in good agreement with theoretical calculations and exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, underscoring the feasibility of using near-term quantum computers to study finite-temperature QCD systems.",

From a sensitivity analysis we determine which measurements and what precision are necessary for extracting particular properties such as quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecupole deformation parameters, as well as triaxiality parameters and details of short-range correlations.  We determine the precision with which these parameters can be determined from existing RHIC data, and perform a  Bayesian analysis to estimate the structure of $^{96}$Zr relative to $^{96}$Ru.  We also estimate the statistics necessary to obtain a given precision, and show that -- due to recent advancements in methods -- it is feasible to perform a full Bayesian calibration (using full hybrid simulations) with a limited amount of computing power.",

Crucially, it has provided a testing ground for the construction of new effective field theories, especially those in the low frequency, long wavelength limit known as hydrodynamics. We review the study of strongly-coupled rotating fluids using holography, and we examine the hydrodynamics emerging from the study of rotating Myers-Perry black holes. We describe techniques to obtain hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, and we compute the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic description, also discussing other limitations of hydrodynamics under rotation.",

          "description": "Theoretical modelling of the neutron and proton ZDC signals in heavy ion collisions is in its infancy due to its unique dynamics of spectator nucleons. Spectators, often forming clusters with varying charge-to-mass ratio, may fail to reach either ZDC and also single proton spectators are challenging to model due to the beamline magnetic fields. Despite these challenges, spectator production reveals rich physics that includes the neutron skin of Pb-208, event shape engineering of QGP droplets and an independent centrality estimator for ultracentral collisions. In this talk we present Trajectum results that include a sophisticated Bayesian analysis of a clustering model, cluster decay using the Gemini code and matched to recent ALICE data that include neutron and proton ZDC signals as well as the event-by-event spectator asymmetry. We conclude by discussing implications for upcoming light ion collisions at the LHC.",

          "description": "Leading-order pQCD calculations have shown dileptons to be a promising signature of the preequilibrium in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. This work extends the analysis of dileptons as a probe of chemical equilibration to next-to-leading order accuracy. Since the system is far-from-equilibrium, we employ the real-time formalism of quantum field theory to perform this kind of calculation for the first time. This formalism allows us to understand in isolation the contributions from the vacuum and the medium, as well as self energy corrections, vertex corrections and corrections from real processes with gluons in the initial or final state. The results provide a prediction to motivate the corresponding measurements, which promise to improve our phenomenological understanding of the pre-equilibrium chemistry of the QGP.",

          "description": "We formulate an efficient covariant method for interacting N-body systems with correct density-dependent potential and consistent mass-shell constraints.  We implement it in the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2 and calculate anisotropic flows for RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic transport approaches such as Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) have proven to be effective for simulating the space-time propagation of systems in heavy-ion collisions and for extracting the properties of dense nuclear matter. While BUU is a one-body theory, QMD and its relativistic version, RQMD, approaches evolve an N-body distribution function capable of capturing event-by-event fluctuations and correlations, which are crucial for understanding nuclear cluster formation and fluctuations of conserved charges. However, certain approximations for density-dependent potentials in the conventional QMD and RQMD hinder their accurate reproduction of the equation of state. Explicit three-dimensional integration is needed to obtain the exact density dependence, which is numerically expensive. Furthermore, the traditional RQMD models use mass-shell constraints inconsistent with the underlying theory.\r\n\r\nThis work addresses these limitations by formulating a covariant approach to interacting Gaussian wave packets that achieves accurate density-dependent potentials under correct mass-shell constraints. Our method introduces a novel approximation scheme for computing the density-dependent potential within the RQMD framework, yielding precise solutions with a reduced computational cost. Starting with an action for interacting wave packets, we derive equations of motion for Gaussian packets consistent with constrained Hamiltonian dynamics.\r\n\r\nThis new RQMD formulation is implemented in JAM2 together with the covariant collision term [1] and applied to Skyrme-type density-dependent potentials [2], the Walecka model [3], and the parity-doublet model [4]. We present results for anisotropic flows, benchmarked against data from the RHIC-BES energy ranges, and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in simulating dense nuclear matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Y.

Dielectrons serve as versatile probes for properties of the hot and dense medium created in the collisions, since once produced, they do not interact strongly and escape the fireball undisturbed. Dielectron physics relies on the efficient reduction of combinatorial background, dominated by misidentified hadrons as well as electrons from photon conversions in the target or detector material. On this poster, simulation results concerning the dielectron performance of CBM with a focus on central Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.9 \\ \\text{GeV}$ will be presented, with a discussion of background rejection using conventional cut-based selections and machine learning methods, as well as the determination the resulting invariant mass spectra and signal-to-background ratios.",

          "description": "Hybrid numerical models based on relativistic hydrodynamics have successfully described key aspects of the evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. At the end of the hydrodynamical stage, the continuous fluid degrees of freedom are translated to the discrete components of a hadron resonance gas described by kinetic theory. This process is based on the Cooper-Frye formalism and is typically called particlization. Viscous corrections to the Cooper-Frye formula are encoded in a linear correction to the equilibrium probability distribution function. Such corrections at particlization remain a major source of theoretical uncertainty in Bayesian inference of the QGP properties from heavy-ion data.\r\n\r\nWe introduce and evaluate viscous corrections based on the recently presented novel relaxation time approximation, designed to uphold conservation laws without relying on specific matching conditions or relaxation time parametrization. This new viscous correction also introduces a phenomenological parameter $\\gamma$ related to the microscopic interactions between particles. We investigate the performance of this new correction in the particlization process and systematically compare it to traditional viscous corrections to demonstrate its effects and the $\\gamma$ dependence on final state observables. The findings provide insights into the particlization process, advancing our understanding of how viscous corrections impact phenomenological analyses of anisotropic flow and hadronic chemistry and offering a pathway for more systematic models of heavy-ion collisions.",

          "description": "Hadronisation is the complex process by which hadrons form from partons. Due to its non-perturbative nature, an exact theoretical description is unavailable, making phenomenological assumptions necessary. Currently, various hadronisation models are implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator PYTHIA 8.311. In this poster, we discuss tuning these hadronisation models using Professor [1] to better reproduce data on strange hadron production relative to pions as a function of multiplicity, as measured by the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions [2].\r\nThe first model considered is the Rope Hadronisation model, based on the idea that in high-density string environments, increased string tension enhances strange hadron production [3]. This model has not previously been tuned with ALICE strangeness data. The second model is the more recent Close Packing model, which modifies string tension similarly but does not require space-time modelling of string breaking [4].\r\nResults using the Rope Hadronisation model reproduce strange mesons and multi-strange baryons as a function of multiplicity with $5-10\\%$ precision. This new tuning significantly improves the $\\Lambda/K^{0}_{S}$ and $\\Lambda/\\pi$ ratios, reducing previous discrepancies with ALICE data from $15-40\\%$ to more acceptable ranges. However, the $p/\\pi$ ratio remains inconsistent with the data despite tuning.\r\nA first complete tuning of the Close Packing model is also presented. This model reproduces nearly all particle ratios as a function of multiplicity within one standard deviation, with improved agreement for the $p/\\pi$ ratio compared to the Rope Hadronisation model, though some deviations persist.\r\nThese results demonstrate the ongoing challenges of accurately modelling both strange and non-strange light-flavour hadrons, highlighting limitations in current hadronisation models.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n[1] Andy Buckley, Hendrik Hoeth, Heiko Lacker, Holger Schulz, and Jan Eike von Seggern.

          "description": "During the data-taking campaigns Run 1 and Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the ALICE collaboration recorded a large amount of proton-proton (pp) collisions across a variety of center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s\\,}$). This extensive dataset is well suited to study the energy dependence of particle production. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a powerful regression tool to capture underlying multidimensional correlations inherent in the data. DNNs are used to parametrize recent ALICE measurements of multiplicity ($N_{\\mathrm{ch}}$)- and transverse momentum ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$)-dependent charged-particle spectra. This new approach allows extrapolating the measurements towards higher $N_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ values as well as to unmeasured $\\sqrt{s\\,}$, providing data-driven references for future heavy-ion measurements. \r\nIn this poster, we present the current status of the analysis and discuss the potential and limitations of using DNNs to model complex multidimensional data, comparing the results to those from event generators.",

          "description": "We evaluate the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficients in a hot magnetized medium for the most general scenario of any arbitrary values of the external magnetic field. We choose to work with the systematic way of incorporating the effect of the magnetic field, by using the effective gluon and quark propagators, generalized for a hot and magnetized medium. To get gauge independent analytic form factors valid through all Landau levels, we apply the hard thermal loop technique for the resummed effective gluon propagator. The derived effective hard thermal loop gluon propagator and the generalized version of Schwinger quark propagator subsequently allow us to analytically evaluate the longitudinal and transverse momentum diffusion coefficients for charm and bottom quarks beyond the static limit. Within the static limit we also explore another way of incorporating the effect of the magnetic field, i.e. through the magnetized medium modified Debye mass and compare the results to justify the need for structural changes.\r\n\r\nBased on : Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 3, 034013",

The interest in N-point energy correlation functions (ENC) has been revitalized for studying QCD, due to their distinct resolution of scales that helps in exploring QCD from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes. Recently a result has been presented for the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in e+e- collisions spanning from the collinear limit all the way to the back-to-back limit, providing vital input to the study of QCD. In this poster, we will discuss new analyses of N-point correlators from the ALEPH e+e− dataset at LEP as well as future prospects.",

          "description": "In most fields of science, visualizations help to understand concepts and to identify potential issues. For these reasons, animations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide interesting visual insights into the simulation software used as well as the time evolution of the collisions. In our work, we produce animations for collisions at several beam energies below 200 GeV for different impact parameters and collision systems. The underlying software for our animations are the relativistic transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) and the SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid approach. SMASH constitutes an effective solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and is suitable for the dynamical description of collisions at low beam energies. The SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid approach mainly combines SMASH, which is used to describe the non-equilibrium phases of a collision, with vHLLE, a software for the simulation of relativistic hydrodynamics. The latter is employed to describe the fluid phase of the hot and dense fireball. This approach is suitable for collisions at higher beam energies. Each visualization is based on the output of a single event from SMASH or the SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid and is animated using the open-source software ParaView.",

          "description": "The Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) is the first downstream detector of the fixed-target CBM experiment at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It enables high-precision tracking of low-momentum particles in direct proximity of the target, e.g., the first out of four planar stations is placed only 8 cm downstream the interaction point. Thus, minimizing the material budget while operating the dedicated CMOS (MAPS) pixel sensors called MIMOSIS in the moderate target chamber vacuum is challenging. Each detector plane will feature a material budget x/X0 ranging between 0.3 and 0.5%. The harsh radiation environment of up to 7・10^13 n_eq/cm^2 and 5 Mrad per CBM running year poses challenging constraints on the choice of technologies and materials employed, and in particular on the sensors. Stable sub-0° C operation to maintain high detection efficiency and low fake rate is mandatory.\r\nThe contribution will highlight the technological challenges w.r.t. the CMOS pixel sensor and its integration in dedicated detector stations featuring full geometrical acceptance and minimum material budget for operation in vacuum. The status of the detector R&D and pre-production will be reviewed.",
