      "Speaker": "shengli huang",

      "Country": "PHENIX Collaboration",
      "Abstract": "The number of quark ($n_q$) scaling, which is manifested\r\nas $v^{hadron}_{2}(p_T) \\approx n_q*v_2(p_T/n_q)$, is an\r\napproximate scaling that comes from the addition of the valence\r\nquark momenta at hadronization. The observation of $n_q$ scaling\r\nhas been claimed that a partonic matter with quark-like degrees\r\nof freedom and significant collectivity has been generated in\r\nheavy ion collisions~\\ref{1,2}. However, there are several\r\ntheoretical considerations that suggest that the $n_q$ scaling\r\nshould be violated in certain conditions. For example, the\r\ncontribution of sea quarks and gluons have been shown to affect\r\nthe $n_q$ scaling in the models including higher Fock states. And\r\nmodels that consider recombination between \"thermal\" and \"shower\"\r\npartons predict centrality dependent deviations from $n_q$\r\nscaling.\r\n\r\n   Understanding the limits of the recombination domain is important\r\nin relation to viscous hydrodynamics and the extraction of the\r\nshear viscosity over entropy density ($\\eta/s$) from the data, as\r\nwell as for developing a unified approach in describing jet energy\r\nloss and high $p_T$ $v_2$. Searches for deviations from $n_q$\r\nscaling are also important for the low-energy scan program at RHIC\r\nas they have been considered as a signature of the transition\r\nbetween sQGP formation and a hadronic system. In this talk, we\r\nwill report on high-statistics measurements of the second order\r\nFourier coefficient $v_2$ for identified pions, kaons and protons,\r\nwhich extend to relatively high $p_T$ around 6 GeV/c. Comparisons\r\nwith published measurements of $K^{0}_{S}$ and $\\Lambda$ are shown\r\nfor the different centralities. With these new measurements, the\r\n$p_T$ limits and centrality dependence of the $n_q$ scaling\r\ndeviations are being carried out in PHENIX.\r\n\r\n[1]V. Greco, C. M. Ko, and P. Levai, Phys. Rev.

However, not only the location, but even the existence has not yet been settled.  In this talk, we show that the critical points are forbidden in flavor-symmetric QCD at finite \\mu for any nonzero quark mass, as long as the coordinate (T, \\mu) is outside the pion condensed phase in the corresponding phase diagram of QCD at finite isospin chemical potential \\mu_I = 2\\mu, if the two and higher quark loops are negligible in the thermodynamic potential and the correlation functions (The large-Nc QCD naturally satisfies this condition).\r\n\r\nReference\r\nY.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Well-calibrated penetrating probes are essential for investigating the properties of the hot, dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. One such probe are hadrons which carry heavy flavor (charm and bottom quarks). They are a powerful tool for studying the medium because they are generated early in the reaction and subsequently propagate through the created matter.\r\n\r\nTwo very striking results have already been seen for open heavy flavor from the PHENIX experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm or bottom quarks.  First, heavy mesons, despite their large mass, exhibit a suppression at high transverse momentum compared to that expected from p+p interactions. This suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium. Secondly, an elliptic flow is observed for heavy mesons which is comparable to that of light mesons like pions. This imply that the same heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow—giving new insight into the strongly coupled nature of the QGP fluid at these temperatures. In these early results, PHENIX was not able to distinguish electrons from c and b independently. In order to understand these medium effects in more detail it is imperative to directly measure the nuclear modification and the flow of c and b separately.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the silicon vertex tracker, VTX, to PHENIX these direct measurements are now possible. We will present the latest PHENIX measurements of single electrons from beauty and charm decays, emphasizing the flow, v2, and nuclear modification factor, RAA, including the latest progress with the VTX.",

      "Abstract": "A remarkable result from heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider is that, shortly after the collision event, the quark-gluon plasma produced behaves as a nearly ideal liquid.   Understanding the dynamics responsible for such rapid \"hydroization\" is a challenge using traditional perturbative field theory.   In recent years holography has emerged as a powerful tool to study non-equilibrium phenomena, mapping the dynamics of certain quantum field theories onto the dynamics of semi-classical gravity. Via holography, the production of quark-gluon plasma maps onto the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation, with the relaxation of the black hole's gravitational field encoding hydroization of the dual quark gluon plasma.  Thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma is encoded in the thermalization of the black hole's Hawking radiation.  I will describe several processes which mimic heavy ion collisions and present results for both hydroization and thermalization times and mechanisms.",

This observable is not ideal for detailed quenching measurements as the final state hadrons are only relatable to the jet through the fragmentation. More recently, measurements of fully reconstructed jets have been performed at the LHC. This talk presents the latest experimental results from the ATLAS collaboration on jet suppression. These results establish qualitative features of the jet quenching mechanism as experimental fact and provide constraints on models of jet energy loss.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The hot and dense nuclear matter created in nuclear collisions at relativistic energies consists of a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons. Due to their large mass, the charm quarks are mainly formed in the first instants of the nuclear collision and will consequently experience the full history of the system. It was predicted that the strongly bound J/Ã state will be suppressed in the hot and deconfined quark-gluon plasma due to the color screening effect. This effect was already observed in Au-Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC. It was also predicted that high production yields of charm quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and especially at LHC energies will make possible (re)combination thus possibly leading to J/psi enhancement compared to lower energy nuclear collisions and to pp collisions.\r\nALICE measures the J/psi at mid-rapidity, |y| < 0.9, down to zero transverse momentum. The reconstruction is performed using the J/psi decay into the di-electron channel. The electron identification is done using energy loss in gaseous detectors (the Time Projection Chamber and the Transition Radiation Detector) and the time-of-flight method (Time Of Flight detector). We will present the J/psi nuclear modification factor as a function of the collision centrality. Discussions and comparisons to theoretical calculations will be provided. First results and perspectives on the J/psi production with respect to the event plane (elliptic flow) will also be shown.",

However, auto-correlations not related to initial geometry, commonly referred to as non-flow effects, can contribute to these coefficients, hence need to be systematically suppressed. We present comprehensive measurements of coefficients v_2-v_6 using the event plane method and two-particle correlations method in broad p_T, eta and centrality ranges using the Pb-Pb data from the ATLAS experiment. The phase space regions where the two methods are consistent and where they disagree are explored, and the role of harmonic flow, path-length dependence of jet quenching, and non-flow effects in different part of the phase space are clarified. These detailed measurements provide new insights into the hydrodynamic picture at low pT, the jet energy loss picture at high pT, and the nature of the fluctuations in the initial geometry; they also provide a natural explanation for the \"ridge\" structures observed in two-particle correlation functions.",

      "Abstract": "The correlations of jets with neutral bosons is a particularly powerful tool to probe the underlying physics of jet quenching.  To gain insight into the physics of this process we can study Z-jet and gamma-jet correlations. Because the Z and photons do not directly couple to the strong force, in a jet+boson event the unmodified bosons allow us to access the modification of the opposite side jet; unlike dijet events, where both jets potentially lose energy, these bosons provide an excellent calibration of the energy of the recoil jet. The jets are measured in the same calorimeter, over a range of jet radii, and benefit from the detailed information about the shower profile. The ATLAS experiment has measured jet correlations with both direct photons as well as with Z bosons via dilepton channels in Pb+Pb collisions with sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV in a data sample of nearly 150 ub^-1 of integrated luminosity. The measurement of these correlations will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "Higher moments of net-baryon are suggested to be sensitive probe of QCD critical end point [1] in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Their critical fluctuations are highly interesting and instructive for the exploration of QCD phase diagram from both theoretical and experimental sides. \r\n     According to the universality of critical behavior, the QCD critical end point, and the chiral phase transition in two-flavor QCD are argued to be the same universality class of 3 dimensional Ising model [2], and O(2), or O(4) model[3], respectively. The generic structures of net-baryon fluctuations at QCD critical end point and chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential can be discussed by the order-parameter fluctuations in Ising model and the energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) model [4,5]. So in the present work, the higher moments of order parameter and energy from 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models near the critical temperature at finite size are systematically studied, and compared with those obtained from effective models, and Lattice QCD calculations.   \r\n     It is found that the generic structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models are similar. So do energy fluctuations. On the other hand, the singular structures of order parameter fluctuations appear at lower moments, e.g., the oscillation structures of 4th moment of order parameter, which may reflect the generic structure of 4th order moment of baryon number in the vicinity of critical end point, are similar to the 3rd moments of energy, which corresponding to the 6th moment of net-baryon number at chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential. This means that even higher moments, such as 6th moments of net-baryon number, are necessary in probing the chiral phase transition temperature, the same as what suggested in ref. [5].\r\n     The generic singular structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising and energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) models are qualitatively consistent with corresponding estimations of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [6], Linear Sigma model [7], Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [8], Polyakov Quark Meson models [9], and current lattice QCD calculations [10]. \r\n\r\n[1] M.A. Stephanov, Phys.

      "Abstract": "Recently harmonic flow coefficients v_1-v_6 have been measured in heavy-ion collisions at LHC. The magnitude of these coefficients and their centrality dependence suggest that they are associated with the various shape components in the initial geometry, arising from fluctuations of the participating nucleons in the overlap region. The orientation of these harmonic flow (event plane or Psi_n) are generally correlated due to the correlations between the original shape components in the initial geometry; the correlations between event plane can also be generated dynamically during the hydrodynamic evolution of the medium. We present first measurements of various event plane correlations involving Psi_2 to Psi_6 in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The large detector acceptance of ATLAS, i.e. calorimeter covering -5<eta<5 and tracking detector covering -2.5<eta<2.5, allows for a precise measurement of these correlations. The procedure for obtaining these correlations and the detailed comparison of the results obtained from sub-events in different eta ranges are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The major long-term goal of the ALICE experiment at the LHC is to provide precision measurements of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, the state of deconfined matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Experiments towards the characterisation of strongly interacting matter at high density will need to focus on rare probes and the study of their collective properties and hadronization, particularly at soft momentum scales. Such considerations have motivated the development of a comprehensive upgrade strategy for ALICE to provide high rate capability (50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions) in a near minimum bias mode by building a new Inner Tracking System and by modifying all major ALICE detectors to provide a fully pipelined read-out. This implies also a major upgrade of the data acquisition and high level trigger system. Further details of the overall ALICE upgrade strategy are described in [1]. This contribution will describe the proposed approach to upgrading the Inner Tracking System (ITS) in order to both comply with the new requirements set by the ALICE global upgrade strategy and to dramatically improve the performance for heavy-flavour detection. The ITS Upgrade will have greatly improved features in terms of: determination of the distance of closest approach (dca) to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low pt, momentum resolution and readout capabilities. These improvements are possible as a consequence of the spectacular progress made in the field of imaging sensors over the last ten years as well as the possibility to install a smaller radius beampipe. Moreover a tracker with the above features, in particular a high standalone tracking efficiency, creates an opportunity to perform, in combination with the TRD and TOF detectors, online event selection on the basis of topological and PID criteria. Such a new silicon tracker will allow ALICE to measure charm and beauty production in Pb-Pb collisions with sufficient statistical accuracy down to very low transverse  momentum, measure charm baryons and perform exclusive measurements of beauty production. A comprehensive description of the ITS Upgrade can be found in the recent Conceptual Design Report [2].\r\n\r\n[1] Upgrade Strategy for ALICE at High Rate, CERN-LHCC-2012-04.\r\n[2] Conceptual Design Report for the Upgrade of the ALICE ITS, CERN-LHCC-2012-05.",

Similar to the forward dihadron correlation in dAu collisions measured at RHIC, the Drell-Yan type correlation also implies a strong suppression of the away side hadron at forward rapidity due to the strong interaction between the forward quark from the projectile proton and the  gluon  density from the target nucleus. Another feature of this process is that the correlation contains a double-peak structure in the away side, which makes it a unique observable.",

      "Abstract": "As the foundation of high energy hadronic physics, QCD factorization enables us to separate the short distance perturbative physics from the long distance non-perturbative effects. Its prediction power relies on the universality of the parton distributions among different processes. In our recent publication [1], we established an effective factorization in hard processes in nuclei scattered by a dilute probe. This factorization enables us to identify the key observables to probe the so-called unintegrated gluon distributions, the central objects in the saturation framework. This has been a long-standing issue in small-x physics. From our studies, we found that the dijet-correlations in deep inelastic scattering of electron-nucleus collisions directly measure the Weizacker-Williams gluon distribution function, whereas the photon-jet correlation in nucleon-nucleus (pA) collisions probes the dipole gluon distribution. The dijet (di-hadron) correlations in pA collisions can probe both gluon distributions. Current experiments in deuteron-gold (dAu) collisions at RHIC, and future pA collisions at LHC, and the planed electron-ion collider (EIC) experiments, will provide great opportunities to study two-particle collisions and the associated strong interaction dynamics of the gluon distributions in cold nucleus at small-x. \r\n\r\nRecently, both STAR and PHENIX collaborations have reported the measurements of two-hadron correlations in the forward direction of dAu collisions at RHIC [2], where the strong de-correlation of the away-side hadron have been considered as the best evidence for saturation physics. The numeric calculations based on our factorization formalism provides a quantitative and thorough description of the experimental data in the saturation formalism [3], including the large broadening of the angular distribution and suppression of the peak for the away-side hadron. The disappearing of the away-side peak in central collisions indicates that the saturation scale is the same order as the hard jet transverse momentum, which is a clear signal of the onset of the saturation. From the kinematics, we conclude that the saturation scale reaches 2GeV at x~6x10-4 in the center of the gold nucleus with jet transverse momentum kt~3GeV at rapidity 3.2. Future measurements at RHIC and LHC and the planed EIC will provide more information and help to map out the complete phase structure of the cold nuclei matter at small-x. \r\n\r\n[1] F.

For example, $v_{5(23)}/(\\epsilon_2\r\n\\epsilon_3)$ records the $v_5$ generated by the non-linear interactions between $v_2$ and $v_3$. Ideal and viscous hydrodynamic calculations show that the non-linear response becomes dominant for n=4 and n=5 in non-central collisions.

Hydrodynamic model calculation reports that the shape by the initial fluctuation resulting in triangular component may be preserved until freeze-out. The HBT measurement relative to higher order event plane may show the feature if this is the case. \r\nWe will present the recent results of azimuthal HBT measurement relative to 2^{nd} and 3^{rd} order event plane in Au+Au 200 GeV collisions at PHENIX. Eccentricity at freeze-out for charged pions and kaons will be compared and discussed. Also, triangularity at freeze-out for charged pions will be reported. The recent HBT measurement at lower energies will also be shown, and compared with 200GeV results.",

In particular, higher harmonic flow measurements plays an important role in constraining theoretical model calculations describing properties of the matter.\r\n\r\n The silicon vertex tracker (VTX) was installed into the PHENIX experiment in 2010 and it successfully collected approximately 5 billion events of Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV in 2011 RHIC run. The VTX is a four-layer silicon tracker and it can reconstruct charged particle tracks in a wide range of pseudo-rapidity (|eta|<  1.2) and almost 2 pi in phi. With this capability, it can measure elliptic flow v2 and higher harmonics flow (v3, v4, ...) of charged hadrons in a wide eta range.\r\n\r\n The main function of the VTX is separation of heavy flavor hadrons,\r\ncharm and bottom. By identifying electrons with PHENIX central detectors, higher harmonic flow of electrons from heavy flavor decay can be determined over a broad pT range.\r\n\r\n In this talk, we will present measurement results on v2 and higher\r\nharmonic flow of charged hadrons and heavy flavor electrons, as well\r\nas comparison with theoretical models.",

Many important questions in heavy-ion physics will, however, remain unanswered in this first running period up to 2017. Only by increasing the luminosity beyond 10^27 and exploiting recent advances in technology ALICE will be able to address the new and remaining scientific challenges. ALICE is therefore setting up a program of detector upgrades, to be installed in the LHC shutdown planned for 2018. The planned upgrades will give access to otherwise unreachable rare processes, in particular observables involving heavy quarks and quarkonia at low transverse momentum, but also low-mass dileptons, selected topics in photon-jet physics with identified particles, and the search for heavy nuclear states. The potential of unique low-x measurements is also investigated. We will discuss examples of the scientific frontiers and the strategy of ALICE to address them.

However, there are other effects that may affect the observed quarkonia production, such as cold nuclear matter effects, final state nuclear absorption and statistical coalescence of quark-antiquark pairs. Studies of production of various quarkonia states in heavy-ion collisions can provide insight into the properties of the hot and dense medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Systematic measurement of the quarkonia production for different colliding systems, centralities and collision energies may help to understand the quarkonia production mechanisms as well as the medium properties. Furthermore, at RHIC energies the $\\Upsilon$ meson is a clean probe of the early system due to negligible contributions from $b$-$\\bar{b}$ recombination and non-thermal suppression from co-mover absorption.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present results on J/$\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production via the dielectron decay channel in Au+Au, $d$+Au and $p+p$ collisions at midrapidity at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in the STAR experiment.

The p_t -differential production yields in the range 2 < pt < 16 GeV/c at central rapidity, |y| < 0.5, were used to calculate the nuclear modification factor. A suppression of a factor 3–4 for transverse momenta larger than 5 GeV/c in the 20% most central collisions was observed.

      "Abstract": "The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program aims to study the QCD phase diagram. The main focus is to search for signals of the hypothesized critical point and the onset of the quark-hadron phase transition. The BES program covers a large part of the QCD phase diagram ($T$ vs.$mu_{B}$). With its uniform acceptance and excellent particle identification, STAR has collected large event samples in the $mu_{B}$ range 100-400 MeV. This makes it possible to study, in addition to the energy dependence, the centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters such as temperature, baryon chemical potential, and radial collectivity.\r\n\r\nWe present the first results on the centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV from the STAR experiment. The chemical freeze-out conditions are obtained by comparing the measured particle ratios at midrapidity (involving $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_{s}$, $p(\\bar{p})$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$) to those from the statistical-thermal model calculations (THERMUS). We observe a clear centrality dependence in both $T$ and $mu_{B}$ values at the lower beam energies (11.5 and 7.7 GeV). Whereas no such dependence is observed for higher beam energies (200 - 62.4 GeV). The implications of including multi-strange hadrons and choosing different ensembles (Grand canonical versus Strangeness canonical) in THERMUS model on the $T$ and $mu_{B}$ values will be discussed.  The kinetic freeze-out parameters are obtained by fitting the invariant yields of the produced particles ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, and $p(\\bar{p})$), as a function of transverse momentum, to the Blast-Wave and Tsallis models. The kinetic freeze-out temperature and the radial collectivity which shows an anti-correlation at all the energies studied will be presented.",

PHENIX is planning a large upgrade for the next decade, sPHENIX, to answer many of the questions spurred by our discoveries during the last decade. This sPHENIX upgrade includes replacing the central arm spectrometers with an open geometry solenoid surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry.  With this new open geometry, we plan to upgrade our detector at forward rapidities with additional calorimetry and tracking. The larger acceptance will improve our access to low-x distributions in heavy nuclei, extend our measurements of quarkonia in p+p, d+A, and A+A to more forward rapidities, and allow for measurements away from the Bjorken plateau expanding the study of the high energy heavy ion environment. In addition to heavy ion and cold nuclear matter measurements, the envisioned forward rapidity upgrade will allow for a more systematic approach to understanding the large transverse spin measurements seen at RHIC as well as serve as the baseline detector for a future eRHIC detector, ePHENIX.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, by performing the complete next-to-leading order calculation, we have demonstrated the one-loop factorization for inclusive hadron productions in pA collisions in the saturation formalism. The differential cross section is written \r\ninto a factorization form in the coordinate space at the next-to-leading order, while the naive form of the convolution in the transverse momentum space does not hold. The rapidity divergence with small-x dipole gluon distribution of the nucleus is factorized into the energy evolution of the dipole gluon distribution function, which is known as the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. Furthermore, the collinear divergences associated with the incoming parton distribution of the nucleon and the outgoing fragmentation\r\nfunction of the final state hadron are factorized into the splittings of the associated parton distribution and fragmentation functions, which allows us to reproduce the well-known DGLAP equation. The hard coefficient function, which is finite and free\r\nof divergence of any kind, is evaluated at one-loop order. This result is important, not only for the phenomenological applications to the inclusive hadron production in p-A collisions at RHIC and future LHC experiment, but also for theoretically promoting \r\nthe rigorous developments towards a complete QCD factorization in small-x physics.",

We will show that the freeze-out strangeness and electric charge chemical potentials can be fixed by imposing  strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints in the lattice QCD calculations. Further, we will present how the freeze-out baryon chemical potential and the freeze-out temperature can be determined by comparing lattice QCD results for various ratios of conserved charge susceptibilities with the corresponding ratios of moments of conserve charge fluctuations that are currently being measured by the STAR experiment.

The lattice QCD Equation of State is now an essential requirement for the correct hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions. Lattice QCD provides first-principle calculations with physical results recovered in the continuum limit. Thus, understanding of the discretization effects is of great importance. I report on recent progress by the HotQCD collaboration in studying the 2+1 flavor Equation of State on lattices with the temporal extent Nt=6, 8, 10 and 12 in Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) discretization scheme. In the low-temperature phase, where the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is expected to be a good approximation, a comparison of HRG and lattice results is also presented.

      "Abstract": "The hot and dense fireball produced in high energy heavy ion collisions, such as that at RHIC, exhibits complicated dynamics and time evolution.  Thermal photons have a negligible cross-section with the medium and so pass through unmodified, thus measuring their properties gives access to the entire time evolution of the fireball.  Thermal photons are expected to be observable at low momentum. They compete in yield with photons from hadron decays and, at high momentum (above roughly 4 GeV), direct photons that result from initial hard scatterings of partons in the colliding nuclei.  PHENIX has measured the yield of direct photons in Au+Au collisions, as well as the baseline measurements in p+p and d+Au.  Recently PHENIX has also measured elliptic flow of direct photons.  The latest results on low momentum direct photons will be discussed, including measurements of real photons using photon conversions and a novel method to reduce systematic uncertainties.",

While p+p collisions are used as a baseline for comparison with heavier collision systems and provide a cross check for pQCD calculations, d+Au collisions are used to study cold nuclear matter effects for mesons and baryons and their dependence on particle mass and flavor. Heavy ion collisions provide an insight into effects of quark recombination and jet quenching. Experimental measurements reveal if strange particles are suppressed at high transverse momentum ($p_T$) similarly to light hadrons and if the quark recombination mechanisms boosts strange hadron production at intermediate $p_T$. The PHENIX experiment provides excellent capabilities to measure particles with strangeness content over a wide $p_T$ range using a combination of different analysis techniques. \r\n  In this talk we present the latest PHENIX result on production of K$^\\pm$, K$_s$, K*, $\\phi$ and $\\Lambda$ which considerably extend the  $p_T$ range for p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV.

We use full or HTL self-energies in appropriate regimes, resumming each in order to find the leading large-L behavior.  We estimate the jet quenching parameter and compare to results in the literature. And, we compare P(k_perp) at weak coupling to the P(k_perp) expected from holographic calculations that presume the quark-gluon plasma to be strongly coupled at all length scales.  We find that the weak coupling and strong coupling results need not differ greatly at modest k_perp, but we find that P(k_perp) must be parametrically larger in a weakly coupled plasma than in a strongly coupled plasma at large enough k_perp.  By looking for rare large-angle deflections of the jet resulting from a parton produced initially back-to-back with a hard photon, experimentalists can find the weakly coupled quark and gluon short-distance constituents of the strongly coupled liquid quark-gluon plasma, much as Rutherford found the nuclei within atoms or Friedman, Kendall and Taylor found the quark within nucleons.",

      "Abstract": "Many recent lattice QCD calculations predict that there may be a first order phase transition from hadronic matter to a Quark-Gluon Plasma that ends in a critical point, with a continuous phase transition on the other side of the critical point. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has conducted a program to probe different regions of the QCD phase diagram in the vicinity of the possible critical point with a beam energy scan. During 2010 and 2011, \r\nRHIC provided Au+Au collisions to PHENIX at $\\sqrt(s_NN)=$ 200 GeV, \r\n62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, 27 GeV, 19.6 GeV, and 7.7 GeV.  Analysis of the data concentrates on two strategies: looking for signs of the onset of deconfinement by comparing to results at the top RHIC energy, and searching for direct signatures of a critical point.\r\n\r\nResults presented will include the following: charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity, transverse energy production at mid-rapidity, energy loss via the $R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$ observables from a variety of identified particles including neutral pions and the $J/\\psi$, collective flow measurements ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, $v_{4}$) from various particles including neutral pions, charged hadrons, and identified particles in order to examine the validity of the number of constituent quark scaling at lower energies, higher moments of the net charge distribution, and fluctuations of the charged particle multiplicity.",

      "Abstract": "The collective flow of charged hadrons emitted in heavy ion collisions can be characterized using the Fourier coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow), as well as with the higher order coefficients, $v_3$, $v_4$, etc, which result primarily from fluctuations in the initial conditions of the colliding nuclei.The latter is of paramount importance since it can provide insight on the hydrodynamic behavior of the medium, as well as constraints for reliable extraction of transport coefficients. For example, $v_3$ has been critical in discriminating between different models and the application of viscocity. In recent measurements, PHENIX has extracted $v_{2,3,4}$ coefficients for charged hadrons via two independent methods.\r\nThe first correlates the azimuthal distribution of particles at mid-rapidity in the central arm of PHENIX with event planes determined by the detectors widely spaced in pseudorapidity to avoid non-flow effects. \r\nThe second method is a two particle correlation between a charge weighted azimuthal angle in the Beam Beam Counters and the azimuthal angle of a track in the central arms of the PHENIX detector. Again, the pseudorapidity gap is present to avoid non-flow effects. This method has the added benefit of not requiring that the reaction plane angle be determined. \r\nThese coefficients, measured as a function of the number of particpating nucleons, centrality, and $p_T$ for charged hadrons, will be presented and compared to earlier measurements for Au+Au collisions at the same energy so as to see the effect of system size.",

The yields of these bosons in heavy ion collisions can be used for sensitive tests of binary scaling.

      "Abstract": "We propose a new mechanism for generating a single transverse spin \r\nasymmetry (STSA) in polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the high-energy scattering approximation. In this framework the STSA originates from the q -> q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function followed by a  perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks is in qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing projectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T, peaking near the saturation scale Q_s in our framework. Our mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton--nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton--proton collisions. We also observe that in our formalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.",

Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution, ranging from the second to the sixth component, are obtained using different analysis techniques, which have different sensitivities to non-flow and flow fluctuation effects. Utilizing a novel and unique high-pT single-track high-level trigger, the results are presented over a broad pT range up to approximately 60 GeV/c, as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality. These new data will provide essential information on both the hydrodynamic properties of the medium at low pT and path length dependence of in-medium parton energy loss at high pT. Dihadron correlations are measured over a wide acceptance and pT range. Long-range near-side (\"ridge\") correlation structures are observed from low pT (1 GeV/c) to very high pT (at least 20 GeV/c). Their connection to the single-particle azimuthal anisotropy is extensively investigated via the factorization studies of Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations. Short-range jet-like correlations are also systematically studied as a function of pT, pseudorapidity, centrality and compared to the results in pp collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The idea of using heavy quarkonia production as a direct probe of the screening length in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) has been around for over two decades. Suppression of quarkonia production in heavy ion collisions has been measured at the SPS, RHIC, and the LHC, including new measurements of $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX. However, a full understanding of these results in terms of direct contributions from the QGP is still evolving. An incomplete knowledge of the baseline cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, as well as the possibility of competing effects present in the QGP, such as recombination, has hindered a full understanding of the observed heavy ion results.\r\n\r\nIn order to quantify the CNM effects present at RHIC, PHENIX has measured both $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in $d$+Au collisions over a wide range in rapidity with the inclusion of new measurements of $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production at midrapidity. PHENIX finds a suppression relative to $p$+$p$ collisions which is greater at forward rapidity and similar between the $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$, leading to interesting implications of the RHIC heavy ion results. New measurements of the transverse momentum dependence of the $J/\\psi$ nuclear modification factor provide further constraints on CNM effects, as well as constraining the Cronin effect at RHIC energies.

      "Abstract": "The flexibility of RHIC to collide different nuclei provides experiments with a rich resource to systematically test models and scaling behaviors and compare the results to those from Au+Au collisions. For an initial evaluation of the Cu+Au collision system, PHENIX has earmarked several measurements for fast analysis, in particular, forward/backward and central-rapidity J/psi production.  These collisions promise an array of unique geometrical configurations including odd harmonics and events where the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au.  Such geometries present an opportunity to probe the \"core\" and \"corona\" regions of the collision (which are strongly asymmetric in Cu+Au) by measuring the reaction plane dependence of particle production.  J/psi production may be more sensitive to the least dense part of the collision at the surface - the corona - thus providing a handle of the relative size of the Cu- versus Au-side corona.  An important component of this analysis is the understanding of the light-hadron vn(n=1,2,3,4) and the correlation between the vn event planes in these collisions, which will reveal the underlying hydrodynamical properties of the system.  In particular, the odd harmonics from the Cu+Au system offer sensitivity to v3 generated from the collision geometry as opposed to fluctuations in a symmetric system.  The analysis status of the recently taken U+U collision data, which offers some of the same advantages as Cu+Au, as well as a wider range of energy densities, will also be presented.",

We show that the event-by-event hydrodynamics followed by statistical hadronization with proper charge conservation provides the crucial non-flow component and leads to agreement with the data at soft transverse momenta (p_T < 2 GeV). The fall-off of the same-side ridge follows from the fact that a pair of particles with opposite charges is emitted from the same fluid element, whose collective velocity collimates the momenta of the pair. Basic experimental features of the two-dimensional correlation functions are then represented, including the dependence on the relative charge (like-sign and unlike-sign pairs) and centrality.  Related quantities, such as the charge balance functions or the dependence of the harmonic flow coefficients on relative pseudorapidity, are also properly explained in our approach.",

      "Speaker": "Gyulnara Eyyubova",
      "Institute": "University of Oslo (NO)",
      "Country": "NO",
      "Abstract": "Recently significant effort is made to study azimuthal flow asymmetries in ultra-relativistic heavy ion reactions. At finite impact parameters the directed flow and the elliptic flow were dominant observables for many years.\r\n\r\nIn head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. In addition in head-on collisions the third harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, v_3, exceeds the second one, v_2, and becomes the dominant harmonic component in accordance with large fluctuations. The fact that high harmonics, measured up to v_8, survive the fluid dynamical expansion indicates that the QGP fluid is almost perfect, and does not absorb high-harmonics.\r\n\r\nFluctuations must also appear in the longitudinal direction, especially in peripheral reactions where the projectile and target spectators may not be exactly the same size. As a first step of our study, we estimate the Event-by-Event (EbE) c.m. rapidity fluctuations using a method based on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC)s. In peripheral reactions one can check if significant correlation between the EbE c.m. rapidities measured in the TPC and via the ZDCs do exist. This then leads to the possibility to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe first v_1 measurements at LHC [2] were also arising dominantly from random fluctuations as both the even and odd rapidity combinations gave the same result. As a second step, with the aim to determine the global asymmetry component of the directed flow v_1, we propose that the participant system Event-by-Event shifted from the Lab. c.m. frame to the measurable participant c.m. rapidity EbE, thus removing or minimizing the effect of random longitudinal fluctuations. Then following the global asymmetry the \"odd\" component of the directed flow can be separated and identified using this method.\r\n\r\nThis new method [3] enables us to separate fluctuating and the global symmetry components in the flow, which is important for the odd harmonics, especially for v_1 and v_3. Thus one can study experimentally the rotation effect [4] and the possible occurrence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability [5] in the globally symmetric component of the collective flow.\r\n\r\n[1] K.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Azimuthal anisotropic flows vn, arising from the anisotropic collision geometry, reflect the hydrodynamic properties of the quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A long standing issue in vn measurements is the contamination of nonflow, caused by intrinsic particle correlations unrelated to the collision geometry. Nonflow limits, in part, the precise extraction of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s from data-model comparisons. Isolation of flow and nonflow is critical to the interpretation of the Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we report measurements of vn azimuthal anisotropies using the two- and mult-particle Q-cumulants method from STAR in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. The centrality and pT dependence of vn will be presented. We compare the four- and six-particle cumulant measurements to gain insights on the nature of flow fluctuations [1,2]. We further analyze two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (eta) bins. Exploiting the collision symmetry about mid-rapidity, we isolate the \\Delta\\eta-dependent and \\Delta\\eta-independent correlations in the data with a data-driven method [3]. The \\Delta\\eta-dependent part arises from near-side nonflow correlations, such as HBT interferometry, resonance decays, and jet-correlations. The \\Delta\\eta-independent part is dominated by flow and flow fluctuations with relatively small contribution from away-side jet-correlations. The method does not make assumptions about the eta dependence of flow. Our isolated \\Delta\\eta-independent part from data, dominated by flow, however, is found to be also eta-independent within the STAR TPC of +-1 unit of pseudo-rapidity. The \\Delta\\eta drop in the measured two-particle cumulant appears to entirely come from nonflow. We assess the effect of the nonflow on eta/s extraction. We reexamine the high-pT triggered dihadron correlations with background subtraction of our decomposed flows. \r\n\r\n[1] S.A. Voloshin, A.M. Poskanzer, A. Tang, and G. Wang, Phys. Lett.

      "Abstract": "Direct photons are a powerful tool to study heavy ion collisions. Their production rates provide access to the initial state PDFs, which are expected to be modified by nuclear effects. They also provide a means to calibrate the expected energy of jets that are produced in the medium, and thus are a tool to probe the physics of jet quenching more precisely both through jet rates and fragmentation properties. The ATLAS detector measures photons with its hermetic, longitudinally segmented calorimeter, which gives excellent spatial and energy resolution, and detailed information about the shower shape of each measured photon. This gives powerful rejection against the expected background from neutral pions coming from jets. Rejection against jet fragmentation products is further enhanced by isolation criteria, which can be based on calorimeter energy or the presence of high pT tracks. First results on the rates of isolated direct photons from approximately 140 µb-1 of lead-lead data will be shown, as a function of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality, and their rates compared to expectations from perturbative QCD.",

      "Speaker": "Karel Safarik",
      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "A baryon anomaly – an increase baryon-to-meson production ratio at intermediate transverse momenta in heavy-ion collisions when compared to proton–proton collisions – is observed at RHIC and the LHC. This effect is usually explained by recombination of constituent quarks during QGP hadronisation, or as a consequence of a strong radial flow developed during the heavy-ion collision. In this contribution, a different mechanism to favour baryon-over-meson production is proposed: when hadrons are formed in the recombination of nearby quarks and antiquarks, only colour-singlet combinations can be chosen. Hadron formation, in particular the probability to create baryons or mesons, depends on the distribution of colour charges among quarks. If the distribution is random – a reasonable assumption for Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) – the baryon-to-meson ratio is nearly twice higher than in the situation where quark colours are pre-arranged to obtain a white hadron in the combination of nearest quarks and antiquarks. The correlation of colour charges in the QGP also influences the distance over which recombination occurs. A study of the dependencies of the baryon-to-meson ratio and of the size of the recombination domain on the colour-correlation configuration will be presented.",

At leading order, photon production is determined by three processes: hard two-to-two collisions, collinear bremsstrahlung, and quark-conversions, i.e. a process where the incoming quark transfers almost all of its momentum to the produced photon and the final state quark is soft.  At NLO, wider angle bremsstrahlung must be treated carefully, and the LPM suppressed leading order rate smoothly matches onto two-to-three processes.  Similarly, asymmetric bremsstrahlung,  when  the photon carries a large momentum fraction of the incoming momentum and the final state quark is soft, must be smoothly matched onto the quark conversion process present at leading order. We carefully include these rates without double counting to determine the full photon production rate at NLO.",

      "Speaker": "Pol Gossiaux",

      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Recently, we have proposed a microscopic approach for the quenching and thermalisation of heavy quarks (HQ) in URHIC \\cite{Gossiaux:2008,Gossiaux:2009,Gossiaux:2010}, assuming that \r\nthey interact with light partons through both elastic and radiative processes evaluated by resorting to some parameterization of the running coupling constant, while those partons are spatially distributed along hydrodynamical evolution of the hot medium. This approach is able to explain successfully several observables measured at RHIC, such as the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of non-photonic single electrons. The diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks in the quark gluon plasma -- a fundamental property of this state of matter -- can thus be extracted and compared with recent lattice calculations. In this contribution, we discuss the predictions of our model for D and B mesons production in URHIC at LHC energies and confront them with experimental results obtained so far by ALICE and CMS collaborations for Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76~{\\rm TeV}$. \r\n\r\nThe slight excess of quenching found w.r.t. the D mesons data at LHC trigers our interest in new effects neglected up to now, such as the influence of gluon damping on radiative energy loss and its phenomenological consequences. In \\cite{Bluhm:2011}, we have indeed studied the effect of an absorptive medium on standard LPM \\cite{LPM} radiation in electrodynamics and have advocated that the large time needed for the photon formation in Bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic charges is not affordable if damping is taken into account. Similar effect manifests itself in QCD, as we have recently advocated in \\cite{Bluhm_2012}. In our QM contribution, we intend to concentrate on the {\\em implications} of such an effect on the quenching of particles in URHIC (discussing observables such as spectra, elliptic flow and azimutal correlations) as well as on the single electron puzzle.  \r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{Gossiaux:2008}\r\nP.B.

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC, heavy quarks are expected to be created from initial hard scatterings. Their large masses are not easily affected by the strong interaction with QCD medium, thus they carry clean information from the system at early stage. The interaction between heavy quarks and the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics, therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an ideal probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting QCD matter.\r\nIn this talk, we will present the STAR results of open charm hadron production at mid-rapidity in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Open charm mesons were reconstructed directly via hadronic decay channels with daughter particles identified by TPC and TOF detectors.  With abundant statistics of Au+Au collisions collected by STAR in the year 2010 and 2011, the D-meson is measured at $p_T$ from 0.2 to 8 GeV in minimum bias Au+Au collisions. The centrality dependence of D-meson $p_T$ spectra as well as the nuclear modification factor will be presented. A first measurement of the $D^{0}$ elliptic flow in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be reported. These measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations and physics implications will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the open charm hadron measurement in $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV $p+p$ collisions to study the energy dependence of charm production.",

      "Abstract": "Charmonium production in heavy ion collisions has been studied at different energies and with different collision systems over the last few decades, ever since the J/psi suppression induced by color screening of its constituent quarks was proposed as a signature of the formation of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions. The recent measurement of the J/psi production in Pb-Pb collisions at forward rapidity performed by ALICE at the LHC clearly showed less suppression with respect to SPS and RHIC results. The J/psi  elliptic flow v2 provides an important tool to test the degree of J/psi  thermalisation in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV. It may also help in understanding the J/psi (re)generation mechanism in the QGP, which is expected to play a more important role at LHC energies.\r\nWe present the elliptic flow of J/psi measured in the dimuon channel\r\nat forward rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4.0 ) with the ALICE muon spectrometer, down to zero transverse momentum. The centrality dependence of the pt-integrated elliptic flow will be discussed. In addition, the pt and rapidity dependence in several centrality classes will be presented, as well as the systematical studies based on using various methods for measuring the elliptic flow.

      "Abstract": "The recent jet measurements at RHIC and the LHC have challenged the heavy-ion community to a better understanding of jet fragmentation in the presence of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). \r\n\r\nJet fragmentation in vacuum is well described by perturbative QCD and is characterized by color coherence effects that lead to the angular ordering of successive branchings along the jet. To investigate the alteration of color coherence in jets in the QGP we study the radiation pattern of a  color-correlated quark-anti-quark antenna  which is in fact the building block of jet evolution in vacuum. \r\n\r\nWe show that in a dense medium the onset of coherence is governed by the hardest scale induced by the presence of the medium. In a medium of length $L$ and transport coefficient $\\hat q$ this can either be the typical transverse momentum broadening  of the gluon in the medium, $\\sqrt{\\hat q L}$, or the inverse of the size of the antenna as probed by the medium, namely  $r_\\perp^{-1}=(\\theta_{qq} L)^{-1}$, where $\\theta_{qq}$ is the opening angle of the antenna. Therefore, for $k_\\perp<max(\\sqrt{\\hat q L}, r_\\perp^{-1})$  we obtain complete decoherence of the antenna; for larger momenta color coherence is restored. \r\n\r\nWe expect the transition from color decoherence to coherence to play an important role in in-medium jet fragmentation.",

Fourier decompositions are performed, the jet-like peak is characterised, and identified particle ratios are studied in the jet-like peak and compared to those in the bulk.

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions produced at the LHC two-particle correlations\r\nof mesons and baryons carry important information about the emitting\r\nsource. At low relative momentum femtoscopic correlations arise, which\r\nare sensitive to the homogeneity lengths of the system. Hydrodynamic\r\nmodels predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse\r\nmass of the pair. Such decrease is universally reported for pions,\r\nalso at the LHC. Kaons and baryons, having a much larger mass, allow\r\nto significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The femtoscopic\r\nresults for heavier particles would put a strong constraint on such\r\npredictions. Non-identical baryon and meson pairs are also sensitive\r\nto emission asymmetries.\r\n\r\nFemtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to\r\nthe strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon\r\npair types. Most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction\r\nwhich has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of\r\nthe H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon\r\npotentials, which have a significant contribution from annihilation\r\nchannels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle\r\nspectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of\r\nthe small proton yield at the LHC.\r\n\r\nWe show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types\r\n(baryon-baryon, baryon-antibaryon and meson-meson), consisting of\r\nneutral and charged kaons, protons and lambdas.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Since heavy flavor quarks are produced early in the collision, they experience the full evolution of the medium and are thus a good probe of medium effects.  Electrons from open heavy flavor have previously been measured for p+p, Au+Au and d+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by PHENIX.  In the most central Au+Au the yield is suppressed relative to a Ncoll scaled p+p which suggests that the heavy quarks lose a significant portion of their initial energy in the medium.  A similar analysis done in the d+Au collisions suggests that there are cold nuclear matter effects that are masked by the hot, dense medium produced in the Au+Au collisions.  New results from Cu+Cu collisions provide an important look at the Ncoll region between the d+Au and Au+Au systems.  The Cu+Cu results will be shown for different centralities along with a comparison to the d+Au and Au+Au results.  The nuclear modification factor, RAA, will also be shown as a function of Ncoll, giving a more complete picture as the cold nuclear matter effects in d+Au collisions are taken over by the effects of the hot medium in the Au+Au system.",

Results have been obtained with the highly improved staggered quark action (HISQ) and almost physical quark masses on lattices with temporal extent of N_tau=6,8,12. Higher cumulants of the net-charge distributions are increasingly dominated by a universal scaling behavior, which is arising due to a critical point of QCD in the chiral limit. Considering cumulants up to the 6th order, we observe that they generically behave as expected from universal scaling laws, which is quite different from cumulants calculated within the hadron resonance gas model. Taking ratios of these cumulants, we obtain volume independent results that can be directly compared to the experimental measurements. Such a comparison will unambiguously relate the QCD transition temperature that has been determined on the lattice with, the freeze out temperature of the heavy ion collision at LHC and the 200 GeV RHIC run.",

Effects such as nuclear shadowing, Cronin enhancement, and initial-state parton energy loss, among others, are not only interesting in their own right, but have direct implications on QGP-related measurements in $A+A$ collisions.\r\n\r\nRecently PHENIX has measured CNM effects at midrapidity in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au collisions.  Measurements of reconstructed jets reveal the centrality dependence of both jet suppression and broadening of the away-side jet.  Meanwhile, single electrons from heavy flavor decays exhibit enhancement over a broad $p_T$ range and increasing with centrality.  These results will be presented and compared to our present understanding of CNM effects to see if simultaneous constraints on nuclear shadowing, initial state energy loss, and Cronin effects can be found.  The centrality dependence of the nuclear modification, for which there is no a priori model, will be examined in the context of available theoretical models of CNM effects, including the EPS09 nuclear-modified parton distribution functions.",

We search for possible effects of the initial high anisotropy of pressure on the final soft-hadronic observables. We find that by appropriate adjustment of the initial energy density and/or the initial pseudorapidity distributions, the effects of the initial anisotropy of pressure may be easily compensated and the final hadronic observables become insensitive to early dynamics. \r\nOur results indicate that the early thermalization assumption is not necessary to describe hadronic data, in particular, to reproduce the measured elliptic flow v2. The complete thermalization of matter (local equilibration) may take place only at the times of about 1–2 fm/c, in agreement with the results of microscopic models.\r\n\r\nWork based on recent publications:\r\n\r\n1.

Such modifications can be studied in d+Au collisions, and their understanding is crucial for interpreting heavy-ion data.\r\n\r\nPHENIX has measured the spectra of direct photons in different collision systems and at different energies, over a broad range of transverse momentum.

In p+p collisions, PHENIX has also measured isolated direct photons, as well as the fraction of direct photons from jet fragmentation.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the latest results on direct photon measurements, in heavy-ion collisions as well as in p+p and d+Au collisions, and compare the results with theoretical models.",

      "Abstract": "Angular di-hadron correlation studies in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV have revealed a nearisde elongated structure in delta eta. This is often referred to as the ridge, and was found to extend to delta eta 9 units at the LHC. Using preliminary STAR data [3], we discuss methods to decompose 2D di-hadron correlations in Au+Au 200 GeV collisions on the nearside. Our analysis is performed as a function of centrality and pT. We propose a model that encompasses azimuthal flow up to 4 orders (v1, v2, v3, and v4). The remainder of the correlation function is modeled via an asymmetric 2d Gaussian, which we refer to as non-flow. We find our model describes the data very well. The extracted flow parameters are compared to model predictions [4,5]. We investigate possible scalings for the Gaussian remainder, and compare it's properties to a similar structure observed in p+p 200 GeV collisions. These findings will help us shed on the production mechanism of the remainder. Finally, we will provide an estimate of the ratio of non-flow to flow as a function of centrality and pT, which will aid a variety of other flow studies at these energies.\r\n\r\n[1] B. I.

      "Speaker": "Sarah Campbell",
      "Institute": "I",
      "Country": "I",
      "Abstract": "The proposed MPC-EX detector is a Si-W preshower extension to PHENIX's existing Muon Piston Calorimeter (MPC).   The MPC-EX consists of eight layers of alternating W absorber and Si mini-pad sensors.  Located at large rapidities, 3.1 < |$\\eta$| < 3.8, the MPC-EX and MPC access low-x partons in the Au nucleus in d+Au collisions.  With the addition of the MPC-EX, the neutral pion reconstruction range extends to energies > 80 GeV, a factor of four improvement over current capabilities.  Not only will the MPC-EX strengthen PHENIX's existing forward $\\pi^0$ and jet measurements, it also provides the necessary $\\pi^0$ rejection to make a direct photon measurement feasible.  With this $\\pi^0$ rejection, direct photon yields at high $p_{T}$, $p_{T}$ > 3 GeV, can be statistically extracted using a double ratio method.  The direct photon $R_{dAu}$ measured with the MPC-EX will quantify the level of gluon shadowing or saturation in the Au nucleus at low-x, x ~ 10^-3, with a projected systematic error band a factor of four smaller than EPS09’s current allowable range.  Direct photons at forward rapidities are optimally sensitive to the gluon distribution because, unlike pions, direct photons are only produced by processes that are directly sensitive to the gluon distribution at leading order.  A measurement of the forward direct photon $R_{dA}$ will cleanly access and greatly expand our understanding of the gluon nuclear parton distribution functions and provide important information about the initial state in heavy ion collisions.",

Photons are produced at all stages of the colliding system and through decay of produced particles like neutral pions. The multiplicity measurement of photons on an event-by-event basis is an important measurement complementing the charged particle measurement in a heavy ion collision. Inclusive photon production at forward rapidity shows an energy-independent longitudinal scaling as observed at √sNN = 62.4 and 200 GeV [1,2]. Photons measurements at lower energies will be helpful in further testing the energy dependence of the longitudinal scaling.   \r\n         The Photon Multiplicity Detector in the STAR experiment measures inclusive photons in the pseudo-rapidity region −3.7 < η < −2.3.

One of the major new components of this upgrade will be a new compact electromagnetic calorimeter covering ±1 units in pseudorapidity and 2 in phi. It will consist of a matrix of tungsten plates, tungsten powder, scintillating fibers and epoxy formed into an accordion structure that will have a small Moliere radius and short radiation length, thus allowing the calorimeter to have a high degree of segmentation for measuring jets at a relatively small radius and providing a compact design for the sPHENIX detector. The scintillating fibers will be read out using silicon photomultipliers that will be required to operate in the fringe field of the sPHENIX solenoid magnet and will include a new electronic readout system. The overall design of the calorimeter will be described, along with the R&D effort currently under way to develop the detector and its expected performance based on Monte Carlo simulations.",

This is the first comparison between multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations and flow fluctuations in the same framework. The simultaneous investigation of these observables allows us to study the interplay of correlations induced by collision geometry and common points of production. We employ a framework of initial state Glasma flux tubes followed by later stage hydrodynamic flow modeled in a blast wave. Our approach has the advantage that we can test our calculations over a broad range of collision systems and energies and provide useful benchmarks for more rigorous event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. Our survey over these observables reveals a common energy and centrality dependence that we attribute to the production mechanism.

      "Abstract": "Particle production mechanisms vary with $p_T$.  At low $p_T$ soft processes dominate whereas hard processes dominate at higher $p_T$.  Experimental data has shown drastic change from d+Au to Au+Au collision in $p_T$ spectra, collective phenomena, and baryon/meson ratio at intermediate $p_T$.  This indicates that the relative mixture of particles produced by hard and soft processes differ between Au+Au and d+Au at a given, relatively low $p_T$ (< 2.0GeV).  It is therefore expected that the dihadron correlations will differ between d+Au and Au+Au with relatively low trigger particle $p_T$.  In this talk we present the near-side jet-like correlations in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV by STAR.  The jet-like results are obtained by the difference of small and large \\Delta\\eta correlations. We report the findings as a function of trigger and associated particle $p_T$, collision centrality, and Event Plane trigger orientation.  We find the $/sqrt{S_{NN}}=200$GeV d+Au and Au+Au near-side correlations to be identical even at trigger $p_T$ as low as 1.5 GeV/c.  The AMPT and HIJING models do not describe the data.

      "Abstract": "The time evolution of the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) created in relativistic heavy ion collisions can be described by hydrodynamical models. Hadrons are created at the freeze-out of this fluid, thus their distributions reveal information about the final state. To access the time evolution and the initial state, one needs either additional information about the Equation of State (EoS) of this matter, or one needs to analyze penetrating probes, such as direct photon observables. [1] In this talk we review recent hydrodynamic solutions, and show new exact, analytic solutions of hydrodynamics with arbitrary temperature dependent EoS. We investigate special cases of this class of solutions, in particular, we present exact hydrodynamical solutions with the Equation of State determined from lattice QCD calculations. [2] We calculate direct photon spectra, elliptic flow and HBT radii and compare them to recent direct photon measurements performed by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC [3].

The particle ratios serve as an important indicator of the collision dynamics [1]. These can be used to probe the process of hadronization in high energy collisions. In this poster, we will present measurements of mid-rapidity antiparticle to particle ratios in p + p collisions at sqrt(s)= 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. The charged pion and kaon particle ratios as well as the antiproton to proton ratios will be measured as a function of transverse momentum using the TPC detector. Charged hadrons will be identiﬁed by using speciﬁc ionization energy loss at the low momentum region (0.15 to 0.75 GeV) [2-3]. We will compare our results with the previous measurements made with same collision system at ISR energies [4]. Antiproton to proton ratio will be obtained after applying background corrections to the proton yields.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] H. Satz , Rep.Prog.Phys. 63 (2000) 151.\r\n[2] B. I.

      "Abstract": "Dielectron spectra in Au+Au collisions carry important information on the properties of the hot dense matter created in the early stage of the collisions. The earlier PHENIX measurement, using data taken in 2004 shows significant deviations from hadronic decay expectations. The most recent data set from 2010, taken with the the Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) upgrade designed to reduce the combinatorial background, promises to be a more significant result. This new data set requires an update to the simulations of hadronic cocktail contributions. The cocktail provides the benchmark for studying medium effects, such as the previously reported low mass excess. The new simulation takes into account improved PHENIX measurements of the cross sections for some of the hadrons (\\eta, \\phi, \\omega), as well as an improved line shape of the \\rho meson. In addition, it also includes the modified PHENIX acceptance and additional detector material. Results on the new cocktail and comparison with dielectron spectra will be shown.",

      "Abstract": "Azimuthal emission spectra of various hadron species in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx $ 200 GeV exhibit a curious hierarchy at intermediate $p_t$ ($\\approx 2-3$ GeV). Rather than being ordered by mass, the spectra seem to be ordered by whether the species is a baryon or meson. It is seen that when the elliptic flow $v_2$ and transverse momentum $p_T$ are both scaled by the number of quarks in each hadron, the spectra fall in line with each other [1]. This number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling suggests a system where the relevant degrees of freedom are colored partons as opposed to hadrons: the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Thus, a break down of this scaling as beam energy is reduced could be indicative of the QGP threshold. However, at lower energies, there is also an increase in the number of entrance-channel partons transported to mid-rapidity due to baryon stopping, which can also violate NCQ scaling, even above the QGP threshold [2]. We describe a specific pattern for the break down of the scaling that includes the observed difference in elliptic flow for positive and negative pions. \\\\\r\nWe also contrast baryon stopping with the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [3]--an alternative model for $\\pi_{+} / \\pi_{-}$ flow difference--and discuss results from tests that can distinguish between them.\r\n\r\n[1] Rainer J.

We also study the effect of magnetic field on flow. \r\nIn the presence of magnetic field plasma develops three acoustic modes. It is known in literature that\r\nthis distorts the CMB acoustic peaks. We show that flow coefficients in relativistic heavy ion collisions \r\ncan be significantly affected by these effects where a a strong magnetic field is known to be \r\npresent in the initial stages (of non-central collisions) and is expected to survive due to strong \r\ninduced fields in the conducting plasma.

It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  \r\n\r\nIn this investigation we study the energy loss for heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton proton collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy might lead to multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC and thus might lead to a deconfined phase. This gives rise to a non-negligible suppression of heavy quark yields in elementary collisions. We study the dependence of this phenomenon on various quantities, such as the deconfinement energy density and the multiplicity reached in proton proton collisions and discuss this measurement as a probe to pin down parameters of the deconfinement phase transition.\r\nThis study is published in Phys.Rev.Lett. 107 (2011) 032302.

The medium descriptions we compare are widely used in the field of heavy ion physics, ranging from elliptic fireball models to hydrodynamics.\r\n\r\nThus, by pinning down the energy loss mechanism with other existing approaches and measurements one can use this effect in order to differentiate between various medium descriptions and limit the parameter range of QGP modeling.",

For the first time, STAR has collected a large enough sample of rho mesons to study their diffractive interaction with Au nuclear targets in detail. The transverse momentum distribution of rho mesons is sensitive not only to the distribution of nucleons in the target, but the dominance of Pomeron exchange at RHIC energies makes this distribution sensitive to the gluon distribution in nuclei. We will describe our latest work on diffractive scattering of rho mesons on Au nuclei and its comparison to several calculations based on different gluon exchange mechanisms. We will also present recent results of the measurement of J/ψ photoproduction in 200 (GeV) AuAu collisions at RHIC. The pT distribution of the J/ψ mesons peaks at very low pT , consistent with expectations for coherent photoproduction.\r\nBoth the photoproduction cross section and the J/ψ rapidity distribution are expected to show the effects of gluon shadowing. We will present a measurement of the ratio of J/ψ to rho meson cross sections in 200 GeV AuAu collisions, as well as a distribution of J/ψ rapidity within | y |< 1. The measured results will be compared to theoretical models.",

      "Abstract": "A central goal of the heavy-ion program at LHC is to study the properties of the  quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The azimuthal anisotropy of particle production is a sensitive tool to study the features of the QGP. The anisotropy is typically characterized by $v_2$, the second harmonic coefficient of the Fourier series expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane. The observed $v_2$ is believed to be sensitive to different particle production mechanisms. At low transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm t}$) $v_2$ encodes the information of the expansion driven by the initial pressure gradients. At high $p_{\\rm t}$ it may be caused by path-length dependent parton energy loss. At intermediate $p_{\\rm t}$ it may be related to the mechanism of quark coalescence.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we present the $v_2$ measurements of $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ mesons using data from the 2011 heavy-ion run at the LHC. The neutral mesons are reconstructed using the ALICE Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), while the event plane is determined by the V0 detector. The measured $v_{2}$ is reported as a function of the transverse momentum for different centrality selections. In order to study the systematic uncertainty, the $v_2$ coefficient has been extracted using both the $dN/d#varphi$ method and invariant mass method. The determination of the event plane using different subdetectors in ALICE, as well as their resolution, are also explored and discussed.",

The bias of the EMCal trigger, which selects events with a shower in EMCal of energy greater than 3 GeV, is corrected to extract the jet cross-section.

      "Abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a plethora of new and exciting results in heavy-ion collisions emanating from the CERN and Brookhaven Laboratories.  These results have led to a sea change of the view on how the evolution of a high energy heavy-ion collision proceeds.  What has become apparent is that in order to validate claims of perfect fluidity, for example, the initial conditions at small-x need to be well understood.  Whilst d+A and p+A collisions provide a handle on some of these effects, for precision measurements and precise knowledge of the kinematics, e+A collisions become essential.\r\n\r\nA proposal has been developed at Brookhaven National Lab to add an electron accelerator to the current RHIC complex, providing for electron beams ranging from 5 GeV to 30 GeV. Complementing the programme on polarised e+p scattering, a broad programme on e+A physics is envisioned which will range from investigating saturation physics at low-x to hadronization at high-x.  In this poster, I will show the recent progress made on the golden measurements which were identified in the proceedings of the Fall programme at the INT [1].\r\n\r\n[1] “Gluons and the quark sea at high energies: Distributions, polarization and tomography.”,Eds D.

      "Institute": "Ohio State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectra and their anisotropy are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1]. Previous computations of photon emission spectra have been mostly carried out in a fully thermalized medium evolving dynamically under the influence of an equation of state with a first order phase transition. Today, a realistic state-of-the-art equation of state based on lattice QCD results and partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) in the hadronic phase is available for relativistic hydrodynamic simulations [2]. The non-zero chemical potentials will enhance thermal photon production rates in the hadronic phase by their corresponding non-equilibrium fugacity factor ~ e^{mu/T}. However, the breaking of chemical equilibrium below the quark hadron phase transition also changes the relation between temperature and energy density, which results in faster cooling evolution during the hadronic phase. This reduces the space-time volume for photon emission from the hadronic phase. In this work, we study PCE effects on the yields and the azimuthal anisotropies of produced thermal photons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, using a realistically evolving hydrodynamic medium. We study in detail the interplay between the chemical potential enhancement in the thermal photon emission rates and faster cooling evolution of the medium. We compare our calculations with data from RHIC, and make  predictions for measurements at the LHC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] M. Dion, J. F. Paquet, B. Schenke, C. Young, S. Jeon and C.

      "Abstract": "We present a systematic study on the evolution of hadron spectra and their azimuthal anisotropy from the lowest collision energy studied at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), √s = 7.7A GeV, to the highest energy reachable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), √s = 5500A GeV [1]. As the collision energy increases, the resulting increases of the initial temperature, and fireball lifetime, as well as the evolution of the centrality dependence of final charged particle multiplicity are quantitatively studied and compared between the two most popular initial state models, the Monte Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models. For Glauber model initial conditions with a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the differential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) is found to exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of √s around top RHIC energy, rendering it  almost independent of collision energy for 39 < √s < 2760A GeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations [2], this \"saturation\" of elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects. For color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger shear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar \"saturation\" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low pT. We emphasize that this \"saturation\" of the elliptic flow is not associated with the QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which shifts with √s depending on the fluid's viscosity and leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and decreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the √s range where v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) at fixed pT is maximal. By generalizing the definition of spatial eccentricity ecc_x to isothermal hyper-surfaces, we calculate ecc_x on the kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies. Up to top RHIC energy, √s=200A GeV, the fireball is still out-of-plane deformed at freeze out, while at LHC energy the final spatial eccentricity is predicted to approach zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chun Shen and Ulrich Heinz, \"Collision Energy Dependence of Viscous Hydrodynamic Flow in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions,'', arXiv:1202.6620 [nucl-th].\r\n \r\n[2] Gregory Kestin and Ulrich Heinz, \"Hydrodynamic radial and elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions from AGS to LHC energies,'' Eur.

Not only being the strongest magnetic field in the Universe (cf. ~ 10^11 T on the surface of magnetars), various consequences of physics interests are in discussion, including chiral magnetic effects, synchrotron radiation, and non-linear behaviors of QED e.g. photon splitting and real photon decaying into dileptons.  It should be however noted that the field itself is yet to be directly detected.  We evaluate the expected intensity and life time of the field, based on cascade and static models, and its possible effects on real/virtual photon anisotropy and polarization, based on QED calculations of photon vacuum polarization tensors.  A new approach to detect the field via direct virtual photon polarization is proposed and its experimental feasibilities at ALICE and PHENIX experiments are examined.",

      "Abstract": "We calculate a way to acquire some current quark mass from a general relativistic effect.  For a bare quark, we model that boundary conditions on the spacetime metric can plausibly couple the value of current quark mass to the charge, via external pressure (e.g., as supplied by a background field) at sub-fm length scales.  This mechanism acquires some (up to ~ 40%) current quark mass “from” the charge.  To construct an approximate metric, we model a bare quark as a spherically symmetric static perfect fluid with charge, using a recent exact Maxwell-Einstein metric for the interior, out to a radius r at which the boundary condition is to match to the Reissner-Nordström metric (for spacetime external to a charged mass).  At r, the model produces internal pressure, which should be matched to external pressure.  For reported values of quark charges q and bare masses mq, this construction produces sub-fm radii.  Although the metric at this radius differs only perturbatively from a flat spacetime, the matching condition is more significant and couples the current quark mass to the charge.",

      "Country": "S",
      "Abstract": "We address a recent puzzling result from the LHC: the jet fragmentation functions measured  in $PbPb$ and $pp$ collisions appear very similar in spite of a large medium-induced energy loss (we will call this ``jet fragmentation scaling\", JFS).  To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the propagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we adopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the  $(1+1)$ quasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of the coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of ``mesons\" with a finite mass and the screening of ``quark\" charge  that are crucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that this approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$ annihilation \r\nat $z\\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion measurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we find that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\\lambda$ of the jet is short, $\\lambda \\leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity inferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at short mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low momenta $p \\sim m$, where $m \\simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.  Meanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger than naively expected in string models.",

In this analysis, we used the data collected by the ALICE collaboration, in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV. Charged and neutral leading jets have been used to study the momentum balance with the recoiling charged jet. The di-jet momentum balance (A_J) in pp at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV as a function of charged particle multiplicity has been measured and is compared with the PYTHIA simulation. We also report the status of an analysis of di-jet measurement in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV to search for a possible medium response by a propagation of high energy jet, which is sensitive to parton energy loss.",

      "Institute": "Ohio State University (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions produced at the LHC a significant number of baryons is emitted in each collision. Two-particle correlations of those baryons carry important information about the emitting source and the interaction between them. \r\n\r\nAt low relative momentum femtoscopic correlations arise, which are sensitive to the homogeneity lengths of the system. Hydrodynamic models predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse mass of the pair. Such a decrease is universally reported for pions, also at the LHC. Baryons, having a much larger mass, allow to significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The results from baryon femtoscopy would put a strong constraint on such predictions. Non-identical baryon pairs are also sensitive to emission\r\nasymmetries.\r\n\r\nFemtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to the strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon pair types. The most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction which has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of the H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon potentials, which have significant contributions from annihilation channels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle spectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of the small proton yield at the LHC.\r\n\r\nWe show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types (both baryon-baryon and baryon-antibaryon) composed of protons and lambdas. Femtoscopic analysis is carried out for proton  pairs, taking into account residual correlations and annihilation\r\nchannel for the proton-antiproton system. Correlations with lambdas are also analyzed, both with femtoscopic methods as well as to study the unknown interaction potentials.",

As a complement to single inclusive spectra, detailed information is obtained with two-particle correlations. Recent measurements of the azimuthal angle correlations at RHIC have shown that there is a strong suppression of the away side peak at forward rapidities. This is easily understood in the CGC framework: the produced partons are initially back-to-back in the transverse plane, but the interaction with the nucleus causes a momentum transfer of the order of the saturation scale. In forward dihadron production the small-x structure of the nucleus is probed, implying a large saturation scale.\r\n\r\nWe present on going work on calculating the dihadron correlation using the running coupling BK equation. We include the inelastic terms neglected in some of the previous literature and show that they naturally contain the double parton scattering part that has so far been treated as a separate contribution.

      "Abstract": "To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks\r\nand gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are\r\nperformed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion\r\nCollider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries was that elliptic flow v_2\r\nwas comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,\r\nthat a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was\r\nestablished. Recently, the higher harmonics v_n (n > 2) are\r\nsystematically observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of theoretical\r\nand experimental interests. Initial state fluctuations turned out to be\r\nimportant to explain these higher harmonics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to initial state fluctuations, thermal fluctuation during\r\nthe space-time evolution of the QGP also plays an important role in\r\nevent-by-event simulations. We first formulate the relativistic\r\nfluctuating hydrodynamics in the context of the second order causal\r\ntheory. Finite relaxation time for dissipative current is required to\r\nmake hydrodynamic equation consistent with causality. Instead of\r\nintroducing the relaxation term itself, one can define a kernel function\r\n(or a retarded Green function) such that constitutive equation becomes\r\nconvolution of the kernel function including relaxation as well as\r\ndissipation and the corresponding thermodynamic force. One can also\r\nintroduce a noise field as thermal fluctuation of the dissipative\r\ncurrent like in the Langevin equation. Thus the constitutive equation\r\nbecomes no longer a deterministic equation, but a stochastic equation.\r\nThe power spectrum of the noise fields is intimately related to the\r\nkernel function via the fluctuation-dissipation relation and,\r\nconsequently, noise becomes colored noise rather than white one due to\r\nthe finite relaxation time. We then implement the colored noise together\r\nwith viscous kernels in numerical simulations of relativistic\r\nhydrodynamics and perform simulations on an event-by-event basis to see\r\neffects of thermal fluctuation on the dynamics of heavy ion collisions.\r\nThis framework is beyond the conventional second order dissipative\r\nhydrodynamics and, thus, will become important in the upcoming era of\r\nthe precision QGP physics by means of high-energy heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The precise value of the QGP kinematic shear viscosity eta/s is a question of intense topical interest. Viscous hydrodynamic simulations are a tool for extracting this information from experiment. The key observables are the anisotropic flow coefficients v_n which (i) can be measured very precisely and (ii) are very sensitive to eta/s which controls the \"conversion efficiency\" v_n/ecc_n for turning initial fireball eccentricities of harmonic order n into final flows of the same harmonic order. \r\n\r\nBoth ecc_n and v_n fluctuate strongly from collision to collision. These event-by-event fluctuations have a key influence on the measurements [1] and must be properly taken into account when extracting eta/s. Until recently, most initial-state models accounted only for the shape and density fluctuations arising from the fluctuating positions of the nucleons in the colliding nuclei. This leads to fluctuations in the location of the newly produced matter, and thus of the initial energy density profile of the expanding fireball and its eccentricities ecc_n, but does not account for additional quantum fluctuations in the quark and gluon fields inside the nucleons that lead to fluctuating numbers of secondary particles per nucleon-nucleon interaction. Several recent papers have addressed the implementation of these quantum fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial conditions for the expanding collision fireball. \r\n\r\nStarting from the Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model for generating fluctuating initial profiles for the gluon saturation momentum Q_sat(x_T) in the transverse plane, we have developed a Monte Carlo algorithm that uses a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) generator [2] to generate a distribution of gluonic energy densities centered at the value corresponding to the field Q_sat(x_T), but fluctuating around this profile with the two-point covariance function derived in [3] from the Glasma model. To ensure that the energy density is everywhere positive the GRF is mapped to an appropriate negative binomial distribution (NBD) with the same variance. NBD fluctuations have been recently shown to arise naturally from the Glasma model and to describe the measured multiplicity distributions in pp collisions at the LHC. The resulting density profile features ``hot spots\" as in the MC-KLN model overlaid with a fluctuating field texture characterized by an intrinsic length scale 1/Q_sat(x_T).\r\n \r\nWe show that inclusion of these additional gluonic quantum field fluctuations leads to only a small (few percent) increase of the initial eccentricities ecc_n in central collisions and to almost negligible effects at larger impact parameters. These findings disagree with some of the results reported in [4], and we will discuss possible origins for this discrepancy. Our results imply that an earlier extraction of the QGP shear viscosity from a combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow data from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [5] is robust.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n   \r\n[1] Zhi Qiu and U.

A comparison of the centrality dependence of forward energy flow to that at lower pseudorapidities can shed light on the gluon saturation at low-x. This problem can also be approached by a direct comparison of PbPb and pp energy flow in the forward region. This analysis is based on data taken in 2010. The energy flow in the pseudorapidity range of -5.2 to -6.6 has been measured for 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions over a wide range of centrality and also for minium bias pp collisions. These data are compared to energy-flow measurements for pseudorapidities between -5.2 and +5.2. The very large angular coverage of the CMS detector allows for a test of limiting fragmentation of energy flow, and for an estimate of nuclear stopping.

At TeV energies, the strong electromagnetic field due to the coherent action of the Z=82 proton charges generates a large flux of photons, which can be used for high-energy photoproduction studies. Heavy vector mesons (for example J/psi, Psi', Upsilon) produced in electromagnetic interactions provide direct information on the parton distribution functions in the nucleus at very low values of Bjorken-x. These events are characterized by a very low hadron multiplicity. The wide pseudorapidity coverage of the CMS detectors is used to separate such events from very peripheral nuclear interactions. The CMS experiment has excellent capabilities for the measurement of the heavy vector mesons in the di-muon decay channel using the tracker and the muon chambers. This analysis is based on the full 2011 PbPb data set of 150/ub. Ultra-peripheral events where one nucleus breaks up are tagged by forward neutrons detected in the Zero Degree Calorimeters. In this talk ratios of Psi' to J/psi, and the yields of J/psi and Psi' per UPC event with nuclear breakup will be presented and compared to theoretical predictions.",

      "Abstract": "One important theoretical model of heavy ion collisions expects that the collision zone can be divided into two distinct regions: the core and the corona.  The corona region is a low density p+p or p+A like region which may be a more favorable for J/psi production as opposed to the hot, dense core.  From a Glauber model, this region is found to be symmetric about the reaction plane in Au+Au collisions, but is distinctly asymmetric in Cu+Au collisions.  In this poster, we will describe the expected geometrical asymmetry in terms of the Glauber model implementation and show our initial studies of forward J/psi production toward measuring the relative size of the corona as a function of system-size.",

      "Abstract": "The first measurements of the elliptic azimuthal anisotropy of neutral pions, pi0s, produced in 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions will be presented. The results are based on data collected by the CMS experiment during the 2010 LHC running period. The amplitudes of the second Fourier component (v2) of the pi0 azimuthal distributions are extracted using an event-plane technique. The values of v2 are studied as a function of the neutral pion transverse momentum (pT) for different centrality classes in the kinematic range pT = 1.6 - 8 GeV/c, and |eta|<0.8. The CMS measurements of v2(pT) agree with previously reported pi0 azimuthal anisotropy results from 200 GeV AuAu collisions measured by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC, despite a factor of ~14 increase in the center-of-mass energy. A comparison of the CMS measurements of v2(pT) from pi0 mesons and inclusive charged particles reveals a systematic difference in the range of pT = 2.5 ~ 5 GeV/c, with the neutral pion anisotropies being weaker than those observed for inclusive charged particles. This difference indicates a particle-species dependence in the azimuthal anisotropy at the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of the nuclear modification factor of mesons with open heavy flavor content in PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV from the CMS experiment will be presented. These modification factors provide stringent constraints on the theoretical models of heavy quark energy loss. Until recently only indirect measurements of this effect existed, through single electrons from semileptonic open heavy-flavor decays. The importance of an unambiguous measurement of open bottom flavor is driven by the lack of knowledge regarding key features of the dynamics of parton energy loss in the QGP, such as its color-charge and parton-mass dependencies and the relative role of radiative and collisional energy loss. CMS is the first, and so far only, experiment to measure the nuclear modification factor of B hadrons, identified via their decays into J/psi displaced from the primary collision vertex. First results have shown that B hadrons are strongly suppressed in PbPb collisions at a level comparable to open charm. New results on the centrality dependence of RAA and the first measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy of non-prompt J/psi will be presented, based on the full 2011 PbPb data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150/ub.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Data taken over the last several years have demonstrated that the Relative Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has created dense and rapidly thermalizing matter. The next objective at RHIC is to study properties of this partonic matter in detail in terms of color degrees of freedom and the equation of state. The precise measurement of transverse momentum distributions of quarkonia at different centralities, collision systems, and energies will serve as a thermometer of QGP. A large-area and cost-effective Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) at mid-rapidity for the STAR was proposed. The MTD will be constructed with LMRPC instead of small pad read-out MRPC. With this design the number of electronic channels can be reduced effectively and the hit position along the strip can be obtained by the time differences of two ends of the strips.\r\n A prototype of Long-strip Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (LMRPC) for STAR-MTD has been developed. This 5-gap prototype has an active area of 52x87 cm2 and the signals are read out from 12 strips, which are 3.8cm wide and 87cm long. The 5-gap STAR-MTD LMRPC module has a efficiency up to 98% and time resolution is in the order of 95 ps. The noise level of such modules is quite low. A special machine was developed to make the colloidal graphite electrodes. Using the time difference of the two PMT signals of each of the two long scintillators, a selection of perpendicular cosmic-ray particles is done to get a better time resolution evaluation. 22 LMRPC modules we have been built all passed QC and they have very good performance. The whole MTD consists of 117 LMRPCs and 60 modules will be produced in Tsinghua university. In this paper, the performance of the prototype, cosmic test facility and production status are described.",

      "Abstract": "The production of large number of multi-strange hyperons per central nucleus-nucleus collision at RHIC allows us to study hyperon-hyperon interactions through measurement of particle correlations and search for exotic particles like dihyperons. In 1977 Jaffe[1] predicted a six quark state, $H_{0}$-dibaryon, with hypercharge (Y) = 0 and Strangeness (S) = -2 to be stable against strong decay, but not to weak decay. It has been proposed that the $H_{0}$ would appear as a bump in the $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ invariant mass spectra if the $H_{0}$ is a resonance state, or it would lead to a depletion of the $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ correlation near the threshold if the $H_{0}$ is weakly bound, which can be used to probe whether there is a stable $H_{0}$ or resonance. Considerable experimental efforts have been devoted to search for $H_{0}$. However there is no conclusive experimental evidence for a bound $H_{0}$. In addition to $H_{0}$, many other dihyperon states have been predicted thoeretically. However, very few measurements are available due to low multiplicity of hyperon production in early nuclear collisions. \r\n\r\nRecently STAR has collected unprecedented high statistics data for Au+Au collision at RHIC, which provides a unique opportunity to look for the exotic particles and hyperon-hyperon correlations. In this talk, we will present the measurement of $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ correlations for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39-200 GeV in Au+Au collisions using the STAR experiment at RHIC. In addition to that, we will also present measurements of $\\Lambda-\\bar\\Lambda$, $\\Lambda-\\Xi^{-}$ correlations for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in Au+Au collisions. \r\n\r\n[1] R. L. Jaffe,Phys.

Input cross sections for heavy quarks and quarkonia, as well as cold nuclear matter effects, are constrained by pp and pA/dA data as available. Formation-time effects and bottom feeddown, mostly relevant at high transverse momentum (p_t), are accounted for. The thermal relaxation time of heavy quarks, controlling the regeneration contribution, is adjusted to central AA data at SPS and RHIC. The approach is applied to pre- and postdict charmonium [1,2] and bottomonium [3] production as a function of centrality, p_t, rapidity, and collision energy in comparison to data from NA50, PHENIX, STAR, ALICE, CMS and ATLAS.

The compact stars consist of not only nuclear matter but also hypeons and quarks, we call such stars \"hybrid stars\". However, the equation of state (EOS) is still not clear and many theoretical studies try to elucidate the EOS in the high density and/or temperature.  The crust region of the stars consist of nucleus and nuclear matter. Therefore the inner region of the stars should have hadron-quark mixed phase. Nowadays it is pointed out that the inner structures would affect macroscopic phenomena of the star[1]. However, the inner structures are strongly depend on EOS of the matter. We show that the hadron-quark mixed phase should be restricted to a narrower region because of the finite-size effects and a quark matter region should appear in the central region[2]. The narrow region of the mixed phase seems to explain physical phenomena of neutron stars such as the strong magnetic field and glitch phenomena, and it would give a new cooling curve for the neutron star.\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] A.

The contamination of nonflow hampers further advancement in our study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, in at least two areas: it prevents a more precise determination of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s of the QGP medium from flow measurements, and it limits the power of jet-like correlations in probing partonic energy loss mechanisms where flow presents a background to be subtracted. Recently it has been shown that the measured two-particle correlation Fourier coefficients approximately factorize, and it was argued that this indicates the dominance of flow. In this talk we show by PYTHA simulations of p+p collisions that factorization approximately holds also for jet-like correlations and therefore is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for flow [1]. We suggest that nonflow factorization can in turn be used to disentangle flow and nonflow as a function of particle transverse momentum by performing a two-component factorization fit to Fourier coefficients [1]. However, such disentanglement is model dependent, so are all other experimental nonflow studies thus far. To revamp this, we present in this talk a novel, model-independent method to decompose \\Delta\\eta-dependent and independent correlations using two- and four-partice cumulants between \\eta bins, exploiting the symmetry of flow about midrapidity in symmetric heavy-ion collisions [2]. The \\Delta\\eta-independent correlations are dominated by anisotropic flow while the \\Delta\\eta-dependent correlations can be identified as nonflow. We illustrate our method using the AMPT and HIJING event generators. We discuss our decomposed flow and nonflow from the models. We further discuss the applicability of our method in separating flow and nonflow in real data at RHIC and LHC.\r\n\r\n[1] Daniel Kikola, Li Yi, ShinIchi Esumi, Fuqiang Wang and Wei Xie. arXiv:1110.4809 [nucl-ex]\r\n[2] Lingshan Xu, Li Yi, Daniel Kikola, Joshua Konzer, Fuqiang Wang and Wei Xie. arXiv:1204.2815 [nucl-ex]",

At low pair mass, direct photons and low mass vector mesons are the main center of interest. Interpretation of lepton pair production rates in excess of expectations from hadronic decays observed by PHENIX and how the data constrains theoretical models on thermalization and chiral symmetry restoration is a hotly debated topic. At intermediate and high mass, the di-electron spectrum has been used by PHENIX to measure cross sections of open charm and open bottom, as well as Quarkonium suppression with implications for color screening and recombination.\r\n\r\nDue to the small signal to background ratio, measurement of the dielectron spectrum, especially at low mass, is very challenging. In PHENIX, the background results mainly from random combinations of electron positron pairs from uncorrelated sources, mostly $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decays and photon conversions. The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was developed to address this issue. The HBD accomplishes this by tagging and rejecting tracks from conversions and $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decays. It was successfully operated in RHIC run years 2009 to 2010, where Au+Au and reference p+p data sets were taken. We will present the dielectron results from the analysis of these data sets.",

      "Abstract": "We report on a recently proposed scenario for thermalization of hot QCD matter after the \"Little Bang\" in heavy ion collisions. A distinctive feature of the pre-equilibrium system (the Glasma) is the high over-population of phase space for gluons, which we argue plays a central role for the thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. In particular, the over-population (1) coherently amplifies scattering by $1/\\alpha_s$ and makes the system behave as a strongly interacting fluid despite being out of equilibrium at weak coupling, (2) may lead to the dynamical, albeit transient formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate over the course of thermalization. A further distinctive feature of our scenario is that the initially single scale ($Q_s$) of Glasma develops into a hierarchy of scales, with the IR scale and the UV separated by coupling $\\alpha_s$, precisely as in equilibrium thermal field theory. We demonstrate these features by solving the Boltzmann equation in the small angle approximation and in the regime where the occupation numbers are large. Finally, we address possible phenomenological consequences of our scenario.",

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "The initial conditions play a fundamental role in the fluid-dynamical modeling of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Many observables that are important in determining the properties of the QGP, such \r\nas elliptic flow (v2) and triangular flow (v3), appear to be generated mainly from the initial geometry of the energy density profile. Since the initial conditions remain undetermined, it introduces a large uncertainty in the extraction of the \r\nproperties of the QGP. \r\n\r\nTypically it is assumed that the matter thermalizes and fluid dynamics can be applied after time of the order of $1$ fm/c after the initial nuclear collision. However, the matter itself can be created much earlier, and it undergoes pre-equilibrium evolution \r\nbefore fluid dynamics can be applied. In this work, we estimate the impact of the pre-equilibrium evolution of the QGP on the initial conditions for fluid dynamics using a parton cascade model. \r\n\r\nFor the initial conditions for the pre-equilibrium evolution we use a realistic 6--dimensional parametrization of the initial single-particle distribution function $f(x, p)$ that reflect, e.g. the observed rapidity and multiplicity distributions at RHIC and LHC.\r\nThen, we solve the time evolution of this distribution using the relativistic Boltzmann equation, up to times of the order of 1 fm/c, for various values of partonic cross sections. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is solved using the \r\nBAMPS algorithm Ref. [1].\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of our approach is that we are able to compute, not only the energy density distribution at $t=1$ fm, but also the velocity and shear-stress tensor profiles, which, so far, are mostly unknown. \r\n\r\n[1] Z.

      "Abstract": "The proton gluon distribution function increases rapidly with decreasing x at fixed $Q^{2}$, but cannot increase indefinitely as x goes to 0. Gluon saturation is expected at a low x value when gluon recombination balances gluon splitting. The nuclear (with atomic mass number A) gluon distribution is approximately $A^{1/3}$ larger than the nucleon gluon distribution function at the same x [1]. STAR is sensitive to x between 0.001 and 0.02 for the nuclear gluon distribution via di-jet measurements with calorimeter subsystems covering -1 < eta < 4. The STAR collaboration has measured forward $\\pi{0}$-$\\pi{0}$ correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200GeV$. The suppression of the away-side peak observed in forward-forward correlations in central d+Au collisions is consistent with the CGC expectation [2,3]. Such suppression does not appear in the forward+mid-rapidity correlations. \r\n\r\nThe Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) at STAR covers pseudo-rapidity between 1.08 and 2, providing the opportunity to probe gluons at intermediate x via forward+near-forward correlations. Azimuthal correlations between $\\pi{0}$ in the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) and jet-like clusters in the EEMC are sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution in 0.003<x<0.02 region. Together with the forward+forward correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations, we will be able to determine the sharpness of the transition along x from a dilute parton gas to the expected CGC state at low $Q^{2}$. In this talk, we will focus on FMS-$\\pi^{0}$ + EEMC-jet-like-cluster azimuthal correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions. The impact from underlying-event contributions to the jet-like clusters and effective p+Au results, via a deuteron-beam-facing neutron tag, will be discussed as well.\r\n\r\n[1] H. Kowalski, D.

      "Abstract": "Flow asymmetries are in focus of present heavy ion studies. In head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. This poses a challenge to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations. Here we study flow asymmetries arising from global asymmetries in peripheral collisions.\r\n\r\nThe dynamical development of collective flow of prefect QGP fluid is studied in a (3+1)D fluid dynamical model for peripheral heavy-ion collisions, with globally symmetric, initial conditions, which take into account the shear flow caused by the forward motion of the matter on the projectile side and the backward motion on the target side.  While at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76A$\\,TeV semi-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions the earlier predicted rotation effect [2] is visible in the calculations, at more peripheral collisions, with high resolution and low numerical viscosity the initial development of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is observed [3], which alters the flow pattern considerably. On the initial dividing plane a wave develops, and the dividing plane develops into a turning nonlinear wave. The wave develops only in peripheral reactions with very low numerical viscosity. The KHI wave is visible in the reaction plane if we mark the motion of the fluid which was initially on the dividing plane. The direction of the wave is such that it enhances the rotation effect and increases the asymmetry of the global collective $v_1(y)$. The possibility of turbulence in the transverse plane developing from initial fluctuations was also pointed out recently [4].\r\n\r\nAlthough, the predicted rotation effect is not easily detectable due to longitudinal initial state fluctuations, the KHI enhances the flow asymmetry and changes its pattern in peripheral collisions.  The present developments suggest that the global collective $v_1$ flow can be disentangled from random fluctuations. This is necessary to measure the global collective flow in peripheral collisions.\r\n\r\nThe KHI is very sensitive to the magnitude of the viscosity.  Thus if this research is successful the analysis of global collective $v_1$ flow as a function of beam energy and impact parameter may provide a precision measurement of viscosity and its variation.\r\n\r\n[1] K.

      "Speaker": "Zhi Qiu",
      "Institute": "Ohio State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions is well described by viscous hydrodynamic simulations. A key QGP transport coefficient, its specific shear viscosity eta/s, can be extracted by comparing such simulations with experimental data. Previous extractions gave (eta/s)_QGP ~ (1-2.5)/(4\\pi) where the ~100% uncertainty arises mainly from ambiguities in the initial fireball shape and density profile. To obtain (eta/s)_QGP with better precision, the ambiguities in the initial conditions must be addressed.\r\n\r\nPublished extractions of the specific shear viscosity have relied on elliptic flow measurements and the fact that eta/s suppresses elliptic flow. It was recently realized that higher order harmonic flows are suppressed even more strongly with increasing eta/s, and that the recently measured triangular flow allows to simultaneously constrain eta/s and the initial conditions: viable initial conditions should describe the elliptic and triangular flows v2 and v3 simultaneously with the same eta/s. We have performed such a simultaneous analysis of v2 and v3 [1]. We show that the normalized elliptic and triangular flow coefficients v2/ecc2 and v3/ecc3 (where ecc_n are the n-th order eccentricities of the initial state) can be obtained with 10-15% accuracy using single-shot hydrodynamical simulations where the initial conditions are averaged before hydrodynamical evolution, instead of the more realistic but costly event-by-event hydrodynamical approach where averaging is done only after separate evolution of each fluctuating initial condition.\r\n\r\nFor elliptic flow we find that, within 10-15%, v2/ecc2 = v2{2}/ecc2{2} = v2{4}/ecc2{4} where the expression on the left is obtained from single-shot hydrodynamics while the cumulant expressions on the right are extracted from event-by-event hydrodynamics. For triangular flow we find, at the same level of precision, that v3/ecc3=v3{2}/ecc3{2} \\neq v3{4}/ecc3{4}. The ALICE data for charged hadron elliptic and triangular flow from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [2] are shown to obey these approximate (in-)equalities. Our hydrodynamic analysis [1] shows that the ALICE v2 and v3 data [2] can be explained simultaneously, at all collision centralities, if (eta/s)_QGP \\approx 1/(4\\pi). This requires MC-Glauber initial conditions which have smaller ecc2 than CGC-motivated MC-KLN initial conditions. For MC-KLN initial conditions the v2 data require larger (eta/s)_QGP ~ (2-2.5)/(4\\pi) which, however, then underpredicts the measured triangular flow by 35-40%. We conclude that the large v3 measured at the LHC requires either almost minimal QGP shear viscosity (eta/s)_QGP \\approx 1/(4\\pi), or a presently unknown mechanism for increasing the triangularity fluctuations in the initial state by ~50%.\r\n\r\n[1] Zhi Qiu, Chun Shen, and Ulrich Heinz, ``Hydrodynamic elliptic and triangular flow in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s)=2.76 A TeV,'' Phys.

In particular, the medium-induced parton energy loss is expected to depend on its mass and colour charge. The measurement of heavy quark production in pp collisions provides an important test of pQCD calculations and serves as a baseline for studies in heavy-ion collisions. The production of electrons from beauty hadron decays can be measured using their displacement from the primary vertex.\r\nThe pt differential production yields of electrons from beauty hadron decays have been measured at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.8) in Pb-Pb collisions at\r\nsqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC in the transverse momentum range 1.5 < pt < 6 GeV/c. The pt dependence of the nuclear modification factor R_AA has been calculated with respect to a pp reference obtained from the cross section measured at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and scaled to sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV. We present the spectra in pp and Pb-Pb collisions and the nuclear modication factor of electrons from beauty decays for\r\ndifferent centrality classes.",

For large |t| values, the cross-section exhibits a power law behavior.\r\nBy extrapolation of measured elastic p+p cross sections to |t| = 0, TOTEM obtained a total elastic scattering cross-section of 24.8 +- 0.2(stat) +- 1.2(syst)) mb [2]. Applying the optical theorem and using the luminosity measurement from CMS, a total proton-proton cross-section of (98.3 +- 0.2(stat) +- 2.8(syst)) mb was deduced.\r\nTOTEM also measured the charged particle pseudorapidity density dN/deta in p+p collisions at 7 TeV, in the pseudorapidity range 5.3 < |eta| < 6.4 [3].

      "Abstract": "Recent data from LHC has revived the question whether the matter produced in high energy hadronic collisions is thermalized or not. With the published data from ALICE and CMS experiments, we have shown that the multi-particle production in p+p collisions at LHC energies available up to now, follows the scaling of information entropy if one takes the chaotic and coherent sources of particle production into account and the information entropy is extracted from the chaotically produced particles. Based on these scaling properties we have argued that in hadronic collisions at the highest energies projected for LHC, almost all the particles will be produced chaotically. This indicates that a collective behavior will be observed even in the hadron-hadron collisions at that energy. Further connections of this study with heavy ion interactions will be elucidated.",

In this talk we increase the p_T threshold of the leading hadron in the pair (8, 10 and 12 GeV/c) to vary the degree of the surface bias. The di-jet energy imbalance is assessed via the difference of total momenta in the same- minus away-side peaks, and the measured imbalance is over-predicted by path-length dependent models, while showing possible evidence of softening of jet fragmentation. We find no qualitative change in the same-side peak of 2+1 correlation.\r\n\r\nRemoving the back-to-back partner maximizing the asymmetry, the 2+1 reduces to the ordinary dihadron correlation, where significant modification is indeed observed on the away-side but the near-side remains similar between the d+Au and Au+Au events, indicating surface bias. We further lower the trigger p_T to as low as 1.5 GeV/c, where hydrodynamic production of particles are thought to dominate and jet-like correlations are expected to diminish. However, we find the identical near-side correlation between d+Au and Au+Au persists. The data cannot be described by the AMPT and HIJING models, and challenge the particle production paradigm in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

PHENIX results of $v_{2}$ in Au$+$Au collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV for heavy-flavor decays are comparable to the $v_{2}$ measurements of other hadrons. This indicates that both the flow and the energy loss characteristics in heavy quarks are similar to light quarks, which is not well understood. \r\n\r\nWe extend the PHENIX systematic study of azimuthal anisotropy by reducing the beam energy to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=62.4GeV.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are produced early in the collisions and therefore are important probes of the hot and dense matter created in the reactions at RHIC energies. Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy flavour mesons (so called non-photonic electrons, NPE) are the most feasible tool so far for studying heavy quarks in-medium interactions. NPE azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, is of particular interest because it provides additional means to discriminate between models which describe heavy quark\r\nin-medium interactions. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will report the $v_2$ measurements using  2- and 4-particle correlations, $v_2\\lbrace2\\rbrace$ and $v_2\\lbrace4\\rbrace$, at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 200, 62 and 39 GeV at STAR. Non-photonic electrons in this study are identified using three main STAR subsystems: Time Projection Chamber, Time of Flight Detector and Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter. $v_2\\lbrace2\\rbrace$ and $v_2\\lbrace4\\rbrace$ have different sensitivity to the flow fluctuations and so called nonflow (correlations not related to the reaction plane) - there is a positive contribution of fluctuation and nonflow to the $v_2\\lbrace2\\rbrace$ while, in the case of $v_2\\lbrace4\\rbrace$, nonflow is negligible and the effect of fluctuations is negative. Therefore $v_2\\lbrace2\\rbrace$ and  $v_2\\lbrace4\\rbrace$ provide an upper and lower limit on the average azimuthal anisotropy of non-photonic electrons. Moreover, bottom/charm production ratio at lower energies is expected to be reduced compared to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV, therefore low $p_T$ NPE azimuthal anisotropy at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 62 and 39 GeV would reflect charm $v_2$ better than at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "One of the main discoveries at RHIC is the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), based particularly on the observed \"perfect fluid\" and strong jet quenching. One of the most interesting physics to see at LHC is whether and how such sQGP properties will change. Based on the deep and generic electric-magnetic duality, we've suggested that the QCD plasma contains the quarks and gluons (color-electric D.o.F) as well as the EMERGENT monopoles (color-magnetic D.o.F.) with the latter becoming dominant at strong gauge coupling as in the near-Tc QCD plasma . An important prediction of this \"magnetic scenario\" is a RAPID turn-off of the magnetic dominanace when increasing temperature  beyond the near-Tc regime of 1-1.5Tc, accompanied by rapid decrease (due to non-perturbative running) of QCD coupling in this regime. \r\n\r\nThis scenario, therefore, implies the QCD plasma to be less perfect a fluid and more transparent a medium at LHC, despite only modest increase in tempearture. We will discuss such expected change of the emergent QCD plasma from RHIC to LHC energies. Furthermore, we will examine the changes in the two most important medium properties: 1) evidences for a less perfect fluid from our molecular dynamics simulations as well as from other groups' hydrodynamic modelling of flow data at LHC; 2) evidences for a more transparent medium as predicted from our analysis of geometric data for jet quenching and from other groups' modelling for LHC Raa data and extraction of jet quenching parameter at LHC.  \r\n\r\nReference: arXiv:1109.0271[nucl-th]; arXiv:1202.1047[nucl-th]; Phys.Rev.

      "Abstract": "We propose a QCD-like theory with the Z_{Nc} symmetry. The flavor-dependent twisted boundary condition (TBC) is imposed on Nc degenerate flavor quarks in the SU(Nc) gauge theory. The QCD-like theory is useful to understand the mechanism of color confinement. Dynamics of the QCD-like theory is studied by imposing the TBC on the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The Z_{Nc} symmetry is preserved below some temperature Tc, but spontaneously broken above Tc. The color confinement below Tc preserves the flavor symmetry. Above Tc, the flavor symmetry is broken, but the breaking is suppressed by the entanglement between the Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate. Particularly at low temperature, dynamics of the TBC model is similar to that of the PNJL model with the standard fermion boundary condition, indicating that the Z_{Nc} symmetry is a good approximate concept in the latter model even if the current quark mass is small. The present prediction can be tested in future by lattice QCD, since the QCD-like theory has no sign problem.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most advocated probes of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) properties is the $J/\\psi$ suppression. However, the comparison between experimental data and theoretical scenarios is still rather inconclusive, as several mechanisms might participate to explain the observed suppression (sequential suppression, dynamical or statistical recombination, formation time,...), not to mention the cold nuclear matter effects. In recent experimental studies at PHENIX and STAR, the $v_2$ of the $J/\\Psi$'s has been measured. In conjunction with $R_{AA}$, this observable should improve our understanding of quarkonia production in the QGP and puts higher constrains on models aiming at describing the $J/\\psi$ suppression. However, most of them neglect the possible diffusion of $Q\\bar{Q}$ correlations (\"pre $J/\\psi$'s\") in the QGP although it is \r\ngenerically an essential ingredient for the understanding of the $v_2$ of all particles.\r\n\r\n Motivated by SPS results of $v_2^{J/\\psi}$ and recent RHIC and LHC results suggesting a strong thermalization of charm quarks in the medium, our approach is focused not only on the suppression phenomenon but also on the physical evolution of those correlations, including an original treatment of their diffusion in the QGP due to their Compton scattering with gluons and the implications of such a diffusion on $J/\\psi$ energy loss and collectivity, studied in a hydrodynamic transport model. The general tendency of our results indeed shows that elastic processes may have a non-negligible influence on the quarkonia propagation in the QGP.\r\n   \r\n   In our contribution, we will discuss the theoretical framework we have developed to evaluate the elastic cross section of $J/\\psi$'s (and more generally $\\Q\\bar{Q}$ correlations) by combining analytical calculations based on pQCD and results from lQCD. We will then address the quarkonia propagation under the influence of such collisions, treated in a Fokker-Planck approach, and will present results deduced from our transport code MC@SHQ. Those results will be compared to recent STAR and PHENIX experiments at RHIC and predictions of $v_2^{J/\\psi}$ for LHC will be shown.",

      "Abstract": "Within the framework of generalized collinear factorization in perturbative QCD (pQCD), we study the effect of initial multiple parton scattering and induced parton energy loss in Drell–Yan (DY) process in proton–nucleus collisions. We express the contribution from multiple parton scattering and induced radiative energy loss to the DY dilepton spectra in terms of nuclear modified effective beam (anti)quark distribution functions. The modification depends on the quark transport parameter in nuclear medium. This is similar to the final-state multiple parton scattering in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off large nuclei and leads to the suppression of the Drell–Yan cross section in p + A relative to p + p collisions. The modifications to (anti)quark distribution functions from (anti)quark-antiquark double scattering are shown to be determined by the (anti)quark distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark distribution functions inside the beam hardon. We also calculate DY spectra in p + A collisions and find the nuclear suppression due to beam parton energy loss negligible at the Fermilab energy Elab = 800 GeV in the kinematic region as covered by the E866 experiment. Most of the observed nuclear suppression of DY spectra in E866 experiment can be described well by parton shadowing in target nuclei as given by the EPS08 parameterization. The effect of beam parton energy loss, however, becomes significant for DY lepton pairs with large beam parton momentum fraction or small target parton momentum fraction.",

One of the main goals of this beam energy scan program is to locate the  critical point  which is postulated to lie at  the end of the phase transition boundary between partonic and hadronic  matter. Calculations on the lattice predict  that the  higher moments (such as standard deviation (σ), skewness (S) and kurtosis (k)) of the multiplicity  distribution  of  the  conserved  quantities like the net-charge, net-baryon,  net-strangeness are related to the  corresponding susceptibi-lities and the correlation length of the system, presence of a Critical Point might result in divergences of the thermodynamic susceptibilities and correlation lengths.  \r\n\r\nHere we report the measurements of the various moments (standard deviation (σ), skewness (S) and kurtosis (k)) and their products (kσ2, Sσ) of the net kaon multiplicity measured by the STAR detector at mid-rapidity for Au+Au collisions at 7.7-200 GeV center of mass energies.

      "Abstract": "We calculate the yields of quarkonia in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC as a function of the transverse momentum.  We focus on the consistent implementation of dynamically calculated nuclear matter effects, such as coherent power corrections, cold nuclear matter energy loss, and the Cronin effect in the initial state, and collisional dissociation of quarkonia in the final state as they traverse through the QGP. This formalism has been previously used to successfully describe the phenomenology of open heavy flavor (B and D mesons) both at RHIC and the LHC. We will briefly review the comparison with new open heavy flavor data and describe the extension of the calculation for quarkonium production.  Based upon non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics, our calculations include both color-singlet and color-octet contributions and feed-down effects from excited states. Theoretical results are presented for $J/\\psi$  and $\\Upsilon$ and compared to experimental data where applicable. At RHIC, a good description of the high-$p_T$ $J/\\psi$  modification observed in central Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions can be achieved within the model uncertainties. We find that $J/\\psi$ measurements in proton(or deuteron)-nucleus reactions are needed to constrain the magnitude of cold nuclear matter effects, and new data from d+Au collisions at RHIC already puts a strong limit on the Cronin enhancement for $J/\\psi$.  At the LHC, a  good description of the experimental data can be achieved only in mid-central and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. The large five-fold suppression of prompt $J/\\psi$ in the most central nuclear reactions  suggests the presence of thermal effects at the level of the quarkonium wavefunction, even at large transverse momentum.",

Using different scenarios for the interaction between projectile and matter, and different transport properties of the matter, we study the formation and structure of Mach cones. Especially, a dependence of the Mach cone angle on the details and rate of the energy deposition from projectile to the matter is investigated. Furthermore, the two-particle correlations extracted \r\nfrom the numerical calculations are compared to an analytical approximation. We find that the propagation of a high energetic particle through the matter does not lead to the appearance of a double peak structure as observed in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. The reason is the strongly forward-peaked energy and momentum deposition in the head shock region. In addition, by adjusting the cross section we investigate the\r\ninfluence of the viscosity to the structure of Mach cones. A clear and unavoidable smearing of the profile depending on a finite ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density is clearly visible.",

      "Abstract": "We suggest that the combined effect of screening, gluon-induced dissociation, Landau damping, and reduced feed-down explains most of the suppression of Y states that has been observed by CMS [1] in PbPb relative to pp collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV at the CERN LHC. The suppression is thus a clear, albeit indirect, indication for the presence of a qgp.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we calculate the suppression of both the Y(1S) ground state in the quark-gluon plasma in minimum-bias PbPb collisions, and of the Y(2S + 3S) states relative to the ground state. In a major extension of our schematic phenomenological approach presented in [2], we now explicitly consider the time dependence with transverse and longitudinal expansion, and the effect of Landau damping [3] on the widths of the states, in addition to gluodissociation.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Landau damping of the Y(nS) and Chi_b(nP) states is computed from a complex potential, and is found to be of the same order of magnitude as the gluon-induced dissociation [2] for the 1S state at the temperatures that are relevant at LHC.\r\nThe gluodissociation is treated explicitly for all five states considered here (1S, 2S, 3S, 1P and 2P), including the influence of the confining string contribution on the dissociation rates.\r\n\r\nAs compared to pp collisions at the same energy, the feed-down cascade leading to the Y(1S) ground state is drastically modified due to the substantial suppression of the excited states through screening, damping and gluodissociation. The 1S ground state remains very stable with respect to screening, its suppression is essentially due to damping, gluodissociation and reduced feed-down.\r\n\r\nOur results are presented for different Y formation times and qgp lifetimes. For reasonable plasma temperatures at Y formation time, we obtain good agreement with the CMS data for the Y(1S) suppression factor, but less suppression than is needed\r\nfor the measured [1] ratio Y(2S + 3S)/ Y(1S) - which requires, however, better statistics.\r\nShould the result persist in the 2011 data, it is likely that additional suppression mechanisms are at work.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] S.

It is believed that the QGP phase dominates the evolution briefly during the early time of the Universe.  In high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC, the new form of matter, strongly interaction quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), has been formed [1]. The question now is what is the structure of the QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will report a systematic study of the freeze-out properties and collectivities as a function of collision energies.

      "Abstract": "Parton energy loss in the hot QCD medium will manifest itself not only in leading hadron spectra but also in reconstructed jet productions in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. With its more differential power full jets in heavy-ion collisions can then provide excellent tools to study the properties of the QGP and impose constraints on different parton energy loss models.\r\n\r\nWith this motivation, we investigate the cold nuclear matter(CNM) effects on jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions at LHC with the NLO perturbative QCD. The nuclear modifications for dijet angular distributions, dijet invariant mass spectra, dijet transverse momentum spectra and dijet momentum imbalance due to CNM effects are calculated by incorporating EPS, EKS, HKN and DS parametrization sets of parton distributions in nucleus. It is found that dijet angular distributions and dijet momentum imbalance are insensitive to the initial-state CNM effects and thus provide optimal tools to study the final-state hot QGP effects such as jet quenching. \r\n\r\nFurthermore we present the results and predictions at NLO for productions of the single, double and tagged jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by including parton energy loss effect in the QGP and the CNM effects. We demonstrate how an enhanced di-jet transverse momentum imbalance in central Pb+Pb reactions at the LHC, recently measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, can be derived from these results. We show quantitatively that a significant fraction of this enhancement may be related to the ambiguity in the separation between the jet and soft background medium and point to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of parton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "Viscous hydrodynamic calculations have shown that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) shear viscosity can be extracted from elliptic and triangular flow data [1]. However, strong non-equilibrium effects, both in the chemical composition and the kinetic evolution, during the hadronic stage influence the development and distribution of flow anisotropy and must be correctly accounted for when extracting the QGP viscosity. For an improved description of the hadronic evolution, we developed the hybrid model VISHNU which couples viscous hydrodynamic expansion of a QGP fluid to a microscopic description of hadronic rescattering and chemical and thermal freeze-out using the UrQMD cascade [2]. In this talk, we will summarize a number of key results obtained with VISHNU:\r\n\r\na) We present a robust method for extracting the QGP viscosity from the collision centrality dependence of the eccentricity-scaled charged hadron elliptic flow [3].\r\n\r\nb) We extract the  QGP shear viscosity at RHIC energies from elliptic flow data, giving quantitative estimates for and initial pre-equilibrium flow and from model ambiguities of the initial fireball eccentricity. We discuss the prospects for reducing the main uncertainties from initial conditions through a combined analysis of elliptic, triangular and higher-order harmonic flow coefficients using event-by-event VISHNU simulations.\r\n\r\nc) We show that, with the QGP viscosity extracted in [3], VISHNU yields an excellent description of all soft-hadron data from Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy [4].\r\n\r\nd) Extrapolating to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and comparing with recent experimental results from the ALICE Collaboration, we show that the LHC data are again well described by VISHNU, with\r\napproximately the same constant QGP viscosity as at RHIC energies [5], including the proton elliptic flow in the most central collisions which cannot be correctly reproduced in a purely hydrodynamic approach [6].\r\n\r\ne) Using an improved implementation of baryon-antibaryon annihilation in UrQMD, VISHNU is shown to resolve the ``proton puzzle\" at the LHC [7].\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1]H.

This surprising result has challenged the view of gluon radiation dominating over elastic 2-to-2 processes as a cause of parton energy loss in a quark-gluon plasma. To study the effectiveness of elastic collisions as the suppression mechanism in detail, we have developed a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation describing the non-eikonal propagation of high-energy gluons and light quarks interacting with the quarks and gluons from the expanding QCD medium. The partonic collision rates are computed in leading-order perturbative QCD, while four different scenarios are used to model the QCD medium: 1) a simple static model for case studies of energy loss probability distributions; 2) (1+1)-dimensional hydro with initial conditions from the EKRT model for modeling the central heavy ion collisions; 3) (2+1)-dimensional hydro with a smooth sWN profile obtained from the optical Glauber model for non-central collisions; and 4) event-by-event hydro with an eBC profile from the Monte Carlo Glauber model for a detailed study of the initial state density fluctuation effects.\r\n\r\nWe compare our results with the neutral pion suppression observed in sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and charged hadron suppression in sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions in the LHC.

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is a common tool to\r\ndescribe the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) \r\ncreated in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The validity of the fluid-dynamical approach is experimentally confirmed by the fact that\r\ninitial-state anisotropies are directly converted into nonvanishing\r\n(event-averaged) Fourier coefficients $\\langle v_n \\rangle$ of the \r\ndecomposition of the single-inclusive momentum distribution of hadrons\r\nwith respect to the azimuthal angle. From the magnitude of the $\\langle v_n \\rangle$ one can obtain information about the size of dissipative corrections and thus infer the value of the viscous coefficients of the QGP.\r\n\r\nIt has been realized that, for a proper comparison to experimental data\r\nand a reliable extraction of viscosity, fluid-dynamical calculations have to be performed on an event-by-event basis. Therefore, fluid dynamics should not only be able to predict the correct event-averaged $\\langle v_n\\rangle$, but also their distributions. In this paper, we investigate the event-by-event distribution of the initial-state eccentricities $\\varepsilon_n$, and show how they correlate with the event-by-event distribution of the Fourier coefficients $v_n$. In order to generate the initial state, we use the Monte-Carlo Glauber model of Ref.\\ [1]. For the fluid-dynamical evolution, we use the model of Refs.\\ [2]. The final hadron spectra are calculated with the Cooper-Frye freeze-out procedure.\r\n\r\nWe demonstrate that the event-by-event distributions of the $v_n$,\r\nand not only their average values, are promising observables to \r\ngain information about the initial state of the fluid-dynamical evolution and the transport properties of the hot and dense, strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] H.~Holopainen, H.~Niemi, and K.~J.~Eskola,\r\nPhys.\\ Rev.\\ {\\bf C83}, 034901 (2011), \r\n[arXiv:1007.0368 [hep-ph]].\r\n\r\n[2] H.~Niemi, G.~S.~Denicol, P.~Huovinen, E.~Molnar, and D.~H.~Rischke,\r\nPhys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\  {\\bf 106}, 212302 (2011), \r\n[arXiv:1101.2442 [nucl-th]];\r\nH.~Niemi, G.~S.~Denicol, P.~Huovinen, E.~Molnar and D.~H.~Rischke,  \r\narXiv:1203.2452 [nucl-th].",

In this model [1]  the universe is assumed to begin with a large baryon chemical potential through an Affleck – Dine mechanism and then undergoes a “little (or tepid) inflation” after crossing the QCD first-order phase transition line, while remaining in a deconfined and a chirally symmetric phase. We exploit first order phase transition [2] and examine critically what could be the relics.

      "Abstract": "ALICE, ATLAS and CMS detectors at LHC and previously PHENIX and STAR detectors at RHIC have provided\r\ncompelling evidence for higher order flow components apart from the elliptic flow v2. It is by now well established that\r\nboth RHIC and LHC have produced a ”perfect fluid” of Quark Gluon Plasma with eta/s close to zero, as predicted by\r\nAdS/CFT limit. One expects that higher order harmonics and in particular triangular flow v3 will constrain eta/s more\r\nprecisely. Although, the particle density per participant pair at 2.76 TEV (LHC) is a factor of 2.15 higher than at\r\nRHIC, eta/s remain almost the same going from RHIC to LHC. It is known that [1] eta/s / 1/g4 and 1/g2  [ln(T/T )]2,\r\nthus /s becomes and increasing function of the temperature. However, a simple [2] estimate indicates, that the initial\r\ntemperature for eta/s 0.08 changes from 360 MeV for RHIC to 530 MeV for LHC. Given the logarithmic dependence\r\nof /s on the temperature, it is almost natural that /s at LHC (2.76 TeV) does not changes perceptibly going from\r\nRHIC to LHC [3]. Our prediction is that even for the highest energy of LHC, eta/s will not change perceptably.\r\nThe second great puzzle is the universality of /s  1/4, applicable across a large number of phenomena, dra-\r\nmatically different from each other. Ultracold quantum degenerate strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, Graphene,\r\neven Giant resonances in finite nuclei exhibit the same behavior of /s  1/4. It is remarkable that both the coldest\r\nand hottest matter on earth are rather similar. This universaility is a direct consequence of strong coupling due to\r\nmany body interaction leading to observable correlation. This observation will be presented.\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] J. I.

      "Abstract": "The STAR results [1] from dihadron correlations as a function of the high-pt trigger azimuth relative to the event plane (phi_s) show a significant change from in-plane (phi_s~0) to out-of-plane direction (phi_s~90 degree). The near-side correlation is composed of two components: the jet-like correlation and the ridge; The former is found to be invariant over phi_s while the ridge is primarily observed in-plane. On the other hand, the away-side \"double hump\" is present only out-of-plane. It has been found that the recently characterized triangular flow does not change the qualitative conclusions [1]. However, the question remains, whether the observed phi_s dependent modification is due to analysis biases in flow background subtraction or jet-medium interactions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we analyze high-pt triggered dihadron correlations relative to the event plane in the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) parton cascade model. The AMPT model, with its string melting, has been previously shown to reproduce some of the global phenomena seen in heavy-ion collisions, specifically flow [2]. We first obtain the near-side jet-like correlations from the difference of large and small delta-eta azimuthal correlations and find AMPT does not reproduce the STAR data. We then analyze the large delta-eta azimuthal correlation by subtraction of v2, v3, and v4 harmonic flows. The vn harmonic flows are obtained from two- and four-particle cumulant method and compared to the true average<vn>   calculated using the initial geometry harmonic planes in AMPT. We assess the non-flow contributions in vn by the newly developed decomposition method [3], and address possible biases in our AMPT correlation analysis. We discuss their implications to the STAR data by comparing the vn subtracted event plane dependent dihadron correlations in AMPT to the STAR results. We discuss the remaining effects of jet-medium interactions in AMPT.\r\n\r\n[1] H. Agakishiev et al. (STAR Colloaboration), arXiv:1010.0690 [nucl-ex].\r\n[2] Z.-W. Lin and C.M. Ko, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "Charm quarks/antiquarks produced in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions, would traverse the quark gluon plasma, colliding with quarks and gluons and radiating gluons before appearing as D-mesons. Thus the final spectra of D-mesons would contain information of the medium modification suffered by the charm quarks/antiquarks. We have made a detailed study for the nuclear modification factor of production of D-mesons from the initial fusion of partons in a nuclear collision at RHIC and LHC energies. \r\nAs a first step, we made a comparative study of some of the energy loss formalisms of charm quarks/antiquarks available in the literature with the same initial conditions [1]. \r\nWe consider both the radiative and collision energy loss along with longitudinal expansion of the plasma for the prediction of nuclear modification factor. As at RHIC and LHC energies, parton densities reach very high values leading to effective nuclear shadowing, we use the modified structure functions due to shadowing effect given by EKS98 group, in 1998 [2]. Peterson fragmentation function [3] is used for fragmentation of Charm quarks/antiquarks into D-mesons.\r\n We have seen that our result can satisfactorily explain the ALICE experimental data for nuclear modification of D-mesons at Pb+Pb collision @ 2.76 ATeV. The result with a recent radiative energy loss calculation [4] has an increasing trend at high transverse momentum and explains the nuclear modification for transverse momentum up to 15 GeV very well. The inclusion of collisional energy loss of charm quarks/antiquarks further suppresses the muclear modification factor of D-mesons.\r\n\r\n1.    Umme Jamil and Dinesh K Srivastava,\r\n            J.

      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "A holographic calculation of the quenching of a beam of gluons with typical momenta q shining through strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma shows that such a beam is attenuated rapidly over a distance of order q^{1/3} (pi T)^{-4/3} as it propagates at the speed of light, shedding trailing sound waves with momenta of order (pi T).  At larger and larger q, the trailing sound wave becomes less and less prominent.  The outward-going beam of gluon radiation itself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger wavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated.  In this regard, the behavior of the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets produced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction of their energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or their momentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions.  However, we know that quark-gluon plasma must be weakly coupled at short enough distance scales.  This means that even if jet quenching typically occurs as in a strongly coupled plasma, there should be rare events in which a hard parton is scattered by a larger angle, picking up significant transverse momentum.",

      "Speaker": "Guang-You Qin",
      "Institute": "Duke University/Wayne State University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Jets propagating through dense matter are modified due to the scattering between the patrons of the jet with the constituents of the medium. Such scattering leads to an exchange of momenta between the medium and the jet, and has components that are both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of jet propagation. These scatterings introduce both drag and diffusion, and also change the rate of parton splitting leading to radiative energy loss. In all current calculations of jet modification, only the effect of transverse scattering (quantified by $\\hat{q}$) on stimulated emission has been considered. The effect of longitudinal exchange, leading to a drag and diffusion of the produced patrons, is included separately. We compute, for the first time, the gluon emission rate from a hard quark in the presence of both transverse and longitudinal exchange. Depending on the size of the longitudinal drag and diffusion coefficients, longitudinal scattering is shown to influence the radiative energy loss of a hard quark in a dense medium in a non-intuitive way. Ramifications of this effect for the phenomenology of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions will also be presented.",

We report on the measurement of various flow harmonics, v_n, with multi-particle cumulants, and present the results from a study of the inter-correlation among different order symmetry planes psi_n via multi-particle mixed harmonic correlations. This provides comprehensive experimental information on the fluctuating event-by-event shape of the initial conditions, which is currently among the main sources of large theoretical uncertainties in describing the evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Single heavy quark system has been considered as a hard probe for dynamical information of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), namely drag force, while heavy quarkonium has been thought to probe static information, such as heavy quark potential. However, this intuitive picture is not correct, in particular for the latter. Recent theoretical developments have shown that dynamical feature is also important in the physics of heavy quarkonia through complex heavy quark potential [1]. This complex potential can be understood as stochastic process in the medium [2]. However, as pointed out in [2], complete description must also explain the irreversible process, which results in drag force in the classical limit. In other words, a unified description of heavy quark systems is required.\r\nIn this presentation, I will develop such a quantum description for heavy quark systems in QGP on the basis of closed-time formalism in non-equilibrium field theory. In this description, I will explain how we can obtain the stochastic process and the drag force from the first principle and derive the master equation for quantum evolution of the heavy quark systems.\r\n\r\n[1] M.

      "Speaker": "Michael Weber",
      "Institute": "University of Houston (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "The creation of a strongly interacting deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be studied by the fluctuations of conserved quantities like net-charge, and correlations between positive and negative pairs by using the method of Balance functions. Net-charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges present in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are expected to be different from those of the hadron gas with unit charged particles. Lattice calculations suggest that the higher moments of net-charge distributions and their products are sensitive to the correlation length, and are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of the system. The method of the Balance function, on the other hand, is sensitive to collective flow and the breakup temperature and was proposed to give a handle on the hadronization time. A combined study of net-charge fluctuations with Balance functions provides insight to the properties of matter created in high energy collisions. We will present the first results of net-charge fluctuations, higher moments of net-charge distributions and Balance functions for Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results from net-charge fluctuations, presented in terms of νdyn and D-measure, are compared to predictions for a system initially dominated by a QGP, as well as for a hadron resonance gas. The widths of the Balance functions in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle for non-identified charged particles show a clear centrality dependence, consistent with the picture of a delayed hadronization but also with a system exhibiting larger radial expansion in central collisions. A comparison of the results will be made to lower energy collisions at SPS and RHIC as well as to several models that incorporate collective effects.",

We extract these harmonics from inclusive event by event di-hadron correlations, where the minimum track pT is larger than 0.15 GeV. Within a fine centrality bin, we find the correlation function varies substantially on an event by event basis, indicating large fluctuations in the initial conditions for a given impact parameter. Such large fluctuations lead to some events being highly triangular or highly elliptical, where the angular correlation function is completely dominated by the respective cos(2#delta#phi) and cos(3#delta#phi) terms. We will show the 2D inclusive correlation function for such events, and access the covariance between different harmonics. Finally, we will present first measurements of the full v2 distribution for various centralities, and report the higher moments. Implications for our understanding of the initial conditions will be discussed.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Recently there has been much discussed the appearance of inhomogeneous chiral phases in the vicinity of the chiral restoration [1,2]. The critical end point should be the Lifshitz point, which properties have not been explored so much.Here we discuss an implication of inhomogeneous phase on cooling of hybrid stars.\r\nWe consider the dual-chiral-density-wave (DCDW) specified by the spatially modulated quark condensates with amplitude \\Delta and wave number q [1], and study the beta decay of quarks. Since the DCDW state can be represented as a chirally rotated state, the quark weak-current is accordingly transformed to have an additional phase factor which modifies the energy-momentum conservation at the vertex. The direct evaluation of the neutrino luminosity shows that it is proportional to \\Delta^2q^2T^6, which exhibits a similar form to the pion cooling [3]. Since the DCDW phase develops only in the limited density region, this novel mechanism may give an interesting scenario that lower mass stars should be cooler than heavy-mass ones, which has been also proposed to explain the recent data of Cas A in the context of color superconductivity [4].  \r\n[1]E.

      "Abstract": "We discuss opportunities that may arise from subjecting high-multiplicity events in relativistic heavy ion collisions to an analysis similar to the one used in cosmology for the study of fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). To this end, we discuss examples of how pertinent features of heavy ion collisions including global characteristics, signatures of collective flow and event-wise fluctuations are visually represented in a Mollweide projection commonly used in CMB analysis, and how they are statistically analyzed in an expansion over spherical harmonic functions. If applied to the characterization of purely azimuthal dependent phenomena such as collective flow, the expansion coefficients of spherical harmonics are seen to contain redundancies compared to the set of harmonic flow coefficients commonly used in heavy ion collisions. Our exploratory study indicates, however, that these redundancies may offer novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of those event-wise fluctuations that remain after subtraction of the dominant collective flow signatures. By construction, the proposed approach allows also for the characterization of more complex collective phenomena like higher-order flow and other sources of fluctuations, and it may be extended to the characterization of phenomena of non-collective origin such as jets.\r\n\r\nJ.J.

      "Abstract": "Di-leptons are ideal probes of the strongly interacting hot and dense\r\nmedium created at RHIC. They are not affected by the strong interaction once produced, therefore they can probe the whole evolution of the collision. The di-leptons spectra in the intermediate mass range ($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$) are directly related to thermal radiation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). In the low mass range ($M_{ll}<1.1$GeV/$c^{2}$), we can study the vector meson in-medium properties through their di-leptons decays, the observable of possible chiral symmetry restoration. It has been proposed that the elliptic flow measurements of di-leptons in different mass regions will enable us to probe the properties of medium from hadron-gas dominated to QGP dominated. In 2010 and 2011 more than one billion minimum bias events were taken. The 2$\\pi$ azimuthal coverage of the newly installed time-of-flight subdetector\r\nenables the elliptic flow measurements of di-electrons. In this poster, we will report elliptic flow measurements of di-electrons from low to intermediate mass region for Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Differential measurements of di-electrons elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum in different mass regions will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Soft hadron production at LHC energies presented a new challenge for the statistical hadronization mode (SHM). We show that the SHARE chemical nonequilibrium model describes well the available hadron yield data. We than extend SHARE to include CHARM contribution to hadron yields and present a remarkably accurate description of hadron yields at energy s_{NN} =2.76 TeV for several high  multiplicity  centrality bins.We show that ignoring the charm contribution can introduce up to 40% contribution in yields of certain hadrons which, when measured, offer an indirect evaluation of charm production yield. We demonstrate that employing SHARE with CHARM our current fit of pions, kaons, protons, Xi's and Omegas  is fully consistent with our understanding of AuAu and CuCu data at 62.4 and 200 GeV. This demonstrates the overall superiority of the chemical nonequilibrium SHM model in predicting hadron production in relativistic heavy ion collisions.",

Using the 120 GeV proton beams from the Main Injector, E906/SeaQuest measures the Drell-Yan production in the dimuon mass region of 4-8 GeV in p+p and p+A collisions over a wide xF range. Parton energy loss in QGP is considered as the dominant mechanism of the observed jet-quenching phenomena at RHIC and LHC. In order to clearly estimate the energy loss effect in QGP possibly formed in A+A collisions, a benchmark of parton energy loss in cold (or normal) nuclear matter, established from p+A collisions, is indispensible. Since the center-of-mass energy of p+A collisions is low and the antiquarks of nucleons inside nuclei sit out of the nuclear shadowing region in E906/SeaQuest, our measurementof quark energy loss via Drell-Yan process will provide the first clean determination of parton energy loss effect in cold nuclear medium. E906/SeaQuest has been taking data since February 2012 and will continue to the end of April of this year. We will present the current status and the prospect of the parton energy loss measurements.",

We use Weyl invariance to obtain the most\r\ngeneral equations of motion containing 2 comoving derivatives of the\r\nshear stress tensor that are compatible with the symmetries. We show\r\nthat the asymptotic solution of this theory valid at times much larger\r\nthan the timescale associated with the “non-hydrodynamical” modes\r\nreproduces the well-known results previously obtained directly from\r\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence. If the QGP formed in heavy ion collisions\r\ncan be at least qualitatively understood in terms of strongly-coupled\r\nN = 4 SYM theory, the second time derivative present in the equations\r\nof motion of the fluid may lead to an unexpected dependence on the\r\ninitial conditions for the shear stress tensor needed in numerical\r\nhydrodynamic simulations.",

Considering that many of the particles have not been measured, extrapolation of their yields have decisive impact on the result of the analysis of  these  'bulk' properties. We present a strategy how to obtain precise description of the available data using a maximum-parameter phase space model. Our results show that the bulk properties at RHIC and LHC are extremely similar and do not differ significantly from high energy SPS results supporting the notion that bulk QGP at hadronization is governed by the same universal hadronization conditions charactrized by a common pressure and energy density. We show that the chemical equilibrium model forcing hadron yields to equilibrate in the hadron phase fails both to describe the data and to produce  consistent description of bulk properties across centrality and a wide energy domain, which we achieve.",

In particular, the ability to measure jets in heavy ion collisions implies that, in order to fully understand jet quenching phenomena, we must go beyond leading parton energy loss and attempt to describe how the jet structure is modified by the presence of the quark-gluon plasma. In this spirit, we study in-medium jet evolution by considering the multiple emission of soft gluons, for which the formation time is much smaller than the size of the medium. This separation of scales implies that one can consider the multiple emissions as independent and ordered in time, therefore allowing for a probabilistic interpretation where the parton shower is built as a classical branching process.",

The decay products of these resonances carry information on the resonance properties at the space time point of their decay. \r\nWe especially investigate the percentage of reconstructable resonances as a function of density for heavy ion collisions in the energy range between $E_{lab}$ = 30~AGeV and $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200~AGeV, the energy domain between the future FAIR facility and the present RHIC collider. \r\nWe will show the dependency of the reconstructability of resonances on baryon density, which unexpectedly  increases with higher density. \r\nWe will explain this phenomenon by analyzing the points of origin and the transverse momentum of the resonances. The differences between RHIC and FAIR energies will be explored.\r\nAdditionally we study leptonic decay channels and argue that dileptons, contrary to the common thinking only offer a restricted view on the hot and dense phase of heavy ion collisions. \r\n\r\nFinally we will suggest measurements that might circumvent those problems.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal emission of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions is believed to have a very strong temperature dependence and the high p_T thermal photons are expected to provide a glimpse of the early part of the expansion history when the system is still in the plasma phase. Photons having p_T > 1 GeV/c are thus specially suitable for probing fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density distributions. We present the p_T spectra, ratio of central to-peripheral yield and elliptic flow of thermal photons from an event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic calculation with fluctuating initial conditions (IC).\r\n\r\nWe show that fluctuations in the IC enhance the production of thermal photons significantly in the range 2 < p_T < 4 GeV/c compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged profile for Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions at RHIC (LHC) [1,2]. The relative effect of fluctuations in the IC is found to be stronger for peripheral collisions and for lower beam energies. Thermal photon p_T spectra are studied for different values of initial formation time \\tau_0 as well as for centrality dependent \\tau_0 values. We show that a suitably normalized ratio of central-to-peripheral yield as a function of collision centrality and p_T can be a useful measure of the fluctuation size scale [2].\r\n\r\nPHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow at RHIC is found to be significantly larger than the v_2 results obtained using ideal hydrodynamics with smooth IC in the region 1 < p_T < 6 GeV/c. We show that fluctuations in the IC increase the elliptic flow for p_T > 2  GeV/c for  mid-central collisions compared to the results from a smooth initial-state-averaged profile [3]. We also show that these results depend strongly on the value of the fluctuation size scale as well as on the initial and final conditions of the  hydrodynamic calculation [3].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] R.

      "Abstract": "The knowledge of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) is essential for interpreting any hard-process results from hadronic and nuclear collisions. The nuclear modifications of PDFs have been successfully determined through a global DGLAP analysis e.g. in the sets EKS98 and more recently EPS09. So far the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) in the global fits have been taken to be spatially independent. However, it can be expected that the nuclear modifications vary when going from the dense center of a nucleus to its more dilute edge. In this work, using the $A$-dependence of the globally fitted nPDFs, we have been able to determine the spatial dependence of the nPDFs in terms of powers of the nuclear thickness functions. A routine for public use is released. For applications, we will discuss how one can then compute hard-process cross sections in different centrality classes of nuclear collisions. In particular, we consider the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm dAu}$ for neutral pion production in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC. Comparison with the PHENIX data in different centrality classes is also shown. In addition, predictions for the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ in proton-lead collisions at the LHC are discussed. Both leading-order and next-to-leading order results are considered.",

This analysis is based on 0.306/ub of data from 2010, with recently extended number (and range) of pseudorapidity and centrality bins. The transverse energy per unit of pseudorapidity increases faster with collision energy than the multiplicity of charged particles. This implies that the mean energy per particle and hence the temperature of the system is increasing with collision energy. The amount of transverse energy produced per participating nucleon increases with centrality and with collision energy. The centrality dependence of transverse energy production has only a weak dependence on pseudorapidity and collision energy. For the most central collisions, the energy density is estimated to be 11.3 +- 0.6 GeV/fm3 at a time of 1 fm/c after the collision, which is 2.8 times higher than the value reported at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV.",

These measurements make use of the high-statistics jet-triggered data recorded in 2011, including the total available PbPb luminosity of 150/ub. Charged particles are reconstructed using an iterative algorithm and spurious high-pT tracks are suppressed by requiring appropriate energy deposits in the calorimeter system. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm, using combined information from tracking and calorimetry. The charged particle and jet transverse momentum distributions are measured in the pseudorapidity range of |eta|<1 and |eta| < 1.6, and in pT up to 100 GeV/c, and from 100 to 300 GeV/c, respectively. The nuclear modification factors, RAAs, for charged hadrons and jets are presented as a function of pT and collision centrality. In the range pT = 5-10 GeV/c the charged hadron production in PbPb collisions is suppressed by up to a factor of seven, compared to the pp yield scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The charged hadron RAA increases at higher pT and approaches a value of approximately 0.5 in the range pT = 40-100 GeV/c.",

      "Abstract": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research will use a time-of-flight (TOF) wall for hadron identification, based on the MRPC technology. The challenge is to keep high efficiencies (above 90%) and good time resolutions (less than 80ps) at particle fluxes up to 20kHz/cm2, which is not accessible to conventional float-glass MRPCs. For this purpose, a type of low-resistivity doped glass with bulk resistivity on the order of 1010 Ωcm was produced at Tsinghua University. Several high-rate prototypes based on this material have been developed and tested in beam.\r\nIn the current conceptual design, the whole CBM-TOF wall is arranged in four “rate regions”. In the inner region of the wall (region 1), pad readout MRPCs based on low-resistive glass can be efficiently used to cope with the high particle fluxes and granularities (above 20 kHz/cm2), while strip-readout MRPCs represent a natural choice for the outer region where the system occupancy is orders of magnitude lower. Recently, our effort is to realistically adapt the MRPC geometry to suit the conceptual design of the TOF wall. Two kinds of real-size MRPC modules made of low-resistivity doped glass were developed, and beam tested were performed both with protons at the Electron Linac with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) facility at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). \r\nWe summarize here the results from the latest beam test of the two real-size modules at ELBE facility at HZDR. The counters show high efficiencies above 90%, and time resolutions (MRPC+FEE) down to 60ps, at particle flux up to 100 kHz/cm2, thus fulfill the CBM requirements.",

      "Abstract": "The anisotropy associated with the initial dipole asymmetry in heavy ion collisions is studied via the first harmonic coefficient $v_{1,1}$ of the two-particle azimuthal angle correlations, within AMPT and HIJING model (AMPT is essentially HIJING + parton/hadron transport). For a broad selection of centrality, transverse momenta and pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), a fitting method is used to decompose $v_{1,1}$ into a rapidity-even component, characterized by the Fourier coefficient $v_1$, and a global momentum conservation component. We found that the $v_{1,1}$ data from HIJING can be entirely described by the momentum conservation component, while description of the data from AMPT requires both components. This proves that the rapidity-even $v_1$ is indeed a collective phenomena transferred from initial dipole asymmetry by the strong final state interaction. The extracted $v_1$ values are negative for pT < 0.7-0.9 GeV, reach a maximum at 2-3 GeV, and decreases at higher pT. The $v_1$ values vary weakly with $\\eta$ and centrality, but increase with collision energy, strong coupling constant ($\\alpha_s$) and parton cross-section ($\\sigma$). We compare our results with ATLAS $v_1$ data extracted from same two-component fit [1]. This comparison allows us to constrain $\\alpha_s$ and $\\sigma$, and consequently the values of shear viscosity. We analyze the values of the extracted global momentum conservation component and compare with those calculated based on Borghini et.al. [2]; the comparison suggests that the effective size of the system that conserve momentum is about 1/3 of the total multiplicity of the event, also consistent with the ATLAS data. We then extract $v_1$ using the modified event plane method proposed by Luzum et.al. [3] and compared with those obtained from two-particle correlation. The differences between the two methods, and consequently the caveat for applying this event plane method to experimental analysis, are discussed. Finally, we extend our simulation to identified particles (proton, kaon and meson). This extension allows us to predict/test the constituent quark scaling which was only done before for higher-order harmonic flow.

The main difference between our approach and the traditional 14-moment approximation is that we do not close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion by truncating the expansion of the single-particle momentum distribution function. Instead, we keep all the terms in the moment expansion and truncate the exact equations of motion for these moments according to a systematic power counting scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers. We apply this formalism to obtain an approximate expression for the non-equilibrium single-particle momentum distribution function of a hadron resonance gas. Then, we investigate the implications of our new formalism in the freeze-out description of the hadron resonance gas and compare it with the method traditionally used in heavy-ion collisions, the 14-moment approximation.\r\n\r\n[1] G.S.

Initial charge separations of about 10 % for 200 GeV, 5 % for 39 GeV, 0 % for 11.5 GeV appear to be necessary. This is consistent with decreasing Chiral Magnetic Effect as the incident energy decreases at RHIC. A reduced partonic interaction cross section is also needed for 11.5 GeV, indicating possible significant contributions from the hadronic stage. For Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV, 10% initial charge separation can produce similar behaviors as those at the top RHIC energy.

      "Abstract": "Three-particle correlations have been used to probe for local parity violation (LPV) in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed during Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC [1]. Further expanding on this analysis, we present our results on looking at these correlations through pairing kaons and pions produced during the collision events (while fixing the third particle to be another pion). The idea behind looking at kaon-pion (K-Pi) correlations is that the two-body correlations between these distinct particles are weaker than those between pions with themselves. It may be that the tendency of two pions to be emitted at small angles to one another can be an important ingredient in a strong interaction background [2]. Hence, looking at K-Pi correlations may reduce potential effects from such backgrounds and possibly other parity-even effects that may contribute to the three-particle correlator.\r\n\r\nWe present charge dependent azimuthal correlations between pions and kaons identified by using the Time-Of-Flight detector as a function of centrality, $\\delta\\eta$ and $\\deltap_{T}$ between pairs in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

      "Country": "CZ",
      "Abstract": "We discuss a production of direct photons at large transverse momenta p_T in nuclear collisions at different energies and rapidities corresponding to RHIC and LHC experiments. Direct photons are very convenient tool for investigation of nuclear effects since \r\nthey are not expected to be accompanied by any final state interaction, either energy loss or absorption. Therefore, besides the Cronin enhancement at medium-high p_T and small isotopic corrections at larger p_T, one should not expect any nuclear effects. However, data from the PHENIX experiment at mid-rapidities demonstrate a significant large-p_T suppression in central d+Au and Au+Au collisions that cannot be induced by coherent phenomena (gluon shadowing, Color Glass Condensate). We demonstrate that such an unexpected result is a subject to the energy conservation constraints (ECC) in initial state multiple parton interactions. The corresponding suppression factor falls steeply with p_T and leads to rather strong decrease with p_T of the nuclear modification factor violating so QCD factorization. In the RHIC kinematic region at forward rapidities we include also coherent phenomena as an additional source of nuclear suppression. In the LHC energy range ECC effects are irrelevant at mid-rapidities, but they are going to be important with increasing rapidity. We study for the first time a relative contribution of both sources of nuclear suppression at different rapidities performing predictions that could be verified in the future by experiments at RHIC and LHC. We analyze also a contribution of gluon shadowing as a leading twist shadowing correction modifying nuclear effects especially at small p_T.",

      "Abstract": "We have studied the effect of shear viscosity effects on direct photons as well as lepton pair production from Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The production rate for both these two thermodynamic signals gets modified due to: (i) changed space-time evolution of the viscous fluid and (ii) non-equilibrium correction to the equilibrium distribution function. The non-equilibrium correction grows with viscosity as well as transverse momentum. Viscous effects on photon production are strong [1]. The space-time evolution of QGP was obtained by solving Israel-Stewart’s second order hydrodynamics for $\\sqrt_{NN}$=200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Effect of viscosity is to stiffen the dilepton spectra and reduce the elliptic flow [2]. Although, the rate of applicability is limited in the pT range due to non-equilibrium effects, the thermometric signals can limit the initial temperature and viscosity, the ratios of dileptons to photons it is expected, can be a fairly good measure of viscosity without the uncertainty of initial conditions. Shear viscosity per entropy, it seems, does not change appreciably going from RHIC to LHC. We intend to explore this puzzle.\r\n\r\n[1]  A.K. Chaudhuri and Bikash Sinha, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "The universe is assumed to begin with a large baryonic chemical potential acquired through an Affleck – Dine mechanism, which leads on to a baryon asymmetry of 0(1) without requiring superhigh temperatures. However, the observed baryon asymmetry of 0(10-10) at CMB temperature needs to emerge naturally from such a scenario. This is what could be achieved through a “little inflation” of about 7 e – folding leading to a QCD first order transition [1], while remaining in a deconfined and in a chirally symmetric phase. It was demonstrated [2] using chromoelectric flux-tube fission model that some strange quark “nuggets” (SQN) [3] with an initial baryon number ~ 1044  or more can survive the evaporation process and be stable on cosmological time scales. We demonstrate that these SQN’s are natural candidates for baryonic dark matter. We also argue that these SQNs, together with the natural requirement that the total baryon number of the universe is an integer [4], can explain the occurrence of the cosmological dark energy within the standard model of particle physics.\r\n\r\n[1]  T.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, charm and bottom, are produced in early stages of heavy-ion collisions. Propagating through the created matter they serve as a probe of the dynamics of the strongly-interacting, hot and dense plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP).\r\nThe transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow (v2) of heavy quarks is sensitive to the properties of the QGP.\r\nA non-zero v2 of low transverse momentum electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavours indicates a collective motion of the heavy quarks with respect to the bulk of the created matter. Whereas, the high transverse momentum v2 is sensitive to the path length dependence of heavy-quark energy loss within the QGP.\r\nWe present measurements of heavy-flavour electron v2 in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at mid-rapidity. In 2011, the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) provided a dedicated online trigger for measurements of high momentum electrons in Pb-Pb collisions. The electrons were identified in these triggered events using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). The heavy-flavour electron v2 will be shown as a function of the transverse momentum of the decay electrons.",

      "Abstract": "Strong fluctuations in observables are believed to provide decisive signals for identifying phase transitions of QCD in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. To study this possibility under realistic conditions of the expansion and the cooling of the fireball we performed dynamic simulations within our approach of nonequilibrium chiral fluid dynamics. Based on an effective phase transition model, chiral fields and their fluctuations propagate explicitly within a medium that expands fluid dynamically. The interaction between the fields and the fluid leads to dissipation and noise, which in turn affect the chiral propagation. In this talk we present the consequences of this coupled dynamics for different phase transition scenarios.\r\nIn the case of a first order phase transition we observe the development of a highly supercooled state. This leads to the dynamic formation and decay of domains of the chirally-symmetric phase in a chirally-broken environment and can be seen in single event studies. At the critical point, due to large relaxation times, we find that critical slowing down weakens the critical phenomena. However, for the first time we are able to demonstrate in a dynamic and realistic study the basic features of a critical point: the growth of the correlation length and the enhancement of event-by-event fluctuations of the sigma field. It is, therefore, expected that both, the first order phase transition and the critical point develop their characteristic signals in heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Speaker": "Kurt Jung",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Dileptons are unique probes of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Compared to hadrons, leptons have little interaction with the QGP medium and can thus travel through the entire system with most of the original information intact. This feature allows us to study the properties of the medium during its space-time evolution.  The low mass region (LMR, m < 1.1 GeV/c^2) is dominated by the decay of the vector mesons, in which chiral symmetry restoration in the medium can be studied. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, 1.1 < m < 3.0 GeV/c^2), the dominant dilepton sources are expected to be the thermal radiation of the QGP and the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Systematic measurements in both mass regions and at all pT are crucial in revealing the medium's properties.  Finally, high-pT dileptons in particular allow measurements of direct photons and of spectrum enhancements in the LMR.\r\n\r\nTo observe the dilepton production at high pT, it is necessary to utilize the data from the high-pT triggers in conjunction with the minimum-bias trigger.  These dielectron measurements are made using data from the STAR time projection chamber, time of flight, and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter (BEMC) at midrapidity.  In this poster, we present a study on the dielectron production in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions recorded by the STAR detector in 2010 using a novel combination of the minimum-bias trigger and three high-pT triggers with different energy thresholds in the BEMC.  Because the mass spectrum from each high-pT trigger is biased, we apply an effective weight to each dielectron pair based on the trigger threshold and scale factor.  Finally, we combine the weighted results from all four triggers.  The analysis details and associated mass spectra will be discussed.",

Fluctuation in the initial energy density comes from not only the coherent soft interaction of overlapping nucleons but also the number of mini-jets within each binary nucleon collision. Mini-jets produced via semi-hard parton scatterings are assumed to be locally thermalized through a Gaussian smearing and give rise to fluctuation in rapidity distribution along the longitudinal direction. The longitudinal fluctuation is found to lead to sizable reduction of elliptic flow at large transverse momentum.",

      "Speaker": "Rone Andrade",
      "Institute": "Universidade de São Paulo USP",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In this work we study how highly energetic jets affect the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in an  event-by-event basis. This is done by the introduction of a source term [1] in the energy-momentum conservation equation that describes the evolution of inviscid hydrodynamics (with a realistic equation of state [2]). The source is parametrized in terms of the direction of the jet in the medium and its energy loss rate. The influence of jets on the QGP collective flow is systematically investigated using the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal flow distribution computed at both RHIC and LHC energies. In addition, we discuss the structure of the two-particle correlation function taking into account both initial state fluctuations [3,4] and the effects of jets. While the propagation of jets in a smooth QGP has been extensively studied before, the interplay between the different sources of flow anisotropy (i.e, initial state fluctuations and jets) studied in this work poses some new questions about the hydrodynamical evolution of the QGP. For instance, can Mach cones consistently form in an event-by-event basis? Do the highly high energetic jets present at LHC lead to novel structures in the two-particle correlation function? In this presentation we intend to shed some light on such questions.\r\n\r\n[1] A.K.Chaudhuri and U.Heinz, Effect of jet quenching on the hydrodynamical evolution of QGP, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "One of the most difficult problems still to be understood is the mechanism of fast thermalization in heavy ion collisions. The problem involves dynamics in strong coupling regime and physics far from equilibrium, therefore is hardly tractable by usual method. The gauge/gravity duality naturally maps the formation of quark gluon plasma to another fundamental problem in black hole physics: information loss in a gravitational collapse process. The present work summarizes our recent results on the study of a particular probe: unequal time two-point correlator for gauge theory in the evolution toward thermal equilibrium. In [1], we found that near equilibrium the spectral functions showed a universal pattern as field equilibrates in a quasi-static approximation. We have then systematically extended the previous work to the far from equilibrium region by using the coordinate representation. In the past two years we have developed a divergence matching method in computing the singularities of the unequal time two-point correlator in a time-dependent background. We found the singularities have a nice interpretation with a geometric optics picture [2,3]. Applying this method to the gravitational collapse model, we found the singularities of the unequal time correlator shifted from the real time to the complex time in the formation of QGP [4]. This signature sheds more light on the mechanism of the thermalization and may have interesting implications to heavy ion phenomenology and experiments.\r\n\r\n[1] S.~Lin and E.~Shuryak,\r\n  %``Toward the AdS/CFT Gravity Dual for High Energy Collisions. 3.

We start from vacuum spectral functions which include both ground- and excited-state resonances for both the vector and axial-vector channels, supplemented by an identical perturbative continuum. The vacuum spectral functions are constructed to agree with tau decay data and Weinberg sum rules. In the medium, the rho spectral function is\r\ntaken from effective hadronic many-body theory which is consistent with available dilepton data. The in-medium properties of the rho' are constrained by satisfying the in-medium QCD sum rule. For the axial-vector channel, different ansaetze are chosen for the in-medium a1 (broadening, mass drop, two-level model), while the medium modification of the excited state is again constrained by the QCD sum rule. These different ansaetze are then tested for chiral symmetry restoration through the Weinberg sum rules.",

In 2010 (Run 10) PHENIX has collected 8.2 billion events of Au+Au collision with 200 GeV of center-of-mass energy per nucleon, a factor of 1.5 times larger than the same collision system collected in 2007 (Run 7). Improvement can also be achieved by event-by-event based methods that would reject large number of the background photons and thus increase the signal-to-background ratio.

At high pt, v2 provides insight on the path length dependence of parton energy-loss. \r\nOne channel to measure the heavy-flavour v2 is semi-electronic decays of hadrons carrying a charm or a beauty quark.\r\nALICE recorded Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at the end of 2010 and 2011.\r\nThe presented poster will focus on the method to subtract the background electron contribution in the measurement of the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour decay electrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with ALICE at mid-rapidity.\r\nThe elliptic flow of inclusive electrons is measured with the event plane method. At high pt the contribution of electrons from heavy-flavour decays is expected to be dominant, whereas at low pt most electrons come from Dalitz decays of pi0 and gamma conversions in the detector material. A Monte Carlo simulation, based on the measured elliptic flow and pt distributions of the main background sources, is performed to estimate the contribution from known background electrons. The knowledge of the ratio of inclusive electrons to the known background electrons allows to subtract the background cocktail from the inclusive electron v2 and obtain the heavy flavour decay electron v2.",

The physics goals of including the calorimeter in the forward direction are to study outstanding fundamental QCD problems at low Bjorken-x values, such as parton distributions in the nuclei, to test pQCD predictions, and to probe high temperature and high density matter in greater detail. As a very promising probe we intend to study direct photons and correlations involving photons, pions, and jets over a broad range rapidity in p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the highest LHC energies. For these measurements, the detector needs to be capable of measuring photons of energies up to several 100 GeV and be able to discriminate them from neutral pions. This will require a detector of unprecedented granularity. The detector design consists of silicon sensor layers interleaved with layers of tungsten absorber. The use of both conventional silicon sensors and of monolithic pixels is investigated. We will discuss the detector requirements and design options and will present results of Monte-Carlo simulations and test measurements with detector prototypes.",

      "Abstract": "Almost all charm in heavy ion collisions is produced in the hard 'first interaction'  processes before partons thermalize into a drop of QGP. Charm survives the QGP evolution and as hadrons emerge in soft hadronization  processes, practically every charm or anticharm quark turns into a charmed hadron, small fraction of the charm yield enters multi-charmed hadrons and charmonium states. We assume that in the hadronization process the single charmed hadrons production is governed by the available phase space and their yield is normalized by the total single charm hadron yield. By allowing for charm hadron to charm hadron decay cascades, we establish total fraction of single charm hadrons found in their ground states. We  show that the yields of charmed mesons can help to determine the charm  hadronization temperature. We further cascade single charmed  hadrons into non-charmed hadrons and show that at LHC these cascade products add  significant fraction to certain strange hadron yields.We discuss particularly interesting examples such as  phi (bar s s) and Xi(ssq). This shows that one cannot study charm and hadron production at LHC omitting the charm conversion into soft hadrons.",

Also, because of the prevalence of the Compton scattering in the direct photon events, the away-side jets are predominantly produced by quark jets. We analyze the azimuthal correlation between high pT direct photons and hadrons and look for the modification of the away-side jet portion of this correlation. The current status of this gamma-jet correlation analysis in d+Au collisions is presented in this poster. This includes analysis of the $x_{E}$ distribution which is related to the fragmentation function D(z). We will also present the status of a new analysis in d+Au of the asymmetry between positive and negative charged hadrons in the away-side quark jets due to the cross-section dominance of up vs down quarks, which can be compared to Au+Au.",

      "Abstract": "The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the central tracking device of the ALICE experiment, providing momentum measurement and particle identification via the specific energy loss dE/dx. The readout rate of the TPC is presently limited by the necessity to prevent ions from the amplification region of the MWPC-based readout chambers to drift back into the drift volume, which is achieved through active ion gating by operating a dedicated Gating Grid. The relevant ion drift times limit the maximum trigger rate of the TPC to about 3.5 kHz. For future running at the LHC beyond 2019, where collision rates of 50 kHz in Pb-Pb are expected, these limitations can be overcome by replacing the present MWPC-based readout chambers by a GEM readout, which provides intrinsic ion capture capability without additional gating. In this contribution the perspectives of a GEM TPC for ALICE with continuous readout are discussed and the expected performance and status of R & D will be presented.",

A radiative transport model can be used to reveal interesting characteristics of Quark-Gluon Plasma thermalization. For example, screened parton interactions always lead to partial pressure isotropization. Systems with different initial pressure anisotropies evolve toward the same asymptotic evolution. In particular, radiative processes are crucial for the chemical equilibration of the system. Matrix elements under the soft and collinear approximation for these processes as first derived by Gunion and Bertsch are widely used. A different approach is to start with the exact matrix element for the 2<->3 processes as was first conjectured by Parke and Taylor. General features of this approach will be reviewed and the results will be compared with the Gunion-Bertsch results.

We derive the medium induced gluon spectrum of an ``asymptotic\" parton which suffers a hard scattering and subsequently crosses a QCD medium. The angular distribution of the induced gluon spectrum gets modified when one includes interference terms between the incoming and the outcoming parton at finite angle. In the soft limit, we provide a simple and intuitive probabilistic picture which could be of interest for Monte Carlo implementations.

The FVTX consists of two endcaps, with four silicon mini-strip planes each, covering the angles from ~10 to 35 degrees (1.2< |y|<2.2) that match the two existing PHENIX muon spectrometer arms. Each silicon plane consists of 48 wedges of mini-strips with 75 micron pitch in the radial direction and lengths in the phi direction varying from 3.4 mm at the inner radius to 11.5 mm at the outer radius.  The FVTX has about 0.54 million strips in each forward detector that are read out with FPHX chips which are wire bonded directly to the mini-strips.  This chip provides analog and digital processing with zero-suppression and produces a digital output which is data-pushed at 200 Mbps to an intelligent readout board (ROC) containing Field-Programmable Gate Arrays.  The maximum occupancy reached in central Au-Au collisions is less than 3%.  With an expected distance of closest approach (DCA) resolution of 200 microns or better at 5 GeV/c, we will improve tracking from the original collision vertex and be able to identify secondary particles from in-flight decays.

      "Abstract": "There has been a lot of interest in testing radiative energy loss \r\ncalculations against data from RHIC and the LHC. It is customary, as in the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) approach, to formulate the energy loss of a jet parton as a line integral from the production point along a straight-line trajectory. Calculations then account for variations in path length with jet origin and direction, and most recently also for fluctuations in the medium density (lumpiness), which give rise to fluctuations in energy loss that significantly affect high-pT observables such as the nuclear suppression R_AA or the momentum anisotropies v_n.\r\n\r\nThese studies, however, ignore that the line integrals themselves \r\nrepresent an average over the location of possible interaction points \r\n(color sources in GLV) along the jet path. We will present results from a calculation with stochastically chosen interaction points for each jet, which gives additional fluctuations in energy loss. The influence of these fluctuations on RHIC and LHC observables will be discussed utilizing both medium density parameterizations and realistic medium evolution from bulk dynamics models, such as the parton transport MPC. A special advantage of using parton transport is that it conveniently provides the evolution of an ensemble of scattering centers.",

For $\\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV $\\bar{p}-p$ collisions, the UA2 collaboration~\\cite{UA2PLB165} measured that the hard-scattering component of $\\sum E_T$ distributions only becomes apparent at the level of $\\sim 1/500$ the total cross-section, clearly indicating that the contribution of hard-process to the multiplicity and $\\sum E_T$ distributions is negligible. The universal behavior of $\\mean{dN_{\\rm ch}^{AA}/(0.5N_{\\rm part}d\\eta)}$ as a function of $N_{\\rm part}$ at RHIC and LHC over the range $7\\leq \\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\leq 2760$ GeV, in spite of the dramatic increase in the ratio of $N_{\\rm coll}/N_{\\rm part}$ due to the increasing N-N interaction cross section, is another indication. Finally, an $E_T$ distribution which satisfies the popular formula for $\\mean{dN_{\\rm ch}^{AA}/d\\eta}$ will be demonstrated and shown to look nothing like any measured $\\sum E_T$ distribution. A more reasonable nuclear geometrical description has been given previously~\\cite{Voloshin,De,Nouicer} and will be tested with recent data.  \r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\r\n\\bibitem{UA2PLB165} UA2 Collab., \\Journal{\\PLB}{165}{441-448}{1985}.\r\n\\bibitem{Voloshin} S.~Eremin and S.~Voloshin, \\Journal{\\PRC}{67}{064905}{2003}.\r\n\\bibitem{De} B.~De and S.~Bhattacharyya, \\Journal{\\PRC}{71}{024903}{2005}.\r\n\\bibitem{Nouicer} R.

      "Abstract": "A new source of photon and dilepton emission from nuclear matter undergoing phase transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is studied. Electromagnetic radiation can be emitted when quark antiquark pairs recombine into pions and other hadrons. The photon and dilepton production rates are found to be comparable to those in quark gluon plasma and hadronic matter around the critical temperature. We compute the photon and dilepton yields from such processes for Au+Au collision at RHIC(\\sqrt{s}=200GeV) by convoluting the rates with a hydrodynamic simulation of the system. A comparison of the results to PHENIX and STAR measurements shows that dileptons from hadronization processes could partially explain the excess of low mass dilepton. The transverse momentum spectrum exhibits a smaller effective temperature than the QGP contribution. The elliptic flow of dileptons from the hadronization process behaves similar to the elliptic flow of dileptons from hadronic matter.  Photon yields from these processes are not found to be important compared to QGP emission.",

      "Speaker": "Akihiko Monnai",
      "Institute": "The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The first results of the heavy ion program at LHC [1] suggest that the near-perfect fluidity discovered at RHIC is a universal property of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) above and around the crossover temperature. The recent developments in hydrodynamic studies take account of the effects of shear and bulk viscosities as well as fluctuations for the quantitative understanding of the hot medium. On the other hand, net baryon number is neglected in most of the modern hydrodynamic analyses even though it is fully conserved at forward rapidity. Since the net baryon carries valuable information on the remnant of the colliding nuclei and thus on the magnitude of kinetic energy loss for the QGP production in the yet-unknown early thermalization stage, the next task for hydrodynamic analyses should be to incorporate finite baryon density.\r\n\r\nIn this study, I develop a novel dissipative hydrodynamic model with finite net baryon density to investigate the net baryon rapidity distributions at RHIC and LHC [2]. Baryon dissipation is taken into account together with shear and bulk viscosities by a generalized second order theory [3]. The state-of-art lattice QCD equation of state and the color glass type initial conditions are employed. The results show that the net baryon is carried to forward rapidity during the hydrodynamic evolution, which implies that the experimentally observed transparency of the collision at RHIC [4] is effectively enhanced. This indicates that the kinetic energy loss for the production of the hot medium at the initial stage is larger, and then a part of the energy is transferred back to the net baryon components through the strong medium interaction. Furthermore, the net baryon distribution is found sensitive to baryon diffusion as well as to viscosities. This opens a possibility of constraining all the transport coefficients experimentally, including the ones at finite density such as baryon diffusion coefficient and thermo-diffusion cross coefficient. The results indicate that the dissipative hydrodynamic modeling would be important for extracting unique properties of the hot medium even in the high-energy collisions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] K.

      "Abstract": "We investigate how the initial geometry of a heavy-ion collision is transformed into final flow observables by solving event-by-event ideal hydrodynamics with realistic fluctuating initial conditions.  We study quantitatively to what extent anisotropic flow ($v_n$) is determined by the initial eccentricity $\\varepsilon_n$ for a set of realistic simulations, and we discuss which definition of $\\varepsilon_n$ gives the best estimator of $v_n$.  We find that the common practice of using an $r^2$ weight in the definition of $\\varepsilon_n$ in general results in a poorer predictor of $v_n$ than when using $r^n$ weight, for $n > 2$.   We similarly study the importance of additional properties of the initial state.  For example, we show that in order to correctly predict $v_4$ and $v_5$ for non-central collisions, one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional to $\\varepsilon_2^2$ and $\\varepsilon_2\\varepsilon_3$, respectively.  We find that it makes no difference whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity, or in a single slice at $z=0$, nor is it important whether one uses an energy or entropy density weight. This knowledge will be important for making a more direct link between experimental observables and hydrodynamic initial conditions, the latter being poorly constrained at present.",

      "Abstract": "The AdS/CFT correspondence has been widely used to study the jet quenching of hard probes traveling in the strongly-coupled plasma. Nevertheless, in most of studies, the hard probes were assumed to be created at the late time within the thermalized medium. To understand the thermalization of the medium and its influence on high-energy probes generated in the early time in the strongly-coupled scenario would entail further investigations. In the gravity dual, the thermalization of the medium corresponds to the gravitational collapse and the formation of a black hole. We utilize the AdS-Vaidya metric, which describes a falling mass shell, to analyze the isotropic thermalization. In WKB approximation, the dissipation of a high-energy jet traversing the medium can be characterized by the stopping distance of a massless particle falling along the null geodesic in the gravity dual. We find the stopping distance of an energetic probe in AdS-Vaidya spacetime is equal to that in AdS-Schwarzschild spacetime, which implies that a probe with the energy much greater than the thermalization temperature is not be sensitive to the thermalization process, at least in this idealized scenario. This is different from a gluon probe with finite energy represented by a falling string in the gravity dual, where the stopping distance is governed by the null geodesic starting below the boundary. We find that the stopping distance is increased in the presence of the thermalization process.",

      "Abstract": "Higher cumulant ratios of conserved charges are suggested to be sensitive probe of QCD critical end point [1] in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Their behaviors at current relativistic heavy ion collisions are highly interested and studied intensively [2,3]. Before we draw the critical-like fluctuations from the measured higher cumulants, it is necessary to know what the contributions of conventional effects are.  \r\n    In the present work, we firstly derive the Poisson-like statistical fluctuations of net-proton number [4], and net-electric charge. It shows that net-proton kurtosis at top incident energy of RHIC [3] is dominated by Poisson-liked statistical fluctuations [4]. So dynamical higher moments, subtracting the statistical parts, are suggested.  \r\n    Secondly, the influences of the centrality, the efficiency of the detector, and the cuts of transverse momentum (pT) and rapidity in higher cumulant ratios of net-proton are systematically studied by using the sample of Au + Au collisions at 39GeV generated by APMT default model. It is found: (1) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are sensitive to the definitions of centrality. (2) Dynamical cumulant ratios are little efficiency dependent. (3) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are the cuts of phase-space dependent. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] Volker Koch, arXiv:0810.2520.\r\nM.A. Stephanov, Phys. Rev.

      "Institute": "Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, Wuhan China",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The radial flow parameters are important quantities in relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. They constrain the equation of state [2] and in particular, the anisotropic parameter relates to shear viscosity [3]. They are usually extracted from the spectrum of transverse momentum by the parameterizations of Blast-wave model [4]. \r\n    In the present work, we suggest a direct measure of radial velocity, i.e., microscopic average velocity of freeze-out particles in azimuthal plane. It contains three parts: average radial expansion velocity, average anisotropic velocity (the amplitude of modulation in radial expansion velocity as function of the relative angle to the reaction plane), and average thermal velocity. \r\n     Using the sample of Au+ Au collisions at 200 GeV produced by AMPT with string melting model, we demonstrate that this microscopic average velocity is well fitted by two parts: an average isotropic velocity, and an average anisotropic velocity, which is azimuthal angle dependent. This form of radial velocity is the same as theoretically expected radial flow parameterization [5]. But the difference is that the average isotropic velocity contains the contributions of thermal motion. From the particle species dependence of the average isotropic velocity, we demonstrate that the heavier the mass of the particles, the smaller the isotropic velocity is. It is just the character of thermal motion. \r\n      Fortunately, average thermal velocity is isotropic and therefore has no contribution toward the average anisotropic velocity. In order to confirm this, the centrality dependence of average radial velocity is presented. We find that its anisotropic part is close to zero when the collisions approach to the central ones. It shows indeed no anisotropic velocity in an ideal central collision. \r\n       Moreover, we carefully extract kinetic freeze-out parameters in the same sample by fitting pt spectrum and elliptic flow using the parameterization of blast-wave model [4,6]. It is found that the average anisotropic velocity is well coincident with the anisotropic flow velocity extracted by blast-wave model. Furthermore, the centrality dependence of average anisotropic velocity is also consistent with that of extracted from the Blast-wave model.

Such a measurement provides information on the pathlength dependence of medium-induced parton energy loss as well as biases in jet-finding methods.  In addition, an estimate of jet $v_2$ is necessary for background-subtraction in jet-triggered correlation analyses, which are used to study medium-induced jet shape modification.  However, jet $v_2$ measurements are complicated by biases in the event plane calculation due to the presence of the jet, leading to an overestimation of jet $v_2$.  In order to reduce the artificial jet-event plane bias, we utilize detectors at forward pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), such as the Forward Time Projection Chambers located at $2.5 < |\\eta| < 4$ and the Zero Degree Calorimeter Shower Maximum Detectors at $|\\eta| > 6.3$, to determine the event plane when measuring $v_2$ of reconstructed jets at mid-rapidity ($|\\eta| < 1$).

At low temperatures and density this approximate symmetry is also spontaneously broken, while at higher temperatures and/or densities a chiral-symmetry restoring phase transition is expected. Collider experiments at LHC (CERN) probe the phase diagramm at high energy densities and low chemical and baryon chemical potentials, where the chiral phase transition is expected to be a cross over. Future experiments at FAIR (GSI) probe the region with high chemical potential, where a lower-order phase transition is expected.\r\n\r\nWe use a dynamical 3+1D linear sigma model with constituent quarks to examine the evolution of equilibrium and non-equilibrium  scenarios. In a first attempt we employ a mean-field ansatz which reproduces the thermodynamical properties of the linear sigma model. To investigate fluctuating observables like the quark- and baryon-density at and near the phase transition, the model is extended with scattering processes between the quark quasi-particles and the chiral fields. For further improvments, we plan to include an effective Polyakov-loop to model effects of the confienment.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks\r\nand gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are\r\nperformed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion\r\nCollider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries is that elliptic flow v_2\r\nwas comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,\r\nthat a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at\r\ntemperature of a few hundreds MeV was established. Recently, the higher\r\nharmonics v_n (n > 2) are observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of\r\ntheoretical and experimental interests. Initial condition with\r\nfluctuation from initial nucleon distribution in colliding nuclei is\r\nattributed to one of the major origins of the higher harmonics.\r\n\r\nTo understand detailed mechanism of how the higher harmonics develop, we\r\nconstruct an integrated dynamical framework based on relativistic\r\nhydrodynamics [1] and perform massive numerical simulations (10^5\r\nminimum bias events) on an event-by-event basis [2]. In this framework,\r\nthe Monte-Carlo versions of factorized Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (fKLN) model\r\n(MC-KLN) and Glauber model (MC-Glauber) are employed as the\r\ninitialization models. After describing hydrodynamic evolution of the\r\nmatter using fully (3+1) dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, we treat the\r\nsubsequent dynamics of hadron gas using a hadron cascade model, JAM.\r\nUsing the obtained momentum distribution of the final hadrons, we\r\nfinally analyze the harmonics v_n in a way that experimental people\r\nperform the flow analysis such as event plane method, multi-particle\r\ncumulant method. We compare these results with the conventional\r\ntheoretically-obtained harmonics with respect to reaction plane or\r\nparticipant plane to investigate the systematic uncertainty in the\r\nconventional theoretical results. We found that v_n obtained in this way\r\ndepends on the flow analysis model, which means the importance of\r\nconsistent comparison between theoretical results with experimental\r\ndata. We also calculate v_n as a function of centrality using the MC-KLN\r\nand MC-Glauber initialization and found differences of v_2, v_4 and v_5\r\nbetween these two models. This indicates the simultaneous analysis of\r\nseveral harmonics would discriminate between the initialization models.\r\n\r\n[1] T. Hirano and Y.

      "Abstract": "A primary goal of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) is to search for evidence of a transition \r\nbetween a hadron gas and a Quark Gluon Plasma. The dependence of $v_{1}$ and higher flow \r\nharmonics on system size and beam energy may be sensitive to the degrees of\r\nfreedom in the system, as a consequence of early pressure gradients and a potential softening in\r\nthe equation of state. In this talk, we present STAR measurements of $v_{1}$ for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$,\r\nprotons and antiprotons along with $v_{n}$ for charged particles from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV. A striking observation is that\r\nthe $v_1$ slope $F = dv_1 /dy$ for net protons, which is an  estimate of the directed flow contribution from baryon number transported to the midrapidity region, changes sign twice within the BES energy range. In contrast, $F$ for all other particle types is negative at all studied energies. For charged particles, we observe a local minimum in integrated ($0.2 < p_T < 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|\\eta| < 1.0)$ directed flow between 11.5 and 27 GeV for central 0-20\\% collisions.  At a similar centrality, we observe a shallow minimum in the energy dependence of $v_{3}$ for charged hadrons.  We also show the ratio of the two-particle cumulant $v_{n}\\{2\\}$ to participant eccentricity($\\varepsilon_{n, {\\rm part}}$) to quantify how well the system converts initial geometry fluctuations into momentum-space correlations for different collision energies, system sizes and harmonics.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The major challenge in heavy ion physics is to extract the equation of state and the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\\eta/s$ from the data. In the clustering of color sources (CSPM) the charged particle transverse momentum spectrum is used to measure the percolation density parameter $\\xi$, which determines the initial temperature T, energy density $\\epsilon$, and the $\\eta/s$ ratio versus T in Au+Au collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV . \r\nFor 0.9 $T_{c} < T < $1.2  $T_{c}$ ($T_{c}$  = 167.7 MeV), the sound velocity $C_{s}^{2}$ from the mass less non interacting constituent version of CSPM agrees with Lattice QCD (LQCD)$C_{s}^{2}$ values . For T$ >$ 1.2$T_{c}$  there is a significant difference with the LQCD  values\\cite{eos}. \r\n\r\nThe measured CSPM value for $\\eta/s$ = 0.20, at 1.15$T_{c}$  is consistent with a strongly coupled QGP and increases with T. The Trace Anomaly $\\triangle $ is defined as $(\\epsilon-3p)/T^{4}$.\r\nAbove $T_{c}$, the LQCD $\\triangle $ and the reciprocal of $\\eta/s$ fall off with 1/T. At $T_{c}$ , $s/\\eta$ has a magnitude of  $\\sim$5.5 , non interacting - CSPM  has a  $\\triangle\\sim$ 5.5  and LQCD $\\triangle \\sim $5.5.   The change in $\\triangle$ and $s/\\eta$  with 1/T describes the transition from a strongly to weakly coupled QGP. Above $T_{c}$,  $s/\\eta$ and the LQCD $\\triangle$ may have the same underlying structure.  The $C_{s}^{2}$ values for the QGP obtained using the  $s/\\eta \\sim 5.5$  version of CSPM above  $T_{c}$ are in excellent agreement with LQCD \\cite{wupp, hotqcd}.\r\nThe CSPM predictions for Pb-Pb and p-p collisions at LHC energies will be presented.",

These data were already used as a reference to measure the nuclear modification factor (RAA) of  J/Ψ production in Pb-Pb collisions.\r\nOne can search for possible collective effects in pp collisions by studying the multiplicity dependence of various observables commonly studied as probes of the Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy-ion collisions.

However, Dalitz decays and photon conversions lead to a high combinatorial background. Additionally, coincident semi-leptonic decays of charm and anti-charm hadrons produce a continuum signal, which dominates over a thermal dielectron signal.\r\nBoth contributions can be reduced by an improved Inner Tracking System, to be installed during LHC's long shutdown (2018). It will further improve the tracking efficiency at low p_t and provide excellent detection capabilities for electrons from secondary vertices like conversions and heavy-quark decays. The expected impact of a new ITS on the low-mass dielectron measurement in pp and Pb-Pb collisions will be presented.\r\nTo further increase the acceptance for low p_t tracks, a reduction of the magnetic field in the ALICE central barrel from 0.5 T to 0.2 T is considered.

However, since the fraction of thermal photon is small, the measurement of direct photons is notoriously difficult due to the large background from hadronic decay photons. These difficulties can be overcome by measuring virtual photons detected as internal conversion into electron-positron pairs.\r\nALICE uses its excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities at very low momenta to perform this measurement in the Pb-Pb collisions collected in 2011 at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV.\r\nDetails of the measurement and status of the analysis will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "The ALICE experiment is dedicated to the study of the quark gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions at the CERN LHC. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is under consideration by the ALICE Experiment to be part of its programme of detectors upgrade to be installed during the LHC shutdown planned for 2018. The MFT is a silicon pixel detector added in the Muon Spectrometer acceptance ($2.5 < \\eta < 4$) upstream of the hadron absorber. The MFT will allow a dramatic improvement of the measurements that are presently done with the Muon Spectrometer and, in addition, will give access to new measurements that are not possible with the present Muon Spectrometer set-up. The enhanced pointing accuracy gained by the muon tracks will significantly improve the mass resolution for the low mass resonances $\\omega$ and $\\phi$, as well as $-$ to a lesser extent $-$ for the $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. The measurement of these resonances down to low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ in heavy-ion collisions represents a unique feature at the LHC. The precise measurement of the offset for the muon tracks will also permit a model-independent identification of open charm ($c\\tau \\sim 150~\\mu$m) and beauty ($c\\tau \\sim 500~\\mu$m) production, including displaced vertices related to $J/\\psi$ production from $b$. In addition, the MFT will help to reject a large fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over background ratio for all the observables. In order to establish the physics performances achievable at the luminosities expected after 2018, realistic simulations of the MFT setup are being performed within the AliRoot framework. Detailed results will be shown on the physics performances, including background treatment and rejection, for the measurement of low mass neutral mesons and the $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ resonances down to low $p_\\mathrm{T}$, in central Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.5$~TeV. An overview of the main technological issues related to the MFT project will also be given.",

Two different background modelings - a detailed Monte Carlo and a flexible toy model, and two subtraction methods - an area-based one similar to that used by ALICE and ATLAS, and a pedestal subtraction technique using the information in calorimetric cells resembling the one employed by CMS, are examined. We also consider the effect of quenching using the Q-PYTHIA Monte Carlo, and some additional background characteristics like elliptic flow.

      "Abstract": "We study Lambda-Lambda correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions based on the Lambda-Lambda interactions proposed so far. Lambda-Lambda interaction and the existence of H-dibaryon are long-standing problems in hadron physics. Since high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC can be utilized as the exotic hadron factories [1], they would also provide information on exotic interactions such as Lambda-Lambda, Lambda-Sigma, Lambda-Xi interactions, which are important to understand neutron star matter EOS. We have analyzed recent STAR data [2] and find that small negative scattering length (1/a_0 < -1 fm^{-1}) and large effective range (r_{eff} > 3 fm) are favored for Lambda-Lambda interaction [3]. This is consistent with quark model interaction (fss2), recent boson exchange potential (NSC97), and old boson exchange potentials (ND, NF) with large hard-core radius. In the presentation, we first discuss how precisely we can constrain Lambda-Lambda interaction from heavy-ion data. We also discuss the effects of feed from heavier hyperons and coupling effects with Xi-N channel, and Lambda-Lambda correlation measured in (K-,K+) reactions [4].\r\n\r\n[1] S.

      "Abstract": "The measurement of heavy-flavour (charm and beauty) production in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions provides an important test of the parton energy loss mechanism and its predicted color charge and parton mass dependencies. The suppression of electron yields from semi-leptonic decays of D and B mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC has been observed to be large. Because of the dead-cone effect, heavy quarks are expected to loose less energy than light quarks if the dominant energy loss mechanism is gluon radiation.  The suppression expected on the basis of energy loss depends on the relative contribution of D and B hadrons to the total yield. Therefore, it is important to separate these contributions.\r\nThe relative contribution of beauty decays to the total electron yield from heavy flavour decays can be isolated by looking at azimuthal correlation between these electrons and charged hadrons, exploiting the different decay kinematics of D and B hadrons.\r\nIn this talk, we present results on the relative beauty contribution to the heavy flavour decay electron yield and the beauty production cross section in the pt range 2.5-10 GeV/c in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV recorded in 2011 with the ALICE experiment. The results are compared to predictions from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.

      "Abstract": "In high-energy nuclear collisions, we study the properties of the excited nuclear matter with QCD degrees of freedom and search for the signals of the QCD phase transition. The ratios of the cumulants of conserved number distributions are sensitive to the correlation length of the system created in heavy-ion collisions, hence they are considered as good observables to study phase transitions. QCD based calculations suggests that the ratios of the sixth to second ($C_{6}/C_{2}$) order cumulants of the net baryon number distributions will change rapidly in the phase transition region of the QCD phase diagram. They are found to deviate considerably from predictions of the hadron resonance gas model which reproduce the fourth to second ($C_{4}/C_{2}$) order cumulants of the net proton number distributions at RHIC top energies.\r\n \r\nThe STAR experiment, with large and uniform acceptance and excellence in particle identification, is ideal to study the QCD phase structure. The data collected in 2010 and 2011 allow us to study the $C_{6}/C_{2}$ ratio. In this talk, we will present the ratio of the sixth to second order cumulants of net-proton multiplicity distributions from minimum biased Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. Both protons and anti-protons are cleanly identified within $|y|<0.5$ and 0.4$< p_{T} <$0.8 GeV/c by the STAR Time Projection Chamber. For beam energies above 39 GeV, the ratios are consistently close to but below unity, while they have larger values below 39 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The hyperon-nucleon(Y-N) interaction is of great physical interest because it introduces a new quantum number strangeness in nuclear matter. It is predicted to be the decisive interaction in some high-density matter systems, such as neutron stars [1]. RHIC, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, provides an ideal laboratory to study Y-N interaction because hyperons and nucleons are abundantly produced at high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime and decay modes of the hypertriton, the lightest hypernucleus, which consists of a proton, a neutron and the lightest hyperon Lambda, and the antimatter hypertriton discovered at RHIC[2], provide valuable insights into the Y-N interaction.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness population factor S3, defined as $\\frac{{^3_\\Lambda}H/^{3}He}{\\Lambda/p}$, is a good representation of the local correlation between baryon number and strangeness[2]. It is predicted that S3 has a different behavior in QGP and pure hadron gas[3,4] thus can be used as a tool to distinguish Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) from a pure hadronic phase.\r\n\r\nThe RHIC beam energy scan program in 2010-2011 allowed STAR to collecte data from Au+Au collisions over a broad range of energies. This provides an opportunity to study the beam energy dependence of S3. In addition, due to the beam energy independence of our lifetime measurement method, with increased statistics of present datasets, an improved result of lifetime measurement of hypertriton can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the hypertriton analysis results for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 200 GeV will be presented.

The combined $^{3}_{\\Lambda}H$ plus $^{3}_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}\\bar{H}$ raw yield is about 600 and its significance can reach 9.5$\\sigma$.

Using the factorization, we derive formulas to determine nucleon number cumulants, which are not direct experimental observables, from proton number fluctuations which are experimentally observable in event-by-event analyses.\r\nWith a simple treatment for strange baryons, the nucleon number\r\ncumulants are further promoted to the baryon number ones. \r\nExperimental determination of the baryon number cumulants makes\r\nit possible to compare various theoretical stduies on them directly with experiments.

The hydrodynamic bulk evolution is quantitatively constrained by bulk and multi-strange hadron spectra and elliptic flow [2]. In the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase, heavy-quark diffusion coefficients are taken from a non-perturbative $T$-matrix approach. The latter leads to resonance formation close to Tc which is implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface. In the hadronic phase, the diffusion of HF mesons is obtained from effective hadronic theory [3]. We compute observables at RHIC and LHC for both HF mesons and non-photonic electrons. In particular, we suggest the R_AA and v_2 of the D_s mesons as a unique observable due to the coupling of charm to the strangeness enhancement in AA collisions [4], which allows to quantitatively test key components of our approach, including recombination and hadronic diffusion effects.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] M.

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies ofer an unique opportunity to probe highly excited dense nuclear matter with properties very diferent from that of a hadron gas or ordinary nuclear matter in the laboratory. An interesting phenomenon at the kinetic freeze-out stage of the system evolution is the collective transverse expansion as it is entirely generated during the collision and therefore reflect the collision dynamics. Experimental data collected at RHIC have shown that the system produced in Au-Au collisions is thermalized and undergoes a strong collective expansion, that could be characterized by the Hubble law. The measurable observables that can provide information about thermalization and collective flow are the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles. The expansion rate at “thermal freeze-out” provides the nuclear collision analogue of the Hubble constant for the Big Bang, while the corresponding freeze-out temperature parallels the temperature of the cosmic microwave background at the point of photon decoupling. \r\n\r\nIn this work we will make an estimate of a Hubble parameter for relativistic nuclear collisions similar to cosmological Hubble constant, based on temporal connections between the evolution of nuclear matter produced in a relativistic heavy ion collision and the Universe evolution after the Big Bang. We will present  experimental data obtained in Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies and will compare with the same parameters obtained from simulated data at future CBM-FAIR energies.  \r\n\r\nWe will investigate the freeze-out process in heavy ion collisions at CBM-FAIR energies and we will present a study of blast-wave fits performed to the transverse momentum spectra obtained from simulated heavy ion collisions using the most important simulation codes from this field. In addition, comparisons with results from Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies will be presented to provide more detailed insight into the properties of the space-time evolution such as collective dynamics of the dense matter. We will compare the freeze-out kinetic parameters obtained from experimental data at RHIC energies with the same parameters obtained from simulated data at future CBM-FAIR energies using the most important simulation codes from this field.",

In particular, we calculate the minijet transverse energy production by using the latest knowledge of nuclear parton distributions (nPDFs), the NLO sets EPS09 [4], and discuss how\r\nthe nPDF uncertainties propagate into the computed hydrodynamical initial conditions as well as observable multiplicities. Regarding the NLO minijet production, we develop a new set of infra-red safe measurement functions and study their effect on the multiplicity systematics from RHIC to LHC.

      "Abstract": "Interest in the development of the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics is growing [1]. Early efforts suggested that viscous diffusion broadens the rapidity dependence of transverse momentum correlations [2]. That work stimulated an experimental analysis by STAR [3]. We attack this new data along two fronts. First, we compute STAR’s fluctuation observable using the NeXSPheRIO code, which combines fluctuating initial conditions from a string fragmentation model with deterministic viscosity-free hydrodynamic evolution [4]. We find that NeXSPheRIO produces a longitudinal narrowing, in contrast to the data. Second, we study the hydrodynamic evolution using second order causal viscous hydrodynamics including Langevin noise. We obtain a deterministic evolution equation for the transverse momentum density correlation function.  We use the latest theoretical equations of state and transport coefficients to compute STAR’s observable. The results are in excellent accord with the measured broadening. In addition, we predict features of the distribution that can distinguish 2nd and 1st order diffusion. \r\n \r\nJ. Kapusta, B. Mueller, M. Stephanov, arXiv:1112.6405 [nucl-th].\r\n\r\nS. Gavin and M.

The dijet momentum balance and angular correlations are studied in detail as a function of collision centrality and leading jet transverse momentum. For the most peripheral PbPb collisions, the dijet momentum balance distributions are in good agreement with pp data and with reference calculations at the same collision energy. More central collisions show a strong imbalance between the leading and subleading jet transverse momenta, which is found to persist to the largest values of leading jet transverse momenta studied.\r\n\r\nThe flavor dependence of jet quenching is a powerful handle to discriminate models of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate the capacity of CMS to identify jets initiated by bottom quarks using displaced vertices reconstructed in the silicon tracking system.

These correlations are formed from all charged particles with $p_t \\geq 0.15$ GeV/c, $|\\eta| \\leq 1$, and $2\\pi$ azimuth.  The broad peak is observed in both like- and unlike-sign charge combinations and same- and away-side relative azimuth angles. Variation of peak positions and widths will be reported as a function of centrality.  Interestingly, the peak in the data for away-side or “back-to-back” pairs persists even in more-central collisions, remaining at approximately the same transverse momentum for like- and unlike-sign pairs at all centralities. The event generator HIJING,\r\noften used to model peripheral heavy ion interactions, predicts a\r\nsimilar peak in this momentum range but only when jets are included.\r\nThe peak position for same-side unlike-sign pairs remains at the same approximate momentum for peripheral to mid-central collisions.\r\nHowever, for more-central collisions the same-side peak separates into two peaks.  The centrality dependence of these data will be compared with that of $p_t$-integral 2D angular correlations [3].  The transverse momentum dependence of the same-side angular correlation structures will also be presented. Possible mechanisms for the observed structures will be discussed and predictions from several models will be presented to test agreement with data.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, J.

Following on this discovery,the PHENIX collaboration has embarked on a  number of upgrades to study the QGP properties in detail,  with the next step being a significant overhaul of the PHENIX detector called sPHENIX. sPHENIX includes upgrading the central detector with a compact solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry to study jets produced in p+p, p+A, and A+A collisions at RHIC. The location of the calorimetry in vicinity of the solenoid requires an optical readout that is compact and immune to magnetic fields. For this reason, the sPHENIX calorimetry will use a Silicon Photomultiplier(SiPM) based readout system for both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. In this presentation, we present the current design status and performance of the prototype analog readout for the sPHENIX calorimetry based on SiPMs.",

This, in addition to the statistical analysis of neutron-star radii by Steiner, Lattimer, and Brown lead to tight constraints for the equation of state of dense baryonic matter inside the neutron star. We combine a realistic phenomenological equation of state at low densities with equations of state around nuclear densities derived both from chiral effective field theories, on one hand, and from the Polyakov-loop-extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, on the other. Our analysis based on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation strongly supports an equation of state of ordinary nuclear matter. This means, that there is no need to include exotic matter in order to stabilize a two-solar mass neutron star. Furthermore, with these constraints we draw conclusions for the QCD phase diagram.",

The number of correlated like-sign dimuons due to neutral B meson oscillation is directly related to the total number of open bottom meson pairs and thus can provide a way of constraining the open bottom contribution to the dimuon continuum in the high mass region. \r\n\r\nTo establish this new analysis method, correlated like-sign dimuons from pairs of B mesons of $\\sim$6.3 pb$^{-1}$ data from p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV within the PHENIX muon arms acceptance (1.2 < |y| < 2.2) were studied.

These have been greatly informative, of course; but they've provided a window only onto a central \"slice\" of the created medium, leaving the full 3-D picture of the collision as a relatively unexplored frontier.  How the initially locally thermalized hydro state comes into being across three dimensions involves fundamentally new QCD physics, which we can hope to diagnose via measurements spanning wide ranges of rapidity and correlations across them.  \r\n\r\nHere we present and discuss the so-called \"Club Sandwich picture\", an inclusive framework for describing and parameterizing 3-D initial energy density profiles, not based on any particular stopping mechanism but only on the general considerations of energy and momentum conservation and causality.  It is proposed, that frameworks of this type can serve as a useful bridge between final-state observations of energy/momentum flow and new physics models for the initial medium creation mechanisms.",

      "Abstract": "In hydrodynamical modeling of the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the freeze-out is typically performed at a constant temperature. In this work we introduce a dynamical freeze-out criterion, which compares the hydrodynamical expansion rate with the pion scattering rate [1]. Previous studies [2] have shown that differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria are small in the transverse momentum spectra, but the effect on flow anisotropies has not yet been studied. Recently many calculations have been done using event-by-event hydrodynamics, in which case the expansion rate does not necessarily behave as nicely as in the case of smooth initial conditions. Thus it is interesting to check how the dynamical freeze-out changes hadron distributions with respect to the constant temperature freeze-out.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution we present hadron spectra and elliptic and triangular flow calculated using (2+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, and show the differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria. First we discuss the systematics of the dynamical freeze-out, and for simplicity these calculations have been performed using smooth initial states. Finally dynamical\r\nfreeze-out condition is applied to event-by-event calculations to evaluate $v_2$ and $v_3$. We find that the differences caused by different freeze-out criteria are small in all studied cases.\r\n\r\n[1] C. M. Hung and E. V. Shuryak, Phys. Rev. C 57, 1891 (1998).\r\n[2] K. J. Eskola, H.

The latter, able to describe lattice QCD thermodynamics, implies a \"chemical\" equilibrium ratio between quarks and gluons strongly increasing as T -> Tc, the phase transition temperature. Accordingly we see in realistic simulations of uRHIC's a rapid evolution from a gluon dominated initial state to a quark dominated plasma close to Tc. The quark to gluon ratio can be modified by about a factor of 20 in the bulk of the system and appears to be large also in the high pT region.\r\nWe discuss how this aspect, often overflown, can be essential for a quantitative study of several key issues in the QGP physics: shear viscosity, jet quenching, quarkonia suppression. Furthermore a bulk plasma made by more than 80% of quarks plus antiquarks provides a theoretical basis for hadronization via quark coalescence. \r\nRef. [arXiv:1202.2262]",

The goal is to investigate the QCD phase diagram in particular in the region of high net baryonic density, using heavy ion collisions in a fixed target experiment at beam energies ranging from 8 to 45 GeV/nucleon. The high beam intensity and -quality of the SIS300 accelerator (SIS100 in the first step), together with a detector concept optimized for high event rate capability, allow to achieve exceptional high luminosities (reaction rates up to 10 MHz) and to study in particular rare probes.\r\nOf particular interest are dilepton probes originating from decays of charmonium and light vector mesons, such as rho/omega -> e+ e-/ mu+ mu-. These dilepton probes do not interact hadronically with the dense medium and as such allow to probe the early, high density phase of the fireball evolution.\r\nIn the CBM detector setup, a Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH) will be used to provide clean separation of electrons from pions, and together with additional layers of Transition Radiation Detectors (TRD) to achieve pion suppression factors up to 4 orders of magnitude. The RICH detector will consist of a CO2 gas radiator volume, a spherical focusing mirror, and multi-anode PMTs (ca 55k individual channels) for detection of Cherenkov photons. A major step in the detector development was the test of a quasi full-scale prototype of the RICH detector at CERN in autumn 2011. Valuable information on the ring image resolution, the photon statistics, the MAPMT readout, and the overall operation was obtained.\r\nWe report on the design and status of the RICH detector development, and in particular on the beam time results obtained with the RICH prototype.",

      "Abstract": "Strong jet quenching and high-pT hadron suppression as observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are striking experimental signatures for the formation of a deconfined QCD plasma, in which partons suffer from medium-induced energy loss. In particular, heavy quarks represent key probes for revealing the properties of the produced matter.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we discuss the consequences of a realistic medium description with fluctuating initial conditions on heavy-quark observables. For this purpose, we combine our Monte-Carlo approach to heavy-quark in-medium propagation MC@sHQ [1] with the full 3+1 dimensional fluid dynamic expansion from EPOS [2]. This allows for a consistent treatment of both the heavy-quark production and the collisional and radiative processes leading to the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks. On an event-by-event basis, we report on RAA and v2 of D and B mesons for RHIC and LHC energies and confront our results with recent experimental observations. While with a simplified medium description [3] we find a too strong quenching for LHC conditions, the discrepancy can be resolved with a medium with initial fluctuations. Moreover, in EPOS a lattice QCD equation of state is used. This allows us to study the nature of the effective degrees of freedom present in the vicinity of the crossover transition, cf. [4], because a proportion of hadronic degrees of freedom above Tc would reduce the energy loss of heavy quarks.\r\n\r\n[1] P. B. Gossiaux and J. Aichelin, Phys. Rev. C 78 (2008) 014904\r\n[2] K.

      "Abstract": "An enhancement of low-mass di-electron production which is compared to expected yields from known hadron sources was observed by the CERES experiment at CERN SPS in 158 A GeV central Pb+Au collisions\r\n(sqrt(s)=17.3GeV). More recently, NA60 reported their di-muon\r\nmeasurements in 158 A GeV In+In collisions. The enhancement of di-muon at $M_{\\mu\\mu} < 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$ can be described by a broadened spectral function. At RHIC, PHENIX experiment observed a significant enhancement in the di-electron continuum in Au+Au collisions at $0.15 < M_{ee} < 0.75$ GeV/$c^2$ at low transverse momentum ($p_{T}$ < 1 GeV/c).  The models, which describe the SPS di-lepton data, have not been able to consistently describe the PHENIX data in the low mass and low $p_{T}$ region. STAR has recently presented preliminary results on the di-electron production in Au+Au at 200 GeV[1] Which was made possible by the addition of full-coverage time-of-flight detector. The Beam Energy\r\nScan program covering beam energies down to SPS energies, and STAR's large acceptance, allow for measurements that can provide invaluable insights in this subject. We will present the mid-rapidity di-electron measurements in the $M<1.2$ GeV/$c^{2}$ mass region in Au+Au collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 GeV taken in 2011 with the full Time-of-Flight detector coverage at STAR. The di-electron production will be compared to hadronic cocktail simulation. Comparisons to model calculations with in-medium vector meson modifications will be made.\r\n\r\n[1] Jie Zhao (for the STAR collaboration) 2011. J. Phys. G: Nucl. Part.\r\nPhys. 38 124134",

      "Abstract": "Di-leptons serve as clean and bulk penetrating probes to study\r\nthe properties of the strongly interacting hot and dense medium\r\ncreated in heavy ion collisions. They are produced in all stages\r\nof the heavy-ion collisions and are not affected by strong\r\ninteractions, hence can probe the entire evolution of the\r\ncollision. Di-lepton production in the low mass range\r\n($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^{2}$) allows the study of vector meson\r\nin-medium properties, an observable possibly connected to chiral\r\nsymmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region\r\n($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$), di-lepton measurements serve as\r\na tool to extract the medium thermal radiation, which provides\r\ndirect information on the temperature of the early system.\r\nQuantitative studies on these properties require systematic\r\nmeasurements of di-lepton production yields as well as elliptic\r\nflow as a function of invariant mass and transverse momentum\r\n($p_T$). An extension of these studies to energy and centrality\r\ndependent measurements offer crucial information on how the\r\nsystem properties evolve with collision energies and system\r\nsizes. The STAR experiment, with its large and full azimuthal\r\nacceptance, clean electron identification over a wide momentum\r\nrange and low material environment, is very well suited to carry\r\nout systematic studies on di-lepton production. In the years\r\n2010 and 2011, more than one billion events were taken in 200\r\nGeV Au+Au collisions and several hundred million events were\r\nrecorded at lower energies by the STAR experiment. In this\r\npresentation, results from di-electron mass spectra as a\r\nfunction of $p_T$ and centrality as well as the dependence of\r\nelliptic flow on invariant mass in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will\r\nbe presented. The results on mass, width, dN/dy, $p_{T}$ spectra\r\nof $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ mesons will be reported. The first STAR\r\nresults of di-electron mass spectra and $p_T$ distributions at\r\nmidrapidity for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 39\r\nand 62.4 GeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Recent results from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC have shown evidence of dramatic medium modification of di-jets. Although asymmetric di-jets are also seen in p+p collisions, di-jets with a large energy asymmetry are found much more often in Pb+Pb collisions. E.g., events with a 200 GeV leading jet and a 80 GeV subleading jet were frequently observed. The increase in the average energy asymmetry is believed to be caused by in-medium energy loss that arises from the  interaction of the colored jet constituents with the hot deconfined matter formed is the collision. The modified di-jets provide a means to study the nature of the high energy interactions of this deconfined matter. \r\n\r\nThe observed di-jet suppression has been quantified in terms of the asymmetry A_j, the ratio of the difference between the two jet energies to their sum. It is not a priori clear that this is the observable best suited to extract information about the modification of the di-jets and the nature of their interactions with the deconfined medium. Understanding the sensitivity of di-jet observables to properties of the deconfined medium and to experimental factors is vital if they are to become a useful tool for jet tomography of hot QCD matter.\r\n\r\nWe have examined the response of the di-jet asymmetry and other di-jet observables to variations in the jet modification mechanism and to variations of the observables. We present a systematic study of di-jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC using the VNI/BMS parton cascade.  VNI/BMS is a jet+medium Monte-Carlo code which provides a controllable testbed with sufficient complexity to model jet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from hydrodynamics and hadronization.   \r\n\r\nWe consider the medium modification of the di-jet asymmetry A_j and the energy distribution within the di-jets (jet shape).  Di-jets are examined under the modification of: the jet transport coefficient qhat; the path length of leading and sub-leading jets; cuts on the jet energy distributions; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism and the strong coupling constant.  We find that, while the jet asymmetry and jet shape are similarly sensitive to the in-medium path length, the jet-shape is more sensitive to the nature of the interaction with the medium and the value of q-hat than the jet asymmetry.",

      "Abstract": "I will review recent and ongoing work on thermal meson properties relevant for the hadron gas regime in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. These include transport coefficients, chemical nonequilibrium, susceptibilities, isospin breaking and different aspects on chiral symmetry restoration and the QCD transition. The basic framework is the use of Chiral Effective Lagrangians  which ensure the model independency of the low-energy and low-temperature regimes and allows to include interactions consistently. This is combined with unitarity when an accurate analytical description of particle scattering is needed, as in the case  of resonance studies, virial analysis and   transport coefficients,  for temperatures and energies where deviations from  Chiral Perturbation Theory are significant. Our scheme provides an adequate phenomenological description  for several quantities.  The shear viscosity is compatible with the KSS bound and recent data on elliptic flow, bulk viscosity correlation with the trace anomaly is established without appealing to the spectral function profile and the electrical conductivity is consistent with the low-energy photon spectrum. At the same time, this framework helps to understand theoretical aspects such as the role of scalar resonances and   degeneration of partners in chiral restoration or the effects of meson interactions in a possible window between chemical and thermal freeze-out. We will pay also  attention to the connection with lattice results, particularly in the analysis of connected and disconnected scalar susceptibilities, whose quark mass and temperature behaviour we can establish rigorously from our isospin-breaking analysis, providing then a useful benchmark for the continuum limit.\r\n   \r\n   Some related references:\r\n\r\n- D.Fernandez-Fraile and A.Gomez Nicola, ``The Electrical conductivity of a pion gas'', Phys.Rev.

Heavy quarks, in particular, interact with the rest of the medium via binary and radiative scatterings with a running coupling and a more precise Debye screening which is derived from hard thermal loop calculations. We compare our results of the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor not only to experimental data of heavy flavor electrons at RHIC, but also to LHC data of heavy flavor electrons, muons, D mesons, and non-prompt J/psi. The latter two are in particular sensitive on the mass difference of charm and bottom quarks. Where no data is available yet, we make predictions for those observables. Furthermore, results on J/psi suppression are reported for central and non-central collisions, taking cold nuclear matter effects and the dissociation as well as regeneration of J/psi in the quark-gluon plasma into account.",

      "Institute": "Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Hot and dense QCD matter, namely the quark gluon plasma, is created in high energy heavy ion collisions. High energy partons are also created through initial hard scatterings and have to traverse the QGP medium. These energetic partons are subject to lose their energy due to strong interactions with the medium. So jets in heavy ion collisions are expected to give information about the stopping power of the QGP.\r\nWhile jets traverse the QGP medium, they could induce collective flow in the fluid by depositing energy and momentum. Thus the space-time evolution of the QGP fluid would be affected when jets pass through the medium. In fact, the CMS Collaboration observed a lot of low momentum hadrons at large angles from a quenched jet [1]. These low momentum hadrons are intimately related with jet energy loss since the total momentum of these hadrons together with the quenched jet balances the momentum of the other jet propagating in the opposite direction. The CMS result can be interpreted as manifestation of a wake of the QGP fluid by jet energy loss.\r\nIn this study, we construct a model to describe the dynamics of QGP fluid and jets simulta- neously. We model a source term in the relativistic hydrodynamic equations which originates from the energy and momentum deposited from traversing jets. Without linearization we solve these non-linear hydrodynamic equations numerically in fully three dimensional space and describe the dynamics of the background QGP medium.\r\nA Mach cone like structure and a vortex ring appear behind the jet traversing a uniform medium. When a pair of jets go through a fluid expanding three dimensionally, the Mach cone like structure is distorted by radial flow. As a result, low momentum particles from the medium are preferentially emitted at large angles from the jet axis. The result exhibits the same trend as the one observed by the CMS Collaboration.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]S. Chatrchyan et al. [CMS Collaboration], Phys. Rev. C 84, 024906 (2011); C. Roland, J. Phys.

We extend this algorithm to include medium-induced gluon radiation in hot and dense nuclear matter. Within this new and improved approach, we perform a detailed analysis of various ingredients affecting the final heavy flavor spectra and elliptic flow, such as the coupling strength between heavy quarks and the medium, the medium's geometric anisotropy and its flow profile, and the relative contributions from charm and bottom quarks. We demonstrate the consistency between these properties and our previous study of the thermalization behavior of heavy quarks inside the QGP.

      "Abstract": "Most of the the calculations on gluon emission off a heavy quark, within perturbative QCD, have been performed in the literature using light cone gauge with eikonal approximations. Recently we revisited the issue in Feynman gauge that resulted in a very compact and elegant expression for the suppression  factor for gluon emission off a heavy quark [1]. This generalization is valid for the full range of rapidity of the radiated gluons and also has no restriction on the scaled mass of the quark with its energy. In the appropriate limit it correctly reproduces the usual dead cone factor in the forward rapidity region [2]. On the other hand, this suppression factor becomes close to unity in the backward direction.  We then obtain the radiative energy loss of a heavy quark in a deconfined medium due to radiation of gluons off them using this derived gluon emission spectrum. We find that the heavy flavor loses energy almost in a similar fashion like light quarks through this process. This indicates a small suppression of gluon emission in the backward region, which should have an impact on the phenomenology of heavy quark energy loss in the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An analysis of the nuclear modification factor for $D$-meson at LHC is found to be in very good agreement with the most recent data from ALICE collaboration at 2.76 ATeV Pb-Pb collisions [3]. \r\n\r\n1.

      "Abstract": "We outline the physics opportunities~\\cite{Brodsky:2012vg} which are offered by a next generation and multi-purpose fixed-target experiment exploiting the LHC beams extracted by a bent crystal. This mature extraction technique offers an ideal way to obtain a clean and very collimated high-energy beam, without altering the performance of the LHC~\\cite{Uggerhoj:2005xz,Scandale:2011zz,LUA9}. The multi-TeV LHC beams grant the most energetic fixed-target experiment ever performed, to study \\pp, \\pd\\ and \\pA\\ collisions at \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\simeq 115\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$} and \\PbA\\ collisions at \\mbox{$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\simeq 72\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$}. AFTER -- for A Fixed-Target ExperRiment -- gives access to new domains of particle and nuclear physics complementing that of collider experiments, in particular RHIC and the projects of electron-ion colliders. The typical instantaneous luminosity achievable with AFTER in \\pp\\ and \\pA\\ mode~\\cite{Brodsky:2012vg} surpasses that of RHIC by more than 3~orders of magnitude  and is comparable to that of the LHC collider mode. This provides a quarkonium and heavy-flavour observatory in \\pp\\ and \\pA\\ collisions where, by instrumenting the target-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark distributions of the proton, the neutron and the nuclei can be accessed at large $x$ and even at $x$ larger than unity in the nuclear case.\r\nThe nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique opportunity to study cold nuclear matter versus the features of the hot and dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, including the formation of the quark-gluon plasma. During the one-month lead runs, \\PbA\\ collisions can be studied at a luminosity comparable to that of RHIC and the LHC over the full range of target-rapidity domain. Modern detection technology should allow for the study of quarkonium excited states, in particular the $\\chi_c$ and $\\chi_b$ resonances, even in the challenging high-multiplicity environment of \\pA\\ and \\PbA\\ collisions, magnified by the boost of the fixed-target mode.\r\nPrecise data from \\pp, \\pA\\ and \\PbA\\ should help to greatly improve our understanding of heavy-quark and quarkonium production, to clear the way to use them for gluon and heavy-quark PDF extraction in free and bound nucleons, to unravel cold from hot nuclear effects and to restore the status of heavy quarkonia as a golden test of lattice QCD in terms of dissociation temperature predictions at a \\sqrtsNN\\ where the recombination process is expected to have a small impact. The fixed-target mode also has the advantage to allow for spin measurements with polarized targets. We will discuss a tentative design for AFTER, and report the projected detector performances from the first preliminary simulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{4}\r\n\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{Brodsky:2012vg}\r\n  S.~J.~Brodsky, F.~Fleuret, C.~Hadjidakis and J.~P.~Lansberg,\r\n  arXiv:1202.6585 [hep-ph].\r\n  %%CITATION = ARXIV:1202.6585;%%\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{Uggerhoj:2005xz}\r\n  E.~Uggerh\\o j, U.~I.~Uggerh\\o j,\r\n  Nucl.\\ Instrum.\\ Meth.\\  B {\\bf 234} (2005) 31.\r\n  %%CITATION = NUIMA,B234,31;%\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{Scandale:2011zz}\r\n  W.~Scandale, {\\it et al.}, \r\n  Phys.\\ Lett.\\  {\\bf B703 } (2011)  547-551.\r\n  \r\n\\bibitem{LUA9} W.~Scandale, {\\it et al.} [LUA9], CERN-LHCC-2011-007, 2011.",

      "Abstract": "The main difficulty in precise and systematically controlled jet measurements in heavy-ion collisions is the correction for the soft underlying background fluctuation as well as for additional hard scatterings occurring in the nucleus-nucleus collision. To minimize non-trivial biases in jet-quenching measurements by imposing kinematical constraints on the jet fragmentation and to suppress background fluctuations requires a precise description of background fluctuations down to very low momentum. In order to avoid ambiguities in the background fluctuation estimate, caused by additional hard scatterings, especially in the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at lower jet energies, we propose a statistical correction scheme: The Independent Particle Emission Model. In this approach we characterize the soft underlying heavy-ion background fluctuations in a typical jet area via a statistical convolution of multiplicity and (mean) transverse momentum pT fluctuations. In addition higher order flow harmonics (vn) will be taken properly into account. We will present simulation studies in order to estimate the precision of the Independent Particle Emission Model. Furthermore we will discuss conceptually how this approach can be applied in data analysis and how one can assess the validity of the assumed functional form in a data driven way.",

      "Abstract": "In the years 2010/11, the Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR) conducted a Beam Energy Scan (BES) over a wide range of center-of-mass energies with the purpose of studying the properties of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) as well as searching for the onset of deconfinement and the critical point of the QCD phase diagram. The installation of the Barrel Time-Of-Flight-Detector (TOF) has enabled STAR to identify electrons over a wide momentum range. Combined with its large acceptance, excellent PID, and a low material budget in the runs of 2010/11, STAR now provides unique capabilities for the study of dielectron production in heavy ion collisions.\r\nDue to their negligible strong interaction with the dense medium created at RHIC, leptons can escape the interaction region undistorted and thus, carry direct information about the space-time evolution of the fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In the special case of dileptons, their invariant mass ($m_{ee}$) serves as an additional observable: For the BES energies, later dielectron creation times are accessible in the Low-Mass-Region (LMR, $m_{ee}<1.1 GeV/c^2$) where the in-medium vector meson properties and its implications on the dielectron yield can be measured. Earlier creation times, on the other hand, can be studied in the Intermediate-Mass-Region (IMR, $1.1<m_{ee}<3 GeV/c^2$) in which the continuum yield allows a direct measure of the effective QGP temperature. In this regard, the dependence of these observables on the collision energy is of special interest. These aspects, in particular, make dielectrons favorable as a clean penetration probe for the bulk.\r\nThe poster will present dielectron invariant mass spectra from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 39 \\& 62.4 GeV and its comparisons to cocktail simulations of known hadron sources. In addition, the energy dependencies of low mass dielectron production, as well as the slope parameters of $p_T$ distributions from IMR dielectrons will be discussed.",

A smooth evolution of data is observed and our results reproduce the initial triggered analysis structure near <p_{T}> = 2.7 GeV/c.

The model function emphasizes possible initial state fluctuation contribution via the use of higher harmonic model components; v_{n} (n=1,2,3,4) and the remainder is modeled via an asymmetric 2d Gaussian.

The increase of correlation radii for increasing multiplicity was observed both in Pb-Pb and pp collisions. The decrease of kaon radii for increasing transverse momentum was observed in Pb-Pb collisions. Similar behaviour of the radii was observed at high multiplicities in pp collisions.

      "Abstract": "Charge fluctuations are considered to provide a possible signature for the existence of the de-confined Quark Gluon Plasma phase (QGP). Charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of hadron gas with unit charged particles. The study of charge fluctuations have been carried out by using the variable, ν(+−,dyn) which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias, i.e., impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of charged particles within the detector acceptance. The dependence of charge fluctuations on the rapidity windows for various centrality bins are analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV in the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC. Furthermore the higher moments of net-charge distribution are examined. It has been demonstrated that higher moments as well as moment products are sensitive to the correlation length and directly connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities computed in the Lattice QCD.\r\n\r\nWe observe that the dynamical fluctuations, measured in terms of ν(+−,dyn), decrease while going from peripheral to central collisions. We examine the dependence of fluctuations, using the D-measure, on the pseudorapidity interval ∆η, which may account for the dilution of fluctuations during the evolution of the system. The higher moments like mean, sigma (σ), skewness (S), kurtosis (K) and the quantities like Sσ and Kσ2 of net-charge are estimated as a function of centrality. The experimental values are compared to the theoretical expectations for a hadron gas and a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The results will be shown and discussed.",

      "Abstract": "High-energy heavy-ion collisions at the LHC allow for the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks, charm and bottom, produced in the initial hard scattering processes of the collision are excellent probes of the QGP.\r\nWhen heavy quarks traverse the QGP they are expected to lose energy and such energy loss is predicted to be smaller than for gluons and light quarks. On the other hand, recent experimental data indicate larger energy loss than expected. Heavy flavour production can be studied using electrons from semi-leptonic decays of D and B mesons. The separation of electrons from these two sources (charm and bottom) is of crucial importance to address the expected mass dependence of energy loss. In this poster, we present the measurement of electrons from bottom in the transverse momentum range of 7-12 GeV in 7 TeV p-p collisions. The ALICE EMCal detector possesses outstanding particle identification for electrons at high pT. Two-track secondary vertices with these electrons and surrounding charged tracks are reconstructed, exploiting the tracking precision provided by the Inner Tracking System, and are used to select displaced decay vertices of B mesons. The cross section for bottom-decay electrons is compared to FONLL pQCD predictions and it serves as a reference for studies of B meson suppression in Pb-Pb collisions.",

A detailed understanding of the pair production mechanisms in proton-proton collisions is interesting both as a QCD test tool as well as a reference for future heavy-ion studies. \r\nThis particular physical process can be investigated using the angular azimuthal correlation between open-charmed mesons and charged hadrons. This correlation exhibits characteristic near-side and away-side structures that are produced by the charged hadrons from the fragmentation and decay of the partner charmed meson. The azimuthal direction is expected to be sensitive to the heavy quark production mechanism and can be compared to the perturbative QCD calculations. \r\nD mesons are reconstructed in several hadronic channels in the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Using $D*^{\\pm}$  mesons is advantageous because they can be selected with higher purity with respect to D0 and $D^{+}$. Correlating with kaons (identified $K^{\\pm}$  or reconstructed $K0_{S}$) that are produced with high probability in charm decays, provides a reduction of the background in the correlation distribution.\r\nIn this contribution results of this correlation analysis, performed using the minimum bias proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV$ collected by the ALICE experiment in 2010, will be presented.",

This\r\nmakes the composite spectra sensitive to the distribution of the\r\nconstituent nucleons in phase space. It also implies a sensitivity of\r\nthe spectra to the local densities and flow velocities of the source.\r\nIn the coalescence picture, specific ratios of these spectra provide\r\ninformation on the baryon densities and homogeneity volumes.

Utilizing a novel and unique high-pT single-track high-level trigger, the analysis explores the full 2011 PbPb data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150/ub collected by CMS. For the first time, a long-range correlation structure up to |delta-eta|~4 at small delta-phi (near side) is observed for such very high-pT (e.g., pT~20 GeV/c) trigger particles correlated with low-pT (a few GeV/c) associated particles. The observed long-range correlations in |delta-eta| on the near side are consistent with the single-particle azimuthal anisotropy (characterized by the Fourier harmonics, vn) of high-pT trigger particles measured relative to the event-plane angle determined with the forward hadronic calorimeters. After subtracting the vn harmonics component, the shape and yield on the near (|delta-phi| < 1) and away (|delta-phi| > 1) side of the residual dihadron correlations have been studied systematically over a wide kinematic range in trigger (12 < pT[trig] < 50 GeV/c) and associated ( 0.5 GeV/c < pT[assoc] < pT[trig]) particle pT, as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality.

      "Abstract": "Recent experimental data measured in \\sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by ATLAS and CMS showed a significant imbalance in the transverse momenta of the two reconstructed jets with the highest transverse momenta. This momentum imbalance is assumed to be caused by the different energy and momentum loss of the di-jets by scatterings within the created medium. To investigate this momentum loss we extended the transport model BAMPS which solves the full 3+1D Boltzmann equation for partons based on pQCD cross sections. One feature of BAMPS is the stochastic modeling of 2 -> 2 as well as 2 <-> 3 scattering processes. We show that the simulations of the momentum imbalance A_J of full reconstructed jets within BAMPS are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Due to the available particle information in configuration as well as momentum space within such a transport model, it is possible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed jets within the medium and gain a deeper understanding of the emerging jet shapes. With this information we explain the momentum imbalance of di-jets by different in-medium path lengths and thus different energy and momentum loss at parton-level.",

      "Abstract": "The higher-order flow anisotropies of charged particles have been systematically studied by the CMS collaboration for PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2010 and 2011. Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution, ranging from the third to the sixth component, are obtained using four different analysis techniques: event plane, two- and four-particle correlations, and Lee-Yang Zeros. The results are reported as a function of the particle transverse momentum (pT) for pT = 0.5 - 20 GeV/c and collision centrality. The long-range azimuthal dihadron correlations are extensively studied with a Fourier-decomposition analysis. Using a data driven method, the extracted Fourier coefficients (up to the fifth order) are found to factorize into a product of single-particle azimuthal anisotropies up to pT~3-3.5 GeV/c for at least one particle from each pair, except for the second-order harmonics in the most central PbPb events. Based on the factorization studies, the implications of flow and non-flow effects in the long-range correlations are discussed. Comparison of higher-order harmonics derived from different techniques provides important insight on the initial-state eccentricity fluctuations and helps further constrain the transport properties of the medium.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of charged hadrons are presented for PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV over an extended transverse momentum range up to approximately 60 GeV/c. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Utilizing a novel and unique high-pT single-track high-level trigger, the analysis explores the full 2011 PbPb data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150/ub. Anisotropy parameters (v2, v3 and v4) are extracted by correlating charged tracks with the event plane angle reconstructed using the energy deposited in the forward calorimeters. By utilizing the broad coverage of the CMS foward calorimetry, contamination from back-to-back dijets is suppressed. The results presented in this talk significantly improve on the statistical precision of previous v2 measurements for pT> 12 GeV/c, and explore for the first time the harmonic components of the azimuthal dependence in the very high pT region beyond 20 GeV/c. Beyond pT>10 GeV/c, the observed v2 values show a moderate decrease with pT, being consistent with zero only above pT~40 GeV/c and for mid-central (30-60%) collisions. A common trend in the centrality dependence of v2 is observed for particles over a wide range of pT up to approximately 48 GeV/c that is independent of pseudorapditiy, suggesting a potential connection to the initial geometry. These new data can impose quantitative constraints on the details of in-medium parton energy loss models, particularly the influence of the path length and the shape of the interaction region.",

The second Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution are obtained using an event-plane technique for pi0s and four different analysis techniques for charged particles: event plane, two- and four-particle cumulants, and Lee-Yang Zeros. These techniques have different sensitivities to non-flow and flow fluctuation effects and their comparison helps disentangle hydrodynamic flow, initial state fluctuations and non-flow correlations. The results are presented as a function of pT, pseudorapidity, and centrality. A comparison of the CMS measurements of v2(pT) from pi0 mesons and inclusive charged particles reveals a systematic difference in the range of pT = 2.5 ~ 5 GeV/c, with the neutral pion anisotropies being weaker than those observed for inclusive charged particles. This difference indicates a particle-species dependence in the azimuthal anisotropy at the LHC. New measurements of correlations associated with mixed harmonics for charged particles are explored and discussed in terms of participant fluctuations. A systematic comparison of the LHC results to lower energy observations will also be presented.",

The fluctuation in net charge depends on the squares of the charges present in the system, which depends on the state from which it originates. The system passing through a QGP phase which has quarks as charge carriers, should result in a significantly different net charge fluctuation as compared to Hadron Gas (HG).  The variance of the ratio of positive and negative charges scaled by the total charge particle multiplicity (a quantity called D) is approximately 4 times smaller for QGP as compared to HG [1].\r\nWe will present preliminary results on net charge fluctuations for Au+Au\r\ncollisions at \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39 GeV and will also present their\r\ndependence on energy and collision centrality by comparing to the\r\npublished results [2].",

      "Abstract": "The exploration of the QCD phase diagram in the region of a possible phase transition between the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the hadron gas phase is one of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan(BES). One of the most important observables from high-energy nuclear collisions to study the early evolution of the expanding system is the elliptic flow $v_{2}$. At the top RHIC energy, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is interpreted as a signature of deconfinement and the formation of the QGP phase. A disappearance of the NCQ scaling is expected for a pure hadronic system at low beam energies. Hence it is a necessary signature to identify the phase transition.\r\n\r\nWe present the $v_2$ measurement at midrapidity from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 62.4 GeV for inclusive charged hadrons, light nuclei ($d$, $\\bar{d}$) and identified hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_{S}^{0}$, $p$, $\\bar{p}$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi^{-}$, $\\bar{\\Xi}^{+}$, $\\Omega^{-}$, $\\bar{\\Omega}^{+}$) up to 4 GeV/$c$ in $p_{T}$. The beam energy and centrality dependence of charged hadron $v_2$ are presented with comparison to higher energies at RHIC and LHC. The identified hadron $v_{2}$ are used to discuss the NCQ scaling for different beam energies. Significant difference in $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is observed between particles and corresponding anti-particles for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 39 GeV. These differences are more pronounced for baryons compared to mesons and they increase with decreasing energy and increasing centrality. The $v_{2}$ difference between particles and anti-particles shows an almost linear dependency with the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_{B}$. The transport model calculations of UrQMD and AMPT models are compared with the experimental data.",

We demonstrate how medium recoil, geometry, expansion scenarios, and phase space cuts can be implemented numerically for phenomenological applications and quantify the effect of these uncertainties. We also prove the factorization of the medium-induced splitting from the hard process that creates the jet. We show that in the soft gluon approximation our result reduces to the parton energy loss obtained in the framework of the reaction operator approach. This limit is illustrated with an application to inclusive hadron suppression and comparison to the new ALICE and CMS results at the LHC. We discuss ongoing work on obtaining next-to-leading order splitting kernels in the medium and possible applications to heavy ion event generators.",

      "Institute": "Universita e INFN (IT)",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The main physics motivation for the upgrade of the Inner Tracking System of the ALICE experiment is to perform new measurements on charm and beauty production in heavy-ion collisions, dealing with the challenge of expected Pb-Pb interaction rates of up to 50 kHz. For this purpose, a new silicon tracker is needed with greatly improved features in terms of determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum, momentum resolution and readout rate capabilities.\r\nThe ITS upgrade foresees to replace the present ITS detector with a new seven layer silicon vertex detector. Two layouts are being considered: Layout 1 foresees to equip all layers with monolithic silicon pixel detectors; Layout 2 will consist of 3 layers of hybrid silicon pixel detectors and 4 layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors. For the innermost layers, there is a strong effort to decrease the pixel dimensions to about 20-30 um in the bending direction and equivalently in the beam direction and to reduce the material budget from 1.1% to 0.3% of X0, by using monolithic pixel detectors or hybrid pixel detectors with thinned chip and sensor, and minimizing the contribution coming from supports and services. The different types of monolithic pixel detectors under consideration for the ALICE ITS upgrade are: the rolling shutter, low power, architecture of the MIMOSA26 and ULTIMATE sensors, moved to a 0.18 um technology node; the INMAPS prototype, an in-pixel hit discrimination CMOS sensor based on a deep p-well extension of a triple-well 0.18 um CMOS; the LePIX development, a drift-based monolithic sensor in very deep submicron CMOS. The expected radiation levels for the innermost layer (685 krad TID, 10^13 neq per year) will require a careful validation of the different technologies in terms of radiation resistance. On the outermost layers the needed granularity and pointing resolution can be ensured by a strip detector geometry with a small cell size (95 um strip pitch, 22 mm strip length) and a small strip inclination with respect to the beam direction. The information on the signal amplitude will be preserved for the strip sensors for particle identification purposes. The strip readout chip will incorporate a low power ADC with 10 bits resolution. \r\nThe present status of the technology development for the considered options will be reported.",

Higher moments of event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distributions have high sensitivity to the correlation length[1], and they are directly connected to the susceptibilities in the Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) calculations and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. Therefore, they are ideal tools to search for the QCD critical point[4]\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present various moments (variance [σ^2], skewness[S] and kurtosis [κ], moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants (ω3 and ω4) of net-proton and total-proton multiplicity distributions measured by the STAR detector at RHIC. The moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants are related to the volume independent susceptibility ratios. The data presented in this talk will include the measurements of centrality dependence for the net-protons and total-protons from Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. These results have been compared with a Poisson baseline. It is observed that the moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants of net-proton distributions in the 0-5% most central Au+Au collisions show significant deviations from the Poisson expectations around √sNN = 19.6 GeV.

The ratios of yields of baryonic resonances to stable particles, namely $\\Sigmastar / \\Lambda$, $\\Lambdastar / \\Lambda$ and $\\Xistar / \\Xi$ will be compared with both thermal models and corresponding values from previous experiments at different colliding energies.\r\n\r\nThese results will serve as baseline for the forthcoming heavy-ion results.

      "Abstract": "Starting with the relativistic Boltzmann equation where the collision term is generalized to include nonlocal effects, and using Grad's 14-moment approximation for the single-particle distribution function, we derive equations for the relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics. We compare them with the corresponding equations obtained in the standard Israel-Stewart and related approaches. Our method generates all the second-order terms that are allowed by symmetry, some of which have been missed by the traditional approaches, and the coefficients of other terms are altered. The first-order or Navier-Stokes equations too get modified. Significance of these findings is demonstrated in the framework of one-dimensional Bjorken scaling expansion of the matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.",

Energy deposition is described by a simple Bethe-Bloch model which leads to an explosive burst of energy and momentum at the end of the trajectory of the parton. Dependence of the response on the equation of state is also discussed. The pairs of hard partons induce flow of energy and momentum density in medium which depend on initial directions of the partons.",

      "Speaker": "Nirupam Dutta",
      "Institute": "Doctoral Student, Bielefeld University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "In static picture a quarkonium bound state in deconfined medium is either completely dissociated above some threshold temperature or just stays in the speciﬁc state below the threshold. In contrast, some recent studies suggest that the static quark antiquark potential for describing bound quarkonia should include an imaginary part. This shows a ﬁnite life time of the bound state in the medium and initiate a quest for dynamical picture of the dissociation. The dynamical picture becomes more relevant when the medium is expanding and cooling down rapidly, as in the case of heavy ion collision. A possible general framework for this dynamics is to view the quarkonia as an open system. We have designed a novel approach, based on the wave function, to address the real time dynamics of heavy quarkonia in medium (thermally equilibrated or not) produced in heavy ion collision.",

      "Abstract": "Hard probes are a cornerstone in the ongoing program to determine the properties of hot and dense QCD matter as created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The first two runs at the LHC have resulted in a wealth of measurements of both reconstructed jets and single inclusive high P_T hadrons, opening new kinematic windows and offering high statistics. Yet on first glance, several observations are counter-intuitive and seem to contradict results from the RHIC high P_T program. I present a combined analysis of high P_T hadronic observables at RHIC and LHC and reconstructed jets at LHC in a framework testing a large number of theoretical models for both medium evolution and shower medium interactions against the systematics of the data. I demonstrate how a consistent picture of shower-medium interaction emerges from the combined results and explain where and why results appear counter-intuitive. In particular, I discuss the role of jet measurements in constraining models critically and suggest measurements sensitive to the gaps in our knowledge.",

      "Abstract": "The effect of initial fluctuations on partonic jet energy loss in a hydrodynamical background in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is studied within a next-to-leading order (NLO) perturbative QCD\r\nparton model. An energetic parton jet is found to lose more energy loss with fluctuating initial conditions than that with smooth initial conditions due to initial dominative positive correlation between the fluctuation of the production probability of the initial parton jet and the fluctuation of the local medium density in the jet trajectory. The deviation between the nuclear modification factors with fluctuating initial conditions and smooth initial conditions in non-central A+A collisions is found greater than in central A+A collisions. Particularly, the jet energy loss with linear path-length dependence is found to encounter more stronger fluctuation effect than with quadratic path-length dependence.",

      "Speaker": "Erike Cazaroto",
      "Institute": "University of Sao Paulo",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "At high energies the amount of gluons in a hadron is much larger than the amount of any other constituent, for example it is much larger than the amount of sea quarks. Therefore, at high energies the hadronic cross sections are basically a function only of the gluons distribution. The color dipole formalism applied to photon-photon collisions implies that, before interacting, each of the photons fluctuates in a pair quark-antiquark with a certain probability. The pair is colorless and it is also called Color Dipole. In a first approximation we can treat one of the pairs quark-antiquark as if it was a hadron and we can apply the evolution equations of QCD to determine its gluons distribution. Then the photon-photon cross section can be factorized as a product of two terms. The first one is the probabilities for each photon fluctuate in a color dipole and the second term is the dipole-hadron cross section. In order to determine the dipole-hadron scattering amplitude we used non-linear QCD dynamics. The non-linearity of the evolution equations implies that the gluons distribution inside the hadron saturates when a given kinematic regime is reached. The scale separating the saturation regime of the linear one is called Saturation Scale. When the saturation regime is reached it is expected that the gluons distribution form a new state of matter, the called Color Glass Condensate (CGC). The search for the CGC is still going on and it is expected that LHC, as well as the future eRHIC, will give us a definitive answer of its existence. In this work we applied the CGC approach to photon-photon collisions through the color dipole formalism. We calculated cross sections to photon-photon scattering and calculated structure functions of virtual and real photons. We proposed a new model to the dipole-dipole cross section and compared our results with a model available in the literature. Our calculations can be considered as predictions to observables that will be measured in a future linear collider.",

Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution, ranging from the second to the sixth component, are obtained using different analysis techniques, which have different sensitivities to non-flow and flow fluctuation effects. Utilizing a novel and unique high-pT single-track high-level trigger, the results are presented over a broad pT range up to approximately 60 GeV/c, as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality. These new data will provide essential information on both the hydrodynamic properties of the medium at low pT and path length dependence of in-medium parton energy loss at high pT. Dihadron correlations are measured over a wide acceptance and pT range. Long-range near-side (\"ridge\") correlation structures are observed from low pT (1 GeV/c) to very high pT (at least 20 GeV/c). Their connection to the single-particle azimuthal anisotropy is extensively investigated via the factorization studies of Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations. Short-range jet-like correlations are also systematically studied as a function of pT, pseudorapidity, centrality and compared to the results in pp collisions.",

Jet reconstruction can better determine the initial parton kinematics and recent improvements in analysis techniques allow the exploration of these effects over a wide pT range.

      "Speaker": "Ilkka Helenius",
      "Institute": "U",
      "Country": "U",
      "Abstract": "The knowledge of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) is essential for interpreting any hard-process results from hadronic and nuclear collisions. The nuclear modifications of PDFs have been successfully determined through a global DGLAP analysis e.g. in the sets EKS98 and more recently EPS09. So far the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs) in the global fits have been taken to be spatially independent. However, it can be expected that the nuclear modifications vary when going from the dense center of a nucleus to its more dilute edge. In this work, using the $A$-dependence of the globally fitted nPDFs, we have been able to determine the spatial dependence of the nPDFs in terms of powers of the nuclear thickness functions. A routine for public use is released. For applications, we will discuss how one can then compute hard-process cross sections in different centrality classes of nuclear collisions. In particular, we consider the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm dAu}$ for neutral pion production in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC. Comparison with the PHENIX data in different centrality classes is also shown. In addition, predictions for the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ in proton-lead collisions at the LHC are discussed. Both leading-order and next-to-leading order results are considered.",

      "Speaker": "Yasuki Tachibana",
      "Institute": "Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Hot and dense QCD matter, namely the quark gluon plasma, is created in high energy heavy ion collisions. High energy partons are also created through initial hard scatterings and have to traverse the QGP medium. These energetic partons are subject to lose their energy due to strong interactions with the medium. So jets in heavy ion collisions are expected to give information about the stopping power of the QGP.\r\nWhile jets traverse the QGP medium, they could induce collective flow in the fluid by depositing energy and momentum. Thus the space-time evolution of the QGP fluid would be affected when jets pass through the medium. In fact, the CMS Collaboration observed a lot of low momentum hadrons at large angles from a quenched jet [1]. These low momentum hadrons are intimately related with jet energy loss since the total momentum of these hadrons together with the quenched jet balances the momentum of the other jet propagating in the opposite direction. The CMS result can be interpreted as manifestation of a wake of the QGP fluid by jet energy loss.\r\nIn this study, we construct a model to describe the dynamics of QGP fluid and jets simulta- neously. We model a source term in the relativistic hydrodynamic equations which originates from the energy and momentum deposited from traversing jets. Without linearization we solve these non-linear hydrodynamic equations numerically in fully three dimensional space and describe the dynamics of the background QGP medium.\r\nA Mach cone like structure and a vortex ring appear behind the jet traversing a uniform medium. When a pair of jets go through a fluid expanding three dimensionally, the Mach cone like structure is distorted by radial flow. As a result, low momentum particles from the medium are preferentially emitted at large angles from the jet axis. The result exhibits the same trend as the one observed by the CMS Collaboration.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1]S. Chatrchyan et al. [CMS Collaboration], Phys. Rev. C 84, 024906 (2011); C. Roland, J. Phys.

      "Abstract": "The number of quark ($n_q$) scaling, which is manifested\r\nas $v^{hadron}_{2}(p_T) \\approx n_q*v_2(p_T/n_q)$, is an\r\napproximate scaling that comes from the addition of the valence\r\nquark momenta at hadronization. The observation of $n_q$ scaling\r\nhas been claimed that a partonic matter with quark-like degrees\r\nof freedom and significant collectivity has been generated in\r\nheavy ion collisions~\\ref{1,2}. However, there are several\r\ntheoretical considerations that suggest that the $n_q$ scaling\r\nshould be violated in certain conditions.

      "Abstract": "Well-calibrated penetrating probes are essential for investigating the properties of the hot, dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. One such probe are hadrons which carry heavy flavor (charm and bottom quarks). They are a powerful tool for studying the medium because they are generated early in the reaction and subsequently propagate through the created matter.\r\n\r\nTwo very striking results have already been seen for open heavy flavor from the PHENIX experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm or bottom quarks.  First, heavy mesons, despite their large mass, exhibit a suppression at high transverse momentum compared to that expected from p+p interactions. This suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium. Secondly, an elliptic flow is observed for heavy mesons which is comparable to that of light mesons like pions. This imply that the same heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow—giving new insight into the strongly coupled nature of the QGP fluid at these temperatures. In these early results, PHENIX was not able to distinguish electrons from c and b independently. In order to understand these medium effects in more detail it is imperative to directly measure the nuclear modification and the flow of c and b separately.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of the silicon vertex tracker, VTX, to PHENIX these direct measurements are now possible. We will present the latest PHENIX measurements of single electrons from beauty and charm decays, emphasizing the flow, v2, and nuclear modification factor, RAA, including the latest progress with the VTX.",

Understanding the dynamics responsible for such rapid \"hydroization\" is a challenge using traditional perturbative field theory.   In recent years holography has emerged as a powerful tool to study non-equilibrium phenomena, mapping the dynamics of certain quantum field theories onto the dynamics of semi-classical gravity. Via holography, the production of quark-gluon plasma maps onto the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation, with the relaxation of the black hole's gravitational field encoding hydroization of the dual quark gluon plasma.  Thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma is encoded in the thermalization of the black hole's Hawking radiation.  I will describe several processes which mimic heavy ion collisions and present results for both hydroization and thermalization times and mechanisms.",

This effect was already observed in Au-Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC. It was also predicted that high production yields of charm quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and especially at LHC energies will make possible (re)combination thus possibly leading to J/psi enhancement compared to lower energy nuclear collisions and to pp collisions.\r\nALICE measures the J/psi at mid-rapidity, |y| < 0.9, down to zero transverse momentum. The reconstruction is performed using the J/psi decay into the di-electron channel. The electron identification is done using energy loss in gaseous detectors (the Time Projection Chamber and the Transition Radiation Detector) and the time-of-flight method (Time Of Flight detector). We will present the J/psi nuclear modification factor as a function of the collision centrality. Discussions and comparisons to theoretical calculations will be provided. First results and perspectives on the J/psi production with respect to the event plane (elliptic flow) will also be shown.",

However, auto-correlations not related to initial geometry, commonly referred to as non-flow effects, can contribute to these coefficients, hence need to be systematically suppressed. We present comprehensive measurements of coefficients v_2-v_6 using the event plane method and two-particle correlations method in broad p_T, eta and centrality ranges using the Pb-Pb data from the ATLAS experiment. The phase space regions where the two methods are consistent and where they disagree are explored, and the role of harmonic flow, path-length dependence of jet quenching, and non-flow effects in different part of the phase space are clarified. These detailed measurements provide new insights into the hydrodynamic picture at low pT, the jet energy loss picture at high pT, and the nature of the fluctuations in the initial geometry; they also provide a natural explanation for the \"ridge\" structures observed in two-particle correlation functions.",

The jets are measured in the same calorimeter, over a range of jet radii, and benefit from the detailed information about the shower profile. The ATLAS experiment has measured jet correlations with both direct photons as well as with Z bosons via dilepton channels in Pb+Pb collisions with sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV in a data sample of nearly 150 ub^-1 of integrated luminosity.

We present first measurements of various event plane correlations involving Psi_2 to Psi_6 in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The large detector acceptance of ATLAS, i.e. calorimeter covering -5<eta<5 and tracking detector covering -2.5<eta<2.5, allows for a precise measurement of these correlations.

      "Abstract": "The major long-term goal of the ALICE experiment at the LHC is to provide precision measurements of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, the state of deconfined matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Experiments towards the characterisation of strongly interacting matter at high density will need to focus on rare probes and the study of their collective properties and hadronization, particularly at soft momentum scales. Such considerations have motivated the development of a comprehensive upgrade strategy for ALICE to provide high rate capability (50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions) in a near minimum bias mode by building a new Inner Tracking System and by modifying all major ALICE detectors to provide a fully pipelined read-out. This implies also a major upgrade of the data acquisition and high level trigger system. Further details of the overall ALICE upgrade strategy are described in [1]. This contribution will describe the proposed approach to upgrading the Inner Tracking System (ITS) in order to both comply with the new requirements set by the ALICE global upgrade strategy and to dramatically improve the performance for heavy-flavour detection. The ITS Upgrade will have greatly improved features in terms of: determination of the distance of closest approach (dca) to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low pt, momentum resolution and readout capabilities. These improvements are possible as a consequence of the spectacular progress made in the field of imaging sensors over the last ten years as well as the possibility to install a smaller radius beampipe. Moreover a tracker with the above features, in particular a high standalone tracking efficiency, creates an opportunity to perform, in combination with the TRD and TOF detectors, online event selection on the basis of topological and PID criteria. Such a new silicon tracker will allow ALICE to measure charm and beauty production in Pb-Pb collisions with sufficient statistical accuracy down to very low transverse  momentum, measure charm baryons and perform exclusive measurements of beauty production. A comprehensive description of the ITS Upgrade can be found in the recent Conceptual Design Report [2].\r\n\r\n[1] Upgrade Strategy for ALICE at High Rate, CERN-LHCC-2012-04.\r\n[2] Conceptual Design Report for the Upgrade of the ALICE ITS, CERN-LHCC-2012-05.",

Similar to the forward dihadron correlation in dAu collisions measured at RHIC, the Drell-Yan type correlation also implies a strong suppression of the away side hadron at forward rapidity due to the strong interaction between the forward quark from the projectile proton and the  gluon  density from the target nucleus.

Therefore, measurements of heavy flavour production provide relevant information on the properties of the QGP.\r\nThis talk presents measurements by the ALICE Collaboration of electrons from heavy flavour decays at central rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. Electrons are identified using several detectors of the ALICE central barrel. \r\nElectrons from beauty decays are separated based on their displacement from the interaction vertex. The nuclear modification factor of inclusive electrons from heavy flavour decays and of electrons from beauty decays, as a function of transverse momentum and collision centrality, will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "As the foundation of high energy hadronic physics, QCD factorization enables us to separate the short distance perturbative physics from the long distance non-perturbative effects. Its prediction power relies on the universality of the parton distributions among different processes. In our recent publication [1], we established an effective factorization in hard processes in nuclei scattered by a dilute probe. This factorization enables us to identify the key observables to probe the so-called unintegrated gluon distributions, the central objects in the saturation framework. This has been a long-standing issue in small-x physics. From our studies, we found that the dijet-correlations in deep inelastic scattering of electron-nucleus collisions directly measure the Weizacker-Williams gluon distribution function, whereas the photon-jet correlation in nucleon-nucleus (pA) collisions probes the dipole gluon distribution. The dijet (di-hadron) correlations in pA collisions can probe both gluon distributions. Current experiments in deuteron-gold (dAu) collisions at RHIC, and future pA collisions at LHC, and the planed electron-ion collider (EIC) experiments, will provide great opportunities to study two-particle collisions and the associated strong interaction dynamics of the gluon distributions in cold nucleus at small-x. \r\n\r\nRecently, both STAR and PHENIX collaborations have reported the measurements of two-hadron correlations in the forward direction of dAu collisions at RHIC [2], where the strong de-correlation of the away-side hadron have been considered as the best evidence for saturation physics. The numeric calculations based on our factorization formalism provides a quantitative and thorough description of the experimental data in the saturation formalism [3], including the large broadening of the angular distribution and suppression of the peak for the away-side hadron. The disappearing of the away-side peak in central collisions indicates that the saturation scale is the same order as the hard jet transverse momentum, which is a clear signal of the onset of the saturation. From the kinematics, we conclude that the saturation scale reaches 2GeV at x~6x10-4 in the center of the gold nucleus with jet transverse momentum kt~3GeV at rapidity 3.2. Future measurements at RHIC and LHC and the planed EIC will provide more information and help to map out the complete phase structure of the cold nuclei matter at small-x. \r\n\r\n[1] F.

For example, $v_{5(23)}/(\\epsilon_2\r\n\\epsilon_3)$ records the $v_5$ generated by the non-linear interactions between $v_2$ and $v_3$. Ideal and viscous hydrodynamic calculations show that the non-linear response becomes dominant for n=4 and n=5 in non-central collisions.

The VTX is a four-layer silicon tracker and it can reconstruct charged particle tracks in a wide range of pseudo-rapidity (|eta|<  1.2) and almost 2 pi in phi.

Only by increasing the luminosity beyond 10^27 and exploiting recent advances in technology ALICE will be able to address the new and remaining scientific challenges. ALICE is therefore setting up a program of detector upgrades, to be installed in the LHC shutdown planned for 2018. The planned upgrades will give access to otherwise unreachable rare processes, in particular observables involving heavy quarks and quarkonia at low transverse momentum, but also low-mass dileptons, selected topics in photon-jet physics with identified particles, and the search for heavy nuclear states. The potential of unique low-x measurements is also investigated. We will discuss examples of the scientific frontiers and the strategy of ALICE to address them.

However, there are other effects that may affect the observed quarkonia production, such as cold nuclear matter effects, final state nuclear absorption and statistical coalescence of quark-antiquark pairs. Studies of production of various quarkonia states in heavy-ion collisions can provide insight into the properties of the hot and dense medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Systematic measurement of the quarkonia production for different colliding systems, centralities and collision energies may help to understand the quarkonia production mechanisms as well as the medium properties. Furthermore, at RHIC energies the $\\Upsilon$ meson is a clean probe of the early system due to negligible contributions from $b$-$\\bar{b}$ recombination and non-thermal suppression from co-mover absorption.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present results on J/$\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production via the dielectron decay channel in Au+Au, $d$+Au and $p+p$ collisions at midrapidity at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in the STAR experiment.

The main focus is to search for signals of the hypothesized critical point and the onset of the quark-hadron phase transition. The BES program covers a large part of the QCD phase diagram ($T$ vs.$mu_{B}$). With its uniform acceptance and excellent particle identification, STAR has collected large event samples in the $mu_{B}$ range 100-400 MeV. This makes it possible to study, in addition to the energy dependence, the centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters such as temperature, baryon chemical potential, and radial collectivity.\r\n\r\nWe present the first results on the centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV from the STAR experiment. The chemical freeze-out conditions are obtained by comparing the measured particle ratios at midrapidity (involving $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_{s}$, $p(\\bar{p})$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$) to those from the statistical-thermal model calculations (THERMUS). We observe a clear centrality dependence in both $T$ and $mu_{B}$ values at the lower beam energies (11.5 and 7.7 GeV). Whereas no such dependence is observed for higher beam energies (200 - 62.4 GeV). The implications of including multi-strange hadrons and choosing different ensembles (Grand canonical versus Strangeness canonical) in THERMUS model on the $T$ and $mu_{B}$ values will be discussed.  The kinetic freeze-out parameters are obtained by fitting the invariant yields of the produced particles ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, and $p(\\bar{p})$), as a function of transverse momentum, to the Blast-Wave and Tsallis models.

Partonic energy loss allows us to access important observables for the study of the hot deconfined nuclear matter produced in heavy ion collisions.  The inclusive cross-section of reconstructed jets using the ALICE tracking detectors and electromagnetic calorimeter is presented from data collected during the 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb runs. The procedures used to reconstruct jets and extract them from a fluctuating background are discussed.

Bottom quark is produced at the relatively early stage of the nucleus-nucleus collisions and may have a small gluon radiation due to a suppression of small angle gluon radiation `dead cone effect’. Because the heavy mass of b-hadrons, muons from semi-leptonic b-hadron decays tend to have larger angle with respect to the jet axis. This information can be used to tag b-jets. Specifically, the transverse momentum of the muon with respect to the b-jet axis, pT^{rel}, is used to differentiate b-jets from the background charm and light quark jets. In this talk, we present the b-jet suppression R_CP, which is defined as the ratio of the average N_coll scaled yield in central collisions to that in peripheral collisions (60-80%), as a function of the muon momentum, jet momentum and the number of participants  average N_part in Pb+Pb collisions at  2.76 TeV. The result is also compared with the inclusive heavy flavor suppression, which was obtained by studying single muons decayed semi-leptonically from the from the b- and c-quark containing hadrons.",

PHENIX is planning a large upgrade for the next decade, sPHENIX, to answer many of the questions spurred by our discoveries during the last decade. This sPHENIX upgrade includes replacing the central arm spectrometers with an open geometry solenoid surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry.  With this new open geometry, we plan to upgrade our detector at forward rapidities with additional calorimetry and tracking. The larger acceptance will improve our access to low-x distributions in heavy nuclei, extend our measurements of quarkonia in p+p, d+A, and A+A to more forward rapidities, and allow for measurements away from the Bjorken plateau expanding the study of the high energy heavy ion environment. In addition to heavy ion and cold nuclear matter measurements, the envisioned forward rapidity upgrade will allow for a more systematic approach to understanding the large transverse spin measurements seen at RHIC as well as serve as the baseline detector for a future eRHIC detector, ePHENIX.",

The differential cross section is written \r\ninto a factorization form in the coordinate space at the next-to-leading order, while the naive form of the convolution in the transverse momentum space does not hold. The rapidity divergence with small-x dipole gluon distribution of the nucleus is factorized into the energy evolution of the dipole gluon distribution function, which is known as the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. Furthermore, the collinear divergences associated with the incoming parton distribution of the nucleon and the outgoing fragmentation\r\nfunction of the final state hadron are factorized into the splittings of the associated parton distribution and fragmentation functions, which allows us to reproduce the well-known DGLAP equation. The hard coefficient function, which is finite and free\r\nof divergence of any kind, is evaluated at one-loop order. This result is important, not only for the phenomenological applications to the inclusive hadron production in p-A collisions at RHIC and future LHC experiment, but also for theoretically promoting \r\nthe rigorous developments towards a complete QCD factorization in small-x physics.",

The lattice QCD Equation of State is now an essential requirement for the correct hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions. Lattice QCD provides first-principle calculations with physical results recovered in the continuum limit. Thus, understanding of the discretization effects is of great importance. I report on recent progress by the HotQCD collaboration in studying the 2+1 flavor Equation of State on lattices with the temporal extent Nt=6, 8, 10 and 12 in Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) discretization scheme. In the low-temperature phase, where the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is expected to be a good approximation, a comparison of HRG and lattice results is also presented.

While p+p collisions are used as a baseline for comparison with heavier collision systems and provide a cross check for pQCD calculations, d+Au collisions are used to study cold nuclear matter effects for mesons and baryons and their dependence on particle mass and flavor. Heavy ion collisions provide an insight into effects of quark recombination and jet quenching. Experimental measurements reveal if strange particles are suppressed at high transverse momentum ($p_T$) similarly to light hadrons and if the quark recombination mechanisms boosts strange hadron production at intermediate $p_T$. The PHENIX experiment provides excellent capabilities to measure particles with strangeness content over a wide $p_T$ range using a combination of different analysis techniques. \r\n  In this talk we present the latest PHENIX result on production of K$^\\pm$, K$_s$, K*, $\\phi$ and $\\Lambda$ which considerably extend the  $p_T$ range for p+p, d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 GeV.

We estimate the jet quenching parameter and compare to results in the literature. And, we compare P(k_perp) at weak coupling to the P(k_perp) expected from holographic calculations that presume the quark-gluon plasma to be strongly coupled at all length scales.  We find that the weak coupling and strong coupling results need not differ greatly at modest k_perp, but we find that P(k_perp) must be parametrically larger in a weakly coupled plasma than in a strongly coupled plasma at large enough k_perp.  By looking for rare large-angle deflections of the jet resulting from a parton produced initially back-to-back with a hard photon, experimentalists can find the weakly coupled quark and gluon short-distance constituents of the strongly coupled liquid quark-gluon plasma, much as Rutherford found the nuclei within atoms or Friedman, Kendall and Taylor found the quark within nucleons.",

Analysis of the data concentrates on two strategies: looking for signs of the onset of deconfinement by comparing to results at the top RHIC energy, and searching for direct signatures of a critical point.\r\n\r\nResults presented will include the following: charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity, transverse energy production at mid-rapidity, energy loss via the $R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$ observables from a variety of identified particles including neutral pions and the $J/\\psi$, collective flow measurements ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, $v_{4}$) from various particles including neutral pions, charged hadrons, and identified particles in order to examine the validity of the number of constituent quark scaling at lower energies, higher moments of the net charge distribution, and fluctuations of the charged particle multiplicity.",

      "Abstract": "Collisions of lead nuclei at the LHC allow study of the deconfined phase of QCD matter at unparalleled temperatures and energy densities. The use of leptonic observables is particularly appealing as a consequence of their electroweak nature, allowing them to traverse the strongly-coupled medium essentially unaffected. W and Z bosons, observed through their semi-leptonic decay channels, may serve as a proxy for investigating phenomenological processes associated with particle interactions in the QCD medium as well as exploring hitherto unattainable regions of nuclear PDFs.  The yields of these bosons in heavy ion collisions can be used for sensitive tests of binary scaling. This presentation will describe measurements of the W boson using single muon decay, and measurements of Z->ee and Z->mumu, both performed with nearly 150 ub-1 of collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair sqrt(s_NN)=2.76 TeV with the ATLAS detector during the 2011 heavy ion run.",

      "Abstract": "We propose a new mechanism for generating a single transverse spin \r\nasymmetry (STSA) in polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the high-energy scattering approximation. In this framework the STSA originates from the q -> q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function followed by a  perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks is in qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing projectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T, peaking near the saturation scale Q_s in our framework. Our mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton--nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton--proton collisions. We also observe that in our formalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.",

Additionally, direct photon measurements  in A+A  since they are not affected by the final state QGP,  offer an excellent way to test for non-trivial initial state effects,  complementing recent PHENIX d+Au collision jet and single  electron spectra data.  To this end, we will report in this talk on new results  of high pT single direct photon production in both p+p and Heavy Ion systems. \r\nFor the hot final state QGP studies, PHENIX results on direct photon-jet \"photon-hadron\" \r\ncorrelations for QGP studies will also be presented.

      "Abstract": "The idea of using heavy quarkonia production as a direct probe of the screening length in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) has been around for over two decades. Suppression of quarkonia production in heavy ion collisions has been measured at the SPS, RHIC, and the LHC, including new measurements of $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production in Au+Au collisions by PHENIX. However, a full understanding of these results in terms of direct contributions from the QGP is still evolving. An incomplete knowledge of the baseline cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, as well as the possibility of competing effects present in the QGP, such as recombination, has hindered a full understanding of the observed heavy ion results.\r\n\r\nIn order to quantify the CNM effects present at RHIC, PHENIX has measured both $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in $d$+Au collisions over a wide range in rapidity with the inclusion of new measurements of $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production at midrapidity. PHENIX finds a suppression relative to $p$+$p$ collisions which is greater at forward rapidity and similar between the $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$, leading to interesting implications of the RHIC heavy ion results. New measurements of the transverse momentum dependence of the $J/\\psi$ nuclear modification factor provide further constraints on CNM effects, as well as constraining the Cronin effect at RHIC energies. This talk will present recent heavy quarkonia results in $p$+$p$, $d$+Au and Au+Au collisions from PHENIX, as well as the implications of the measured CNM effects on the heavy ion data.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The flexibility of RHIC to collide different nuclei provides experiments with a rich resource to systematically test models and scaling behaviors and compare the results to those from Au+Au collisions. For an initial evaluation of the Cu+Au collision system, PHENIX has earmarked several measurements for fast analysis, in particular, forward/backward and central-rapidity J/psi production.  These collisions promise an array of unique geometrical configurations including odd harmonics and events where the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au.  Such geometries present an opportunity to probe the \"core\" and \"corona\" regions of the collision (which are strongly asymmetric in Cu+Au) by measuring the reaction plane dependence of particle production.  J/psi production may be more sensitive to the least dense part of the collision at the surface - the corona - thus providing a handle of the relative size of the Cu- versus Au-side corona.  An important component of this analysis is the understanding of the light-hadron vn(n=1,2,3,4) and the correlation between the vn event planes in these collisions, which will reveal the underlying hydrodynamical properties of the system.  In particular, the odd harmonics from the Cu+Au system offer sensitivity to v3 generated from the collision geometry as opposed to fluctuations in a symmetric system.  The analysis status of the recently taken U+U collision data, which offers some of the same advantages as Cu+Au, as well as a wider range of energy densities, will also be presented.",

We show that the event-by-event hydrodynamics followed by statistical hadronization with proper charge conservation provides the crucial non-flow component and leads to agreement with the data at soft transverse momenta (p_T < 2 GeV). The fall-off of the same-side ridge follows from the fact that a pair of particles with opposite charges is emitted from the same fluid element, whose collective velocity collimates the momenta of the pair. Basic experimental features of the two-dimensional correlation functions are then represented, including the dependence on the relative charge (like-sign and unlike-sign pairs) and centrality.  Related quantities, such as the charge balance functions or the dependence of the harmonic flow coefficients on relative pseudorapidity, are also properly explained in our approach.",

      "Abstract": "Azimuthal anisotropic flows vn, arising from the anisotropic collision geometry, reflect the hydrodynamic properties of the quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A long standing issue in vn measurements is the contamination of nonflow, caused by intrinsic particle correlations unrelated to the collision geometry. Nonflow limits, in part, the precise extraction of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s from data-model comparisons. Isolation of flow and nonflow is critical to the interpretation of the Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we report measurements of vn azimuthal anisotropies using the two- and mult-particle Q-cumulants method from STAR in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. The centrality and pT dependence of vn will be presented. We compare the four- and six-particle cumulant measurements to gain insights on the nature of flow fluctuations [1,2]. We further analyze two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (eta) bins. Exploiting the collision symmetry about mid-rapidity, we isolate the \\Delta\\eta-dependent and \\Delta\\eta-independent correlations in the data with a data-driven method [3]. The \\Delta\\eta-dependent part arises from near-side nonflow correlations, such as HBT interferometry, resonance decays, and jet-correlations. The \\Delta\\eta-independent part is dominated by flow and flow fluctuations with relatively small contribution from away-side jet-correlations. The method does not make assumptions about the eta dependence of flow. Our isolated \\Delta\\eta-independent part from data, dominated by flow, however, is found to be also eta-independent within the STAR TPC of +-1 unit of pseudo-rapidity. The \\Delta\\eta drop in the measured two-particle cumulant appears to entirely come from nonflow. We assess the effect of the nonflow on eta/s extraction. We reexamine the high-pT triggered dihadron correlations with background subtraction of our decomposed flows. \r\n\r\n[1] S.A. Voloshin, A.M. Poskanzer, A. Tang, and G. Wang, Phys. Lett.

      "Abstract": "Direct photons are a powerful tool to study heavy ion collisions. Their production rates provide access to the initial state PDFs, which are expected to be modified by nuclear effects. They also provide a means to calibrate the expected energy of jets that are produced in the medium, and thus are a tool to probe the physics of jet quenching more precisely both through jet rates and fragmentation properties. The ATLAS detector measures photons with its hermetic, longitudinally segmented calorimeter, which gives excellent spatial and energy resolution, and detailed information about the shower shape of each measured photon. This gives powerful rejection against the expected background from neutral pions coming from jets. Rejection against jet fragmentation products is further enhanced by isolation criteria, which can be based on calorimeter energy or the presence of high pT tracks. First results on the rates of isolated direct photons from approximately 140 µb-1 of lead-lead data will be shown, as a function of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality, and their rates compared to expectations from perturbative QCD.",

      "Speaker": "Karel Safarik",
      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "A baryon anomaly – an increase baryon-to-meson production ratio at intermediate transverse momenta in heavy-ion collisions when compared to proton–proton collisions – is observed at RHIC and the LHC. This effect is usually explained by recombination of constituent quarks during QGP hadronisation, or as a consequence of a strong radial flow developed during the heavy-ion collision. In this contribution, a different mechanism to favour baryon-over-meson production is proposed: when hadrons are formed in the recombination of nearby quarks and antiquarks, only colour-singlet combinations can be chosen. Hadron formation, in particular the probability to create baryons or mesons, depends on the distribution of colour charges among quarks. If the distribution is random – a reasonable assumption for Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) – the baryon-to-meson ratio is nearly twice higher than in the situation where quark colours are pre-arranged to obtain a white hadron in the combination of nearest quarks and antiquarks. The correlation of colour charges in the QGP also influences the distance over which recombination occurs. A study of the dependencies of the baryon-to-meson ratio and of the size of the recombination domain on the colour-correlation configuration will be presented.",

At leading order, photon production is determined by three processes: hard two-to-two collisions, collinear bremsstrahlung, and quark-conversions, i.e. a process where the incoming quark transfers almost all of its momentum to the produced photon and the final state quark is soft.  At NLO, wider angle bremsstrahlung must be treated carefully, and the LPM suppressed leading order rate smoothly matches onto two-to-three processes.  Similarly, asymmetric bremsstrahlung,  when  the photon carries a large momentum fraction of the incoming momentum and the final state quark is soft, must be smoothly matched onto the quark conversion process present at leading order. We carefully include these rates without double counting to determine the full photon production rate at NLO.",

      "Speaker": "Pol Gossiaux",
      "Institute": "Subatech",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Recently, we have proposed a microscopic approach for the quenching and thermalisation of heavy quarks (HQ) in URHIC \\cite{Gossiaux:2008,Gossiaux:2009,Gossiaux:2010}, assuming that \r\nthey interact with light partons through both elastic and radiative processes evaluated by resorting to some parameterization of the running coupling constant, while those partons are spatially distributed along hydrodynamical evolution of the hot medium. This approach is able to explain successfully several observables measured at RHIC, such as the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of non-photonic single electrons. The diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks in the quark gluon plasma -- a fundamental property of this state of matter -- can thus be extracted and compared with recent lattice calculations. In this contribution, we discuss the predictions of our model for D and B mesons production in URHIC at LHC energies and confront them with experimental results obtained so far by ALICE and CMS collaborations for Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76~{\\rm TeV}$. \r\n\r\nThe slight excess of quenching found w.r.t. the D mesons data at LHC trigers our interest in new effects neglected up to now, such as the influence of gluon damping on radiative energy loss and its phenomenological consequences. In \\cite{Bluhm:2011}, we have indeed studied the effect of an absorptive medium on standard LPM \\cite{LPM} radiation in electrodynamics and have advocated that the large time needed for the photon formation in Bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic charges is not affordable if damping is taken into account. Similar effect manifests itself in QCD, as we have recently advocated in \\cite{Bluhm_2012}. In our QM contribution, we intend to concentrate on the {\\em implications} of such an effect on the quenching of particles in URHIC (discussing observables such as spectra, elliptic flow and azimutal correlations) as well as on the single electron puzzle.  \r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{Gossiaux:2008}\r\nP.B.

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC, heavy quarks are expected to be created from initial hard scatterings. Their large masses are not easily affected by the strong interaction with QCD medium, thus they carry clean information from the system at early stage. The interaction between heavy quarks and the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics, therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an ideal probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting QCD matter.\r\nIn this talk, we will present the STAR results of open charm hadron production at mid-rapidity in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Open charm mesons were reconstructed directly via hadronic decay channels with daughter particles identified by TPC and TOF detectors.  With abundant statistics of Au+Au collisions collected by STAR in the year 2010 and 2011, the D-meson is measured at $p_T$ from 0.2 to 8 GeV in minimum bias Au+Au collisions. The centrality dependence of D-meson $p_T$ spectra as well as the nuclear modification factor will be presented. A first measurement of the $D^{0}$ elliptic flow in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be reported. These measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations and physics implications will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the open charm hadron measurement in $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV $p+p$ collisions to study the energy dependence of charm production.",

The J/psi  elliptic flow v2 provides an important tool to test the degree of J/psi  thermalisation in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV. It may also help in understanding the J/psi (re)generation mechanism in the QGP, which is expected to play a more important role at LHC energies.\r\nWe present the elliptic flow of J/psi measured in the dimuon channel\r\nat forward rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4.0 ) with the ALICE muon spectrometer, down to zero transverse momentum.

      "Abstract": "The recent jet measurements at RHIC and the LHC have challenged the heavy-ion community to a better understanding of jet fragmentation in the presence of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). \r\n\r\nJet fragmentation in vacuum is well described by perturbative QCD and is characterized by color coherence effects that lead to the angular ordering of successive branchings along the jet. To investigate the alteration of color coherence in jets in the QGP we study the radiation pattern of a  color-correlated quark-anti-quark antenna  which is in fact the building block of jet evolution in vacuum. \r\n\r\nWe show that in a dense medium the onset of coherence is governed by the hardest scale induced by the presence of the medium. In a medium of length $L$ and transport coefficient $\\hat q$ this can either be the typical transverse momentum broadening  of the gluon in the medium, $\\sqrt{\\hat q L}$, or the inverse of the size of the antenna as probed by the medium, namely  $r_\\perp^{-1}=(\\theta_{qq} L)^{-1}$, where $\\theta_{qq}$ is the opening angle of the antenna. Therefore, for $k_\\perp<max(\\sqrt{\\hat q L}, r_\\perp^{-1})$  we obtain complete decoherence of the antenna; for larger momenta color coherence is restored. \r\n\r\nWe expect the transition from color decoherence to coherence to play an important role in in-medium jet fragmentation.",

Hydrodynamic\r\nmodels predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse\r\nmass of the pair. Such decrease is universally reported for pions,\r\nalso at the LHC. Kaons and baryons, having a much larger mass, allow\r\nto significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The femtoscopic\r\nresults for heavier particles would put a strong constraint on such\r\npredictions. Non-identical baryon and meson pairs are also sensitive\r\nto emission asymmetries.\r\n\r\nFemtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to\r\nthe strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon\r\npair types.

Results have been obtained with the highly improved staggered quark action (HISQ) and almost physical quark masses on lattices with temporal extent of N_tau=6,8,12. Higher cumulants of the net-charge distributions are increasingly dominated by a universal scaling behavior, which is arising due to a critical point of QCD in the chiral limit. Considering cumulants up to the 6th order, we observe that they generically behave as expected from universal scaling laws, which is quite different from cumulants calculated within the hadron resonance gas model. Taking ratios of these cumulants, we obtain volume independent results that can be directly compared to the experimental measurements. Such a comparison will unambiguously relate the QCD transition temperature that has been determined on the lattice with, the freeze out temperature of the heavy ion collision at LHC and the 200 GeV RHIC run.",

Effects such as nuclear shadowing, Cronin enhancement, and initial-state parton energy loss, among others, are not only interesting in their own right, but have direct implications on QGP-related measurements in $A+A$ collisions.\r\n\r\nRecently PHENIX has measured CNM effects at midrapidity in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au collisions.  Measurements of reconstructed jets reveal the centrality dependence of both jet suppression and broadening of the away-side jet.  Meanwhile, single electrons from heavy flavor decays exhibit enhancement over a broad $p_T$ range and increasing with centrality.  These results will be presented and compared to our present understanding of CNM effects to see if simultaneous constraints on nuclear shadowing, initial state energy loss, and Cronin effects can be found.  The centrality dependence of the nuclear modification, for which there is no a priori model, will be examined in the context of available theoretical models of CNM effects, including the EPS09 nuclear-modified parton distribution functions.",

      "Abstract": "We present a systematic study on the evolution of hadron spectra and their azimuthal anisotropy from the lowest collision energy studied at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), √s = 7.7A GeV, to the highest energy reachable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), √s = 5500A GeV [1]. As the collision energy increases, the resulting increases of the initial temperature, and fireball lifetime, as well as the evolution of the centrality dependence of final charged particle multiplicity are quantitatively studied and compared between the two most popular initial state models, the Monte Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models. For Glauber model initial conditions with a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the differential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) is found to exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of √s around top RHIC energy, rendering it  almost independent of collision energy for 39 < √s < 2760A GeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations [2], this \"saturation\" of elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects. For color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger shear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar \"saturation\" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low pT. We emphasize that this \"saturation\" of the elliptic flow is not associated with the QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which shifts with √s depending on the fluid's viscosity and leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and decreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the √s range where v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) at fixed pT is maximal. By generalizing the definition of spatial eccentricity ecc_x to isothermal hyper-surfaces, we calculate ecc_x on the kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies. Up to top RHIC energy, √s=200A GeV, the fireball is still out-of-plane deformed at freeze out, while at LHC energy the final spatial eccentricity is predicted to approach zero.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chun Shen and Ulrich Heinz, \"Collision Energy Dependence of Viscous Hydrodynamic Flow in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions,'', arXiv:1202.6620 [nucl-th].\r\n \r\n[2] Gregory Kestin and Ulrich Heinz, \"Hydrodynamic radial and elliptic flow in heavy-ion collisions from AGS to LHC energies,'' Eur.

      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The precise value of the QGP kinematic shear viscosity eta/s is a question of intense topical interest. Viscous hydrodynamic simulations are a tool for extracting this information from experiment. The key observables are the anisotropic flow coefficients v_n which (i) can be measured very precisely and (ii) are very sensitive to eta/s which controls the \"conversion efficiency\" v_n/ecc_n for turning initial fireball eccentricities of harmonic order n into final flows of the same harmonic order. \r\n\r\nBoth ecc_n and v_n fluctuate strongly from collision to collision. These event-by-event fluctuations have a key influence on the measurements [1] and must be properly taken into account when extracting eta/s. Until recently, most initial-state models accounted only for the shape and density fluctuations arising from the fluctuating positions of the nucleons in the colliding nuclei. This leads to fluctuations in the location of the newly produced matter, and thus of the initial energy density profile of the expanding fireball and its eccentricities ecc_n, but does not account for additional quantum fluctuations in the quark and gluon fields inside the nucleons that lead to fluctuating numbers of secondary particles per nucleon-nucleon interaction. Several recent papers have addressed the implementation of these quantum fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial conditions for the expanding collision fireball. \r\n\r\nStarting from the Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model for generating fluctuating initial profiles for the gluon saturation momentum Q_sat(x_T) in the transverse plane, we have developed a Monte Carlo algorithm that uses a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) generator [2] to generate a distribution of gluonic energy densities centered at the value corresponding to the field Q_sat(x_T), but fluctuating around this profile with the two-point covariance function derived in [3] from the Glasma model. To ensure that the energy density is everywhere positive the GRF is mapped to an appropriate negative binomial distribution (NBD) with the same variance. NBD fluctuations have been recently shown to arise naturally from the Glasma model and to describe the measured multiplicity distributions in pp collisions at the LHC. The resulting density profile features ``hot spots\" as in the MC-KLN model overlaid with a fluctuating field texture characterized by an intrinsic length scale 1/Q_sat(x_T).\r\n \r\nWe show that inclusion of these additional gluonic quantum field fluctuations leads to only a small (few percent) increase of the initial eccentricities ecc_n in central collisions and to almost negligible effects at larger impact parameters. These findings disagree with some of the results reported in [4], and we will discuss possible origins for this discrepancy. Our results imply that an earlier extraction of the QGP shear viscosity from a combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow data from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [5] is robust.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n   \r\n[1] Zhi Qiu and U.

The CASTOR calorimeter extends the pseudorapidity coverage of CMS to -6.6, which is only 1.4 units away from the beam rapidity. A comparison of the centrality dependence of forward energy flow to that at lower pseudorapidities can shed light on the gluon saturation at low-x. This problem can also be approached by a direct comparison of PbPb and pp energy flow in the forward region. This analysis is based on data taken in 2010. The energy flow in the pseudorapidity range of -5.2 to -6.6 has been measured for 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions over a wide range of centrality and also for minium bias pp collisions. These data are compared to energy-flow measurements for pseudorapidities between -5.2 and +5.2. The very large angular coverage of the CMS detector allows for a test of limiting fragmentation of energy flow, and for an estimate of nuclear stopping. Finally, these data are compared to predictions of hydrodynamic models and microscopic event generators.",

These modification factors provide stringent constraints on the theoretical models of heavy quark energy loss. Until recently only indirect measurements of this effect existed, through single electrons from semileptonic open heavy-flavor decays. The importance of an unambiguous measurement of open bottom flavor is driven by the lack of knowledge regarding key features of the dynamics of parton energy loss in the QGP, such as its color-charge and parton-mass dependencies and the relative role of radiative and collisional energy loss. CMS is the first, and so far only, experiment to measure the nuclear modification factor of B hadrons, identified via their decays into J/psi displaced from the primary collision vertex. First results have shown that B hadrons are strongly suppressed in PbPb collisions at a level comparable to open charm. New results on the centrality dependence of RAA and the first measurement of the azimuthal anisotropy of non-prompt J/psi will be presented, based on the full 2011 PbPb data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150/ub.",

At low pair mass, direct photons and low mass vector mesons are the main center of interest. Interpretation of lepton pair production rates in excess of expectations from hadronic decays observed by PHENIX and how the data constrains theoretical models on thermalization and chiral symmetry restoration is a hotly debated topic. At intermediate and high mass, the di-electron spectrum has been used by PHENIX to measure cross sections of open charm and open bottom, as well as Quarkonium suppression with implications for color screening and recombination.\r\n\r\nDue to the small signal to background ratio, measurement of the dielectron spectrum, especially at low mass, is very challenging. In PHENIX, the background results mainly from random combinations of electron positron pairs from uncorrelated sources, mostly $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decays and photon conversions. The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was developed to address this issue. The HBD accomplishes this by tagging and rejecting tracks from conversions and $\\pi^0$ Dalitz decays. It was successfully operated in RHIC run years 2009 to 2010, where Au+Au and reference p+p data sets were taken. We will present the dielectron results from the analysis of these data sets.",

A distinctive feature of the pre-equilibrium system (the Glasma) is the high over-population of phase space for gluons, which we argue plays a central role for the thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. In particular, the over-population (1) coherently amplifies scattering by $1/\\alpha_s$ and makes the system behave as a strongly interacting fluid despite being out of equilibrium at weak coupling, (2) may lead to the dynamical, albeit transient formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate over the course of thermalization. A further distinctive feature of our scenario is that the initially single scale ($Q_s$) of Glasma develops into a hierarchy of scales, with the IR scale and the UV separated by coupling $\\alpha_s$, precisely as in equilibrium thermal field theory. We demonstrate these features by solving the Boltzmann equation in the small angle approximation and in the regime where the occupation numbers are large. Finally, we address possible phenomenological consequences of our scenario.",

      "Abstract": "The proton gluon distribution function increases rapidly with decreasing x at fixed $Q^{2}$, but cannot increase indefinitely as x goes to 0. Gluon saturation is expected at a low x value when gluon recombination balances gluon splitting. The nuclear (with atomic mass number A) gluon distribution is approximately $A^{1/3}$ larger than the nucleon gluon distribution function at the same x [1]. STAR is sensitive to x between 0.001 and 0.02 for the nuclear gluon distribution via di-jet measurements with calorimeter subsystems covering -1 < eta < 4. The STAR collaboration has measured forward $\\pi{0}$-$\\pi{0}$ correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200GeV$. The suppression of the away-side peak observed in forward-forward correlations in central d+Au collisions is consistent with the CGC expectation [2,3]. Such suppression does not appear in the forward+mid-rapidity correlations. \r\n\r\nThe Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) at STAR covers pseudo-rapidity between 1.08 and 2, providing the opportunity to probe gluons at intermediate x via forward+near-forward correlations. Azimuthal correlations between $\\pi{0}$ in the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) and jet-like clusters in the EEMC are sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution in 0.003<x<0.02 region. Together with the forward+forward correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations, we will be able to determine the sharpness of the transition along x from a dilute parton gas to the expected CGC state at low $Q^{2}$. In this talk, we will focus on FMS-$\\pi^{0}$ + EEMC-jet-like-cluster azimuthal correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions. The impact from underlying-event contributions to the jet-like clusters and effective p+Au results, via a deuteron-beam-facing neutron tag, will be discussed as well.\r\n\r\n[1] H. Kowalski, D.

We focus on the consistent implementation of dynamically calculated nuclear matter effects, such as coherent power corrections, cold nuclear matter energy loss, and the Cronin effect in the initial state, and collisional dissociation of quarkonia in the final state as they traverse through the QGP. This formalism has been previously used to successfully describe the phenomenology of open heavy flavor (B and D mesons) both at RHIC and the LHC. We will briefly review the comparison with new open heavy flavor data and describe the extension of the calculation for quarkonium production.  Based upon non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics, our calculations include both color-singlet and color-octet contributions and feed-down effects from excited states. Theoretical results are presented for $J/\\psi$  and $\\Upsilon$ and compared to experimental data where applicable. At RHIC, a good description of the high-$p_T$ $J/\\psi$  modification observed in central Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions can be achieved within the model uncertainties. We find that $J/\\psi$ measurements in proton(or deuteron)-nucleus reactions are needed to constrain the magnitude of cold nuclear matter effects, and new data from d+Au collisions at RHIC already puts a strong limit on the Cronin enhancement for $J/\\psi$.  At the LHC, a  good description of the experimental data can be achieved only in mid-central and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. The large five-fold suppression of prompt $J/\\psi$ in the most central nuclear reactions  suggests the presence of thermal effects at the level of the quarkonium wavefunction, even at large transverse momentum.",

With its more differential power full jets in heavy-ion collisions can then provide excellent tools to study the properties of the QGP and impose constraints on different parton energy loss models.\r\n\r\nWith this motivation, we investigate the cold nuclear matter(CNM) effects on jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions at LHC with the NLO perturbative QCD. The nuclear modifications for dijet angular distributions, dijet invariant mass spectra, dijet transverse momentum spectra and dijet momentum imbalance due to CNM effects are calculated by incorporating EPS, EKS, HKN and DS parametrization sets of parton distributions in nucleus. It is found that dijet angular distributions and dijet momentum imbalance are insensitive to the initial-state CNM effects and thus provide optimal tools to study the final-state hot QGP effects such as jet quenching. \r\n\r\nFurthermore we present the results and predictions at NLO for productions of the single, double and tagged jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by including parton energy loss effect in the QGP and the CNM effects. We demonstrate how an enhanced di-jet transverse momentum imbalance in central Pb+Pb reactions at the LHC, recently measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, can be derived from these results. We show quantitatively that a significant fraction of this enhancement may be related to the ambiguity in the separation between the jet and soft background medium and point to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of parton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.",

In this talk, we will present measurements of identified $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, and $p(\\bar{p})$ and unidentified charged particles in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV. We will report nuclear modification factors $R_{CP}$ and $R_{AA}$ where published p+p references are available. These results offer insight into the $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ dependence of high $p_{T}$ suppression in nuclear collisions.",

      "Speaker": "Krishna Rajagopal",
      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "A holographic calculation of the quenching of a beam of gluons with typical momenta q shining through strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma shows that such a beam is attenuated rapidly over a distance of order q^{1/3} (pi T)^{-4/3} as it propagates at the speed of light, shedding trailing sound waves with momenta of order (pi T).  At larger and larger q, the trailing sound wave becomes less and less prominent.  The outward-going beam of gluon radiation itself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger wavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated.  In this regard, the behavior of the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets produced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction of their energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or their momentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions.  However, we know that quark-gluon plasma must be weakly coupled at short enough distance scales.  This means that even if jet quenching typically occurs as in a strongly coupled plasma, there should be rare events in which a hard parton is scattered by a larger angle, picking up significant transverse momentum.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "The creation of a strongly interacting deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be studied by the fluctuations of conserved quantities like net-charge, and correlations between positive and negative pairs by using the method of Balance functions. Net-charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges present in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are expected to be different from those of the hadron gas with unit charged particles. Lattice calculations suggest that the higher moments of net-charge distributions and their products are sensitive to the correlation length, and are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of the system. The method of the Balance function, on the other hand, is sensitive to collective flow and the breakup temperature and was proposed to give a handle on the hadronization time. A combined study of net-charge fluctuations with Balance functions provides insight to the properties of matter created in high energy collisions. We will present the first results of net-charge fluctuations, higher moments of net-charge distributions and Balance functions for Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. The results from net-charge fluctuations, presented in terms of νdyn and D-measure, are compared to predictions for a system initially dominated by a QGP, as well as for a hadron resonance gas. The widths of the Balance functions in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle for non-identified charged particles show a clear centrality dependence, consistent with the picture of a delayed hadronization but also with a system exhibiting larger radial expansion in central collisions. A comparison of the results will be made to lower energy collisions at SPS and RHIC as well as to several models that incorporate collective effects.",

In particular, the ability to measure jets in heavy ion collisions implies that, in order to fully understand jet quenching phenomena, we must go beyond leading parton energy loss and attempt to describe how the jet structure is modified by the presence of the quark-gluon plasma. In this spirit, we study in-medium jet evolution by considering the multiple emission of soft gluons, for which the formation time is much smaller than the size of the medium. This separation of scales implies that one can consider the multiple emissions as independent and ordered in time, therefore allowing for a probabilistic interpretation where the parton shower is built as a classical branching process.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal emission of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions is believed to have a very strong temperature dependence and the high p_T thermal photons are expected to provide a glimpse of the early part of the expansion history when the system is still in the plasma phase. Photons having p_T > 1 GeV/c are thus specially suitable for probing fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density distributions. We present the p_T spectra, ratio of central to-peripheral yield and elliptic flow of thermal photons from an event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic calculation with fluctuating initial conditions (IC).\r\n\r\nWe show that fluctuations in the IC enhance the production of thermal photons significantly in the range 2 < p_T < 4 GeV/c compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged profile for Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions at RHIC (LHC) [1,2]. The relative effect of fluctuations in the IC is found to be stronger for peripheral collisions and for lower beam energies. Thermal photon p_T spectra are studied for different values of initial formation time \\tau_0 as well as for centrality dependent \\tau_0 values. We show that a suitably normalized ratio of central-to-peripheral yield as a function of collision centrality and p_T can be a useful measure of the fluctuation size scale [2].\r\n\r\nPHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow at RHIC is found to be significantly larger than the v_2 results obtained using ideal hydrodynamics with smooth IC in the region 1 < p_T < 6 GeV/c. We show that fluctuations in the IC increase the elliptic flow for p_T > 2  GeV/c for  mid-central collisions compared to the results from a smooth initial-state-averaged profile [3]. We also show that these results depend strongly on the value of the fluctuation size scale as well as on the initial and final conditions of the  hydrodynamic calculation [3].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] R.

This analysis is based on 0.306/ub of data from 2010, with recently extended number (and range) of pseudorapidity and centrality bins. The transverse energy per unit of pseudorapidity increases faster with collision energy than the multiplicity of charged particles. This implies that the mean energy per particle and hence the temperature of the system is increasing with collision energy. The amount of transverse energy produced per participating nucleon increases with centrality and with collision energy. The centrality dependence of transverse energy production has only a weak dependence on pseudorapidity and collision energy. For the most central collisions, the energy density is estimated to be 11.3 +- 0.6 GeV/fm3 at a time of 1 fm/c after the collision, which is 2.8 times higher than the value reported at sqrt(sNN)=200 GeV.",

Charged particles are reconstructed using an iterative algorithm and spurious high-pT tracks are suppressed by requiring appropriate energy deposits in the calorimeter system. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm, using combined information from tracking and calorimetry. The charged particle and jet transverse momentum distributions are measured in the pseudorapidity range of |eta|<1 and |eta| < 1.6, and in pT up to 100 GeV/c, and from 100 to 300 GeV/c, respectively. The nuclear modification factors, RAAs, for charged hadrons and jets are presented as a function of pT and collision centrality. In the range pT = 5-10 GeV/c the charged hadron production in PbPb collisions is suppressed by up to a factor of seven, compared to the pp yield scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions.

Instead, we keep all the terms in the moment expansion and truncate the exact equations of motion for these moments according to a systematic power counting scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers. We apply this formalism to obtain an approximate expression for the non-equilibrium single-particle momentum distribution function of a hadron resonance gas.

Based on an effective phase transition model, chiral fields and their fluctuations propagate explicitly within a medium that expands fluid dynamically. The interaction between the fields and the fluid leads to dissipation and noise, which in turn affect the chiral propagation. In this talk we present the consequences of this coupled dynamics for different phase transition scenarios.\r\nIn the case of a first order phase transition we observe the development of a highly supercooled state. This leads to the dynamic formation and decay of domains of the chirally-symmetric phase in a chirally-broken environment and can be seen in single event studies. At the critical point, due to large relaxation times, we find that critical slowing down weakens the critical phenomena. However, for the first time we are able to demonstrate in a dynamic and realistic study the basic features of a critical point: the growth of the correlation length and the enhancement of event-by-event fluctuations of the sigma field. It is, therefore, expected that both, the first order phase transition and the critical point develop their characteristic signals in heavy-ion collisions.",

Fluctuation in the initial energy density comes from not only the coherent soft interaction of overlapping nucleons but also the number of mini-jets within each binary nucleon collision. Mini-jets produced via semi-hard parton scatterings are assumed to be locally thermalized through a Gaussian smearing and give rise to fluctuation in rapidity distribution along the longitudinal direction.

      "Abstract": "One of the most difficult problems still to be understood is the mechanism of fast thermalization in heavy ion collisions. The problem involves dynamics in strong coupling regime and physics far from equilibrium, therefore is hardly tractable by usual method. The gauge/gravity duality naturally maps the formation of quark gluon plasma to another fundamental problem in black hole physics: information loss in a gravitational collapse process. The present work summarizes our recent results on the study of a particular probe: unequal time two-point correlator for gauge theory in the evolution toward thermal equilibrium. In [1], we found that near equilibrium the spectral functions showed a universal pattern as field equilibrates in a quasi-static approximation. We have then systematically extended the previous work to the far from equilibrium region by using the coordinate representation. In the past two years we have developed a divergence matching method in computing the singularities of the unequal time two-point correlator in a time-dependent background. We found the singularities have a nice interpretation with a geometric optics picture [2,3]. Applying this method to the gravitational collapse model, we found the singularities of the unequal time correlator shifted from the real time to the complex time in the formation of QGP [4]. This signature sheds more light on the mechanism of the thermalization and may have interesting implications to heavy ion phenomenology and experiments.\r\n\r\n[1] S.~Lin and E.~Shuryak,\r\n  %``Toward the AdS/CFT Gravity Dual for High Energy Collisions. 3.

      "Abstract": "We investigate how the initial geometry of a heavy-ion collision is transformed into final flow observables by solving event-by-event ideal hydrodynamics with realistic fluctuating initial conditions.  We study quantitatively to what extent anisotropic flow ($v_n$) is determined by the initial eccentricity $\\varepsilon_n$ for a set of realistic simulations, and we discuss which definition of $\\varepsilon_n$ gives the best estimator of $v_n$.  We find that the common practice of using an $r^2$ weight in the definition of $\\varepsilon_n$ in general results in a poorer predictor of $v_n$ than when using $r^n$ weight, for $n > 2$.   We similarly study the importance of additional properties of the initial state.  For example, we show that in order to correctly predict $v_4$ and $v_5$ for non-central collisions, one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional to $\\varepsilon_2^2$ and $\\varepsilon_2\\varepsilon_3$, respectively.  We find that it makes no difference whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity, or in a single slice at $z=0$, nor is it important whether one uses an energy or entropy density weight. This knowledge will be important for making a more direct link between experimental observables and hydrodynamic initial conditions, the latter being poorly constrained at present.",

Such a measurement provides information on the pathlength dependence of medium-induced parton energy loss as well as biases in jet-finding methods.  In addition, an estimate of jet $v_2$ is necessary for background-subtraction in jet-triggered correlation analyses, which are used to study medium-induced jet shape modification.  However, jet $v_2$ measurements are complicated by biases in the event plane calculation due to the presence of the jet, leading to an overestimation of jet $v_2$.  In order to reduce the artificial jet-event plane bias, we utilize detectors at forward pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), such as the Forward Time Projection Chambers located at $2.5 < |\\eta| < 4$ and the Zero Degree Calorimeter Shower Maximum Detectors at $|\\eta| > 6.3$, to determine the event plane when measuring $v_2$ of reconstructed jets at mid-rapidity ($|\\eta| < 1$).

The dependence of $v_{1}$ and higher flow \r\nharmonics on system size and beam energy may be sensitive to the degrees of\r\nfreedom in the system, as a consequence of early pressure gradients and a potential softening in\r\nthe equation of state. In this talk, we present STAR measurements of $v_{1}$ for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$,\r\nprotons and antiprotons along with $v_{n}$ for charged particles from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV. A striking observation is that\r\nthe $v_1$ slope $F = dv_1 /dy$ for net protons, which is an  estimate of the directed flow contribution from baryon number transported to the midrapidity region, changes sign twice within the BES energy range. In contrast, $F$ for all other particle types is negative at all studied energies. For charged particles, we observe a local minimum in integrated ($0.2 < p_T < 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and $|\\eta| < 1.0)$ directed flow between 11.5 and 27 GeV for central 0-20\\% collisions.

The ratios of the cumulants of conserved number distributions are sensitive to the correlation length of the system created in heavy-ion collisions, hence they are considered as good observables to study phase transitions. QCD based calculations suggests that the ratios of the sixth to second ($C_{6}/C_{2}$) order cumulants of the net baryon number distributions will change rapidly in the phase transition region of the QCD phase diagram. They are found to deviate considerably from predictions of the hadron resonance gas model which reproduce the fourth to second ($C_{4}/C_{2}$) order cumulants of the net proton number distributions at RHIC top energies.\r\n \r\nThe STAR experiment, with large and uniform acceptance and excellence in particle identification, is ideal to study the QCD phase structure. The data collected in 2010 and 2011 allow us to study the $C_{6}/C_{2}$ ratio.

Both protons and anti-protons are cleanly identified within $|y|<0.5$ and 0.4$< p_{T} <$0.8 GeV/c by the STAR Time Projection Chamber. For beam energies above 39 GeV, the ratios are consistently close to but below unity, while they have larger values below 39 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The hyperon-nucleon(Y-N) interaction is of great physical interest because it introduces a new quantum number strangeness in nuclear matter. It is predicted to be the decisive interaction in some high-density matter systems, such as neutron stars [1]. RHIC, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, provides an ideal laboratory to study Y-N interaction because hyperons and nucleons are abundantly produced at high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime and decay modes of the hypertriton, the lightest hypernucleus, which consists of a proton, a neutron and the lightest hyperon Lambda, and the antimatter hypertriton discovered at RHIC[2], provide valuable insights into the Y-N interaction.\r\n\r\nThe strangeness population factor S3, defined as $\\frac{{^3_\\Lambda}H/^{3}He}{\\Lambda/p}$, is a good representation of the local correlation between baryon number and strangeness[2]. It is predicted that S3 has a different behavior in QGP and pure hadron gas[3,4] thus can be used as a tool to distinguish Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) from a pure hadronic phase.\r\n\r\nThe RHIC beam energy scan program in 2010-2011 allowed STAR to collecte data from Au+Au collisions over a broad range of energies. This provides an opportunity to study the beam energy dependence of S3. In addition, due to the beam energy independence of our lifetime measurement method, with increased statistics of present datasets, an improved result of lifetime measurement of hypertriton can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the hypertriton analysis results for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 200 GeV will be presented.

The dijet momentum balance and angular correlations are studied in detail as a function of collision centrality and leading jet transverse momentum. For the most peripheral PbPb collisions, the dijet momentum balance distributions are in good agreement with pp data and with reference calculations at the same collision energy. More central collisions show a strong imbalance between the leading and subleading jet transverse momenta, which is found to persist to the largest values of leading jet transverse momenta studied.\r\n\r\nThe flavor dependence of jet quenching is a powerful handle to discriminate models of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate the capacity of CMS to identify jets initiated by bottom quarks using displaced vertices reconstructed in the silicon tracking system.

      "Abstract": "Di-leptons serve as clean and bulk penetrating probes to study\r\nthe properties of the strongly interacting hot and dense medium\r\ncreated in heavy ion collisions. They are produced in all stages\r\nof the heavy-ion collisions and are not affected by strong\r\ninteractions, hence can probe the entire evolution of the\r\ncollision. Di-lepton production in the low mass range\r\n($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^{2}$) allows the study of vector meson\r\nin-medium properties, an observable possibly connected to chiral\r\nsymmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region\r\n($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$), di-lepton measurements serve as\r\na tool to extract the medium thermal radiation, which provides\r\ndirect information on the temperature of the early system.\r\nQuantitative studies on these properties require systematic\r\nmeasurements of di-lepton production yields as well as elliptic\r\nflow as a function of invariant mass and transverse momentum\r\n($p_T$). An extension of these studies to energy and centrality\r\ndependent measurements offer crucial information on how the\r\nsystem properties evolve with collision energies and system\r\nsizes. The STAR experiment, with its large and full azimuthal\r\nacceptance, clean electron identification over a wide momentum\r\nrange and low material environment, is very well suited to carry\r\nout systematic studies on di-lepton production.

      "Institute": "Duke Physics",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Recent results from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC have shown evidence of dramatic medium modification of di-jets. Although asymmetric di-jets are also seen in p+p collisions, di-jets with a large energy asymmetry are found much more often in Pb+Pb collisions. E.g., events with a 200 GeV leading jet and a 80 GeV subleading jet were frequently observed. The increase in the average energy asymmetry is believed to be caused by in-medium energy loss that arises from the  interaction of the colored jet constituents with the hot deconfined matter formed is the collision. The modified di-jets provide a means to study the nature of the high energy interactions of this deconfined matter. \r\n\r\nThe observed di-jet suppression has been quantified in terms of the asymmetry A_j, the ratio of the difference between the two jet energies to their sum. It is not a priori clear that this is the observable best suited to extract information about the modification of the di-jets and the nature of their interactions with the deconfined medium. Understanding the sensitivity of di-jet observables to properties of the deconfined medium and to experimental factors is vital if they are to become a useful tool for jet tomography of hot QCD matter.\r\n\r\nWe have examined the response of the di-jet asymmetry and other di-jet observables to variations in the jet modification mechanism and to variations of the observables. We present a systematic study of di-jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC using the VNI/BMS parton cascade.  VNI/BMS is a jet+medium Monte-Carlo code which provides a controllable testbed with sufficient complexity to model jet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from hydrodynamics and hadronization.   \r\n\r\nWe consider the medium modification of the di-jet asymmetry A_j and the energy distribution within the di-jets (jet shape).  Di-jets are examined under the modification of: the jet transport coefficient qhat; the path length of leading and sub-leading jets; cuts on the jet energy distributions; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism and the strong coupling constant.  We find that, while the jet asymmetry and jet shape are similarly sensitive to the in-medium path length, the jet-shape is more sensitive to the nature of the interaction with the medium and the value of q-hat than the jet asymmetry.",

We extend this algorithm to include medium-induced gluon radiation in hot and dense nuclear matter. Within this new and improved approach, we perform a detailed analysis of various ingredients affecting the final heavy flavor spectra and elliptic flow, such as the coupling strength between heavy quarks and the medium, the medium's geometric anisotropy and its flow profile, and the relative contributions from charm and bottom quarks. We demonstrate the consistency between these properties and our previous study of the thermalization behavior of heavy quarks inside the QGP. We also present simulations of heavy flavor quenching and elliptic flow, including both collisional and radiative energy loss, for RHIC and LHC experiments.",

The typical instantaneous luminosity achievable with AFTER in \\pp\\ and \\pA\\ mode~\\cite{Brodsky:2012vg} surpasses that of RHIC by more than 3~orders of magnitude  and is comparable to that of the LHC collider mode. This provides a quarkonium and heavy-flavour observatory in \\pp\\ and \\pA\\ collisions where, by instrumenting the target-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark distributions of the proton, the neutron and the nuclei can be accessed at large $x$ and even at $x$ larger than unity in the nuclear case.\r\nThe nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique opportunity to study cold nuclear matter versus the features of the hot and dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, including the formation of the quark-gluon plasma. During the one-month lead runs, \\PbA\\ collisions can be studied at a luminosity comparable to that of RHIC and the LHC over the full range of target-rapidity domain. Modern detection technology should allow for the study of quarkonium excited states, in particular the $\\chi_c$ and $\\chi_b$ resonances, even in the challenging high-multiplicity environment of \\pA\\ and \\PbA\\ collisions, magnified by the boost of the fixed-target mode.\r\nPrecise data from \\pp, \\pA\\ and \\PbA\\ should help to greatly improve our understanding of heavy-quark and quarkonium production, to clear the way to use them for gluon and heavy-quark PDF extraction in free and bound nucleons, to unravel cold from hot nuclear effects and to restore the status of heavy quarkonia as a golden test of lattice QCD in terms of dissociation temperature predictions at a \\sqrtsNN\\ where the recombination process is expected to have a small impact. The fixed-target mode also has the advantage to allow for spin measurements with polarized targets.

For the first time, a long-range correlation structure up to |delta-eta|~4 at small delta-phi (near side) is observed for such very high-pT (e.g., pT~20 GeV/c) trigger particles correlated with low-pT (a few GeV/c) associated particles. The observed long-range correlations in |delta-eta| on the near side are consistent with the single-particle azimuthal anisotropy (characterized by the Fourier harmonics, vn) of high-pT trigger particles measured relative to the event-plane angle determined with the forward hadronic calorimeters. After subtracting the vn harmonics component, the shape and yield on the near (|delta-phi| < 1) and away (|delta-phi| > 1) side of the residual dihadron correlations have been studied systematically over a wide kinematic range in trigger (12 < pT[trig] < 50 GeV/c) and associated ( 0.5 GeV/c < pT[assoc] < pT[trig]) particle pT, as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality. The results are compared to those in pp collisions at the same energy.",

      "Abstract": "The higher-order flow anisotropies of charged particles have been systematically studied by the CMS collaboration for PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2010 and 2011. Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution, ranging from the third to the sixth component, are obtained using four different analysis techniques: event plane, two- and four-particle correlations, and Lee-Yang Zeros. The results are reported as a function of the particle transverse momentum (pT) for pT = 0.5 - 20 GeV/c and collision centrality. The long-range azimuthal dihadron correlations are extensively studied with a Fourier-decomposition analysis. Using a data driven method, the extracted Fourier coefficients (up to the fifth order) are found to factorize into a product of single-particle azimuthal anisotropies up to pT~3-3.5 GeV/c for at least one particle from each pair, except for the second-order harmonics in the most central PbPb events. Based on the factorization studies, the implications of flow and non-flow effects in the long-range correlations are discussed. Comparison of higher-order harmonics derived from different techniques provides important insight on the initial-state eccentricity fluctuations and helps further constrain the transport properties of the medium.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy of charged hadrons are presented for PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV over an extended transverse momentum range up to approximately 60 GeV/c. The data were collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Utilizing a novel and unique high-pT single-track high-level trigger, the analysis explores the full 2011 PbPb data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150/ub. Anisotropy parameters (v2, v3 and v4) are extracted by correlating charged tracks with the event plane angle reconstructed using the energy deposited in the forward calorimeters. By utilizing the broad coverage of the CMS foward calorimetry, contamination from back-to-back dijets is suppressed. The results presented in this talk significantly improve on the statistical precision of previous v2 measurements for pT> 12 GeV/c, and explore for the first time the harmonic components of the azimuthal dependence in the very high pT region beyond 20 GeV/c. Beyond pT>10 GeV/c, the observed v2 values show a moderate decrease with pT, being consistent with zero only above pT~40 GeV/c and for mid-central (30-60%) collisions. A common trend in the centrality dependence of v2 is observed for particles over a wide range of pT up to approximately 48 GeV/c that is independent of pseudorapditiy, suggesting a potential connection to the initial geometry. These new data can impose quantitative constraints on the details of in-medium parton energy loss models, particularly the influence of the path length and the shape of the interaction region.",

      "Abstract": "The elliptic flow anisotropies of charged particles and neutral pions (pi0s) have been measured by the CMS collaboration for PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The second Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution are obtained using an event-plane technique for pi0s and four different analysis techniques for charged particles: event plane, two- and four-particle cumulants, and Lee-Yang Zeros. These techniques have different sensitivities to non-flow and flow fluctuation effects and their comparison helps disentangle hydrodynamic flow, initial state fluctuations and non-flow correlations. The results are presented as a function of pT, pseudorapidity, and centrality. A comparison of the CMS measurements of v2(pT) from pi0 mesons and inclusive charged particles reveals a systematic difference in the range of pT = 2.5 ~ 5 GeV/c, with the neutral pion anisotropies being weaker than those observed for inclusive charged particles. This difference indicates a particle-species dependence in the azimuthal anisotropy at the LHC. New measurements of correlations associated with mixed harmonics for charged particles are explored and discussed in terms of participant fluctuations. A systematic comparison of the LHC results to lower energy observations will also be presented.",

      "Abstract": "The exploration of the QCD phase diagram in the region of a possible phase transition between the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the hadron gas phase is one of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan(BES). One of the most important observables from high-energy nuclear collisions to study the early evolution of the expanding system is the elliptic flow $v_{2}$. At the top RHIC energy, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is interpreted as a signature of deconfinement and the formation of the QGP phase. A disappearance of the NCQ scaling is expected for a pure hadronic system at low beam energies. Hence it is a necessary signature to identify the phase transition.\r\n\r\nWe present the $v_2$ measurement at midrapidity from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 62.4 GeV for inclusive charged hadrons, light nuclei ($d$, $\\bar{d}$) and identified hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_{S}^{0}$, $p$, $\\bar{p}$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi^{-}$, $\\bar{\\Xi}^{+}$, $\\Omega^{-}$, $\\bar{\\Omega}^{+}$) up to 4 GeV/$c$ in $p_{T}$. The beam energy and centrality dependence of charged hadron $v_2$ are presented with comparison to higher energies at RHIC and LHC. The identified hadron $v_{2}$ are used to discuss the NCQ scaling for different beam energies. Significant difference in $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is observed between particles and corresponding anti-particles for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 39 GeV. These differences are more pronounced for baryons compared to mesons and they increase with decreasing energy and increasing centrality. The $v_{2}$ difference between particles and anti-particles shows an almost linear dependency with the baryon chemical potential $\\mu_{B}$. The transport model calculations of UrQMD and AMPT models are compared with the experimental data.",

We include all corrections beyond the small-x approximation, consistent with the power counting of SCETG. We demonstrate how medium recoil, geometry, expansion scenarios, and phase space cuts can be implemented numerically for phenomenological applications and quantify the effect of these uncertainties. We also prove the factorization of the medium-induced splitting from the hard process that creates the jet. We show that in the soft gluon approximation our result reduces to the parton energy loss obtained in the framework of the reaction operator approach. This limit is illustrated with an application to inclusive hadron suppression and comparison to the new ALICE and CMS results at the LHC. We discuss ongoing work on obtaining next-to-leading order splitting kernels in the medium and possible applications to heavy ion event generators.",

      "Abstract": "One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program is to search for the QCD Critical Point and the phase boundary in the QCD phase diagram. Higher moments of event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distributions have high sensitivity to the correlation length[1], and they are directly connected to the susceptibilities in the Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) calculations and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. Therefore, they are ideal tools to search for the QCD critical point[4]\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present various moments (variance [σ^2], skewness[S] and kurtosis [κ], moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants (ω3 and ω4) of net-proton and total-proton multiplicity distributions measured by the STAR detector at RHIC. The moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants are related to the volume independent susceptibility ratios. The data presented in this talk will include the measurements of centrality dependence for the net-protons and total-protons from Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. These results have been compared with a Poisson baseline. It is observed that the moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants of net-proton distributions in the 0-5% most central Au+Au collisions show significant deviations from the Poisson expectations around √sNN = 19.6 GeV. Those results will be also compared with UrQMD model calculations.\r\n\r\n[1] M. A. Stephanov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 032301 (2009); Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, \r\n052301 (2011);  C.

The first two runs at the LHC have resulted in a wealth of measurements of both reconstructed jets and single inclusive high P_T hadrons, opening new kinematic windows and offering high statistics. Yet on first glance, several observations are counter-intuitive and seem to contradict results from the RHIC high P_T program. I present a combined analysis of high P_T hadronic observables at RHIC and LHC and reconstructed jets at LHC in a framework testing a large number of theoretical models for both medium evolution and shower medium interactions against the systematics of the data. I demonstrate how a consistent picture of shower-medium interaction emerges from the combined results and explain where and why results appear counter-intuitive. In particular, I discuss the role of jet measurements in constraining models critically and suggest measurements sensitive to the gaps in our knowledge.",
