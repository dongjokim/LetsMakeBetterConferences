      "Speaker": "Jan Cepila",
      "Institute": "Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FNSPE)-Czech Technical University in Prague",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We discuss a common feature of all known reactions on nuclear targets - a significant suppression at large Feynman xF and large transverse momenta pT of produced particles. The main emphasis is devoted to production of prompt photons since they are not expected to be accompanied by any final state interaction, either energy loss or absorption. Therefore, besides the Cronin enhancement at medium pT and small isotopic corrections at larger pT, one should not expect any nuclear effects. However, data from the PHENIX experiment demonstrate a significant large-pT suppression in central d+Au and Au+Au collisions that cannot be induced by coherence phenomena. We demonstrate that such an unexpected result is subject to the energy sharing problem in multiple initial state interactions. Using the colour dipole approach we describe first the large-pT production of direct photons in the RHIC kinematic region in agreement with available data. We study also a rise of nuclear effects with rapidity(xF) caused besides corrections for energy deficit by an increasing onset of coherence phenomena. In the LHC energy range we analyze relative manifestation of these effects presenting predictions for large-pT suppression at different rapidities. We analyze also a contribution of gluon shadowing as a leading twist shadowing correction modifying nuclear effects especially at small pT.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  \r\nAlthough various features of heavy quark physics have been understood, several challenges remain. To further study the energy loss mechanism it is not only necessary to separate charm and bottom quarks but also \r\nto separate the two sources of energy loss, collisional or radiative energy loss.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution we present a method for extracting the difference between collisional and radiative energy loss of heavy quarks.\r\nBy analyzing separated bottom and charm contributions to the heavy quark spectrum one can gain information about the relative strength of radiative and collisional energy loss. \r\n\r\nThis talk will give a detailed explanation of how one can separate this information experimentally and what we can learn from this analysis with respect to heavy quark energy loss. By using existing experimental data we will constrain the parameter space of energy loss physics and rule out several model parametrizations. \r\n\r\nA systematic parameter check with regard to RHIC data is carried out and perspectives for RHIC upgrades and the LHC will be presented.",

Although the colliding systems are smaller than compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy leads to multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. The high energy densities reached in LHC collisions might create a deconfined state of matter even in elementary reactions.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Direct photons in low pT region have been of great interest for a long time since thermal photons from Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are considered to contribute predominantly.\r\nAttempts to measure low pT direct photons using EMCals could not succeed since a finite energy resolution of the EMCal prevents us from separating direct photon signal from a large amount of background of hadron decay photons, particularly pi0.\r\n\r\nRecently, the PHENIX experiment demonstrated that direct photon yield can be obtained even in low pT region via the di-electron measurement since direct photon internal conversions make enhanced yield of di-electrons over the known hadron decay contributions.\r\nComparing direct photon yields in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200~$GeV p+p and Au+Au collisions, a significant excess over the binary scaled p+p result is seen in Au+Au for pT<3GeV/c.\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be confirmed that the observed excess of direct photons is not due to nuclear effects such as Cronin effect, nuclear anti-shadowing and so on, since nuclear effects are involved in Au+Au collisions but not in p+p collisions.\r\nd+Au collision data can contribute to quantify nuclear effects on direct photon production.\r\nThe latest results of low pT direct photons from d+Au data taken in the Year-2008 RHIC Run will be shown.",

      "Institute": "Universita degli Studi di Bari-Universita & INFN, Bari for ALICE ITS Collaboration",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are fundamental probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter\r\nformed at the extreme energy densities reached in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC. The heavy quark pairs (cc_bar\r\nand bb_bar), which are produced in the very initial stage of the collision, come out from the interaction\r\nregion as hadrons, possibly as a part of a jet, and carry out information about the properties of the\r\ntraversed medium. Such information can be obtained from the study of the open charm and beauty\r\nhadrons in the final state and of the associated jet. Charm and beauty hadrons decay weakly with a mean\r\nfree path of the order of few hundred microns. Therefore, their identification relies on the possibility of\r\nresolving a decay vertex at distances of such order from the production one. The inner tracker of the ALICE\r\nexperiment (ITS), made of six layers of silicon detectors, has been designed and built to this purpose and is\r\nproviding the first results on the above mentioned item, though with some limitations. A detector based on\r\ntoday\u2019s frontier technologies would certainly offer new exciting possibilities within the physics scope\r\ndescribed above.\r\nThis contribution will present the studies on the upgrade of the ALICE ITS detector. At the moment, several\r\npossible scenarios for the new detector layout and technologies are being considered. With respect to the\r\ncurrent ITS, the baseline idea for the upgraded tracker is to have a detection layer closer to the beam line\r\n(which implies a beam pipe with smaller radius) and a larger number of layers instrumented with silicon\r\npixels. The track position resolution at the primary vertex could be improved by a factor 2\u20133.\r\n Besides the natural improvement of the measurement capabilities on the channels already well measured\r\nwith the present ITS, the upgraded ITS will offer the possibility of exploring new physics items. Examples are\r\nthe heavy flavor baryons, the exclusive decay channels of B-mesons, the production mechanisms of\r\nhadrons containing more than one heavy quark.",

      "Abstract": "The compressed baryonic matter (CBM) experiment at the future FAIR accelerator center in Darmstadt, Germany, aims at the investigation of baryonic matter at highest net baryon densities but moderate temperatures, by colliding heavy-ions at beam energies from 10 to 45 A GeV. The research program comprises the exploration of  basic landmarks of the QCD phase diagram like transitions from hadronic to partonic phase, the region of first order de-confinement as well as chiral phase transition, and the critical end point. The proposed key observables include the measurement of low mass vector mesons and charmonia, which can be detected via their decay into the di-lepton channel. As the  leptons leave the hot and dense fireball without further interactions, hence they provide almost unscathed information about the interior of the collision zone where they are being created. In this paper, we discuss the physics motivation, detector concepts, and the feasibility studies of the di-muon measurements for central Au + Au collisions, with a special reference to the detailed simulation activities performed by the CBM muon group.",

We show that already with a subsample of the 2010 data, thanks to excellent tracking system and particle identification capabilities of the ALICE experiment, the charmed hadron measurements in the mid-rapidity region can be extended down to pT~2 GeV/c, with good prospects to reach pT~1 GeV/c or below using the full sample.

Contrary to the naive expectation, it is the deflection of both the jet shower and the Mach-cone-like excitation in an expanding medium that is found to give rise to a double-peak azimuthal particle distribution with respect to the initial jet direction. Such a deflection is the strongest for hadron-triggered jets which are often produced close to the surface of a dense medium due to trigger bias and travel against or tangential to the radial flow. Without such trigger bias, the effect of deflection on \u03b3-jet showers and their medium excitation is weaker. Comparative study of hadron and \u03b3-triggered particle correlations can therefore reveal the dynamics of jet-induced medium excitation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.",

We can divide space into cells to create a lattice of partons, or describe the transformation of energy via the Cooper-Frye formula, but in these cases we miss some dynamical aspects.\r\n\r\nThat is why I will present a study of the expansion and the phase transition with a QCD inspired model : the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. This model is particularly useful to describe quark matter at low temperature (below \u039b_QCD). It provides an effective mass at finite (T,\u03bc), and then cross sections and decay widths for hadrons (possible mixed phase).\r\n\r\nRecent results are presented using these data within a Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) code. This code is designed for local interactions at finite (T,\u03bc). It is a fully relativistic code which is Lorentz invariant and avoids the No Interaction Theorem in a different way than previous similar attempts.\r\n\r\nFinally we know that there are correlations inside the plasma before the phase transition. We discuss how this scenario can be modeled with these tools to understand this transition in detail and to find observables which distinguish between the different approaches.",

      "Institute": "Arkansas State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Radiative processes and dynamical screening are important for a precise description of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. When evolutions from inside-outside and thermal initial conditions are compared, the parton system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is found to be able to overcome expansion and move toward thermalization via parton collisions. Scaling behaviors show up in both the pressure anisotropy and the energy density evolutions. In particular, the pressure anisotropy evolution shows an approximate coupling constant scaling when radiative processes are included. It approaches an asymptotic time evolution on a time scale of 1 to 2 fm/c. The energy density evolution approaches an asymptotic time evolution that decreases slower than the ideal hydro evolution. These observations indicate that partial thermalization can be achieved and viscosity is important for the evolution during the early longitudinal expansion phase of a relativistic heavy ion collision.\r\n\r\nRadiative processes are the driving force behind gluon chemical equilibration. The effects of these processes, or of chemical equilibration, on kinetic equilibration can be studied by comparing the evolution with only the elastic process to that including radiative processes. When the initial condition is close to chemical equilibrium, the opening up of the inelastic channels leads to more kinetic equilibration. If the initial condition is highly undersaturated, the additional production of particles quickly leads to smaller cross sections that counteract the increase in the particle number. Then kinetic equilibration is less sensitive to whether there are radiative processes. On the other hand, kinetic equilibration also affects chemical equilibration. As expected, when there are only elastic processes, the system goes farther and farther away from chemical equilibrium. It is interesting to see that systems with the same initial fugacity but different initial pressure anisotropies have different early fugacity evolutions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the interplay between chemical equilibration and kinetic equilibration, the pressure anisotropy difference evolution for systems starting from different initial pressure anisotropies is studied to gain better insight into the approach to the asymptotic evolution. The difference evolution is found to follow an exponential proper time dependence after a short period of time. In the case that includes radiative processes, the larger the coupling constant or the larger the initial energy density, the faster the difference decreases. The evolution curves for different coupling constants and initial energy densities appear to come from the same point. Pressure anisotropy evolutions from thermal initial conditions and Color Glass Condensate motivated initial conditions are compared to study the effects of initial particle momentum distribution. Radiative processes are again shown to make a big difference in system evolution. When only the gluon elastic process is included, kinetic equilibration is sensitive to the initial momentum distribution. If radiative processes are included, the pressure anisotropy evolution is robust against changes in the initial momentum distribution.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nParton radiative processes and pressure isotropization in relativistic heavy ion collisions, Bin Zhang, Warner A.

      "Abstract": "The fast thermalization of Quark Gluon Plasma, as suggested by hydrodynamical simulation, is one of the central questions of heavy ion collisions. Theoretical understanding of the mechanism involves field theory out of equilibrium. While the perturbative method becomes less effective due to the strong coupling, the gauge/gravity duality can play an important role. In [1], we studied a gravitational collapse model, which is dual to an equilibration process of a homogeneous QGP. We found that the near-equilibrium correlators of different operators approach their thermal counterpart in a universal fashion. As a first step to explore the far from equilibrium regime, we studied a model with a moving mirror in AdS space [2]. We solved the spatially integrated time-dependent correlator in the dual field theory and found that the singularities of the correlator are consistent with the bulk-cone singularities conjecture [3]. Furthermore, we found a recursive relation among the leading order divergence of the singularities, which allow us to determine the divergences without solving the correlator explicitly [4].

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A new framework of highly-anisotropic hydrodynamics is introduced [1] that includes dissipation effects. Dissipation is defined by the form of the entropy source that depends on the pressure anisotropy and vanishes for the isotropic fluid. With a simple ansatz for the entropy source obeying general physical requirements, we are led to a non-linear equation describing the time evolution of the anisotropy in purely-longitudinal boost-invariant systems. Matter that is initially highly anisotropic approaches naturally the regime of the perfect fluid. Thus, the resulting evolution agrees with the expectations about the behavior of matter produced at the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equilibration is identified with the processes of entropy production. For purely longitudinal, boost-invariant expansion with small anisotropy, the proposed model agrees with the Israel-Stewart theory and Martinez-strickland model [2,3,4]. However, the model is designed\r\n to describe highly anisotropic systems where the standard dissipative hydrodynamics is not applicable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed model of isotropization may be also used to describe non-boost-invariant systems [5] and boost-invariant systems with asymmetric transverse expansion [6]. In the latter case, we find that as long as the initial energy density profile is unchanged the calculated soft hadronic observables remain practically the same. This result indicates the insensitivity of the analyzed observables to the initial pressure anisotropy and suggests that the complete thermalization of the system may be delayed to easily acceptable times of about 1 fm/c. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

The presence of partonic phase leads to larger suppression of 'far-side' correlations which agrees with available data. We find also a fair description of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons as a function of the energy of the reaction, its centrality and the transverse momentum pT within PHSD approach. Furthermore, an approximate quark-number scaling of the elliptic flow v2 of hadrons is observed in the PHSD results, too.

      "Abstract": "The Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment consists of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors, exploiting three different technologies:  pixel detectors for the innermost 2 layers, drift detectors for the two central layers and double sided strip detectors for the last two layers. Each layer has hermetic structure in r-phi  and it is coaxial with the beam pipe. The ITS covers the pseudorapidity range |eta|<0.9  and its distance from the nominal beam line ranges from 3.9 cm for the innermost layer up to 43 cm for the outermost. The overall number of independent sensors is 2198 and the spatial alignment of the ITS requires the determination of about 13000 parameters.  The ITS main functions are those of providing both primary and secondary vertices reconstruction, of improving the ALICE barrel tracking capabilities in the vicinity of the interaction point and of improving the momentum resolution at high pT. Furthermore, as a standalone tracker, the ITS recovers particles which are missed by the external barrel detector, due to acceptance limitations.\r\nAfter a short summary on the status of spatial alignment and detector calibration, this talk will cover the ITS performance with p-p and Pb-Pb collisions in 2010 for what concerns vertexing and tracking.",

A first measurement of the cross section was performed with electrons identified by the ALICE Time Projection Chamber and the Time-of-Flight detector. The Transition Radiation Detector provides a major contribution to the identification of electrons and allows to extend the inclusive electron spectrum up to transverse momenta around 10 GeV/c. During the data taking in 2010, 7 out of 18 supermodules were installed, covering 340\u00b0 < \u03c6 < 40\u00b0 and 140\u00b0 < \u03c6 < 220\u00b0 and |\u03b7| < 0.9.

      "Abstract": "Nonperturbative particle production via the Schwinger mechanism has been studied as a mechanism of matter formation in the context of heavy-ion collisions. In the color flux model, the generation of longitudinal color-electric fields between two Lorentz-contracted nuclei receding from each other has been assumed. These electric fields polarize the vacuum and produce quarks and gluons. Also in the framework of the color glass condensate, the formation of longitudinal electric fields and longitudinal magnetic fields as well has been predicted. One of characteristics of these electric fields is its boost-invariance in the longitudinal beam direction. In an ideal situation where two nuclei run at exactly the speed of light, the electric fields span only inside the forward light cone and their configuration is symmetric under the longitudinal boost transformation. \r\n\r\nWe study the dynamics of nonperturbative particle pair creation in such boost-invariantly expanding electric fields. The proper-time evolution of momentum distributions of created particles, which preserve the boost invariance of the background field, will be presented. The particles have the same velocity distributions as the flow velocity of the Bjorken flow from the first instance they are created. \r\n\r\nWe will also present the results on the calculation of the two-particle correlation between particles produced in the boost-invariant field. The correlation is short-range with respect to the transverse momentum, which originates in the Bose-Einstein correlation, and is long-range with respect to the longitudinal rapidity. This long-range rapidity correlation arises because the particles are created not as an eigenstate of a longitudinal momentum, which violates the boost-symmetry, but as a superposition of several momentum modes preserving the boost-symmetry.",

We argue that via the interaction of the produced streams the spatial anisotropy is translated into an anisotropy of the collective expansion of the bulk matter. This is demonstrated with the help of a simple toy model. The effect is estimated to be potentially responsible for about 25% of the observed elliptic flow at the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "One of the issues in hot/dense QCD is to understand the state \r\nof matter in the vicinity of phase transition from hadronic \r\nmatter to quark matter expected to be created in heavy-ion collisions, or to be present in the interior of compact stars. \r\nIn nuclear physics, a scalar meson plays an essential role as \r\nknown from Walecka model that works fairly well for phenomena \r\nnear nuclear matter density. On the other hand, at high density, the relevant Lagrangian that has correct symmetry is the linear sigma model, and the scalar needed there is the sigma that is the fourth component of the chiral four-vector. Thus in order to \r\nprobe highly hot/dense matter, we have to figure out how the \r\nchiral scalar at low temperature/density transmutes to the fourth component of the four-vector.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we introduce a chiral scalar as a dilaton associated\r\nwith broken conformal symmetry and responsible for the trace anomaly of QCD and discuss the properties of nuclear matter at \r\nhigh density [1]. As the \"dilaton limit\" is taken, which drives a system from nuclear matter density to near chiral restoration density, a linear sigma model emerges from the highly nonlinear\r\nstructure with the omega meson decoupling from the nucleons.\r\nA striking prediction of this procedure is that as the dilaton limit is approached as density increases, the omega-nucleon interaction known to be repulsive at low density gets strongly suppressed at high density. The omega-mediated short-range repulsion gets also suppressed. This occurs in the rho-meson exchanged repulsion too. Consequently the symmetry energy which plays a crucial role in the structure of compact stars gets suppressed. An immediate consequence would be that the equation \r\nof state (EoS) of dense matter will be softened at high density \r\nand would accommodate the EoS without any exotica consistent with the recent measurement of a 2-solar-mass neutron star.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Chihiro Sasaki, Hyun Kyu Lee, Won-Gi Paeng and Mannque Rho,\r\n    \"Conformal anomaly and the vector coupling in dense matter,\"\r\n    arXiv:1103.0184 [hep-ph].",

A thermal field theory approach enables the direct evaluation of the source term from the divergence of the QCD energy momentum tensor.  This approach is more general than previously used Boltzmann transport techniques and allows for the coupling of realistic external quark and gluon currents to the Lagrangian of soft QCD matter.  Specifically, I consider for the first time the medium response to back-to-back jets and jets + medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung.  The calculation includes the effects of quantum interference between the interactions of the multiple fast partons with the medium, and demonstrates that the energy absorbed by the medium is enhanced in a non-trivial way due to the presence and formation time of medium induced radiation.  The numerical results suggest that the use of such realistic external currents has important implications for the shockwave formation in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC and soft-to-intermediate transverse momentum particle correlation phenomenology.",

At leading order the result obtained is two coupled hydro-like differential equations for the momentum-space anisotropy and typical momentum of the degrees of freedom. Within this framework, we get both the ideal hydrodynamic and free streaming expansion as asymptotic limits.

In ultra-peripheral collisions, with impact parameters larger than the sum of the nuclear radii, hadronic interactions are strongly suppressed but the cross sections for electromagnetic or photon-induced interactions are large. The interactions can be purely electromagnetic (two-photon interaction) or a photon from the field of one of the nuclei may interact with the other nucleus (photonuclear interaction). Exclusive interactions, where both nuclei remain in their ground state, are dominated by coherent photonuclear vector meson production and two-photon production of di-lepton pairs. \r\n\r\nDuring the heavy-ion run at the LHC in 2010 where Pb-Pb collisions at an energy of sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV were studied, the ALICE Experiment had triggers enabled for exclusive particle production in ultra-peripheral collisions. These included trigger information from the Time-of-Flight, Silicon Pixel, and V0 Detectors. A trigger for ultra-peripheral collisions was also enabled in the muon arm. The integrated luminosity for the ultra-peripheral triggers corresponds to about 3.6 microb^-1. Results on photoproduction of rho0 and J/Psi from the data collected with these triggers will be presented. \r\n\r\nCoherent rho0 production at mid-rapidity at the LHC corresponds to a photon-nucleon center of mass energy of 45 GeV, roughly a factor of 4 higher than has been studied before.

However, the derivation and the correct interpretation of the Tsallis-Renyi parameter are still unsolved questions.\r\n\r\nWe investigated several models to discover the non-extensive phenomena behind hadronization. Here we present our results for (i) a possible microcanonical generalization of the Tsallis distribution in e+e- collision, and (ii) the original Tallis Pareto-like distribution including QCD evolution ansatz for the hadronization process.",

      "Abstract": "Predictions and postdictions from viscous hydrodynamics for the transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow for unidentified and identified charged hadrons from Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies, including their centrality dependence, will be presented. These predictions are based on a global viscous hydrodynamic fit of soft hadron spectra and their anisotropies measured in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, using a state-of-the-art equation of state, which accurately reproduces the observed charged hadron, pion and proton spectra and their differential v_2(p_T) for all collision centralities in the range p_T<2 GeV. Assuming the same specific effective shear viscosity eta/s=0.20 for KLN initial conditions at RHIC and LHC, we obtain a good description of the soft charged hadron spectra in central Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt{s}=2.76 A TeV, but slightly overpredict the integrated charged hadron elliptic flow in measured by the ALICE Collaboration in non-central Pb+Pb collisions. We explore whether and how this can be remedied by allowing for a temperature dependent change of the specific shear viscosity eta/s of the quark-gluon plasma in the newly explored higher temperature region probed at the LHC. In doing so, we expose a need for a more quantitative understanding of the early pre-equilibrium stage. Future comparisons of spectra and elliptic flow for identified hadrons at both sqrt{s}=2.76 and 5.5 A TeV with predictions presented in this talk will allow to further test the validity of the viscous hydrodynamic model and will shed additional light on possible variations of the quark-gluon transport coefficients between RHIC and LHC energies.",

Summation over\r\nthe equations for all components leads to an effective relaxation-type one-component equation for\r\nthe total system. In this equation the effective shear viscosity (or alternatively the $\\eta/s$\r\nratio) of the whole system is related to the partial shear pressures and cannot be considered as an\r\nexternal parameter. We demonstrate that in order to describe hydrodynamic behaviour of a\r\nmulti-component system as a whole it is essential to solve hydrodynamic equations for each\r\ncomponent, instead of treating a mixture as an effective one-component system with the free\r\nparameters $\\eta/s$ and initial time [1]. This conclusion is confirmed by comparisons of solutions\r\nof the new hydrodynamic equations with results of kinetic transport simulations, which demonstrate\r\na very good agreement between the two approches. Thus, extractions of the $\\eta/s$ value of the QGP\r\nat RHIC and LHC have to be reexamined.

      "Abstract": "For the first time, the generation of the directed flow of particles emitted from the fireball created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC is  described using a 3+1D hydrodynamical model. The initial fireball density is constructed as a sum of contributions from forward and backward going participants. This asymmetry in the \r\nemission from the individual participants leads to a tilt of the source. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed negative directed flow in a wide range of central pseudorapidities and reproduces correctly the  scaling of the directed flow when going from Au-Au to Cu-Cu systems [1]. We also propose to measure the thermalization time in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions using the directed flow of particles. We show that the directed flow\r\nis a very sensitive measure of the pressure equilibration in the first fm/c of the evolution. We demonstrate in hydrodynamic calculations that the directed flow is strongly reduced in the presence of even a very  short pressure anisotropy. Our calculations show that the system must thermalize fast (<0.25fm/c). This suggests that the matter behaves as a strongly coupled system already at the first stages [2]. \r\n\r\n[1] P. Bozek and I.

      "Abstract": "Fluctuations in the initial geometry of a nucleus-nucleus\r\ncollision have been recently shown to produce the correlation\r\nstructures known as ``ridge\" and ``shoulder\". These event-by-event\r\nfluctuations result in new types of anisotropic flow, such as\r\ntriangular flow $v_3$ and a new type of directed flow $v_1$,\r\nwhich, unlike the usual directed flow, is also present at\r\nmidrapidity. The anisotropic flows due to the fluctuations in the\r\ninitial density profile result in different reference angles\r\n$\\Psi_n$ for every harmonic $n$, which are not necessarily\r\ncorrelated with the event plane angle $\\Psi_2$ (the elliptic flow\r\nreference angle), used by the experimentalists to measure the\r\nanisotropic flows, as $v_1$, $v_2$ and $v_4$. Unlike triangular\r\nflow, this new $v_1$ has not been studied in a hydrodynamic\r\nframework.\r\n\r\nThis work is based on the first quantitative predictions for this\r\nnew $v_1$ in Au-Au collisions at the top RHIC energy, using the\r\nhydrodynamic code NEXSPheRIO. NEXSPheRIO solves the relativistic\r\nideal hydrodynamics using initial conditions provided by the event\r\ngenerator NeXus, providing good description for several\r\nobservables, like elliptic flow. Shear viscosity is not\r\nimplemented in this computation, though its effect should be\r\nsmaller than higher harmonics, for instance $v_2$.\r\n\r\nFirst, we compute this new $v_1$ versus transverse momentum and\r\ncentrality for Au-Au collisions at RHIC using the hydrodynamic\r\ncode NeXSPheRIO. Even without dedicated analysis of this new\r\n$v_1$, indirect evidence has been obtained from recent STAR\r\ncorrelation data, and we compared our results with those inferred\r\ndata, finding remarkable agreement.\r\n\r\nAs the fluctuations in the initial geometry break the symmetry of\r\nthe initial density profile, there will be one direction where the\r\nprofile is steepest. This effect can be quantified by the\r\nmagnitude dipole asymmetry $\\varepsilon_1$, and by the steepest\r\ndirection for a smooth profile $\\Phi_1$. For smooth initial\r\nconditions, one expects $\\Psi_1=\\Phi_1$ and $v_1\\propto\r\n\\varepsilon_1$ in each event. We compute those features for our\r\nbumpy initial conditions and compare with the directed flow\r\nquantities.  We find that the event plane of $v_1$ is correlated\r\nwith the angle of the initial dipole of the distribution, as\r\npredicted, though with a large dispersion, but it is uncorrelated\r\nwith the reaction plane. This shows that the dipole asymmetry is\r\nindeed the mechanism to create $v_1$.\r\n\r\nReference: arXiv:1103.4605",

The pQCD cut-off value p0(s) is constrained by Au+Au collisions data from RHIC. Data on charged hadron multiplicity and charged hadron nuclear modification factor (RAA) in central (0-5%) Pb+Pb collisions from the ALICE experiment at the LHC are used to constrain the main parameters of the \"jet quenching\" phenomena (energy loss and mean free path of initial  parton-parton interactions). Predictions for the energy and centrality dependence of rapidity densities (2dNch/dy/Npart) and the hadron flavor dependence(mesons and baryons) of the nuclear modification factor RAA are presented. By studying baryon/meson ratios, we show that the jet quenching in central collisions suppresses the hard pQCD component of the particle spectra, thereby exposing a novel component of baryon dynamics that we attribute to (gluonic) baryon-anti-baryon junctions (JJbar). We predict that a baryon/mesons anomaly at intermediate transverse momentum values will persist at LHC energies, with a moderate centrality dependence.\r\n\r\n(*) This work is being supported by NSERC (Canada) and by the \r\n    US Department of Energy.",

We extrapolate our results to predict the CNM effects on $J/\\psi$ production in Au+Au collisions and compare with the PHENIX results.

Our calculations, in particular, show that the v1-flow, which was rather weak at RHIC and SPS, becomes stronger at LHC. Another even more important change in the v1 behaviour with respect to the similar simulations for RHIC [2] is that the v1 now peaks in the \"forward\" direction [3], i.e. positive v1 peak appears now at positive rapidity, and correspondingly negative peak at negative rapidity, contrary to what was observed at RHIC. \r\n\r\nHowever, it also appears that v1 flow is extremely sensitive to the initial state fluctuations, due to the sharp change around y=0.\r\nOne has to take into account that the Center of Mass (CM) rapidity is not exactly the same for all collisions, due to random fluctuations in the initial state, where the numbers of participant nucleons from projectile and target may not be exactly the same. This leads to considerable y_{CM} fluctuations at large impact parameters, where the flow asymmetry is the strongest, while total number of participants is the smallest. \r\n\r\nTo analyze the consequences of these fluctuations, we assumed a Gaussian \r\ny_{CM} distribution, centered at y_{CM}=0, with variance of 1 or 2 units of rapidity. Such fluctuations strongly reduce v1(y) at central rapidities, however, it still stays large enough to be observed and to demonstrate the \"rotation effect\" discussed above [3].\r\n\r\nIt is also important to take into account experimental rapidity cuts of ALICE detector.

      "Abstract": "The azimuthal correlation of produced particles in the reaction plane or elliptic flow in heavy ion collision is a sensitive probe to (i) degree of thermalization  (ii) transport coefficient and (iii) the equation of state (EoS) of the medium. Recently, ALICE collaboration measured   (differential) elliptic flow in \u221as=2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collision [1]. We have analyzed the elliptic flow data to obtain an estimate of viscosity to entropy ratio $\\eta$/s  at LHC energy. Details can be found in [2]. In Israel-Stewart's second order theory of hydrodynamics, we have simulated elliptic flow in   2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. We have assumed that initial Pb+Pb collisions produces a \r\nQGP fluid which thermalizes in the time scale, $\\tau_i$=0.6 fm/c. Hydrodynamical evolution of the fluid is governed by a lattice motivated equation of state with confinement-deconfinement cross-over transition at Tc=174 MeV. The initial condition of the fluid was fixed to reproduce ALICE measurements for charged particles multiplicity in 0-5% collisions. Ideal QGP fluid require rather large initial energy density, ei=90 GeV/fm^3. Initial energy density is reduced if the fluid is viscous, e.g. ei =78, 70, 60 GeV/fm^3 for viscosity to entropy ratio \u03b7/s=0.08, 0.12 and 0.16 respectively.  ALICE data for charged particles elliptic flow in 20-30%, 30-40% and 40-50% collision are best explained for fluid viscosity \u03b7/s=0.08. In very central 10-20% collisions however, ALICE data prefer ideal fluid rather than a viscous fluid.  We conclude that     nearly perfect fluid is consistent with the ALICE data for elliptic flow in  2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] K.Aamodt et al. arXiv: 1011.3914[nucl-ex].\r\n[2] Victor Roy and A.K.

In this talk, we will utilize the elliptic flow (v2) as a tool to address phase boundary issue. The v2 reflects the early collision dynamics [1]. Using transport models AMPT [2] and UrQMD [3], we study the energy dependence of the identified hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions. While in high-energy collisions where hadrons are formed dominantly via the process of parton coalescence, we find the observed number of quark scaling in v2 [1] for all hadrons, the violation of the scaling is evident for collisions at lower energies where the hadronic interactions become dominant. Due to the high baryon density, the violation is particularly strong for the case of proton and anti-proton. In this talk we will discuss the boundaries of the region of beam energy, above which partonic interactions clearly dominate and below which hadronic interactions dominate. Other thermodynamic parameters, extracted around the energy region, like freeze-out temperature and baryonic chemical potential will also be discussed. \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] J.

The analysis of correlations and fluctuations in the relativistic nuclear collisions addresses fundamental aspects of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and, therefore, to the properties of strongly-interacting matter at extreme density and temperature.\r\nIn this work we present the study of correlations between physical quantities describing the behaviour of different charged particle types providing information on the formation of a new phase of the highly excited and dense nuclear matter. In this analysis were used the experimental results obtained in Au-Au and proton-proton collisions at   with the BRAHMS experiment at RHIC. Using the usual methods from statistics and probability theory, we introduce a linear correlation coefficient for the longitudinal and transverse momentum components and for rapidity and transverse momentum for all charged particles ( , ,   and  ) produced and detected with the BRAHMS experiment. For proving the existence of anomalous states in nuclear matter, unusual correlations between the longitudinal and transverse momenta should be observed in the rapidity range -0.1 < y < 3.5.  It is, also, proposed that the change in pT spectra at high rapidities could be one of the possible signals of QGP formation. These results are compared with others obtained in a large energy range, from the JINR Dubna Synchrophasotron, up to CERN SPS, for symmetric and asymmetric collisions. Interesting anomal states of the nuclear matter can be observed.",

      "Abstract": "Substantial collective flow is observed in collisions between Lead nuclei at LHC as evidenced by the azimuthal correlations in the transverse momentum distributions of the produced particles.\r\n\r\nWe perform simulations [1] of the Pb+Pb heavy ion collisions at LHC at 1.38 + 1.38 TeV/nucl within the three module model. The initial stages of the reaction, before the thermal equilibrium is reached, are simulated in terms of effective string rope model [2], based on longitudinally expanding strings of the color-magnetic field.  The produced initial state is tilted, and, thus, the direction of the largest pressure gradient is pointing in the \"anti-flow\" direction, what resulted in anti-flow peaks in simulations for RHIC and SPS [3]. However, one should not forget that this initial state also has a flow velocity distribution, which tends to further rotate it, and, thus, the direction of the strongest pressure gradient will change with time. The intermediate stages of the reaction are simulated with a (3+1)-dimensional fluid dynamical model, using the Particle in Cell (PIC) method adapted to ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The matter expands until it reaches freeze-out, which is treated in the third module of our model.  \r\n\r\nThe resulting elliptic flow, v2, is in reasonable agreement with the data [4]. Furthermore, our calculations also indicate that the v1-flow, which was rather weak at RHIC and SPS, and peaked at negative rapidities (named as 3rd flow component or anti-flow), now at LHC is expected to peak at forward rapidities (at the same side and direction as the projectile residue), and it may become stronger [1].\r\n\r\nThus, v1-flow provides a sensitive barometer to estimate the pressure and transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.  In order to better study the transverse momentum flow dependence we suggest a new \"symmetrized v1s\" flow component, and make predictions for it.\r\n\r\n[1] L.P. Csernai, V.K. Magas, H.

      "Abstract": "CMS was designed and optimized to record high luminosity pp collisions. Its powerful DAQ and trigger systems are normally configured to handle very high frequency of relatively low multiplicity pp events. To reduce data volume the CMS sub-detectors are read out using zero suppression algorithms optimized for pp. \r\n\r\nThe large multiplicities expected in PbPb collisions required a different optimization of the zero suppression algorithms. The optimization could only be done after the data was taken. To make sure that the collected data is of highest quality the CMS collaboration decided to disable the zero suppression algorithms for the silicon strip tracker and the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters for the duration of the first PbPb run. This resulted in event size of about 12MB of data, corresponding to about 11 million channels recorded for each event. CMS was recording data at up to 180 Hz and with a bandwidth to tape of over 2GB/s, well beyond of what it was designed for (more than 6 times the data volume per second recorded during the pp running). \r\n\r\nThe excellent luminosity delivered by the LHC required that CMS trigger system reduces the rate of minimum bias events written to tape while maintaining the rate of interesting physics events. The trigger algorithms operating at Level-1 and High Level Trigger were optimized to provide maximum selectivity and data writing rates for jets, muons and photons. The fraction of minimum bias events was adjusted during running to maximize the available bandwidth. \r\n\r\nIn just few weeks CMS collected about 890 TB of data. After the run was over, CMS developed a new zero suppression algorithms optimized for heavy ions and the data was compressed offline to about 190TB. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will present the CMS configuration during the 2010 PbPb run, describe the detailed performance of the CMS DAQ and trigger system and the subsequent offline compression processing.",

Z boson reconstruction in the electron channel is challenging due to the complexity of electron reconstruction in the high-occupancy environment of heavy-ion (HI) collisions. The reconstruction of electrons in CMS uses information from the pixel detector, the silicon strip tracker and the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The measurement of electron energy in the ECAL is degraded by the significant tracker material in front of the calorimeter, and by the presence of a strong magnetic field aligned with the beam axis, giving an azimuthal spread of electromagnetic clusters within the ECAL. Despite this challenging reconstruction environment, we are able to reconstruct electrons with dedicated heavy ion tracking and tuned clustering algorithms. The performance of electron reconstruction in Pb-Pb collisions is presented. In particular, the Z measurement in the di-electron channel is presented as a first observation and a main result of electron reconstruction in HI collisions.",

One of\r\nthe possible explanations is the scaling of the dynamical fluctuations with average kaon multiplicity. In order to study this hypothesis one would like to fix the acceptance of the detector and measure the event-by-event fluctuations as a function of centrality at fixed beam energy.\r\nIn this poster, the centrality dependence of event-by-event fluctuations of K/pi, p/pi and K/p ratios measured by the NA49 experiment in Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV will be presented. For all considered ratios, dynamical fluctuations are found to increase in absolute value by 7 - 10% with decreasing centrality. Comparing the centrality and energy dependence of the particle ratio fluctuations, they are found to scale with the particle number dominating the fluctuation measure. I.e. in particular the event-by-event K/pi fluctuations are found to scale with the number of kaons. For p/pi fluctuations the observed scaling supports the interpretation that the measured dynamical fluctuations are a remnant of nucleon resonance feeddown.

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "The origin of the hadron mass has been drawing strong interests in nuclear and particle physics. Especially in QCD, mass of hadrons is composed of a sum of the effective mass of valence quarks, known as constituent quark mass, and their interaction term. According to theoretical models, the effective mass of valence quarks is determined by chiral property of QCD vacuum. This mechanism is understood as a consequence of the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. In hot and/or dense matter, this broken symmetry will be restored either partially or completely and, hence, properties of hadrons, such as mass, decay modes and life time, can be modified. Therefore, we can study the origin of hadron mass and chiral properties of QCD medium by measuring in-medium properties of mesons. Especially, mass spectra of vector mesons are directly connected to anti-quark quark condensates, which is an order parameter of chiral symmetry. Thus, it is important to measure mass spectra of vector mesons in QCD medium, such as Quark Gluon Plasma or nuclear matter. \r\nEven at nuclear matter density, relatively large mass modification is predicted and several experimental efforts using cold nucleus targets are already performed. Among these activities, KEK-E325 reported significant mass modifications for rho and phi mesons and CLAS G7 experiment report only mass broadening for rho meson. Obtained results are different and physics behind these experimental results are not clearly understood. \r\nTo understand the physics, clear and high statistics experimental data are essential. We are preparing new experiments to obtain such data at J-PARC. One experiment is an upgrade of E325 and aims to collect 100 times larger statistics in phi going to e+e- decays. Another experiment focus on exclusive measurements of stopped omega meson in nucleus. \r\nIn this poster, we will report on details of two experiments and results of detector R&D.",

Our  derivation is based on the renormalization group method[3] as a powerful reduction theory of the dynamics. We have identified some drawbacks in our previous derivation \r\nof the casusal equations[4]. Our improved equation is a natural extension of the first-order equation derived by the present authors.[1] The relaxation times derived in our microscopic theory \r\nhave forms which can be nicely interpreted in terms of correlation functions. Our equation in any local rest frame including the particle frame has a definite stable thermal equilibrium state and \r\nis completely free from the instability problem. \r\n Our equation in the energy-frame is found quite different from the one by Denicol et al [5] which is derived on the basis of a moment method; but our equation can be well approximated\r\nby it when the Rits approximatin is valid for a rarefied gas. On the basis of our derivation, we propose the correct moment method for the derivation of causal hydrodynamic equations without \r\nad-hoc ansatz.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] K. Tsumura, T.

In the low mass region, hadronic thermal emission is evaluated assuming vector meson dominance including in-medium modifications of the rho meson spectral function through scattering from nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the hadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes. Emission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken into account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic description breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed. In this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport models. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from long-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass region of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different thermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is discussed.",

Charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of hadron gas with unit charged particles [1,2]. The study of charge fluctuations have been carried out by using the variable, \u03bd+-,dyn [3] which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias, i.e., impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of charged particles within the detector acceptance.  The dependence of charge fluctuations on the rapidity windows for various centrality bins are analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at \u221asNN =2.76 TeV in the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC. A scaling behavior is observed as a function of increasing pseudo-rapidity window for the charge fluctuations, expressed in terms of Nch x \u03bd+-,dyn, where Nch is the number of charged particles. The observed fluctuations are corrected for diffusion of fluctuations [4,5] in the hadronic medium. The results will be shown and discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] S. Jeon, V. Koch, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "In non-central nucleus-necleus collisions, the azimuthal angle of the outgoing particles are cor-related with the direction of the impact parameter and this phenomenon is known as anisotropic flow which is sensitive to the system properties evolved early in the collisions and hence provides evidence for the formation of a hot and dense medium created in such collisions. The measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of short-lived particles (for instance $\\rho^{0}$ mesons) at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions is studied through their decay products. The main focus in our study is the hadronic decay channel of $\\rho^{0}$ where $\\rho^{0} \\rightarrow \\pi^{+} + \\pt^-}$. The motivation of the $\\rho^{0}$ $v_{2}$ measurement is to test quark number scaling as predicted by coalescence models and to answer whether the $\\rho^{0}$ is directly produced or formed from pions in a hadronic phase. In this poster, we present the results of $v_{2}$ for $\\rho^{0}$ vector mesons in $Au + Au$ collisions at $\\sqrt(s_{NN}) = 200$ GeV from STAR. We discuss the extraction of the $\\rho^{0}$ yield with a hadronic cocktail fit after combinatorial background subtraction.

      "Abstract": "LHC and RHIC experiments exhibit a ridge-like enhancement of two particle correlations that is narrow in relative azimuthal angle $\\Delta\\phi$ \r\nand broad in relative pseudorapidity $\\Delta\\eta$. Causality implies that correlations between particles separated by a large $\\Delta\\eta$ must originate at the moment of production. These measurements can therefore reveal how particle production occurs. We were among the first to point out that such correlations can emerge as a consequence of fluctuating initial conditions and the subsequent transverse expansion. Taking the initial fluctuations as resulting from Glasma flux tubes, we successfully describe available ridge measurements, including the collision energy, centrality, and transverse momentum, dependencies of the ridge amplitude and azimuthal width. The effect of initial fluctuations on jet production and quenching has also been studied. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we explore the impact of spatial triangularity of the Glasma flux tubes on the $\\Delta\\phi$ dependence of two particle correlations. Our approach exploits the relationship between fluctuations and correlations and is compatible with multiplicity and $p_t$ fluctuation measurements. We calculate $v_3$ in our approach and compare to other model predictions. Additionally, we present our prediction for the ridge in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and compare our model to the ridge recently seen by CMS in high multiplicity 7 TeV proton-proton collisions, a measurement that could illuminate the interplay between hard and soft particle production.",

We show that the fermion propagator has a pole at v|p|-i\\gamma, where p is the momentum, v=1/3 is the velocity, and \\gamma is the damping rate of order g^2T log(1/g). The residue of the pole is weak of order g^2. When a system has conserved charges, soft modes called hydrodynamic modes appear in the bosonic sector. These hydrodynamic modes are zero mode, i.e., the dispersion of the poles is \\omega=0 at p=0. The question is whether such a soft mode exists in the fermionic sector, when the system has a peculiar symmetry of the fermions. We show that the pole at the ultrasoft region is related to chiral symmetry, although it is not the exact zero mode. In order to obtain the correct pole, one have to sum over relevant diagrams beyond the hard thermal loop approximation even in the leading order of the coupling. This is similar to the calculation of transport coefficients [1]. We analytically obtain the pole of the fermion propagator and its residue in the leading order by solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation. Such pole was also suggested in Ref. [2], in which the self-consistent equation was shown; however it has not been solved. We also discuss whether this phenomena is robust in the fermion-boson system in the chiral limit.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] S. Jeon, Phys. Rev. D52, 3591 (1995); Y. Hidaka and T. Kunihiro, Phys. Rev.

While some models predict that J/\u03a8 produced through direct nucleon-nucleon process have very limited v2, J/\u03a8 produced by the recombination of c and cbar pairs could carry finite v2, depending on the interaction between charm quarks and the medium. Furthermore, due to their long relaxation time, heavy quarks are expected to thermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. Thus the study of J/\u03a8 v2 will also shed light on the extent to which the collision system is thermalized at RHIC.\r\nIn year 2010, with the combined particle identification capability from STAR's Time Projection Chamber, Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter and the newly installed Time of Flight detector, STAR is able to clearly identify electrons from J/\u03a8 decay over a wide momentum range. To cope with the large data volume coming from collisions at high luminosity, a High Level online tracking Trigger was implemented to reconstruct J/\u03a8 events online and tag them for fast analysis. In addition, the low material budget in STAR setup in run 2010 allows us to dramatically improve J/\u03a8 identification, with unprecedented statistics. In this talk, we present J/\u03a8 v2(pT) measurement from 200 GeV AuAu collisions measured by the STAR experiment. This analysis is based on 350 million minimum bias events plus high tower triggered events equivalent to about 7 billion minimum bias events in the relatively higher transverse momentum region. The results of the collision centrality dependence of the J/\u03a8 v2(pT) will be presented. Comparisons to models will be made and the implications on collision dynamics at RHIC will be discussed.",

Each components are glued with epoxy resin, and the pixel hybrid sensors and readout buses are connected electrically with bonding wires. In order to avoid increase of material budget, it is needed to reduce the thickness of resin. Furthermore, it is required to assemble with a precision less than 25 um.

      "Abstract": "To understand the centrality dependence of the measured observables, like the multiplicity  $<p_t>^$ and the elliptic flow of identified particles at midrapidity as well as the elliptic flow of charges hadrons, has been a challenge for theory since many years. Although the multiplicity of different particles in central collisions corresponds exactly to the expectation for a completely thermalized source the centrality dependence is incompatible with this assumption.\r\n\r\nA while ago it has been realized that even in the most central collisions there remain particles (usually close to the surface of the interaction zone) which do not come to equilibrium (corona particles) whereas others come to a local equilibrium (core particles). Corona particles produce hadrons like pp collision. The relative fraction of corona particles can be calculated in the Glauber approach and increases with decreasing centrality? This variable core fraction is the origin of the centrality dependence of the observables. \r\n\r\nThe approach has no free parameter and reproduces quantitatively the experimental results. Especially it explains an observations which have been unexplained since quite a while: the enhancement of (multi) strange baryons and the fact that this enhancement becomes smaller at larger beam energies.\r\n\r\nRecently this model has been extended to dynamical variables like the centrality dependence of $<p_t>$ and $v_2$ of identified particles. The model reproduces quantitatively the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow of charged particles\r\nwithout any new parameter which has been considered so far as an observable which allows to fix the viscosity of a plasma. Our model shows that this centrality dependence can also be predicted assuming the same  fraction of completely equilibrized core and not equilibrized corona particles which has been used to understand the centrality dependence of the multiplicity.\r\n\r\nIn the presentation we will display the model and make comparisons with the EPOS event generator which is based as well on the distinction between core and corona particles and describes the rapidity dependence of many observables. Then we demonstrate that the centrality dependence of all observables at midrapidity is well described in this approach, at SPS as at RHIC, and for CuCu as well as for AuAu. If data are available we will extend the model to LHC energies.\r\nThe interpretation of the results in physical terms concludes the presentation.",

A comparison with the results obtained with simple ideal-gas equations of state is made. The realistic equation of state describes a crossover rather than the first-order phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter. The numerical calculations show that small inhomogeneities of strongly interacting matter in the early Universe are moderately damped during such crossover. \r\n\r\nThe crossover character of the QCD transition indicates that there are small chances for observation of exotic phenomena connected with the first order phase transitions (quark nuggets, strangelets).

      "Abstract": "ALICE is the dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the LHC. Its main physics goal is to study the properties of the strongly-interacting matter in the conditions of high energy density (>10 GeV/fm3 ) and high temperature (> 0.3 GeV) expected to be reached in central Pb-Pb collisions. Charm and beauty quarks are a powerful tool to investigate this high density and strongly interacting state of matter as they are produced in initial hard scatterings, and due to their long life time, they probe all the stages of the system evolution. The measurement of charm production cross section in pp collisions provides interesting insight into QCD processes and is important as a reference for heavy ion studies. Here, we will present the strategy adopted to measure the cross section of one of the hadronic decay channel, D+\u2192 K- \u03c0+ \u03c0+ ,  in pp collisions at LHC energies. The first preliminary cross section results obtained for the same channel will also be shown.",

      "Abstract": "We investigate the thermal dilepton production-rates using one dimensional boost-invariant second order relativistic hydrodynamics to find proper time evolution of the energy density and the temperature. We study the \\textit{non-ideal} effects arising due to viscosity (both bulk and shear), equation of state ($\\epsilon\\neq 3P$) and cavitation on thermal dilepton production from QGP at RHIC energies. The effect of bulk-viscosity and non-ideal equation of state are taken into account in a manner consistent with recent lattice QCD estimates. It is shown that the \\textit{non-ideal} gas equation of state i.e $\\epsilon-3P \\neq 0$ behavior of the expanding plasma, which is important near the phase-transition point, can significantly slow down the hydrodynamic expansion and thereby increase the dilepton production-rates. We calculate the first order corrections to the dilepton production rates due to shear and bulk viscosities. It is shown that ignoring the cavitation can lead to a wrong estimation of the particle spectra. We show that the shear viscosity can enhance the thermal dilepton spectra whereas the bulk viscosity can suppress it. We present the combined effect of bulk and shear viscosities on the dilepton spectra.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The intrinsic transverse momentum of partons and the possible initial and final state gluon radiation associated with hard scatterings give rise to an acoplanarity of  di-jets which depends on both the $Q^2$ of hard scatterings and the center of mass energy of the colliding beams.  Multiple scatterings of the hard  scattered partons in cold nuclear matter may also alter the measured acoplanarity when compared to those in {\\it p+p}. Studies in central {\\it d+Au} collisions are therefore vital to disentangle medium-induced $k_t$ broadening from  initial state nuclear effects and any potential broadening due to jet quenching in the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. While full jet reconstruction is a direct way to study such acoplanarities, di-hadron correlations with respect to a high momentum leading particle can also be utilized as a complementary tool.\r\n\r\nTwo quantities commonly used to characterize the properties of jets are $j_t$, the transverse momentum of the jet fragments relative to the jet axis, and  $k_t$, the transverse component of the momentum of the hard scattered partons. Measurements of the jet parameters, $\\sqrt{\\langle j_t^2 \\rangle}$ and $\\sqrt{\\langle k_t^2 \\rangle}$ at STAR in {\\it p+p} collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 62.4, 200 and 500 GeV extracted from di-hadron correlations are presented. $\\pi^0$ ($E_t$ = 6.5 to 18.5 GeV) and charged tracks ($p_t$ = 3.0-8.5 GeV/c) are used as trigger particles in these analyses.

      "Abstract": "By means of high energy nuclear collisions, the properties, such as \r\nthe viscosity coefficients, of QCD matter under extreme conditions \r\nare intended to be experimentally revealed. One remarkable result \r\nfrom collisions at RHIC is that the produced hot matter is an \r\nalmost ideal fluid, obeying the smallest shear viscosity to entropy \r\ndensity ratio observed in nature. Employing an effective kinetic \r\ntheory for quasiparticle excitations featuring dynamically \r\ngenerated self-energies, we determine the temperature dependence \r\nof the viscosity coefficients of deconfined strongly interacting \r\nmatter [1,2]. This knowledge may serve as input for the \r\nphenomenological description of heavy-ion collisions at LHC and \r\nRHIC. \r\n\r\nExhibiting the parametric dependencies known from perturbative QCD \r\nat large temperatures, the extrapolation of our results into the \r\nnon-perturbative region shows fairly nice quantitative agreement \r\nwith lattice QCD results in the case of a pure gluon plasma. We \r\nfind a minimum in the specific shear viscosity and a rapid increase \r\nof the specific bulk viscosity near the deconfinement transition \r\ntemperature T_c. The ratio of bulk to shear viscosity comprises \r\nboth, a quadratic dependence on the conformality measure at large \r\ntemperatures as known from pQCD as well as a linear dependence \r\nnear T_c as known from specific strongly coupled and nearly \r\nconformal theories based on gauge/string duality [3]. Thus, the \r\nexploited framework provides a systematic interpolation between \r\nboth regimes of weak and strong coupling. \r\n\r\n[1] M. Bluhm, B. Kampfer, K. Redlich, Nucl. Phys.

With minimum material budget in the tracking part of the detector this run is particularly suited for the investigation of virtual photons originating from the hot and dense medium created in heavy ion collisions. The completed installation of the STAR time-of-flight detector is a further distinctive feature which allows the particles\u2019 velocity to be used for particle identification in addition to their energy loss in the time projection chamber. As electromagnetic probes, dielectron pairs do not interact strongly with the medium and hence carry direct information of its properties at the time of production. Thus, measurements of dielectron emissivity in heavy ion collisions provide an additional tool for the study of the quark gluon plasma. For a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\,=\\,39\\,GeV$, 170M events have been taken. The poster presents the status of an ongoing dielectron analysis of this high statistics sample.

Photon multiplicity and pseudorapidity distributions for inelastic and non-single diffractive events are compared with results from event generators (Phojet, Pythia).  Phojet is close to the data at 0.9 TeV, but both models under-predict the observed data at 7 TeV.

The most common method of calculation is with nuclear-modified parton distribution functions and a break-up cross section for the (pre-J/psi) c-cbar pair passing through the nucleus.  Calculations of this nature will be presented (as detailed in arXiv:1011.4534) with different assumptions about the geometric dependence of the nuclear modifications, and the results will be compared to the latest PHENIX d+Au experimental data.  It will be demonstrated that no combination of nPDFs and sigma_breakup, regardless of the nPDF parameter set and the assumed geometric dependence, can simultaneously describe the entire rapidity and centrality dependence of J/psi modifications in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV. We will also extend the calculations to include a simple model of initial-state parton energy loss, with the same result.  We will then compare the results of these calculations with others using coherent J/psi production and gluon saturation at low x.

We derive the Langevin equation for the sigma field  with the explicit damping coefficient and the noise terms, which are similar to those we obtain from the influence functional method. The 2PI effective action in addition contains information about the local equilibrium properties of the quark fluid like the energy density and the pressure, which are needed for the equation of state. We go beyond existing studies of Langevin dynamics at the chiral phase transition by putting special emphasis on the properties and the evolution of the heat bath. The damping in the dynamics of the sigma field leads to energy dissipation from the field to the fluid. In the exact formalism of the 2PI effective action a conserved energy-momentum tensor can be constructed.\r\nInvestigating the coupled dynamics of the sigma field and the expansion of the quark fluid we present results on the intensity of sigma fluctuations and the correlations at the critical point and the first order phase transition observing strong nonequilibrium fluctuations and correlations.",

      "Abstract": "Long-Range Forward-Backward multiplicity correlations(LRC) may be a signal for multiple partonic interactions in dense matter, whereas short-range correlations are due to independent sources [1,2].  Previously, strong LRC have been measured at STAR in 200 GeV central Au+Au collisions, and were shown to decrease with decreasing centrality [3].  The Color Glass Condensate model, which describes sources as longitudinal flux tubes, predicts that the correlation will grow with centrality [4,5].  Furthermore, fluctuations in the number of gluons at early times will produce a long range correlation significantly larger for pions than protons [5].  We present the forward-backward correlation of identified\r\nhadrons (pions, kaons, protons) as a function of rapidity for Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV.  The particle identification is carried out by measuring their average energy loss in the STAR Time Projection Chamber. The centrality dependence of the correlation strength will also be discussed for each particle species.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] A. Capella and A. Krzywicki, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "The production of hypertriton and light nuclei are simulated in a dynamical coalescence model coupled with a multi-phase transport model (AMPT)~\\cite{SZhang10}. The beam energy dependence of strangeness population factor, $S_{3}$ = $^{3}_{\\Lambda}H/(^{3}He\\times\\frac{\\Lambda}{p})$, is calculated to study local baryon-strangeness correlation as a valuable tool to probe the nature of the dense matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. We find that AMPT with string melting predicts an increase of $S_3$ with increasing beam energy, and is consistent with experimental data, while AMPT with only hadronic scattering results in a low $S_3$ throughout the energy range from AGS to RHIC, and fails to describe the experimental data. And we analyzed coalescence parameters, $B_2$ and $B_3$, based on the production of deuteron, helium-3 and proton. The coalescence parameters of $B_2$ and $B_3$ decrease with increasing of beam energy or number of participant. The value of $B_2$ and $B_3$ in this model are consistent with the measurement by experiment collaboration in nucleus-nucleus collisions at different beam energy~\\cite{NA49-07} or in different centralities~\\cite{STAR09}. The freeze-out correlation volume, $V^{1-A}_f$ (A is atomic number), is calculated in AMPT model. The results of coalescence parameter and the freeze-out correlation volume follow the relation of $B_A$ $\\propto$ $V^{1-A}_f$, which is from coalescence mechanism and observed in experiments~\\cite{BAVf,STAR09,HLiu06}. This beam energy and system size dependences indicate the increase of source size in more high energy collisions and in more central collisions.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{SZhang10} S.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We investigate the massless fermion spectral function coupled with a massive vector boson (mass: m) in the whole region of temperature (T) [1].  The massive vector boson is described as a U(1) gauge boson so that we can analyze the extremely high-T region where T/m $\\gg$ 0, in contrast to the Proca formalism [2].  We show that a novel peak appears in the fermion spectral function for T~m in addition to the two peaks corresponding to the normal fermionic and anti-plasmino excitations obtained in the m=0 case [3].\r\nWe find that the novel peak seems to persist though with a small strength \r\neven for T$\\gg$m, where the other two peaks remains robust and are smoothly connected to those obtained in the HTL approximation.  \r\nSince our model has a U(1) gauge invariance, the poles of the fermion propagator must be gauge invariant.  We have confirmed the gauge invariance of the poles for T$\\ll$m and T~m, while the gauge invariance of the poles are satisfied only for a restricted region of the gauge-fixing parameter for T$\\gg$m.  We explicitly obtained the adequate region of the gauge-fixing parameter for T$\\gg$m. Our results shows that the unitary gauge, which corresponds to the large gauge-fixing parameter limit, is found to be inadequate for the calculation of the fermion propagator in the T$\\gg$m region, although the unitary gauge is often adopted in the literature.\r\nThe relevant physical systems of our analysis include the quark-gluon plasma phase near the phase transition temperature (T_c) since vector-type collective excitation may exist there and its mass may become very small (T$\\gg$m) just above T_c.  The neutrino spectrum in the early universe is also relevant since the neutrino couples with the massive vector particles, W and Z boson.  The present work tells us that the analysis of the neutrino spectral function in the unitary gauge or in the Proca formalism [4] can\r\nsuffer from a strong gauge dependence in the T$\\gg$m region.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] D.

Within PHSD the low mass dilepton sector (M<1 GeV) at SPS energies (measured by the NA60 and CERES Collaborations) is rather well described by hadronic degrees of freedom when a collisional broadening of the vector mesons (rho, omega) is incorporated; however, this no longer holds for higher masses. In the intermediate mass regime from 1 to 2 GeV, we find that the contribution from `massive' q+qbar annihilation in the sQGP phase  dominantes over the hadronic channels like pi+a1, pi+omega and rho+rho for In+In reactions at 160 A GeV. On the other hand, we find a quite different pattern of the dilepton production in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of sqrt(s)=200 GeV. Here the in-medium effects for the rho and omega vector mesons do not explain the large enhancement relative to p+p collisions observed in the invariant mass regime from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV by the PHENIX Collaboration. For masses above 1 GeV at RHIC energies, we find that the decay of open charm mesons together with the dilepton radiation from partonic interactions in the sQGP phase dominate the measured spectrum.",

      "Abstract": "The centrality dependence of nuclear modification factor($R_{AA}$) carries information about the path-length variation of partonic energy loss. However, the inclusive $R_{AA}$ for a given centrality emerges by averaging over different path lengths as the overlap zone of two colliding nuclei has typically a nearly elliptical shape in the transverse plane. The partons traversing the medium in the in-plane direction are expected to lose less energy than out-of-plane, because they, on the average, have shorter path length inside the medium. In this sense, azimuthal dependence of $R_{AA}$ w.r.t. reaction plane offers to get a tighter constraint on the actual path length traversed by the parton in medium.\r\n\r\nRecently we published a paper on the charged particle $R_{AA}$[1], showing that the similar suppression as RHIC energy is observed, and moreover a rising trend for increasing $p_{T}$. Another interesting observation is the similarity of $p_{T}$-differential elliptic flow at low $p_{T}$ between at RHIC and the LHC [2]. Since then, we have extended the $p_{T}$ reach for $R_{AA}$ with better precision and elliptic flow measurement up to 20 $GeV/c$ with event plane, which allows us to study the path-length dependence of partonic energy loss with larger kinematic domain.\r\n\r\nWe present the latest ALICE results from Pb-Pb collisions at $sqrt{s_{NN}$=2.76TeV on charged particle yields with respect to reaction plane angle as a function of centrality and transverse momentum.

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "The experiment by the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has opened a novel insight into the extreme state of matter. Besides, it provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of strong Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. In peripheral collisions, an extremely strong Abelian magnetic field is created by two colliding heavy ions having large electric charges. The magnetic field has a much greater order of magnitude than those of ever observed astronomical objects. \r\n\r\nSuch a strong magnetic field becomes not only the source of an exotic phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect but also a background field which allows for nonlinear QED phenomena, where the strong magnetic field interacts with photons emitted in the early stages of time evolution of the created matter. Even though photon self-interaction is diagrammatically a higher order process with a number of external photon legs intermediated by an electron loop, extraordinarily strong magnitude of the background magnetic field compensates the smallness of the coupling constant, and leads to intriguing nonperturbative effects. The interaction causes a modification of production and propagation of photon, which results in significant effects on the observable photon spectrum. It was discussed recently that the presence of magnetic fields also allows for the decay of a real photon into a particle-antiparticle (lepton, or quark) pair, yielding an elliptic flow of observed photons [1]. The study of such nonlinear QED phenomena provides a prevision of planned photon detection in the LHC experiment.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we examine the effect of the interaction, between an emitted photon and the background magnetic field, on Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry. Recently, one of the authors investigated effects of the hadronic final state mean field interaction on the pion interferometry in the central collisions [2,3]. We have found therein that the HBT images are distorted due to the phase shift of the pion amplitude propagating through the one-body mean field interaction region, which is computed by using the semi-classical approximation. The analysis was done on the basis of an analogue of eikonal approximation in the geometrical optics. In the present work, we incorporate the interaction of photon with the background magnetic field as a deviation of the refraction index from the unity, wherein the analogue is more evident. While the HBT interferometry by a photon pair is more promisingly accessible to the primordial image of the created matter than that by a pion pair, we have to take into account the distortion of image by the strong magnetic field. \r\n\r\nThe refraction index of the vacuum in the presence of the magnetic field is obtained by incorporating the self-energy of photon, resummed with respect to the number of external photon legs, into the equation of motion for the Abelian gauge field. Depending on the two physical propagating modes of photon, two distinct refraction indices, called the vacuum birefringence, are obtained. Calculating the optical-path-length of the photon specified by the refraction indices, we have the images distorted depending on the helicity of photons. In addition to the conventionally discussed three HBT parameters, e.g. outward, sideward and longitudinal radii, we investigate the distortion of the outward-sideward cross parameter, which indicates the azimuthal-angle dependence of the image in the non-central collisions [4]. The magnitude of the distortion also depends on the azimuthal angle because the presence of the magnetic field provides a preferred orientation. We show how and to what extent the elliptic shape of the original image is distorted depending on the magnitude of momentum, helicity and azimuthal angle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] K. Tuchin, Phys. Rev.

The pseudo rapidity dependence of the transverse energy per participant is susceptible to the longitudinal expansion of the system. This quantity has not been measured for truly heavy ions for centre of mass energies above 8 GeV. The width of this distribution grows slowly with centrality.

      "Abstract": "The strong electromagnetic fields present in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN LHC accelerator lead to large cross sections for particle production in photonuclear interactions[1]. It will be shown that photonuclear processes may constitute a significant background to peripheral and semi-central hadronic nuclear collisions.\r\n\r\nThe cross sections for photonuclear interactions induced by photons from the electromagnetic fields of the nuclei have been calculated. The photon spectrum has been evaluated in impact parameter space. Thereby one can easily exclude collisions were the nuclei interact hadronically (b < 2R). For modelling the particle production, the DPMJET[2] Monte Carlo event generator has been used. Calculations have been done for photon energies from 6 GeV to 100 TeV in the rest frame of the target nucleus, which is the energy range contributing to particle production around mid-rapidity. The multiplicity, rapidity, and transverse momentum distributions of produced particles will be presented.\r\n\r\nTwo cases of photonuclear processes have been considered, single and double excitation. In the former case, one of the nuclei emits a photon which interacts with the other nucleus, whereas in the latter case both nuclei emit photons which interact with the other nucleus. The cross section for single excitation is much larger than that of double excitation. However, the topology of the double excitation events, where the rapidity distruction is more symmetrical, is simililar to that of hadronic interactions. Both processes may thus contribute significantly to the background of hadronic interactions, depending on the experimental event selection. \r\n\r\nThe photon-nucleon energies that can be reached in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC are higher than for any earlier gamma+A or gamma+p collisions. In addition to being a background for hadronic interactions, such events have a physics interest in themselves. Photoproduction of heavy quarks (e.g. cc-bar through gamma-gluon fusion) and jets have large cross sections and probe the nuclear parton distribution functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] O. Djuvsland, J.

      "Abstract": "We present a general derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. In the 14-moment approximation [1,2], traditionally employed in the fluid-dynamical modeling of heavy-ion collisions, fluid dynamics is obtained by explicitly truncating the moment expansion of the single-particle distribution function. In contrast, in our approach all terms of the moment expansion are included and the exact equations of motion for these moments are derived. These exact equations still contain the degrees of freedom and microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation.  \r\n\r\nWe prove that in order to derive causal fluid-dynamical equations it is necessary to resolve at least the slowest microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation, in agreement with [3]. The truncation of the equations of motion in terms of only 14 dynamical variables is then implemented by a systematic power-counting scheme in Knudsen and Reynolds numbers, instead of the explicit truncation of the moment series, as in Israel-Stewart theory. The resulting fluid-dynamical equations and coefficients are different from the ones \r\nobtained via the 14-moment approximation and are in much better agreement with kinetic theory. This means that the fluid-dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions based on the 14-moment approximation is incomplete.\r\n\r\n[1] W. Israel and J. M. Stewart, Phys.

Two pseudorapidity intervals (the\r\n\"forward\" and the \"backward\" windows) of the variable width from 0.2 to 0.8 rapidity units\r\nwere chosen.

We apply the predicting power of scaling plots to the search for the CEP of strong interactions in heavy ion collisions using data from RHIC and SPS. The results of our data analysis suggest that a critical point cannot be below chemical potentials $\\mu\\sim 450~$MeV. Extrapolating the analysis, we speculate that criticality could appear slightly above $\\mu\\sim 500~$MeV.

In this sense, the tracking efficiency integrated on the five stations of the spectrometer is a critical variable. Indeed, for cross-section calculations we have to apply a correction factor Acc\u2217\u03b5. We use, for to evaluate this factor, realistic Monte Carlo simulations run by run. In heavy ions collisions, one of the main parameters is the centrality of the collision, directly related to the multiplicity and the occupancy of the detector. It is therefore crucial to know the centrality dependence of muon tracking efficiency.\r\nAnother aspect of J/\u03c8 study is to obtain its contribution to the single muon spectrum. Simulations using J/\u03c8 measured cross-section, pt and y distributions, allow to obtain this contribution. Similar evaluation will be done for the vector meson in order to get rid of the resonance contribution to the single muon spectrum.",

      "Abstract": "One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program is to search for the QCD critical point (CP) in the QCD phase diagram. Non-monotonic dependence of the ratios of the various moments of conserved (such as net-charge and net-baryon) number distributions with beam energy has been considered to be a signal for the  CP. In addition to this, it has been recently proposed that a certain set of mix-ratios of these moments can be measured to validate the occurrence of critical phenomena.  These ratios are constructed so as not to have any dependence on model parameters, including the correlation length. Their values after subtracting the statistical contribution should remain as unity even in presence of CP. Measurements of these mix-ratios are a vital step towards establishing a complete set of observables for the critical point program at RHIC. In this poster, we will present the preliminary results of these mix-ratios using event-by-event proton and kaon multiplicity at mid-rapidity measured in Au+Au collisions at\r\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 39 and 200 GeV by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

      "Abstract": "Recently there have been many works about the inhomogeneous phases accompanying the chiral transition, which should have implications on relativistic heavy-ion collisions as well as compact-star phenomena [1]. \r\n\r\nAmong them we here concentrate on the emergence and properties of a special one called dual-chiral-density wave (DCDW) state, which enjoys interesting features such as parity-violating phase, liquid-crystalline structure and spin-density wave [2]. In particular, the one-dimensional order is quasi-long-range-order in this case such that the correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar densities decay algebraically, as in the smectic liquid crystal[3]: fluctuations in the DCDW phase exhibit the heterogeneous dispersion relation.\r\nThe symmetry breaking pattern is also characteristic in this phase transition: U(1) subgroup of chiral symmetry and one-dimensional translational symmetry are broken at the same time, but is still invariant under the specific combination of them. So, Nambu-Goldstone modes (phasons) should exhibit a hybrid features of phonons and \"pions\". Moreover, magnetization spatially modulates to pretend a spin density wave, which may be related with the magnetic activity of compact stars.\r\n\r\nAfter briefly introducing DCDW in the chiral limit and discussing its salient features, we elucidate the physical mechanism of its emergence; we emphasize differences from the usual Overhauser effect or the nesting effect of the Fermi surface. \r\nThen we present a formalism to deform the original DCDW, to include the symmetry breaking effect [4]. Taking a variational method we show that the deformed DCDW can be described by a topological object: it is realized by embedding the chain of the sine-Gordon kinks in $1+1$ dimension into $1+3$ dimensional quark matter [5]. Thus we can generalize DCDW without losing the basic concepts.\r\n\r\nFinally we briefly discuss the neutrino emission process by way of beta decay of quarks in the DCDW phase, as a definite example of implications of DCDW on compact-star phenomena [6].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] D.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We present recent results from the newly developed hybrid code\r\nVISHNU [1] which couples viscous hydrodynamics for the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with a hadron cascade model for the late hadronic stage. By describing the hadronic rescattering and freeze-out stage microscopically, we improve on earlier purely hydrodynamic models which required additional adjustable parameters to describe the transport and freeze-out characteristics of the hadron phase. By describing the QGP phase as a viscous rather than ideal fluid (as done in previous macroscopic + macroscopic hybrid codes), we account for the non-zero viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma which we can now determine empirically, without contamination from an incomplete treatment of the late hadronic dynamics, by comparing VISHNU results with experimental elliptic flow data.\r\n\r\nUsing the Monte-Carlo-Glauber or Monte-Carlo-KLN models to \r\ngenerate event by event fluctuating initial entropy density profiles and averaging these profiles either in the reaction-plane (i.e. directly) or in the participant-plane (i.e. after recentering and rotating each event so that the main axes of its entropy density align), we generate smooth average initial conditions for viscous hydrodynamics which account in different ways for the event by event fluctuations in shape and orientation of the initial state of the collision fireball [2]. We find that the eccentricity scaled elliptic flow $v_2/\\epsilon$ is a universal function of charged multiplicity per unit overlap area $(1/S)(dN_{ch}/dy)$ that depends only on the QGP viscosity but not on the initialization models [3]. Comparing these universal curves with experimental measurements we find that the specific QGP viscosity $(\\eta/s)_{QGP}$ is constrained to fall in the range $1<4\\pi(\\eta/s)_{QGP}<2.5$ where the width of this range is entirely dominated by model uncertainties for the initial eccentricities [3]. Compared to analysis based on pure viscous hydrodynamics this reduces the previously quoted robust upper limit for $(\\eta/s)_{QGP}$ by a factor 2.5. The same $(\\eta/s)_{QGP}$ values extracted in [3] from the centrality dependence of the $p_T$-integrated elliptic flow of all charged hadrons also provide, for the first time, a consistently good simultaneous description of the $p_T$ spectra and differential elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ for charged hadrons as well as identified pions and protons over the entire range of collision centralities in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions [4].\r\n\r\n[1] H.

In this model the chemical freeze-out occurs earlier at higher temperature. In analyzing the hadron ratios, resonance contribution has been carefully taken into account. After the chemical freeze-out the number of the thermal hadrons of each type is kept fixed as in-elastic collisions becomes less frequent, while the elastic collisions among the  hadrons of the same species maintain the thermal equilibrium until the thermal freeze-out. At the thermal freeze-out the chemical potentials for each hadron species are calculated from the fixed number of thermal hadrons and the transverse momentum spectra of measured hadrons are fitted with blast wave-type equation together with the resonance contribution.",

It has also been proposed that the H particle would appear as a bump in the $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ invariant mass spectra if the H is a resonance state, or the H would lead to a depletion of the Lambda-\\Lambda$ correlation near the threshold if the H is weakly bound. In this scenario, the mass of H is expected to be in the range (2230, 2380) MeV. Because of high rate of strange particle production per heavy ion collision, Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is a unique place to search for the H-dibaryon. The $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ correlation measurements at RHIC are sensitive to their mutual interactions, which can be used to probe whether there is a stable H particle or H resonance.  This sensitivity is unique at RHIC because of the allowed range of $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ scattering parameters in nucleus-nucleus collisions. We will present the measurement of $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=39$GeV and $\\sqrt{s}=200$GeV using the STAR experiment at RHIC.\r\n\r\n[1] R. L. Jaffe, Phys.

The effect of photon conversions in the material in front of the EMCal in ALICE on the pT dependence of the \u03c0 0 mass and the \u03c0 0 reconstruction efficiency will also be discussed. The various fundamental corrections and associated systematic errors, as determined by Monte Carlo simulations will be described and summarized.",

With its large acceptance and broad rapidity coverage, the CMS detector is ideally suited to provide detailed analyses of higher order harmonic flow at the LHC. Measurements of $v_n$ (n = 3 to n = 6) in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV using the cumulant and Lee-Yang zeros methods will be presented as a function of $p_T$ and centrality.

The amplitude of this ridge-like correlation rises rapidly, reaches a maximum, and then falls in the most central collisions. In this talk we explain how this centrality dependence arises from an interplay between initial state density fluctuations and the almond shape of the overlap region. We show that the disappearance of the almond shape in central collisions leads to the observed reduction in the near-side ridge, uniquely linking the ridge to initial-state coordinate-space anisotropies converted into final-state momentum-space correlations. We show how the width of the ridge is related to length scales in the expanding system and we provide a prediction for the ridge amplitude in Pb+Pb collisions at \u221asNN = 2.76 TeV.",

Investigation of charmonium production by decay on two leptons (muons) was started at the CERN SPS [1], continued at RHIC [2,3] and now is going at  LHC, CERN. \r\n       The theoretical models without regeneration that could reproduce SPS results produce too strong J/\u03c8 suppression at RHIC energies. At  LHC energy a process of charmonium production is different with respect to the SPS and even to the RHIC. The theoretical estimates   give different results, some predict strong suppression [4], some predict enhancement [5]. In addition to prompt production from hard scattering, charmonium states could be produced due to recombination which may give an enhancement instead of a suppression.\r\n      The energy interval between  SPS and RHIC  is very important for a study of the mechanism of quarkonium production and suppression. If the proton and ion beams will be used at LHC with fixed targets, the energy for 7 TeV proton beam  will be \uf0d6 s = 114.6 GeV, for 2.75 TeV  Pb   beam   \uf0d6 s = 71.8 GeV.\r\n        In order to  separate normal and anomalous charmonium suppression we need to have data for  pp interaction and several target nuclei, which is easy to do with fixed target and very hard with colliding beams.\r\n         As it was already used for the experiment on collider with a fixed target at HERA-B, the target in the form of thin ribbon could be placed around the main orbit of LHC.  The life time of the beam is determined by the beam-beam and beam-gas interactions.  Therefore after some time the particles will leave the main orbit and interact with the target ribbon. So for fixed target measurements only halo of the beam will be used and no deterioration of the main beam will be introduced. The experiments at different interaction points will not feel any presence of the fixed target.\r\n        In order to study a capability of using the fixed target at LHC for charmonium production we calculate geometrical acceptances for J/\u03c8 production, compare acceptances at collider experiments (RHIC and LHC) with existing fixed target experiments. Then we estimate the counting rates and show that  J/\u03c8 production on fixed target at LHC could be measured with rather high statistics collected in several days of data taking. \r\n\r\n[1]  L.

      "Abstract": "The hot and dense medium formed in high energy heavy ion collisions may induce shifts of hadronic masses from their asymptotic values. In case this mass modification indeed occurs, it was demonstrated that squeezed correlations of particle-antiparticle pairs, also known as Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC), should appear. They are expected either in the bosonic (bBBC) or in the fermionic (fBBC) cases [1], in both being positive correlations of unlimited intensity, even for finite-size systems expanding with moderate flow [2]. Although they could nicely probe the mass shift with asymptotic particles, these hadronic squeezed correlations are very sensitive to the functional form of their time emission distribution. This strong sensitivity was demonstrated in [1], by comparing the sudden emission with a Lorentzian distribution, which reduced the intensity of the effect by orders of magnitude. We show here that the reduction of the signal is even more dramatic if this time emission is parameterized  by a Levy-type of distribution [3], although it could still survive if the duration of the process is short and if we search for the effect with lighter mesons, such as kaons. \r\n \r\nTo experimentally search for the  BBC signal, we have suggested to look for the particle-antiparticle squeezed correlation function, plotted in terms of the average momentum of the pair,  $\\vec{K}_{12}=(\\vec{k}_1+\\vec{k}_2)/2$, for high values of their relative momentum, $\\vec{q}_{12}=(\\vec{k}_1-\\vec{k}_2)$ [4]. The first experimental search for the squeezed particle-antiparticle correlations was shown for different hadron pairs in Ref. [5].  We compare here such preliminary results with predictions of our model for $K+ K-$ pairs, showing that the outcome of the experimental search may be still inconclusive, however it does not deny the existence of the squeezing effect on kaons produced at RHIC energies with in-medium modified masses. \r\n\r\n[1] M.

Using the gravity description, we also compute energy and pressure density of the gauge theory plasma and observe a rapid change as temperature is altered, indicating a phase transition.

      "Abstract": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is the future heavy-ion experiment at FAIR being designed to explore the intermediate range of the QCD phase diagram in a beam energy interval of 10-45 AGeV. With its physics program CBM will investigate the properties of dense baryonic matter and the expected phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter. Among the key observables are low-mass vector mesons and charmonium decaying into lepton pairs. In CBM, electrons with energies lower than 8 GeV/c will be identified through a RICH detector being developed at several laboratories. In addition the detector will improve the kaon/pion separation at momenta higher than 4 GeV/c. \r\n\r\nThe proposed concept of the RICH detector foresees CO2 as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors reflecting the Cerenkov radiation on an array of Multianode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as photo detectors. \r\nCO2 has been chosen because it has a Lorenz factor, gth, of 33.3, a radiation length of 183 m and a pion momentum threshold for Cerenkov light production of 4.65 GeV/c, it represents a very good compromise to fulfill the CBM RICH requirements.\r\nThe mirror system will be of approximately 11.8 m\u00b2 with a curvature radius of 3 m and a thickness of 6 mm. For the reflective coating Al+MgF2 are foreseen. In order to cover a spherical mirror wall with a radius of 3 m, square mirror tiles of approximately 40\u00d740cm\u00b2  will be used.\r\nRegarding the photo detector investigations indicated that the 64 channel Hamamatsu H8500 MAPMT is one of the most promising candidates for the CBM RICH. The main criteria for the readout of this MAPMT are the high interaction rates (up to 10 MHz) and the challenging high level triggers in CBM. To cope with these facts a self triggered readout electronics is foreseen. The Front End Electronics (FEE) will be based on a further development of the so called n-XYTER chip which was developed for the readout of silicon detectors. The chip offers 128 channels at a readout speed of 32 MHz. As an intermediate solution the high gain of the MAPMT is currently matched to the existing chip via a charge attenuator board. \r\n\r\nThese components were successfully tested in laboratories and in several test beams. Single photon counting and Cerenkov light detection confirmed the suitability of the FEE and MAPMT setup. The tests also show that uncorrelated noise can be well separated from the signal using available timing information. The usage of wavelength shifter films in order to enhance the quantum efficiency of the MAPMT for wavelengths below 300 nm is investigated. An industrial provider for mirror prototypes with promising  surface homogeneity and reflectivity has been found.\r\n\r\nThe concept of the RICH detector as well as results of several tests will be presented. They are valuable experience for the preparation of a full scale RICH prototype setup currently under construction and to be tested at CERN in fall 2011.",

The moment products $\\kappa \\sigma^{2}$ and $S \\sigma$ of net-proton (net-charge) distributions are related to baryon (charge) number susceptibility ratios and are volume independent. The mix-ratio of the moments of proton and kaon multiplicities, which are predicted to be without any dependence on model parameters including the correlation length  \r\n, will be also presented to establish the baselines.

      "Abstract": "Ongoing heavy ion collision at Large Hadron Collider, CERN is expected to settle the important issues like the possibility of formation of the lattice QCD predicted strongly interacting nuclear matter known as Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the important issue of thermalization and the time taken by the system to achieve the same. Recently ALICE collaboration [1] measured the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity in \u221asNN=2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collision. The viscous hydro was pretty successful to describe the experimental particle multiplicity and elliptic flow data at RHIC energy, from which the initial condition of the produced medium can also be traced back. We use 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic model  to explain  the centrality dependence of experimental charged particle multiplicity produced in Pb-Pb  \u221asNN=2.76 TeV collision and obtain the initial condition of the fluid produced. The space time evolution of the fluid is obtained by solving energy momentum conservation along with solving relaxation equation for shear viscous stresses obtained from Israel-Stewart\u2019s 2nd order theory. The conservation equation were closed with an equation of state (EOS) constructed from recent lattice data [2] for QGP phase which undergoes a crossover transition to Hadronic phase (comprising all the resonances below mass 2.5 GeV) at crossover temperature Tco=174 MeV. It was assumed that initial energy density  was mostly scaled with number of binary collision and the system freezes out when the temperature at any space-time points reaches Tf=130 MeV. Our study [3] shows that hydrodynamical evolution of QGP fluid, with viscosity to entropy density ratio \u03b7/s=1/4\u03c0, initialized to central energy density \u03b5i =370 GeV/fm3 at initial time \u03c4i=0.6 fm/c or initialized to energy density \u03b5i =72 GeV/fm3 at initial time \u03c4i=1.0 fm/c explains the ALICE data on centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity. Smaller initial time \u03c4i=0.2 fm/c do not reproduce the data. Initial time \u03c4i=0.6-1.0 fm/c is also consistent with ALICE measurement of charged particles pT spectra and elliptic flow. We also show that an alternative of hadronic resonance gas, even at the unphysical high temperature of T=220 MeV do not explains the ALICE data. \r\n\r\n[1] K Aamodt et al.

      "Abstract": "Photons and dileptons are important probe for the lattice QCD predicted deconfined matter, commonly called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP).  Unlike the  strongly interacting hadrons, which can give information about the \u2018last scattering surface\u2019, electromagnetically interacting  photons and dileptons give information about the matter at the deep interior. Viscous effects on photon and dilepton production is studied recently [1,2].  However, the model [1,2] appears to have some inconsistency that viscous effects on fluid evolution were not accounted for. In a recent work, we have removed the  inconsistency [3]. Photon production rate from Compton and annihilation processes was convoluted over the space-time evolution of the QGP, obtained by explicitly solving Israel-Stewart\u2019s 2nd order theory of hydrodynamics. In viscous dynamics, photon/dilepton production is modified due to (i) changed space-time evolution of the fluid and (ii) non-equilibrium correction to the equilibrium distribution function. The non-equilibrium correction grows with viscosity as well with transverse momentum. Applicability of viscous hydrodynamics requires that the non-equilibrium correction is small. Viscous effects on photon and dilepton production are strong [3,4]. Even for AdS/CFT lower bound of viscosity ($\\eta$/s=0.08), strong viscous correction render the hydrodynamics inapplicable beyond pT ~ 1.5 GeV.  If QGP viscosity is larger than the Ads/CFT limit, then limitation will be even more severe. Photon production as a function of initial time, also suggest that if the   inverse slope parameter of the photon spectra, is measured within an accuracy of ~20-80 MeV, one can possibly estimate the initial time and viscosity within reasonable limit. We also find that for dilepton invariant mass M~600-900 MeV, the dilepton to  photon ratio is sensitive to viscosity to entropy ratio of the medium. The dilepton to  photon ratio can possibly serve as a \u2018viscometer\u2019 for QGP. \r\n\r\n[1] K. Dusling, Nucl.Phys.A839(2010)70.\r\n[2]K. Dusling and S. Lin, Nucl.Phys A809(2008)246.\r\n[3] A.

The dominant contribution to the cross-section comes from the \r\ngluon--heavy-quark (gQ) initiated subprocess, making this process very sensitive to the gluon and the heavy-quark nuclear parton densities. We show that the future p-A data to be collected at the LHC should allow one to disentangle the various nPDF sets currently available. In heavy-ion collisions, the photon transverse momentum can be used to gauge the initial energy of the massive parton which is expected to propagate through the dense QCD medium produced in those collisions.  The two-particle final state provides a range of observables (jet asymmetry, photon-jet pair momentum, among others), through the use of which a better understanding of parton energy loss processes in the massive quark sector can be achieved, as shown by the present phenomenological analysis carried out in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "For 20 years, the suppression of quarkonia has been studied as a probe of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) properties, either by Debye screening of the interaction between the q-qbar pair (Matsui and Satz) or via gluo-dissociation of quarkonia states, which remain strongly bound (Kharzeev). However, the comparison between experimental data and scenarios including suppression mechanisms is not very conclusive.\r\n  Rather than focusing only on these \u201csuppressed\u201d quarkonia, an alternative track is to focus not only on the suppressed but also on the physical properties of quarkonia survivors in the QGP. In fact, recent results from NA50 and NA60 experiments at SPS showed that these quarkonia indeed carry a non-zero elliptic flow. This could lead to a reconsideration of the propagation and collectivity of these quarkonia in the QGP, especially the elastic scattering process of quarkonia states with the partons in the QGP. \r\n  We study the quarkonia propagation and collectivity by using a hydrodynamic transport code. This code requires the evaluation of two ingredients: The elastic cross section and the Fokker-Planck (FP) coefficients for stochastic processes (drag and diffusion coefficients).\r\n\r\n  In my contribution, I will first present some theoretical calculations and results obtained for the elastic cross section, following perturbative calculations in quantum mechanics and in QCD. I will then present our model for the estimation of FP coefficients and discuss the collisional energy loss of quarkonia in the QGP. Finally, results deduced from our transport code MC@SHQ to study the quarkonia propagation and collectivity are shown. The general tendency of our results shows that quarkonia elastic processes have non-negligible influence on the quarkonia study in the QGP.",

Due to its high energy resolution PHOS is well suited for precision measurements starting at low gamma energies. \r\n\r\nWe will also compare to the available theoretical models, which display a rather large variation in their predictions. Results from earlier experiments up to RHIC energies are consistent with a \r\nlinear increase in E_T with ln(sqrt{s}). Gluon saturation models, which reproduce the charged particle multiplicity well, generally predict a much stronger increase in E_T towards the energies at LHC. The prospects for using E_T measurements to discriminate between theoretical models will be discussed.",

In this talk we will present new results from such correlation analysis that show unambiguously formation of a double-hump structure on the away side in raw correlation measured in very central Au+Au collisions for intermediate pT (2$<$pT$<$5GeV/c) particles.\r\n\r\nWe carry out systematic investigation of the same- and away-side features by varying the event centrality and kinematic selection for 200GeV Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions. To characterize the observed correlation structure we fit the data with a multi-component model that includes a same side Gaussian and higher order Fourier moments (vn; n = 1,2,3,4). The impact of including the third Fourier moment in the fit on the elongated same-side structure and the second Fourier moment (related to the elliptic flow strength) is discussed.\r\n\r\nFinally we compare our data to theoretical expectations based on CGC initial conditions [1], [2], initial density fluctuations [3] and pQCD [4]. We conclude that, within the studied model, the same-side eta elongated structure is consistent with a coexistence of jet and non-jet contributions.\r\n\r\n[1].

However, effects such as the statistical recombination of heavy flavor quark-antiquark pairs or co-mover absorption can also affect quarkonia production.  For the bottomonium states these competing effects are expected to be smaller than for the charmonium states.  Lattice calculations show that quantifying the suppression of an entire family of quarkonium mesons can give us a model dependent measurement of the temperature of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions.  For the $\\Upsilon$ family, calculations indicate that the $\\Upsilon(1S)$ state should not be suppressed at $\\sqrt(s) = $ 200 GeV, which would give a standard candle that the $\\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ states can be compared to.  The suppression of quarkonia can be quantified by calculating the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, which is the ratio of production in p+p scaled by the number of binary collisions to the production in Au+Au collisions.  \r\n\r\nWe will present results for mid-rapidity $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{{s}_{NN }}$ = 200 GeV.

The centrality dependence of $R_{AA}$ will be shown for the combined $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ yield as well as for the $/Upsilon(1S)$ yield.

The latter can be studied by looking at d+Au collisions since it can be safely assumed that no hot and dense medium is being created.\r\n\r\nThe PHENIX experiment at RHIC has performed light meson production measurements in d+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV.

Qualitatively, these results agree with some of the theoretical predictions for local parity violation in heavy-ion collisions. However, a study using reaction-plane-dependent balance functions shows an alternative origin of this signal. The balance function, which measures the\r\ncorrelation between oppositely charged pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges. The reaction-plane dependent balance function measurements can be related to STAR's charge-dependent azimuthal correlations. We report reaction-plane-dependent balance functions for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 , 62.4, 39, 11.5, and 7.7 GeV using the STAR detector. The model of Schlicting and Pratt [2] incorporating local charge conservation and elliptic flow reproduces most of the three-particle azimuthal correlation results at 200 GeV.

      "Speaker": "Prashant Kumar Srivastava",
      "Institute": "Banaras Hindu University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The physics regarding the existence of the critical point on the QCD phase boundary still remains unclear and its precise location is quite uncertain. We follow the suggestion of T. D. Lee et. al. [Phys. Rev. D9, 2291 (1974)] that a phase transition at high baryon density in a bulk matter can be realized in which nucleon loses part of its mass and thus baryons play a significant role in the phase transition. We suggest that the hadron gas consists of pointlike mesons and each baryon having a geometrical hard-core size. It means that mesons can fuse into one another while baryons experience a repulsive force with other baryons when densely packed. We formulate an excluded volume model existing for the equation of state (EOS) of hot, dense hadron gas and for the quark gluon plasma we use a thermodynamically consistent quasiparticle model (QPM). We construct a first order phase transition using Gibbs' equilibrium criteria. This leads to an interesting and surprising finding that a critical point exists in such a formulation beyond which a cross-over region appears. We find that such a picture always appears in all excluded volume models considered in the literature. For ideal hadron gas model, there is no critical point in the diagram. In the mean field model also, we do not get a critical point unless we incorporate an excluded potential effect. Our analysis strongly suggests that the existence of a critical point and a cross-over region owes its explanation in the finite size baryons in the hadron gas.  We find an interesting result that the ratio of the baryons to the total hadrons at the critical point is around 0.2 in all types of models and thus a cross-over region starts as soon as this ratio becomes smaller than 0.2.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "It is well-known that making reliable predictions about low-energy QCD and hadrons is a great challenge, as perturbative methods of quantum field theory do not apply when the coupling constant is strong. The common approach has been to propose various dynamical models which are inspired by assumptions, ideas, and intuition borrowed from physical systems which are not QCD. In this talk, I present refs. 1, 2 below. I will show how a schematic model employing pure QCD ingredients can teach us about the dynamics of QCD. I will present a new extended schematic model for hadrons where diquarks serve as building blocks on equal footing with quarks, and use it to reclassify the hadron spectrum. The outcome is that there are no radially excited mesons and no radially excited baryons; mesons and baryons which were believed to be radially excited are actually orbitally excited states involving diquarks. The reclassification thereby provides a new set of relations between two fundamental properties of hadrons: their size and their energy. The relations state that the size of a hadron is largest in the ground state and shrinks when the hadron is excited, contrary to practically all dynamical models proposed for QCD where the quarks are allowed to be pushed apart by a centrifugal barrier or radial excitations. While this set of relations appears counter-intuitive, it provides a novel explanation for the relationship between confinement and asymptotic freedom. It shows that we can overcome confinement and reach asymptotic freedom by increasing a hadron\u2019s orbital excitation: the path from confinement to asymptotic freedom is a Regge trajectory. This sheds new light not only on the low energy regime of QCD but also on its connection with high energies. \r\n\r\nIt is significant that the above set of relations predicts a QCD effect whereby a hadron can shrink. It is especially important since protons and neutrons, which make up the bulk of ordinary matter, are hadrons, and as such they obey the said relations. Our prediction proved to be concrete and testable when it was confirmed by an experiment that showed that the size of the proton shrinks (Pohl et. al., Nature 466, 213) nine months after this work was posted. \r\n\r\n1.

      "Speaker": "Sungtae Cho",
      "Institute": "Yonsei University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We propose a new approach of using relativistic heavy ion collisions to identify and study multi-quark hadrons. We focus on the expected production yields of these hadrons and show that their production yields are strongly affected by their internal structure [1], e.g. multi-quark configurations or hadronic molecules. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe mainly use the coalescence model, which was successful in explaining the enhanced production of baryons at midrapidity in the intermediate transverse momentum region [2, 3] and the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow of identified hadrons [4]. Based on the coalescence model, we are able to take into account the effects of the internal structure of hadrons, such as the angular momentum and the multiplicity of quarks [5. 6], on their production yields. We also rely on the statistical model [7], which has been known to describe the relative yields of normal hadrons very well, to extract important parameters for the coalescence model and normalize the expected yields. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that the ratio of the production yields of normal hadrons calculated in the coalescence model to those from the statistical model, N^{coal}/N^{stat}, is in the range 0.2$<$N^{coal}/N^{stat}$<$2. This ratio is, however, typically an order of magnitude smaller if a hadron is a compact multi-quark state. On the other hand, for a hadron which is a loosely bound hadronic molecule, it would be more abundantly formed than the expected production yield by a factor of two and more. We further find that the yields of multi-quark hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions are large enough for detection in experiments. For example, the D_{sJ}(2317) yield per unit rapidity is predicted to be more than 2*10^{-3} in central heavy ion collisions at RHIC. Therefore, relativistic heavy ion collision experiments provide a promising opportunity for studying multi-quark hadrons. By measuring their production yields in these experiments, we expect to achieve both new discovery of exotic hadrons and the understanding of their internal structures at the same time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.

On the other hand, the unintegrated gluon distribution defined as the Fourier transform of the color dipole cross section appears naturally in gluon production cross sections but has no partonic interpretation. We show that the Weizsacker-Williams distribution can be probed in a dijet production process in DIS whereas the Fourier transform of the color dipole appears in photon-jet production in pA collisions. More complicated processes involving two particle production can be described with an effective k_t-factorization where each specific process requires a new gluon distribution built from the two basic ones through convolution.",

We study the photons produced from a variety of sources, including those from primordial nucleon-nucleon collisions, from thermal partons, from fragmenting QCD jets, from jets interacting with thermal partons, and from thermal hadrons. We study the interplay of those sources, in an evolving 3D simulation of the colliding system that involves hydrodynamics and hard jets. We study ideal and viscous fluids, and we evaluate the effect of fluctuating initial conditions, and of using different hadronic equations of state. Under all of the above conditions, we quantify the ability of real photons to act as penetrating probes of the hot and dense strongly interacting medium.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Dilepton distributions have been proposed as one of the penetrating probes for hot and dense nuclear matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. Due to their relatively small final-state interaction cross-sections with the hot/dense environment, dileptons bring us direct information of the created matter in such collision. Since dileptons are created over all stages of heavy ion reactions, their sources vary as a function of kinematics. In the low mass region (LMR: mass<1.1GeV/$c^{2}$), dileptons are dominated by vector mesons and directed photons, while in the intermediate mass region (IMR: 1.1< mass< 3GeV/$c^{2}$) dileptons are dominated by thermal radiation of quark gluon plasma (QGP). In the high mass region (HMR: mass> 3 GeV/$c^{2}$), dileptons are mostly contributed by heavy (charm and bottom) quark decays and Drell-Yan processes. As a result, the dilepton distributions, especially in the IMR and HMR, could provide new aspects of early collision dynamics in heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of the full barrel time-of-flight detector, the electron identification has been significantly improved at STAR, especially in low momentum region. In this talk we will present the first STAR results on dielectron production in p+p and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results will be compared to hadron decay cocktails to search for vector meson in-medium modifications in LMR and the QGP thermal radiation in IMR. A systematic analysis of the transverse mass distributions in IMR region as a function of the mass in Au+Au collisions will be discussed. The results will be compared to those from 200 GeV p+p collisions as well as the results from SPS energies.",

In weak coupling, the stopping distance scales with energy as E^(1/2), up to logarithms.  In strongly-coupled plasmas with gravity duals, theorists have found that the maximum stopping distance scales instead like E^(1/3).  In the latter case, we show that there can be an important distinction between typical and maximum stopping distances.  For the strongly-coupled excitations we study, we find that the typical stopping distance scales as E^(1/4).",

The trend was predicted to persist at the LHC. The data from Pb-Pb collisions confirm the existence of a flowing medium and provide strict constraints on the dynamical models. Similar analysis is carried out for pp collisions for pions and kaons and qualitative similarities to heavy-ion data are seen, especially in collisions producing large number of particles. The observed trends give insight into the soft particle production mechanism in pp collisions.\r\n3D radii were also found to universally scale with event multiplicity in heavy-ion collisions. We extend the range of multiplicities both upwards with the Pb-Pb data and downwards with the pp data to test the scaling in new areas. In particular the high multiplicity pp collisions reach particle densities comparable to the ones measured in peripheral Cu-Cu and Au-Au collisions at RHIC.

A differential equation is derived the evolution of the radiated gluon distribution as the jet propagates through the medium. Combined with the in-medium evolution of the leading parton, we compute the depletion of the energy from the jet cone by dissipation through elastic collisions with medium constituents, by scattering of shower partons to larger angles, and by radiation outside the jet cone. Numerical results are presented for the nuclear modification of di-jet energy asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC.",

      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "The strong quenching of jets and the suppression of hadron spectra \r\nat high transverse momenta are striking experimental observations \r\nmade in high energy nuclear collisions. Both have been interpreted \r\nas signature for the formation of a deconfined plasma of QCD \r\nmatter, in which partons suffer a medium-induced energy loss. In \r\ntheoretical studies devoted to a parton's radiative energy loss, \r\nhowever, the damping of radiation within the plasma has so far \r\nwidely been neglected. \r\n\r\nWe investigate the radiative energy loss per unit distance of a \r\nrelativistic colour charge traversing as probe an infinite \r\nabsorptive plasma. The Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is \r\nincorporated as well as modifications due to the polarization of \r\nand damping mechanisms in the medium. The latter are \r\nphenomenologically described by a complex index of refraction, \r\nwhile the colour charge dynamics is considered in the Abelian \r\napproximation. We find a substantial reduction of the medium-\r\ninduced mechanical work in addition to the well known Ter-\r\nMikaelian effect from the polarization of matter. Moreover, the \r\nformation time of radiated quanta is also drastically reduced, \r\nboth for small frequencies, where damping has a minor additional \r\nimpact besides the polarization effect, and for larger frequencies. \r\nThese effects are more pronounced for larger medium damping \r\nand/or larger initial energy of the charge. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we expect that our study will have a significant impact \r\non the understanding of jet quenching phenomena in ultra-\r\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and even more at LHC.",

We present measurements by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC of di-hadron pair production in d+Au\r\ncollisions where the particles in the pair are varied across a wide\r\nrange of rapidity out to $|\\eta| = 3.8$ using a new forward electromagnetic calorimeter, the MPC.  These di-hadron measurements probe down to parton momentum fractions x ~ $10^{-3}$ in the gold nucleus, where the interesting possibility of observing gluon saturation effects at RHIC is the greatest.  Our measurements show that the correlated yield of back-to-back pairs in d+Au collisions is suppressed by up to an order of magnitude relative to p+p collisions, and increases with greater nuclear path thickness and with decreasing parton x in the Au nucleus.",

      "Abstract": "Using linear response theory, we derive [1] conditions for the retarded Green's function so that the linearized equation of motion of a dissipative current is reduced to a relaxation-type equation of the Israel-Stewart type [2]. We prove that this reduction can be done, if the singularity of the retarded Green's function closest to the origin is a simple pole on the imaginary axis. The relaxation time coefficient is then given by the location of this pole in the complex plane. This implies that previous attempts to derive the relaxation time from the generic long-wavelength, low-frequency (i.e., fluid-dynamical) limit of the retarded Green's function, via an expansion in terms of gradients of the fluid-dynamical variables, in general fail to give the correct result.\r\n\r\nFor a dilute gas, this prescription gives a value for the shear relaxation time that, under certain simplifying assumptions, coincides with the one derived by matching relativistic fluid dynamics to kinetic theory [3]. This shows that transient fluid dynamics is determined by the slowest microscopic and not by the fastest fluid-dynamical time scale. This has important implications for the description of the collective motion of matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, where microscopic time scales and  the lifetime of the system itself can be of the same order. We also prove that the long-wavelength dynamics  of the shear stress tensor in a strongly coupled N=4 SYM plasma is not described by relaxation-type equations as in Israel-Stewart theory [2].\r\n\r\n[1] G.

The identification and measurement of anti-$^{4}He$ relies on the mean energy loss per unit track length, the time of flight of particles, and their curvature in the magnetic field of the STAR detector.  Another essential detector capability was the High Level online tracking Trigger (HLT), which helps to cope with the large data volume and greatly speeds up the search effort.\r\nIn total, 18 anti-$^{4}He$ counts were detected at the STAR experiment at RHIC in $10^{9}$ recorded Au+Au collisions at beam energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and 62 GeV. Misidentification probability is estimated to be below $10^{-11}$. \r\nThe invariant differential cross section is consistent with expectations from thermodynamic and coalescent nucleosynthesis models, which has implications for future production of even heavier antimatter nuclei, as well as for experimental searches for new phenomena in the cosmos. The yield of the stable antinucleus next in line (mass number = 6) is predicted to be down by a factor of $2.6 X 10^{6}$ compared to anti-$^{4}He$ and is beyond the reach of current accelerator technology.",

It can also provide reliable estimates of the flow correlations which contribute to the underlying event for jet-driven two-particle azimuthal angle correlation studies; the latter is important to the development of a quantitative understanding of the opacity of the QGP. Thus, significant recent attention has been given to theoretical studies of  $v_n$ (odd and even) and the associated initial [fluctuating] eccentricities which drive $v_n$.  \r\n    In recent experiments, the PHENIX Collaboration has made \r\ndetailed differential measurements of $v_n$ (odd and even) relative \r\nto the participant event planes $\\Psi_n$, as well as measurements of the correlations between different $\\Psi_n$ planes.

Such an event reconstruction has been shown to improve the resolution of jets and missing transverse energy in pp collisions compared to purely calorimetric measurements. This is achieved primarily by combining the precise momentum determination of charged hadrons in the silicon tracker with the associated energy depositions in the calorimeters. By resolving individual particles inside jets, particle flow reduces the sensitivity of the jet energy scale to the jet fragmentation pattern, which is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty in jet reconstruction. Particle flow is thus an attractive tool for the study of potential modifications to jet fragmentation in heavy-ion collisions. The particle flow algorithm has been adapted to the heavy-ion environment. The performance of jet reconstruction from particle flow objects in PbPb collisions using the anti-kT jet reconstruction algorithm will be presented.",

CMS has shown excellent isolation capabilities in pp collisions at the LHC using the shower shape method. \r\n\r\nIn heavy-ion collisions, two independent methods, shower shape and isolation, are used to separate isolated photons from non-prompt photons. This is the first application of these pp photon isolation techniques in heavy ion collisions. Shower shape templates are created with studies of the response in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The latter method, based on the tracker and the calorimeter, is found to have consistent results with the former method. We report the first measurement of the transverse momentum spectra of isolated photons in PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon nucleon pair with the CMS detector.

Charged particle transverse momentum (pT) spectra have been measured by CMS for pp collisions at sqrt(s)=0.9 and 7 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 231 ub-1 and 2.96 pb-1, respectively. Calorimeter-based high-transverse-energy jet triggers are employed to enhance the statistical reach of the high-pT measurements. The results are compared to various generator tunes and also to an empirical scaling of different collision energies with xT=2pT/sqrt(s) over the pT range up to 200 GeV/c. Using a combination of xT scaling and direct interpolation at fixed pT, a reference pT spectrum at sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV is constructed from pT = 1-100 GeV/c with less than 13% systematic uncertainty. We have obtained R_AA in bins of collision centrality for a PbPb data sample with an integrated luminosity of 7 ub-1, dividing by the interpolated reference spectrum. As seen at lower energies, the charged particle spectrum in central PbPb collisions is suppressed by at least a factor of five (R_AA < 0.2) compared to binary scaling around pT = 5-10 GeV/c.

The multipurpose Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is well designed to measure these hard scattering processes with its high resolution calorimeters and high precision silicon tracker. Jet quenching was observed by a significant imbalance of dijet transverse momentum in PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of = 2.76 TeV. The fraction of unbalanced dijets is found to increase strongly with increasing collision centrality. The dijet imbalance persists to the highest jet momenta studied, while angular distributions are only weakly modified. The redistribution of the quenched jet energy was studied using the transverse momentum balance of charged tracks projected onto the direction of the leading jet.

      "Abstract": "In gold-gold collisions of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) a perfect fluid of quarks, sometimes called the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created for an extremely short time. The time evolution of this fluid can be described by hydrodynamical models. After expansion and cooling, the freeze-out happens and hadrons are created. Their distribution reveals information about the final state of the fluid. To investigate the time evolution one needs to analyze penetrating probes, such as direct photon spectra. Distributions of low momentum photons was published in 2010 by PHENIX. Such low momentum distributions can be compared to hydrodynamics to determine the equation of state and the initial temperature of sQGP. In this paper we analyze a 3+1 dimensional solution of relativistic hydrodynamics. We calculate momentum distribution of low momentum thermal photons and other observables from the model. Using earlier fits of this model to hadronic spectra, we compare photon calculations to measurements from RHIC. We find that the initial temperature of the center of the fireball is at least 519+-12 MeV, while for a time averaged equation of state we get c_s=0.36+-0.02. We also find an interesting shape of direct photon elliptic flow.",

The eta' decays (through one of its decay channels) into five pions. These pions will not be correlated in terms of Bose-Einsten correlations, thus the production enhancement changes the strength of two-pion correlation functions at low momentum. Preliminary results strongly support the mass decrease of the eta' boson. In this paper we propose a method to select pions coming from eta' decays. We investigate the efficiency of the proposed kinematical cut in several collision systems and energies with several simulators. We prove that our method can be used in all investigeted collision systems.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "During the past decade, azimuthal correlation measurements have played a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of high density QCD matter through their sensitivity to the early stage evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Despite our increased understanding of the transport coefficients of the plasma produced in these collisions, there remain many questions concerning the interplay between initial state conditions, the equation of state, and the evolution of the system through the final hadronization stage. Detailed experimental data obtained for the energy regime accessible using the LHC should help in establishing the shear viscosity to entropy ratio achieved in the produced, strongly interacting matter. The CMS experiment has measured the anisotropy parameter, v2, using four different methods: the event-plane, two or four particle cumulants, and Lee-Yang Zeros. Consistent results are found for the different methods after considering their respective sensitivities to non-flow correlations and event-by-event fluctuations in the initial conditions. The anisotropy is studied as a function of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality in a broad kinematic range: $0.3 < p_{T} < 12.0 $GeV/$c$, $|\\eta|$ < 2.4, and in 12 centrality classes in the range 0-80\\%. The scaling of $v_{2}$ with participant eccentricity and transverse particle density is examined and compared to lower energy results.",

Our result resums to all loop orders the leading unstable quantum fluctuations at early times. We showed explicitly previously for a scalar field theory [2] that averaging over the analogous spectrum of initial fluctuations leads to hydrodynamic behavior. The computation can now be carried out for QCD and we outline the algorithm for doing so. In addition to providing a mechanism for early thermalization, our result for the small fluctuation spectrum also enables one to compute a) key features of jet modification at early times and b) sphaleron transition rates in the Glasma. An understanding of the latter is crucial for the charge separation mechanism in the Chiral Magnetic Effect.

      "Abstract": "Jet quenching, the parton energy loss in the hot and dense medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, is a well-established experimental phenomenon at RHIC. However, existing single hadron, di-hadron and multi-hadron measurements from RHIC do not provide a complete understanding of the experimental results and do not sufficiently constrain theoretical models. Reconstructed jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are expected to significantly improve experimental sensitivity to quenching and to more stringently constrain theoretical descriptions of the quark/gluon-medium interaction. Thus, prior to its commencement, it was anticipated that the LHC heavy ion program would substantially advance the study of jet quenching by providing access to jets with transverse energies in excess of 100 GeV -- sufficiently high that the underlying event would provide only a modest perturbation to the jet measurements.  Immediately following turn-on of the LHC in November, 2010, that expectation was satisfied through the observation of large di-jet asymmetries that may indicate substantial jet quenching. In this talk we will present results from ATLAS measurements of single jet production, di-jet correlations and jet fragmentation in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN} = 2.76$~TeV. These results include an update on the original di-jet asymmetry analysis using the full statistics from the Fall 2010 LHC Pb+Pb run.",

A large pseudorapidity gap between the tracking system and forward calorimeters significantly reduces contributions from short-range non-flow effects. For the first time at this energy, elliptic flow is measured over 5 units of pseudorapidity, from -2.5 to 2.5, and over a broad range in transverse momentum, 0.5-20 GeV.

Motivated by the glasma-flux-tube scenario, we model the initial condition by a set of randomly distributed longitudinal tubes in a boost-invariant 2D geometry. The model introduces two parameters: the number of tubes in each event and the transverse (gaussian) width in energy density of a tube. The number of tubes fluctuates event by event and the width of the tubes introduces a granularity to the initial condition. Both parameters strongly affect the hydrodynamical evolution. For instance, we observe that the increasing granularity reduces the slope of the transverse momentum spectra, decreases the value of the differential elliptic flow at the average transverse momentum, and generates a double-peak structure in the two-particle distribution. With this framework, we aim to constrain the initial condition of a heavy-ion collision by performing a systematic analysis of the effects of each parameter on the final observables.",

As a result, they retain characteristics of the full\r\ntime evolution and dynamics of the system.  Among the many features,\r\nthe low mass region (m<1 GeV/c2) consists primarily of pairs from\r\nDalitz decays of light hadrons and direct decays of vector mesons that\r\ncan be modified by the medium, while the intermediate (1<m<3\r\nGeV/c2) and high (4<m<8 GeV/c2) mass regions are dominated\r\nby pairs from mesons containing charm and bottom respectively.\r\n\r\nThe PHENIX experiment has presented dielectron continuum spectra for\r\np+p, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at \u221asNN=200GeV.

      "Abstract": "Despite a wealth of experimental data for high p_T processes in heavy-ion collisions, discriminating between different models of hard parton-medium interactions has been difficult. A large reason is that the pQCD parton spectrum at RHIC is so steeply falling that distinguishing even a moderate shift in parton energy from complete parton absorption is essentially impossible. In essence, energy loss models are effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero energy loss and as a result, only the pathlength dependence of energy loss offers some discriminating power at RHIC kinematics. At LHC, this is no longer the case: Due to the much flatter shape of the parton spectra originating from 2.76 AGeV collisions, the available data probe much deeper into the model dynamics. A simultaneous fit of the nuclear suppression both at RHIC and LHC kinematics has thus a huge potential to discriminate between various models with equally good description of RHIC data alone.",

      "Abstract": "Identical neutral kaon pair correlations are measured in 7 TeV proton+proton collisions in the ALICE experiment. Neutral kaons are identified from their decay into \u03c0+\u03c0- pairs. K0sK0s correlation functions are formed in 4 multiplicity x 4 kT bins. The kaon source parameters Rinv and \u03bb are extracted from these correlation functions by fitting a Gaussian*PYTHIA model to them, the Gaussian describing the Bose effect and PYTHIA accounting for the non-flat baseline found in proton+proton collisions. PYTHIA with the Perugia-0 tune is seen to describe well the dependence of the baseline shape of the K0sK0s correlation function on multiplicity-kT bin in the Qinv fitting range used of 0-1 GeV. Corrections to source parameters from the Lednicky model for the a0/f0 resonance are made and found to be large. K0sK0s correlations show a systematic increase in Rinv for increasing multiplicity bin and decreasing Rinv for increasing kT bin as seen in \u03c0\u03c0 correlations in the proton+proton system, as well as seen in heavy-ion collisions. Also, K0sK0s correlations are observed to more or less \u201csmoothly\u201d extend this \u03c0\u03c0 Rinv behavior for the proton+proton system to ~3 times higher kT than the kT range measured in \u03c0\u03c0 correlations.",

      "Abstract": "The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has carried out systematic measurements of $\\phi$ and $\\omega$ mesons in $p+p$, $d+Au$, $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Consistent results have been obtained using leptonic and hadronic decay modes as well as different analysis techniques.\r\n  \r\nIn $p+p$ collisions, the transverse momentum distributions of $\\omega$ and $\\phi$, as well as all other mesons measured by PHENIX, are well described by the Tsallis distribution functional form. Combining the $e^+e^-$ and hadronic ($\\omega \\rightarrow \\pi^0 gamma,~\\pi^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $\\phi \\rightarrow K^+K^-$) decay channels, $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ have been measured over a $p_T$ range of 0 - 13.5 GeV/c and 0 - 7 GeV/c respectively. New results obtained using hadronic and dielectron channels of $\\omega$ and $\\phi$ mesons in $d+Au$ collisions extend the $p_T$ coverage to 0.25 - 13 GeV/c and 0 - 7 GeV/c respectively, and reveal a moderate enhancement at intermediate $p_T$ and a hint of suppression at $p_T >$ 8 GeV/c. Both observations are consistent with previous results for $\\pi^0$, $\\pi^+ + \\pi^-$, $K_s$ and $K^+ + K^-$.\r\n\r\nThe nuclear modification factor of $\\omega$ in $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions measured over a $p_T$ range of 4 - 12 GeV/c, shows that $\\omega$ has a similar suppression pattern as that of $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$, strengthening the observation that mesons with different  masses have similar behavior but different from the one of baryons. However, $\\phi$ in $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions, measured from 1 - 7 GeV/c, shows a suppression, that is smaller than that of the $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2 - 5 GeV/c), whereas at higher $p_T$, within the large experimental uncertainties, the amount of suppression appears similar to that of the light mesons. Results of $\\phi$ production at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV show a similar behavior but with larger uncertainties. This talk will review the most recent results obtained for light vector mesons in different collision systems and energies.",

      "Abstract": "CMS is fully equipped to measure hard probes in the di-muon decay channel in the high multiplicity environment of nucleus-nucleus collisions. Such probes are\r\nespecially relevant for studying the quark gluon plasma since they are produced\r\nat early times and propagate through the medium, mapping its evolution.\r\nQuarkonia and bottomonia are sensitive to the evolution of the medium. In\r\nparticular, the $J\\psi$ production in heavy ion collisions has been studied at\r\ndifferent energies and with different collision systems without yet giving a\r\nglobal picture that is fully understood. Measuring the charmonium production at\r\nthe LHC energies in PbPb collisions will help constraining predictions, in\r\nparticular those expecting high recombination of prompt J/Psi or\r\nsuppression in hot medium. We will review CMS J/Psi measurements in pp\r\ncollisions at \u221asNN=7~TeV, which allow precision studies of quarkonia\r\nproduction and serve as a reference for the observation of hot nuclear effects.\r\nCMS is able to distinguish non-prompt J/psi from prompt J/psi in PbPb\r\ncollisions, and will present the prompt J/psi production cross-section in\r\nPbPb inclusively and as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity and number\r\nof nucleons participating in the collision. Finally, we compare the B fraction\r\nmeasured in PbPb collisions with that measured in pp at various energies. The\r\nLHC centre-of-mass energy allows copious Y production in PbPb\r\ncollisions. Detailed measurements of bottomonium will help characterize the\r\ndense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions beyond what was accessible at\r\nRHIC (mostly) with charmonia. The full spectroscopy of quarkonium states has\r\nbeen suggested as a possible thermometer for the QGP. With its excellent dimuon mass resolution, CMS has measured the three Y states in pp collisions.\r\nWith the 2010 PbPb data sample, CMS has observed the Y(1S) as well as\r\nexcited states. The $\\Upsilon(1S)$ cross-section is presented as a function of\r\ntransverse momentum, rapidity and centrality, and excited state. Suppression of\r\nthe excited state in PbPb will be discussed.",

Because of particle interactions, this initial spatial asymmetry leads to anisotropies in particle emission -- the phenomenon called anisotropic flow. The best known anisotropy of this kind is the elliptic flow that is described by the second harmonic in particle azimuthal distribution. Recently, the so-called triangular, and higher harmonic flow, and in particular their sensitivity to the system initial conditions attracted a lot of attention, as they might provide additional important information about the initial conditions and dynamical properties (e.g. viscosity) of the system.\r\n\r\nFluctuations in the initial geometry should be also reflected in the detail shape of the system at freeze-out. In this talk I discuss the possibility to measure such fluctuations by means of identical and non-identical particle femtoscopy. I support my conclusion on the sensitivity of the method to measure triangularity and higher harmonic spatial asymmetries by analytical calculations, and by results from event generators and blast wave model calculations.",

In absolute terms, all three radii (R_out, R_side, R_long) are larger than at RHIC, roughly consistent with a linear scaling with the cube root of the particle multiplicity. The results, taken together with those obtained from the study of the multiplicity and the azimuthal anisotropy, indicate that the fireball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC is hotter, lives longer, and expands to a larger size as compared to lower energies.",

In this contribution, we present the current results from the PHENIX experiment on fully reconstructed jets and direct $\\gamma$-hadron correlations. Baseline measurements of jets in p+p collisions as well as their yield and correlation modifications in d+Au and Cu+Cu will be given. From $\\gamma$-hadron correlations, we present the fragmentation function in p+p and Au+Au collisions and its modification in Au+Au to lower $z_T$ than what has previously been studied.

A major focus of the PHENIX experiment is the measurement of these quarks through their semi-leptonic decay channels at mid and forward rapidity.    \r\n\r\nHeavy quark measurements in p+p collisions give information on the production of heavy flavor, without complications from medium effects.  New measurements in d+Au indicate significant and surprising cold nuclear matter effects on these quarks at midrapidity, and provide a new baseline for interpretation of the observed suppression in Au+Au collisions.  To complement the measured heavy quark spectra, correlations between heavy quark decay products give information on jet modification in nuclear collisions, while correlations between heavy quarks and hadrons produced in the same event can shed light on interactions with the medium.  When considered all together, these measurements present a detailed study of nuclear matter across a wide range of system size and temperature.

In order to achieve this goal, RHIC has embarked on an energy scan program involving gold nuclei at various energies. The data collected by the PHENIX experiment for this program consists of data sets obtained at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62, 39 and 7.7 GeV.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of these data, have yielded a wealth of new soft physics results which are used in concert to probe reaction dynamics and to constrain the transport coefficients of hot QCD matter. One particularly effective probe that is emphasized in this talk is the anisotropy of particle production, characterized by flow coefficients $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$. For Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, measurements indicate a hydrodynamic flow of hot QCD matter at the partonic level with a small but finite value of the viscosity to entropy density ratio. However, at sufficiently low collision energy (thus lower energy density and temperature), we expect this picture to break down. Therefore measurement of the collision energy dependence of $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ could provide new insights to the current understanding of the nature of interactions in hot QCD matter.\r\n\r\nWe present new energy scan measurements of flow coefficients for both unidentified and identified particles, as well as several other soft physics observables such as identified hadron spectra and HBT correlations.

      "Abstract": "The suppression of inclusive pion production by up to a factor of 5, which was first observed in Au + Au at \u221asNN= 130 GeV/c (e.g. [1]) and later in Au + Au at \u221asNN= 200 GeV/c [2, 3], is one of the most significant manifestations of the opaque QGP produced in heavy ion collisions. The absence of this suppression in d + Au collisions at the same energy indicates the final state nature of the suppression. It is natural to ask where the onset of such massive suppression is in terms of the energy density of the medium which is dictated by the collision energy, centrality and the mass of colliding nuclei. The PHENIX collaboration has studied collisions of lighter nuclei (Cu + Cu) at different beam energies in 2005 [4]. While a significant suppression is observed both at \u221asNN = 200 and 62.4 GeV, at \u221asNN = 22.4 GeV a moderate enhancement is found. In 2010 RHIC scanned lower energies, and PHENIX collected substantial data sets in Au + Au collisions at \u221asNN = 39 and 62 GeV. The goal was to identify better the conditions for the onset of the \u03c00 suppression.

      "Abstract": "In nucleus-nucleus collisions we distinguish early hadro-chemical freeze-out, fixing hadronic concentrations, and final kinetic freeze-out to spectral and flow features, occuring at the end of the hadronic \"cascade\" phase. This view has been adopted in all recent analysis of hadron production rates, which are well described in the grand canonical statistical equilibrium model. The derived freeze-out systematics in the (T,mu(B)) plane occurs in all present sketches of the QCD matter phase diagram. It merges with the lattice QCD parton-hadron coexistence line at small mu(B).\r\n\r\nThe preservation of the equilibrium pattern of hadronic yields (established in the close vicinity of hadronization) throughout the final hadronic expansion phase still remains to be explained, and substantiated.\r\nIn order to systematically assess the effect of the hadronic cascade stage we employ the hybrid version of the UrQMD transport model. In it, a high density hydrodynamic evolution stage is matched, via the Cooper-Frye formalism, to the final hadron/resonance expansion evolution. Matching occurs at a fixed critical energy density. These calculations are carried out at the energies covered by the\r\nSPS Pb+Pb program, 6.3 < squrr(s) < 17.3 GeV. At each energy we determine, both, the hadron yield distribution arising directly after hadronization, and the eventual distribution resulting from the UrQMD hadron/resonance expansion \"afterburner\" stage. The latter turns out to preserve the bulk production channels but to systematically reduce the antibaryon yields, with exception of the Omega/Antiomega. We revisit the data in view of these predictions.\r\n\r\nFinally we analyze all these yield distributions with the grand canonical statistical model, determining the freeze-out curve before/after the cascade afterburner. A significant shift of this curve occurs (to lower T, higher mu(B)) which, however, is essentially absent if the antibaryon yields are excluded, but with exception of the Omega/antiOmega yields. The cascade stage thus appears to distort the initially imprinted equilibrium distributions, but only selectively so: an effect that must be avoided in the data analysis. Thus one recovers the T, mu(B) established before the cascade stage.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of charged dihadron correlations from the CMS collaboration are presented for PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair over a broad range of pseudorapidity and the full range of azimuthal angle. With its large pseudorapidity coverage (|$\\eta$|<2.4), the CMS tracker is ideally suited for detailed analyses of both short and long-range charged hadron correlations at the LHC. For the most central 0-5\\% collisions, a broadening of the away side ($\\Delta\\phi>1$) dihadron correlation is observed at all $\\Delta\\eta$ when compared to pp collisions. A significant correlated yield is observed for pairs of particles with small $\\Delta\\phi$ but large longitudinal separation $\\Delta\\eta$, commonly known as the ``ridge''. The ridge persists up to at least $|\\Delta\\eta| = 4$ and its effect is found to be stronger than what was previously observed at RHIC. The dependence of the ridge region shape and yield on transverse momentum and collision centrality has been measured. For particles of transverse momentum of 2--4 GeV/$c$, the ridge is found to be the most prominent when correlated to particles of 2--6 GeV/$c$, but disappears when correlated to 8--10 GeV/$c$ particles. A Fourier analysis of the long-range two-particle correlations will be presented and discussed in the context of CMS measurements of higher order flow coefficients.",

      "Abstract": "Within the AMPT Monte Carlo model, fluctuations in the initial transverse parton density are shown to lead to harmonic flows. The net back-to-back dihadron azimuthal correlation after subtraction of contributions from harmonic flows still has a double peak that is independent of the initial geometric triangularity and unique to the jet-induced Mach cone and expanding hot spots distorted by radial flow. The longitudinal structure of hot spots also leads to a near-side ridge in dihadron correlation with a large rapidity gap. By successively randomizing the azimuthal angle of the transverse momenta and positions of initial partons, one can isolate the effects of jet-induced medium excitation and expanding hot spots on the dihadron azimuthal correlation. The double peaks in the net dihadron and $\\gamma$-hadron correlation are quantitatively different since the later is caused only by jet-induced Mach cone.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Guo-Liang Ma and Xin-Nian Wang, arXiv:1011.5249",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Thermal photon emission is widely believed to reflect properties of the earliest, hottest evolution stage of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Previous computations of photon emission have been carried out using a hydrodynamical medium description with smooth, averaged initial conditions. Recently, more sophisticated hydrodynamical models which calculate observables by averaging over many evolutions with event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions (IC) have been developed. Given their direct connection to the early time dynamics, thermal photon emission appears an ideal observable to probe fluctuations in the medium initial state. In this work, we demonstrate that including fluctuations in the IC may lead to an enhancement of the thermal photon yield of about a factor of 2 in the region $2 < p_T < 4$ GeV/$c$ (where thermal photon production dominates the direct photon yield) compared to a scenario using smooth, averaged IC. Consequently, a better agreement with PHENIX data is found. This can be understood in terms of the strong temperature dependence of thermal photon production, translating into a sensitivity to the presence of 'hotspots' in an event and thus establishing thermal photons as a suitable probe to characterize IC fluctuations.\r\nRef:arXiv:1102.4706[Hep-ph].",

      "Abstract": "The effects of non-zero baryon density are expected to become important\r\nin hydrodynamic modeling of heavy collisions below the highest energy at RHIC. Recent calculations in effective models and in QCD using Dyson Schwinger equation suggest that the transition in QCD remains a crossover up to baryon chemical potentials of about 800MeV [1]. If so, the equation of state relevant for hydrodynamic models can be calculated on the lattice using Taylor expansion. However, there are large cutoff effects in present lattice calculations for non-zero chemical potentials.\r\n\r\nWe employ the lattice QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients [2] to extend our previous parametrization of the equation of state [3] to finite baryon density. When we take into account lattice spacing and quark mass dependence of the hadron masses [3], the Taylor coefficients at low temperature are equal to those of hadron resonance gas. Therefore we require require that the equation of state is smoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state at low temperatures. Some preliminary results were reported in [4]. \r\nWe also show how the hydrodynamical evolution is affected by this equation of state in the energy range relevant for SPS and the RHIC energy scan.\r\n\r\n[1] T.K.

In this new energy regime, charmonium could reveal a privileged probe to study the properties of the high-density strongly interacting system formed in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions [2].\r\nBottomonium resonances will be abundantly produced, providing new constrains on theoretical models of quarkonium dissociation in QCD matter [1]. Additionally, ALICE will study quarkonium production in proton-proton collisions in which high particle multiplicity events could lead to the formation of high energy density matter as in heavy ions collisions [3].\r\nIn ALICE [4], quarkonium is measured down to pT = 0 via their mu+mu\u2212 decay channels in the ALICE muon spectrometer and via their e+e- in the ALICE central barrel. After a short description of the apparatus, the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of inclusive J/Psi production cross section in proton-proton collisions at LHC energies will be presented. We will discuss the dependence on charged particle multiplicity of J/Psi yield in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV.\r\nThe number of reconstructed tracklets (\u03b7<1.6) in the silicon pixel detector is exploited to measure the charged particle density at mid- rapidity. Finally, the analysis of the inclusive J/Psi production in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre of mass energy of sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV will be described.

Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s)=2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented in intervals of collision centrality. The charged particle spectra are compared to those measured in pp collisions at the same collision energy, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions. This comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor R_AA. The results indicate only weak medium effects in peripheral collisions, while there is clear evidence for strong medium effects in central collisions. In this talk we will present the results of an analysis of the full Pb-Pb statistics obtained in the Nov. 2010 run.

At LO direct photons are produced in quark-gluon Compton scattering and quark-antiquark annihilation, the NLO processes are dominating in bremsstrahlung and fragmentation photon production and jet  re-interaction in medium, QGP and hot hadronic stage emit thermal photons.  Correlated measurements of the  transverse momentum dependence of direct photon production in collisions of different species and of  underlying event observables, like isolation or  flow,  as well as the nuclear modification factor may give insight into the relative contribution from various production mechanisms. \r\n\r\nExtracting the direct photon signal from the large hadron decay  background is experimentally challenging particularly at lower transverse momenta and  high multiplicities.  PHENIX used a combination of techniques based upon virtual (via low to intermediate mass e+e- pairs) and real (neutral clusters in calorimeters and reconstructed e+e- pairs from photon conversions) photon measurements to determine direct photon yields in the range of transverse momenta up to about 20 GeV/c for a wide range of energies and  colliding species. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we present recent PHENIX results on total direct photon production in pp, dA and AA collisions with emphasis on azimuthal correlations  and nuclear modification.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in dynamics and thermodynamics of  non-Abelian plasmas at both very high temperature and density. It is expected that a specific state of matter with unconfined quarks and gluons - the so called quark - gluon plasma (QGP) - can exist. The most fundamental way to compute properties of the strongly interacting matter is provided by the lattice QCD. Interpretation of these very complicated computations requires application of various QCD motivated, albeit schematic, models simulating various aspects of the full theory. Moreover, such models are needed in cases when the lattice QCD fails, e.g. at large baryon chemical potentials and out of equilibrium. A semi-classical approximation, based on a point like quasi-particle picture has been recently introduced in literature. It is expected that it allows to treat soft processes in the QGP which are not accessible by the perturbative means and the main features of non-Abelian plasmas can be understood in simple semi-classical terms without the difficulties inherent to a full quantum field theoretical analysis.  \r\nHere we propose stochastic simulation of thermodynamics and kinetic properties  for  QGP  in semi-classical approximation in the wide region of temperature, density and quasi-particles masses. We extend previous classical nonrelativistic simulations based on a color Coulomb interaction to the quantum regime and take  into account the Fermi (Bose) statistics of quarks (gluons) and quantum degeneracy self-consistently. \r\nIn grand canonical ensemble for finite and zero baryon chemical potential we use the direct quantum path integral Monte Carlo method (PIMC) developed for finite temperature within Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics to do calculations of internal energy, pressure and pair correlation functions. The QGP quasi-particles representing dressed quarks, antiquarks and gluons interact via color quantum  Kelbg pseudopotential rigorously derived in for Coulomb particles. This method has been successfully applied to strongly coupled electrodynamic plasmas (EMP) . A strongly correlated behavior of the QGP is expected to show up in long-ranged spatial correlations of quarks and gluons which, in fact, may give rise to liquid-like and, possibly, solid-like structures. This expectation is based on a very similar behavior observed in electrodynamic plasmas. \r\nWe have done already the first calculation of the QGP equation of state, spatial and color pair distribution functions, diffusion coefficients and shear viscosity. The preliminary results has already been reported and discussed at the  international conferences and meetings and are accepted for publications.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are considered as one of the essential probes to study the interior of a QGP. The experimental observables contain only the combined information about the expansion of the system and the elementary interaction of heavy quarks with the plasma constituants. In order to asses the latter, we have to understand the influence of different expansion scenarios on the observables. In practice, models proposed by various groups for interpreting RHIC heavy quark data should be thoroughly compared before one can progress towards the understanding of LHC data. In this contribution we report on the joint effort of SUBATECH and TAMU in this respect: We study the impact of different Quark-Gluon Plasma expansion scenarios in heavy-ion collisions on spectra and elliptic flow of heavy quarks. For identical heavy-quark transport coefficients relativistic Langevin simulations with different expansion scenarios can lead to appreciable variations in the calculated suppression and elliptic flow of the heavy-quark spectra, by up to a factor of two. A cross comparison with two sets of transport coefficients supports these findings, illustrating the importance of realistic expansion models for quantitative evaluations of heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions. It also turns out that differences in freeze-out prescriptions and Langevin realizations play a significant role in these variations. Light-quark observables are essential in reducing the uncertainties associated with the bulk-matter evolution, even though uncertainties due to the freeze-out prescription persist.\r\n\r\nRef: arXiv:1102.1114, submitted to PRC",

Heavy hadrons have a larger probability to be produced within the quark gluon plasma phase due to their short formation times. Heavy mass, high momentum resonances from jet fragmentation are more likely to be affected by the chirally symmetric medium, and the identification of the early produced resonances from jet fragmentation might be a viable option to study chirality [1]. Two particle correlations in di-jet cones can be used to distinguish between in-medium and in-vacuum fragmentation by assuming that the nearside correlations are surface biased whereas the away-side of a di-jet is likely interacting with the partonic medium.\r\nIn the analysis a single high pt hadron is chosen as a jet leading particle. Then the correlations of phi(1020) and K*(892), identified by their hadronic decay, with this leading particle have been studied in pp collisions at 7 TeV. The characteristics of these resonances (mass and width) as a function of the resonance correlation angle have been extracted both on the near side and the away side.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] C.

      "Abstract": "ALICE is the experiment dedicated to the study of the quark gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Improvement of ALICE sub-detectors for the upgrade plans of the year 2017 are ongoing. The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is a proposal in view of this upgrade. The MFT is a Silicon pixels detector added in the Muon spectrometer acceptance (-4$<$eta$<$-2.5) upstream of the hadronic absorber. The MFT upgrade is motivated by several physics improvements. The measurement of the DCA (Distance of Closest Approach) of single muons and secondary vertex from dimuons will permit the identification of open charm (ctau~ 150 microns) and beauty (ctau ~ 500 microns) mesons. The MFT, thanks to its tracking capabilities, will allow to improve the mass resolution of the resonances for a better separation between rho/omega and phi, jpsi and psi prime,and upsilon family resonances. In addition, it will help to reject a large fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over background ratio. Moreover, the MFT will lead to the direct multiplicity measurement, event by event, of charged particles within the spectrometer acceptance. In order to evaluate the feasability of this upgrade, five Silicon planes were simulated within the AliRoot framework. Effects of multiple scattering in the absorber and L3 magnetic field on muons in the MFT will be shown. A detailed study of the influence of the beam pipe geometry on secondary particles production was performed. Performances of the MFT in terms of occupancy rates in the pixel plans, secondary vertex measurement, improvement of the dimuon invariant mass resolution were established. The method used for tracking in the planes and matching between the muon tracks and MFT tracks will also be presented.",

      "Abstract": "For large Reynolds number (which is inverse to viscosity), fluids are known to develop turbulence. Therefore, the phenomenological evidence for a small viscosity suggests that the hydrodynamical description of heavy ion collisions may have a turbulent regime. Assuming that averaged velocities are described by Bjorkens model, we investigate local fluctuations around it. These perturbations are governed by non-linear equations and we characterize classes of qualitatively different evolution in terms of Reynolds numbers. Perturbations at different rapidities are found to decouple quickly, and the local evolution becomes effectively two-dimensional. The resulting Navier-Stokes equation of non-relativistic form (obtained after suitable coordinate transformations) can be discussed within the theory of Kolmogorov and Kraichnan. In particular, unlike three-dimensional turbulent flow, two-dimensional viscous fluid dynamics can show the interesting phenomenon of inverse cascading of energy into large scale structures. We speculate on possible phenomenological implications of these findings.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC show strong medium-induced modifications of high-pT single inclusive hadron spectra, jet-like particle correlations and reconstructed jets.\r\nA dynamical understanding of these jet quenching phenomena is typically sought within a partonic picture in which the energy of highly energetic parent partons is degraded due to\r\nmultiple inelastic and/or elastic interactions inside QCD matter.\r\nIn the current model implementations of this parton energy loss the hadronization process is unaffected by it on account that for sufficiently energetic projectiles time dilation should guarantee their hadronization outside the medium.\r\nHowever, as it has been pointed out before, the interaction of a colored parton with a QCD medium modifies the color flow of the parton shower and arguably can imprint on the hadronization process at much higher transverse momentum than estimated previously. \r\nIn this context, we present here the first QCD-based calculation of medium-induced color flow. \r\nDecomposing the multiple scattering diagrams of the BDMPS-Z formalism for parton energy loss into color-singlet 'prehadronic' systems, we observe that (in comparison to vacuum fragmentation) medium-induced\r\neffects do not only degrade the longitudinal momentum of these color-singlet systems but also strongly enhance their invariant mass. The larger the invariant mass of a color-singlet at the end of\r\nthe perturbative evolution, the more likely it is for such system to decay into a larger number of hadronic fragments and thus leave a smaller fraction of the total available energy to the leading hadron.\r\nTherefore, for multi-partonic states that show the same kinematic distributions at the end of the perturbative evolution, medium-modified color flow can be a significant additional source of\r\nmedium-induced multiplicity increase and medium-induced degradation of the leading hadron.\r\nWe illustrate this general observation in simple models. We also identify a color flow specific formation time argument that indicates that effects of color-flow induced additional suppression\r\ncan persist over transverse energies up to tens of GeV, and may contribute to an enhanced slope of the nuclear modification factor.",

      "Abstract": "Much of our understanding of the collision dynamics at RHIC and LHC relies\r\non contrasting hydrodynamic or hydro+transport calculations with\r\nexperimental data. For example, early evidence for rapid thermalization\r\nand quark-gluon plasma phase transition at RHIC came from particle spectra      \r\nand the pion-proton splitting of differential elliptic flow. An inevitable\r\ncomponent in these calculations is the conversion of the fluid to\r\nparticles. For an ideal fluid the conversion is straightforward (the usual\r\ncaveats of the Cooper-Frye treatment aside) because the phase space\r\ndistributions are locally thermal for each species. For a viscous fluid,\r\nhowever, an infinite class of phase space corrections can reproduce the \r\nsame hydrodynamic variables, even in a one-component system.\r\n\r\nPresent viscous hydrodynamic calculations routinely assume that phase\r\nspace corrections induced by shear stress are quadratic in momentum and   \r\nthat they have the same coefficient for all particle species (\"democratic\"\r\nGrad ansatz), independently of microscopic details. However, in a gas of  \r\nhadrons, equilibration is driven by scattering rates - species that\r\nscatter rarely tend to be further away from local equilibrium than those\r\nthat scatter often.\r\n\r\nWe will present results from fully nonlinear covariant transport theory\r\nfor the phase space corrections in an expanding multicomponent gas, and\r\ntest the validity of Grad's quadratic ansatz and of the \"democratic\"   \r\nassumption for sharing viscous effects between species. The findings will\r\nbe compared to phase space corrections from linear response theory, which\r\nis applicable for small gradients and small deviations from local\r\nequilibrium. Finally, we will show how dynamical phase space corrections\r\naffect basic identified particle observables (spectra and elliptic flow)\r\nin the framework of viscous hydrodynamics.",

In the saddlepoint approximation these probes are computed in AdS space in terms of invariant geometric objects -- geodesics, minimal surfaces and minimal volumes.    Our calculations for two dimensional field theories are analytical.   In our strongly coupled setting, all probes in all dimensions share certain universal features in their thermalization: (1) a slight delay in the onset of thermalization, (2) an apparent non-analyticity at the endpoint of thermalization, (3) top-down thermalization where the UV thermalizes first.   For homogeneous initial conditions the entanglement entropy thermalizes slowest, and sets a time scale for equilibration that saturates a causality bound over the range of scales studied.  The growth rate of entanglement entropy density is nearly volume-independent for small volumes, but slows for larger volumes.",

While such accuracy is desirable for leading particle tomography, it is absolutely essential for the new jet observables. With this motivation, we present results and predictions at NLO for the recent LHC lead-lead (Pb+Pb) run at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. Specifically, we focus on the suppression\u00a0the single and double inclusive jet cross sections and demonstrate how the di-jet asymmetry, recently measured by ATLAS and CMS, can be related to these general results. The case of jets tagged by an electroweak boson is exemplified by the Z0+jet channel. We predict a signature transition from enhancement to suppression of the tagged jet\u00a0reflective of the medium-induced modification of parton showers. We also present NLO results relevant to the inclusive Z0 data obtained by the CMS collaboration. Our analysis includes not only final-state inelastic parton interactions in the QGP, but also initial-state cold nuclear matter effects and non-perturbative hadronization corrections. Finally, we clarify the relation between the suppression of inclusive jets, tagged jets and di-jets and the quenching of inclusive particles on the example of the recent ALICE neutral pion attenuation data. \u00a0We\u00a0conclude by discussing\u00a0future directions and effective theories of QCD that can help improve the accuracy of the theoretical tools for jet tomography.",

      "Abstract": "Fluctuations of conserved charges are key probes of the chiral\r\nphase transition in a QCD medium. Of particular phenomenological importance are studies of such fluctuations at finite baryon density. A valuable tool for assessing critical fluctuations and the thermodynamics at non-vanishing baryon density is provided by effective chiral models.\r\n\r\nWe consider the Polyakov loop-extended two flavors chiral quark--meson model (PQM) and discuss  critical phenomena related with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The model is explored beyond the mean-field approximation in the functional renormalisation group (FRG) approach.\r\n\r\nWe formulate and solve the renormalization group flow equation for the scale-dependent thermodynamic potential in the presence of the gluonic background field at finite temperature and density [1] and determine the phase diagram of the PQM model in the FRG approach [2]. We also consider properties of the net-quark number density fluctuations as well as their higher cumulants [3] and discuss the influence of nonperturbative effects on their properties near the chiral crossover transition. With increasing net-quark number density, the higher order cumulants show a strong dependence on the chiral crossover transition. This is illustrated by exploring the ratios of moments of net-baryon number and electric charge  fluctuations. We discuss their role as probes of deconfinement and the chiral phase transition in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] V. Skokov, B. Stokic, B. Friman, K.

      "Abstract": "Dileptons are valuable probes in the investigation of the hot and\r\ndense matter formed in heavy ion collisions, since they interact only electromagnetically and thus their path from the interaction region to the detectors is almost undisturbed. They can provide information about the matter properties in the early stages of the collisions where deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are expected to take place. However, the measurements of dileptons in heavy ion collisions are challenging due to the overwhelming yield of pi0 Dalitz decays and photon conversions, which produce a large combinatorial background especially in the low invariant mass region (m_ee<1 GeV/c^2).\r\n\r\nThe PHENIX spectrometer has been upgraded with a Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) with the purpose of reducing the combinatorial background from the dielectron mass spectrum. The HBD is a windowless Cherenkov detector, operating with pure CF_4, using triple GEM elements with a CsI photocathode and pad readout. The HBD reduces the combinatorial background by exploiting the small opening angle of the pi0 Dalitz and conversion pairs. It was successfully operated during Run 9 and Run 10 at RHIC in the measurements of e+e- pairs in p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=200 GeV and in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV, 62 GeV and 39 GeV.

The working principles, the strategies for signal extraction, and excellent performance of the central barrel detectors in a high-multiplicity environment will be presented. The particle identification of the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) are based on the specific energy loss whereas the Time-Of-Flight detector (TOF) determines the particle velocity by measuring its flight time. Thus low momenta charged kaons, pions, protons, deuterons, tritons, helium-nuclei, and their respective anti-particles can be identified from 100 MeV/c up to several GeV/c in momentum and the corresponding spectra and yields can be extracted. Weak decays of strange particles can be identified via their particular kink and V0 topologies and the precise determination of the first and secondary vertices. The pT-reach of hadron identification can be extended using Cherenkov-radiation in the High Momentum Particle Identification detector (HMPID) and by the relativistic rise in the ionization measurement of the TPC. Electron identification at higher momenta is achieved by the detection of transition radiation in the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD).",

      "Abstract": "In the chiral limit and at temperatures close to the QCD phase transition temperature physical observables are expected to show universal properties that are  controlled by the symmetry class of a 3-dimensional O(4) spin model [1]. Higher moments of net baryon number as well as electric charge fluctuations are sensitive to these universal features of the chiral phase transition [2]. \r\n\r\nThe sixth order moments are the first moments which will diverge in the chiral limit at the QCD phase transition temperature. At non-zero values of the light quark masses the sixth order moment of baryon number fluctuations has a  pronounced minimum at a pseudo-critical temperature which is close to the temperature where fluctuations of the chiral order parameter are the largest.\r\n\r\nWe present a calculation of the O(4) scaling functions that control scaling properties of the net baryon number fluctuations [3]. Using these universal scaling functions as well as PNJL model calculations [4] we show that  the sixth order moment of baryon number fluctuations is negative in the vicinity of the pseudo-critical temperature for the chiral transition and present new results from lattice calculations using the highly improved staggered fermion action (hisq). These QCD results are in striking contrast to hadron resonance gas model calculations. We conjecture that higher order moments of net baryon number and electric charge fluctuations are well suited to characterize freeze-out conditions in heavy ion collisions. Their experimental analysis in low-energy runs at RHIC as well as at LHC will allow to verify to what extent freeze-out occurs from a thermal medium close to criticality.\r\n\r\n[1]  O.

The number of charged hadrons was obtained by two different methods based on the inner silicon pixel system of the CMS detector at the LHC. One technique involved counting the number of reconstructed single particle hits in the pixel detector, while the other formed hit pairs ('tracklets') from the different detector layers. The two methods are in excellent agreement. For the transverse energy measurement, CMS has almost hermetic calorimetry coverage with fine granularity and excellent resolution. In addition for particles near central rapidity momenta from the tracker can be combined with the calorimeter data to give a significant improvement of the system resolution. The measurements is compared with heavy-ion results from earlier experiments, where a smooth dependence on the collision energy is observed.

The single gluon emission spectrum from a hard quark due to multiple scattering in a medium is evaluated as a power series in inverse powers of the virtuality of the hard jet. Retaining corrections up to next to leading power, we calculate the medium modified fragmentation function by resumming the effect of multiple gluon emissions in a virtuality ordered DGLAP like evolution equation. This new formalism is applied to the computation of the $R_{AA}$ in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The medium is modeled using viscous 2+1D fluid dynamics which has been tuned to describe both the spectra and the $v_{2}$ at a $p_T$ < 2 GeV. The sole parameter of the calculation $\\hat{q}$ is set proportional to the entropy density and is found to be approximately $2$ GeV$^{2}/fm$ at a plasma temperature of $T=350$ MeV. Using this we obtain a satisfactory description of the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the $R_{AA}$ at RHIC as well as its dependence on the azimuthal angle. With no change in parameters we obtain a natural description of the rising $R_{AA}$ as measured by the ALICE collaboration at the LHC.

Using the same event plane method for obtaining $v_2$ as in the data analysis, we can reproduce both the measured centrality dependence and the $p_T$ shape of charged-particle elliptic flow up to $p_T\\sim2$~GeV. We also consider the relation of elliptic flow to the initial state eccentricity using different reference planes, and discuss the correlation between the physical event plane and the initial participant plane. Our results demonstrate that event-by-event hydrodynamics with initial state fluctuations must be accounted for before a meaningful lower limit for viscosity can be obtained from elliptic flow data.",

Experimentally heavy quarks are found to suffer a considerable energy loss in the QCD medium with the nuclear modification factor for non-photonic electrons (NPE) from heavy quark decays much smaller than unity in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. To better understand the heavy flavor production and energy loss mechanism it is crucial to determine experimentally the relative contributions of Charm and Bottom meson decays to NPE and to study detailed characteristics of heavy quark interactions with the bulk QCD medium.\r\nWe will present the STAR measurements of relative charm and bottom contributions to NPE from p+p collisions at 200 and 500 GeV energies. We report the total bottom quark production cross section from p+p collisions at 200 GeV extracted from NPE spectrum and B to D ratios. We will also present the NPE-hadron correlations from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV from the 2010 RHIC run where we have collected high statistics data set with low photonic conversion background. The evolution of the NPE-hadron azimuthal angular correlation as a function of collision centralities and in comparison with that from d+Au collisions will be indicative of dynamics of heavy quark interactions with the QCD medium created in Au+Au collisions. Comparisons with theoretical calculations will also be discussed.",

      "Speaker": "Akihiko Monnai",
      "Institute": "The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The heavy ion program at LHC opened up a new era in the physics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at higher energies. One of the most unique properties of the hot matter is the near-perfect fluidity, which was first discovered in Au-Au collisions at RHIC [1]. Relativistic hydrodynamic analyses on the momentum anisotropy of transverse collective flow revealed that small viscosity in the QGP is essential when the initial conditions are constructed from the color glass condensate (CGC), the description of saturated gluons in the nuclei before collisions. On the other hand, the dynamics of the longitudinal flow has scarcely been discussed so far due to the numerical difficulties of the non-boost invariant viscous hydrodynamic analyses in relativistic coordinates. Since the CGC itself is considered to be successful in reproducing the observed rapidity distributions and multiplicities at RHIC, it would be indispensable to investigate the longitudinal hydrodynamic evolution for the CGC. \r\n\r\nWe develop a viscous hydrodynamic model with both shear and bulk viscosity and solve the full second-order constitutive equations [2] in the longitudinal direction with the relativistic coordinates using a novel numerical approach. The estimations are performed with the CGC-type initial distributions for both RHIC and LHC settings. The results exhibit visible and non-trivial deformations of the CGC rapidity distributions during the hydrodynamic stage due to the interplay between two factors: (i) Entropy production from non-equilibrium processes and (ii) entropy flux to the forward rapidity caused by non-boost invariance [3]. We find difference in the hydrodynamic effects at RHIC and LHC, which implies that readjustment of the CGC parameters might be necessary. This would be one of the possible explanations for the fact that the CGC predictions tend to underestimate the multiplicity at mid-rapidity observed in the Pb-Pb collisions at LHC experiments [4]. The results indicate that non-boost invariant hydrodynamic evolution together with viscosity is indispensable for understanding the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions as a whole. We also obtain several important numerical insights towards a full (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model for the more quantitative analyses.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/PR_display.asp?prID=05-38\r\n[2] A.

      "Abstract": "The STAR Collaboration has identified eight key questions that will drive RHIC science during the coming decade, six of which involve ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.  What is the nature of the initial state in nuclear collisions?  What are the properties of the strongly-coupled system produced at RHIC, and how does it thermalize?  Are the interactions of energetic partons with QCD matter characterized by weak or strong coupling, and what is the detailed mechanism for partonic energy loss?  Where is the QCD critical point and the associated first-order phase transition line?  Can we strengthen current evidence for novel symmetries in QCD matter and open new avenues?  What exotic particles are created at RHIC?  The STAR detector, with its large acceptance tracking, calorimetry, and particle identification, is an ideal tool to explore these questions.  Complete answers nonetheless will require detector upgrades.  Near-term upgrades, including the Heavy Flavor Tracker and Muon Telescope Detector, will enable a rich program of heavy flavor physics.  Upgrades to the forward region will enable detailed studies of the partonic structure of nuclei and the onset of gluon saturation.  An additional suite of upgrades during the latter part of the decade will position STAR to make crucial measurements in e+p and e+A collisions during the early phase of eRHIC.  The talk will provide an overview of this STAR decadal plan.",

More specifically, the propagation of c and b quarks in the plasma (whose evolution is supposed to be described by relativistic hydrodynamics) is followed by solving the relativistic Langevin equation within a picture of multiple uncorrelated random collisions. The relevant heavy-quark transport coefficients are given a microscopic evaluation within the Hard Thermal Loop approximation, supplemented by a kinetic pQCD calculation for hard collisions.\r\nThe results obtained with this approach turned out to be in reasonable \r\nagreement with the experimental data obtained at RHIC, in particular \r\nfor the R_AA of non-photonic electrons.\r\nHere we extend the above study to the LHC case, at the current center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV. The first data on primary charged particle density obtained by the ALICE collaboration (dN_ch/deta~1600 in central PbPb collisions) allow to provide an estimate of the initial conditions of the hydrodynamical evolution of the background medium.

However, a complete theory of jets in a hot and dense partonic environment remains to be developed. Such a theory is needed in Heavy-Ion Collisions (HIC), at RHIC and now at the LHC, in order to have a clean access to the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). \r\n\r\nTo this end, we have investigated medium modification of the radiation pattern of a quark-antiquark antenna traversing a dense medium in order to understand how the QGP alters color coherence which is an important feature of the intRAjet structure in vacuum. In contrast to gluon radiation in vacuum, and unexpectedly, we find a strict geometrical separation between in-vacuum and medium-induced gluon radiation. Also, a soft logarithmic divergence appears pointing to the possibility of resuming multiple gluon branching in the cascade. Moreover, in the case of an opaque medium near the unitarity bound, a simple and intuitive physical picture arises : the interaction with the QGP leads to the gradual decoherence of the pair yielding a universal radiation pattern which does not depend on the initial color configuration of the antenna. \r\nThese results are in qualitative agreement with the recent  ATLAS and CMS data and provide a starting point for further studies on in-medium  jet modification.",

But the study of the interference effects, the building block of the QCD jet calculation in vacuum, between different radiators has been missing for quite a long time. In this work we calculate, in the eikonal approximation, the gluon radiation spectrum off a quark-antiquark antenna passing through a deconfined QCD plasma with the masses of the quark and antiquark turned on. The massive quark-antiquark antenna involves both the dead cone effect and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, and takes into account the correlation between both of the emitters leading to an additional strong suppression of gluon radiation at angles smaller than the opening angle of the quark-antiquark pair. Furthermore, the quark-antiquark antenna spectrum is infrared divergent. We calculate the medium-induced energy loss of heavy quarks (charm and bottom) and compare it to well-known results (BDMPS/GLV). The implications on jet quenching observables in heavy ion collisions are also discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The study of the production of low mass vector and pseudoscalar mesons in proton-nucleus collisions represents a natural baseline for the heavy-ion observations, allowing to provide a reference in an environment of cold nuclear matter. In-medium modifications of the vector meson spectral functions were actually predicted to occur also in cold nuclear matter, though the experimental evidence at the moment is controversial. Proton-nucleus collisions also give access to the study of strangeness production as a function of the size of the nucleus, providing a robust ground for strangeness enhancement in nuclear collisions. Besides that, the study of the nuclear dependence of particle properties in proton-nucleus collisions, as the transverse momentum spectra and the production cross sections, is an effective tool to understand the dynamics of soft hadron interactions.\r\n\r\nThe NA60 experiment has collected an unprecedented statistics of 180000 low mass muon pairs in proton-nucleus data at $\\sqrt{s} = 27.5$~GeV exposing to the beam six target materials: Be, Cu, In, W, Pb and~U. The very good statistical accuracy and dimuon mass resolution allowed us to perform a precision measurement of the $\\rho$ line shape related the $T$ parameter of the Boltzmann factor, which was measured for the first time in p-A collisions. The $\\rho-\\omega$ interference was also investigated and preliminary results are reported. No evidence of in-medium effects is found. In addition, the electromagnetic transition form factors of the $\\eta$ and $\\omega$ mesons were also measured, with a significant precision improvement with respect to the previous measurements.

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "Event-by-event fluctuations of hadron ratios characterize the hadro-chemical composition of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This makes the fluctuation signal sensitive to changes in the underlying structure of matter, and phase transition effects in particular. In the SPS energy range, inclusive hadronic observables indicate the onset of the deconfinement phase transition [1], making ratio fluctuations a promising observable to further characterize the transition and possibly reveal signatures of the conjectured critical point as suggested by lattice calculations of quark number susceptibilities at finite mu_B [2]. Kaons and protons carry large parts of the conserved quantities strangeness and baryon number. Their correlation, reflected in the kaon-to-proton ratio fluctuations, is expected to undergo a significant change at the anticipated parton-hadron phase boundary [3].\r\nResults on (K+ + K\u2212)/(p + pbar) and K+/p fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions will be presented for the first time. At 5 energies between sqrt(s_NN) = 6.3 and 17.3 GeV, sigma_dyn has been evaluated in central Pb+Pb collisions. For both ratios, a fast transition from positive sigma_dyn at low SPS energies to negative values at the higher energies is observed, an energy dependence that is not reproduced by hadronic models. While hadronic transport models predict almost constant fluctuations in the SPS energy range, a multiplicity scaling as suggested in [4] is also incompatible with the data. This study is complemented by new results on the centrality dependence of ratio fluctuations at sqrt(s_NN) = 17.3 GeV, which confirm the systematics recently reported at RHIC energies [5].\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] C.

      "Abstract": "Non-central heavy ion collisions at RHIC create an anisotropic participant zone of QCD matter under extreme conditions of energy and matter density.  While this zone is initially out-of-plane-extended, pressure gradients cause the hot, dense medium to expand preferentially in plane.  Over time, this expansion makes the shape more spherical, perhaps even becoming extended in the in-plane direction.  The change in shape is determined by the expansion and freeze-out time scales which depend, in part, on the early pressure gradients.  As a result, the freeze-out shape may provide a sensitive probe of the Equation of State of hot QCD matter.\r\n\r\n     The recent RHIC Beam Energy Scan at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 7.7, 11.5, and 39 GeV provides an opportunity to explore the energy dependence of the freeze out eccentricity.  The new low energy data from STAR complements high statistics data sets at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 62.4 and 200 GeV.  The dependence of the HBT radius parameters on azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane have been extracted.  These dependences can be related to the freeze out eccentricity within the context of a blast wave model.  We will present STAR's most recent results on azimuthally-dependent HBT across a wide range of energies.",

Our results demonstrate that electron pair emission in small collision systems, such as C+C, can  essentially  be explained as a superposition of independent N+N collisions with a dominant contribution from the p-n channel. \r\n\r\nThe comparison of the N+N reference spectrum with the di-electron invariant-mass distribution measured in Ar+KC collisions shows a pronounced excess radiation. The properties of the excess as a function of the transverse mass are quantified. \r\n\r\nFurther medium effects have been investigated in p+Nb interactions at 3.5 GeV by a direct comparison to p+p reactions measured at the same energy. Differential dielectron production cross sections have been extracted and can be compared in detail in the pi^{0},  eta and the vector meson regions. The results will be discussed and compared to the ones obtained in photo-induced reactions.\r\n   \r\nIntriguing results were also obtained from the reconstruction of hadrons with open and hidden strangeness in Ar+KCl collisions. While the measured abundance of all reconstructed particles are well described assuming thermalization, the also reconstructed double-strange baryon Xi^{-} appears about ten times more abundant than expected. Also, the phi/omega ratio is much larger than the one measured in N-N collisions and does not require any OZI suppression.\r\n\r\nFurther investigations of compressed nuclear matter by means of di-electrons as penetrating probes and strangeness production will be followed up over the forthcoming years with an upgraded HADES detector in Au+Au and  Ag+Ag collisions.",

We investigated the appearance of non-perturbative hadron production channels connected to the formation of strong non-abelian fields, and their strength at RHIC and LHC energies.

I will present new results of an HTLpt calculation of QCD thermodynamics to three loops. The results of this calculation are consistent with lattice data down to 2-3T_c. This is a non-trivial result since, in this temperature regime, the QCD coupling constant is neither infinitesimally weak nor infinitely strong with g~2, or equivalently alpha_s~0.3. Therefore, we have a crucial test of the quasiparticle picture in the intermediate coupling regime.

      "Abstract": "The high-energy behavior of amplitudes in gauge theories can be reformulated in terms \r\nof the evolution of Wilson-line operators. In the leading order this evolution is governed by the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. \r\nIn order to see if this equation is relevant for existing or future DIS accelerators\r\n(like EIC or LeHC) one needs to know how large are the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections. \r\nIn addition, the NLO corrections define the scale of the running-coupling constant in the BK equation and therefore determine the magnitude\r\nof the leading-order cross sections.\r\nTo obtain then the structure function for DIS off a large nucleus at the NLO accuracy in $\\alpha_s$, \r\nwe calculate the NLO contribution to the BK equation\r\nand the NLO photon impact factor, \r\nrelated to the probability of the virtual photon to split in a quark anti-quark pair before scattering off the target.\r\nWe obtain for the first time an analytic expression in coordinate space of the NLO photon impact factor.",

Therefore, the differential elliptic v_2(p_T) vs. v_2^(I_AA)(p_T) moment correlation between the 2nd moment of monojet R_AA and dijet I_AA nuclear modifications factors remains the most sensitive probe to differentiate between Glauber and CGC/KLN initial state sQGP geometries.",

      "Abstract": "The ALICE experiment is specifically designed for the study of strongly interacting matter as created in heavy ion collisions at LHC. With some of its particular features, like the very good measurement of low momentum particles and the particle identification capabilities it also provides unique measurements in p+p collisions. However, very recent developments in heavy ion physics suggest that some more enhanced measurement capabilities will be strongly desirable to obtain a deeper understanding of the new matter created.\r\nALICE is setting up a program of detector upgrades, which could to a large extent be installed in the long LHC shutdown foreseen for 2017/18, to address these new scientific challenges. Projects considered include an upgrade of the inner tracking system (ITS), the installation of a new forward calorimeter (FOCAL), the extension of the muon spectrometer (MFT, muon forward tracker), the installation of a detector with enhanced particle identification at high momentum (VHMPID), and additional detectors enhancing the capabilities for diffractive physics (AD = ALICE Diffractive). An increased rate capability of the largest detector in ALICE, the time projection chamber (TPC), is also under investigation, and it is foreseen to improve the data acquisition and high level trigger systems (DAQ & HLT) to achieve more bandwidth and to use more sophisticated and complex triggers. We will discuss the scientific frontiers and will present the corresponding upgrade projects under study for the ALICE experiment.",

These include initial state effects like shadowing and parton energy loss and final state effects like J/psi breakup in the collisions with cold nuclear matter.\r\n\r\nTo evaluate these, NA60 has measured J/psi production in p-A collisions at SPS energies with seven nuclear targets. In this analysis the J/psi cross section has been compared with open-charm production that is detected in the NA60 experiment through the simultaneous semi-muonic decay of D meson pairs. The comparison of the production of closed-charm with its natural reference allows to have some insight on how the interplay of the different processes gives rise to the observed (effective) J/psi suppression.",

An analysis of the first ALICE pp data where charged particle, \u03c00 and isolated photon are used as trigger particles will be presented. These measurements will serve as a reference for the same measurements in Pb-Pb collisions. A sensitivity of the associated particle momentum projection into the direction of the trigger particle, xE = \u2212p\u20d7Th\u00b1 \u00b7 p\u20d7Ttrig / | p\u20d7Ttrig |2, can be used to extract the average trigger particle momentum fraction and the jet imbalance function, whereas the \u03b3-hadron correlations can be used to study the jet fragmentation function directly. The quest for the nuclear modification of the partonic properties in heavy ion collisions, using above mentioned quantities, will be also outlined.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] D. Boer and W.

      "Abstract": "From phenomenological considerations, J/psi suppression was proposed \r\nas a signature of QGP production in relativistic heavy ion collisions, \r\nand has been considered as one of the most promising ones [1]. \r\nHowever recent lattice QCD calculations show that charmonia survive even above the \r\ncritical temperature [2], which presents the possibility that the scenario of J/psi \r\nsuppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions may change. \r\nTo understand the relativistic heavy ion collision physics we need to take into account \r\ndynamics of the fireball which is produced after collisions. Therefore the detailed study \r\non spectral functions of charmonia at finite momenta from the first principle \r\ncalculation would shed light on the understanding of the J/psi suppression mechanism \r\nin relativistic heavy ion collisions. \r\n\r\nWe study the charmonium spectral functions at finite momenta in the quark-gluon \r\nplasma on 64^3 \u00d7 N_t(=96(T/Tc=0.78),54(1.38),46(1.62),40(1.87),32(2.33)) \r\nquenched anisotropic lattices with anisotropy a_s /a_t= 4, analyzing correlation \r\nfunctions of charmonia by the maximum entropy method (MEM) which is a \r\nvery useful and powerful tool to analyze spectral functions from lattice QCD simulations [3]. \r\nWe show detailed features of charmonium spectral functions of  pseudoscalar and \r\nvector channels and modification of the dispersion relation \r\nat finite momenta and discuss medium effect on them in QGP. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] T.

      "Abstract": "A color glass condensate (CGC) model for particle productions at collider energies is confronted with the data at RHIC and LHC. When applying the CGC picture to high-energy scatterings at LHC (or higher) energies, we need to include the effects of the running coupling and the transverse expansion of the colliding hadrons. These two are appropriately incorporated here. Main features of our model include\r\n1) fluctuations of the transverse positions of the nucleons in the projectile,\r\n2) the Gaussian shape for the transverse profile of a nucleon to account for the transverse expansion of the nucleon with increasing energy, and\r\n3) the x-evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution by the running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov (rcBK) equation which is applied locally in the impact parameter space. We study the influence of initial condition for rcBK equation on particle production in high energy hadronic collisions. Specifically, the initial conditions provided by i) the naive McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model and ii) the running coupling MV model with adjustable\r\nparameters are examined. The use of running-coupling MV model as the initial condition is necessary for the consistency with the evolution equation which includes the effects of the running coupling.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic nuclear collisions data on two-particle correlations exhibit structures as function of relative azimuthal angle and rapidity. A unified description of these near-side and awayside structures is proposed for low to moderate transverse momentum. It is based on the combined effect of tubular initial conditions and hydrodynamical expansion.\r\n\r\nA 3+1 hydrodynamic approach with fluctuating tubular initial conditions, in addition to reproducing both the near and away-side structures [1], leads to a good qualitative agreement with various data: dependence on trigger/associated particle tranverse momentum and on centrality [2], difference in the away-side structure for in-plane/out-of plane triggers [3]. Some results on the relation between triangularity and triangular flow have also been obtained for this approach [4].\r\n\r\nSince 3+1 hydrodynamics is a complicated scenario, we have also studied the effect of single tubes in 2+1 hydrodynamics. Contrary to expectations, the hydrodynamic solution shows that the high energy density tubes (leftover from the initial particle interactions) give rise to particle emission in two directions and this is what leads to the various structures [2], including the effect of in-plane/out-of plane triggers [3]. This description is sensitive to some\r\nof the initial tube parameters and may provide a probe of the strong interaction.\r\n\r\n[1] J. Takahashi, B.M. Tavares, W.L.Qian, R. Andrade, F. Grassi, Y.

      "Speaker": "William Horowitz",
      "Institute": "University of Cape Town",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We present parameter-free predictions from the WHDG (radiative+elastic+geometric fluctuation) energy loss model for high pT pion suppression in A+A at 2.76 and 5.5 ATeV. The input density is constrained from a rigorous statistical analysis of RHIC pi0 quenching data. The predictions are consistent with the recent _charged_ hadron RAA data from ALICE only within the current very large systematic uncertainty (due to the unmeasured reference p + p spectrum). However, our constrained prediction of central to peripheral pion R_cp(pT), in which reference p + p spectra uncertainties cancel, is found to be over-quenched by ~two sigma relative to the charged hadron ALICE R_cp data at all pT<20 GeV. The basic tomographic assumptions in WHDG are (1) the energy loss scales linearly with the initial QGP density, rho0, and (2) that rho0 scales linearly with charge particle multiplicity dNch/dy. Under these assumptions, WHDG predicts significant difference in magnitude and pt slope pf pion RAA between RHIC and LHC. Future ALICE identified pi,K,p hadron RAA data (as well as accurate p + p and p + Pb reference data) will enable more quantitative jet tomographic tests of hard probe dynamics in strongly interacting quark gluon plasmas.",
