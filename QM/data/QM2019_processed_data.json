We study the dependence of the dijet invariant mass on event multiplicity in both collision systems, to explore cold nuclear matter effects or possible medium modifications in small collision systems. We measure charged jets using central tracking detectors in ALICE and correct the results for detector effects using unfolding procedure. Previous two-particle correlation studies from RHIC and the dijet asymmetry studies from LHC indicate that the dijet invariant mass can be sensitive to modifications caused by the QGP medium.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We study the anomaly-induced effects of dense matter under rotation. We show that the chiral perturbation theory under rotation has the topological term that accounts for the chiral vortical effect. We find that, due to the presence of this new term, the ground state of QCD under rotation is the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) of the neutral pion or $\\eta^{\\prime}$ meson. This state is a periodic array of topological solitons which spontaneously breaks parity and continuous translational symmetries. In particular, at high density, the CSL of the $\\eta^{\\prime}$ meson is energetically more favorable than the color-flavor locked color superconducting phase and its critical angular velocity is proportional to the QCD anomaly in the flavor symmetric case.",

The readout\r\nelectronics was newly designed to meet this requirement. The signal is\r\nreadout by 624 Frontend cards that have 8 SAMPA v5 chips, the new\r\nversion of the one employed for ALICE TPC, and sent to a backend\r\nelectronics, FELIX PCI card, designed for ATLAS experiment. The data\r\nrate from the whole TPC may reach as much as 1.4Tbps.

The measurement of high-multiplicity events at reaction rates up to 50 kHz requires the installation of four new tracking stations equipped with double-sided micro-strip silicon sensors, which have been developed for the CBM experiment at FAIR. It has been demonstrated by simulations using the UrQMD event generator together with the GEANT transport code, that the hybrid tracking system comprizing four silicon stations and seven (already partly existing) GEM tracking detectors will be able to reconstruct charged particles including hyperons emitted in Au+Au collisions with good efficiency and  high signal-to-background ratio. The results of the simulations and the status of the detector development will be presented.",

A quadruple GEM stack with special hole patterns or a MicroMegas based amplification is expected to further reduce the ion backflow.\r\nA series of simulations and measurements have been performed to find an optimal configuration and working point for the sPHENIX TPC.

      "Title": "Factorization breaking in transverse momentum from hydrodynamic fluctuations",
      "Speaker": "Yuki Gogun",
      "Institute": "Sophia University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In recent years, factorization breaking of flow coefficients in transverse momentum has been measured by CMS Collaboration [1] to understand the transport properties of QGP. The factorization ratio $r_n$ measured in Pb + Pb collisions at LHC represents the decorrelation of the event plane angle in different transverse momentum regions. When $r_n = 1$, which implies the coincidence of the event-plane angles along transverse momentum direction, $r_n$ can be factorized into the anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ in the individual transverse momentum regions. However, $r_n < 1$ means the event-plane angles differ from each other and consequently this factorization is broken. Hydrodynamic fluctuations are expected to break the factorization because they disturb the event plane. \r\n\r\nIn this study, we analyze the factorization ratio $r_n$ in the direction of transverse momentum by using an integrated dynamical model [2] that incorporates thermal fluctuations into the relativistic hydrodynamic model. The QGP produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions expands rapidly, cools down and becomes a hadron gas in a short time period. Thus, the QGP cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the transport properties of QGP are explored through analysis of the hadron momentum distribution measured by the detector. Since the final state hadron observables carry the information on the whole history of the space-time evolution of the system, it is important to construct an integrated dynamical model that describes the whole reaction. Using this integrated dynamic model incorporating hydrodynamic fluctuations, we compare the analysis results of the factorization ratio in the transverse momentum direction with the experimental results and discuss the influence of the hydrodynamic fluctuations on the factorization ratio in the transverse momentum direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] CMS Collaboration, Phys.

      "Title": "High transverse momentum direct photons in p+Au collisions in PHENIX at RHIC",
      "Speaker": "Zhandong Sun",
      "Institute": "University of Debrecen",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The primary source of high transverse momentum (>4-5GeV/c) direct photons is the initial hard scattering of partons, specifically the quark-gluon Compton scattering process.  This has been validated not only in hadron-hadron, but also in heavy ion collisions (see for instance PRL 109 (2012) 152302), where the observed yields were proportional, as expected,  to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions as calculated from the Glauber model for various collision centralities.  This observation supports that the collision geometry is well defined by the centrality measure we have been using, at least in the case when the colliding ions are large. The definition, however, is not obvious in very asymmetric collisions,\r\nlike p+Au. We assume that high transverse momentum direct photons are a \"standard candle\" for initial hard scattering, and, per extension, for collision geometry not only for p+p and A+A, but also for small-on-large collisions.  If true, comparing the centrality dependence of direct photon and hadron production in p+Au is a robust test of the applicability of the Glauber model in such systems. In this poster we will report on the status of the analysis of high transverse momentum direct photons in p+Au collisions at various centralities as well as of the direct photon / hadron ratios and its comparison with hadron production.",

      "Abstract": "The hadronic interaction cross section for (multi)strange hadrons are expected to be small. Hence, the study of azimuthal anisotropy of (multi)strange hadrons allows one to access the collective properties of early stages in heavy-ion collisions. The STAR experiment recently recorded high statistics data for Au+Au collisions at a new centre-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) of 54.4 GeV ($\\sim$1.3 billion events) and 27 GeV ($\\sim$600 million events). The newly installed Event Plane Detector (EPD) allows one to  measure the  azimuthal anisotropy of particles with high precision and less non-flow contributions using event plane with large gaps in rapidity. \r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the second-order azimuthal anisotropy ($v_{2}$) of  (multi)strange hadrons ($K^{0}_{S}$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, $\\Omega$) measured at midrapidity ($|y|$ $< $0.5)  as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and centrality at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=27 and 54.4 GeV.  Measurement will be carried out using event planes from both Time Projection Chamber ($|\\eta|$$<$1.0) and EPD (2.1$<$$|\\eta|$$<$5.1). High precision test of the number of constituent quark scaling of $v_{2}$ (including light hadrons) will be shown. The results will be compared to transport-based model calculations. Finally, the physics goals of such measurements at the other $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 11.5, 9.2 and 7.7 GeV of beam energy scan phase II will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Neutral mesons and jets are good probes to study particle production mechanisms and jet phenomena in various collision systems, providing comparisons to model calculations and constraining coefficients of hot QCD matter. Recent measurements of ALICE in pp collisions show a modification of the $\\eta/\\pi^{0}$ ratio for the neutral meson production in jets with respect to the inclusive measurement. The reconstruction of neutral pions inside jets can be extended to Pb--Pb and p-Pb collisions. The comparison of the production inside jets in cold and hot nuclear collisions would shed light on the final state\teffects of the jet quenching mechanism. The reconstruction of neutral pions is done via the two photon decay channel combining various methods of reconstruction. The decay photons are reconstructed via the Photon Conversion Method (PCM) and in the ALICE calorimeters (EMCal and PHOS). In this poster, the latest advances of the neutral meson production inside charged jets in nuclear collisions will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is a fixed-target heavy-ion physics experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany.  The CBM physics program aims at exploring the QCD phase diagram at very high baryon densities. For high-statistics measurements of rare probes, CBM is designed to cope with very high interaction rates up to 10 MHz. To achieve this high rate capability, the CBM experiment will be equipped with fast and radiation hard detectors employing free-streaming readout electronics. The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the essential component for tracking up to 1000 charged particles per event in A+A collision. The experimental conditions pose demanding requirements in terms of channel density and read-out bandwidth. The STS-XYTER is a dedicated ASIC for the readout of the double-sided silicon micro-strip sensors. It is a low power, self-triggering ASIC with 128 channels, 5-bit ADC charge and 14-bit timing information. It needs to be fully integrated into a very confined space and it should perform in a highly irradiated environment with strong magnetic field. Several tests are carried out to check chip functionalities, full detector modules performance and integration aspects. An overview of the frontend electronic, module tests and experimental results, for different data taking scenarios, will be presented, including first measurements with a full system test-setup in heavy-ion collisions at SIS18.",

In the box system with the periodic boundary condition under a uniform magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral magnetic wave were simulated based on the spin kinetic equations of motion (SEOM) and the chiral kinetic equations of motion (CEOM), with the latter derived from the SEOM for massless particles with approximations. We found that the chiral magnetic effect is weaker while the damping of the chiral magnetic wave is stronger from the SEOM compared with that from the CEOM, and they are both weaker than the analytic results. In addition, effects induced by chiral anomalies from the SEOM are less sensitive to the decay of the magnetic field than from the CEOM due to the spin relaxation process. Furthermore, effects of the temperature, the magnetic field, and the specific shear viscosity on the key properties of the chiral magnetic wave with different scenarios are discussed.",

The installation of the new ITS, ITS3,  is planned for the third LHC shutdown (LS3) during which the three innermost layers of ITS2 will be replaced by three cylindrical layers of large curved CMOS wafers.

These residual fluctuations are handled in an unfolding procedure following the background subtraction. \r\n\r\nA novel method to correct the jet transverse momentum on a jet-by-jet basis to reduce these fluctuations by introducing a dependence on the jet fragmentation will be presented. We utilize machine learning techniques to reconstruct the full jet transverse momentum from jet parameters, including the constituents of the jet. The performance of this approach is evaluated using jets from PYTHIA simulations embedded into ALICE Pb--Pb data. In comparison to the standard area-based method, these machine learning based estimators show a significantly improved performance, which could allow for measurements of jets to lower transverse momenta and larger jet radii.",

      "Abstract": "In a collision of two identical heavy-ions, the participant zone formed from the overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei contains unequal number of nucleons from each nucleus due to fluctuations. Consequently, the participant zone has a non-zero momentum in the centre of mass frame of the colliding nuclei, causing a longitudinal asymmetry. Using data in Pb-Pb collisions at centre of mass energy 2.76 TeV, the ALICE experiment had demonstrated that the longitudinal asymmetry manifests itself in the measured pseudorapidity distributions.  In the present work, the results on the pseudorapidity distributions and the estimated shift in the rapidity will be presented using data from Pb-Pb collisions at centre of mass energy 5.02 TeV. The shift in rapidity of the participant zone due to the longitudinal asymmetry is estimated using the unequal energy deposited in the forward zero- degree calorimeters on either side of the interaction vertex.  The results show the relation between the shift in rapidity and the centre of mass energy. In addition, results will be presented for pseudorapidity distributions for charged particles in different transverse momentum intervals.",

The STS is the key detector for measuring the momentum and tracks of up to 1000 charged particles produced in Au+Au collisions which happen at interaction rates up to 10 MHz on a fixed target. Due to the required momentum resolution for the STS of Δp/p ~ 1.5%, the material budget of STS has to be minimized as much as possible. In order to keep the read-out electronics, cooling and mechanical infrastructure out of the detector acceptance, the sensors are connected to the self-triggering front-end electronics by means of low-mass flexible microcables with a length up to 50 cm. In combination with the large double-sided sensors with a size up to 124 mm x 62 mm, the detector module becomes a highly complex structure, which in turn leads to a challenging module assembly procedure.\r\nTo mitigate risk, two high-density interconnection technologies have been developed for the STS modules, based on ultra-thin aluminium and copper mircocables, respectively. Capacitance simulations and measurements of the microcables and full detector material budget simulations have been performed. Next to the individual steps involved in the respective interconnection technologies, the electrical performance of the assembled modules, including a thorough noise analysis, will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "The first RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) was run from 2010-2014 to search for the turn-off of signatures of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), evidence of the first-order phase transition, and the possible QCD critical point. The QGP signatures studied in BES-I became insensitive or disappeared at energies below $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 GeV. The fluctuations in the event-by-event net-proton multiplicities exhibited a dip at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ ≈ 19.6 GeV and a rise at 7.7 GeV. Motivated by the findings of BES-I, STAR has initiated a phase II of the BES program (BES-II). The BES-II program improves upon the earlier BES-I program with detector upgrades to extend the acceptance, higher luminosity to provide $10-20$ times better statistics at each energy, and a Fixed-Target program to extend the range of BES-II below the expected critical point. In this poster, results from the first dedicated fixed-target physics run at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV will be presented. The run used a 250 $\\mu$m thick gold target and accumulated 335 million Au+Au events. We present proton (and anti-proton) yields and multiplicities. These measurements will be compared with results from AGS experiments E866 and E895. We will discuss the implications of the observed multiplicities and efficiency corrections to the study of cumulants of event-by-event net-proton multiplicities up to the fourth order as a function of rapidity. It is expected that this collision energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV should fall below the transition to QGP, therefore measurements at this energy will test for the return of the critical fluctuations to the expected baseline. Results at this energy will help understand the trends observed in the previous results from the BES program and preliminary results from HADES. Additionally, we will discuss the future of BES-II fixed-target measurements at RHIC.",

Among such observables is the production rate of strange quarks, which were originally predicted to be produced with higher probability in a QGP scenario with respect to a pure hadron gas scenario. Studies of strangeness production at LHC energies, compared with the lower energy measurements, can help to determine the properties of the hot system created in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions. In this work, we present results on strangeness production in p-Pb collisions measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC.\r\n   The excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities of ALICE can be used to reconstruct strange hadrons via invariant-mass analysis of their weak decay products. The analysis status of strange ($\\rm K^{0}_{s}$ and $\\rm \\Lambda$ ) hadrons in p-Pb collisions at 8.16 TeV at mid-rapidity as a function of $\\rm p_{T}$ and centrality will be presented and the recent results on strange particle productions in different systems and energies will be summarized and discussed.",

More specifically, observation of jet substructure variables may reveal the microscopic properties of the QGP.\r\n\r\nRecently the modification of groomed jet observables was studied in heavy-ion collisions [1]. In addition, the Lund radiation plane was introduced to investigate parton shower modifications in the QGP [2].\r\n\r\nIn this poster I am going to show how machine learning techniques can help evaluate how quenched a jet is. The first approach is to use a convolution neural network (CNN) which is a technique heavily used in computer vision. The second approach uses a technique based on long and short-term memory (LSTM). The LSTM model is an artificial recursive neural network and is capable of processing sequential data. This design makes it well-suited for making predictions on jets considering that the way of calculating substructure variables implies sequential information of how branchings occur.\r\n\r\nSimulations are made with monte-carlo event generators such as PYTHIA8 and JEWEL which simulates jet showering in vacuum and in medium respectively. Classifiers are trained in order to evaluate how quenched a jet is.

The Silicon vertex detector, VTX, provides the precise tracking capability, enabling the separation of electrons from the bottom and charm decays by measuring the distance of the closest approach to the collision vertex.

One of the promising diagnostic probes for these new states is the enhanced production of multi-strange (anti-)particles. The CBM detector is designed to measure such rare diagnostic probes multi-differentially with unprecedented precision and statistics. Important key observables are the production of hypernuclei and dibaryons. Theoretical models predict that single and even doubly-strange hypernuclei are produced in heavy-ion collisions with the maximum yield in the region of SIS100 energies. The discovery and investigation of new (doubly strange-)hypernuclei and of hyper-matter will shed light on the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions. In this talk, we will report the results of feasibility study on the production of single- and double-strange hypernuclei in CBM experiment.

Studying this ratio as a function of collision energy may provide a unique probe to explore the vicinity of the critical endpoint in heavy ion collisions via the fluctuation of strange quark densities. In addition, studying the central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factor $R_{CP}$ of strange hadrons may provide insight into strangeness production mechanisms in nuclear collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present new measurements of strange baryons $\\Lambda(\\bar{\\Lambda})$, $\\Xi(\\bar{\\Xi})$ and $\\Omega(\\bar{\\Omega})$ at mid-rapidity using $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=27$ and 54.4 GeV Au+Au collisions taken in years 2017 and 2018 by STAR, respectively.

Furthermore the measurements in small systems are used as a reference for ion-ion collisions and are helpful for the tuning of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) inspired event generators. In this contribution, we present recent results on $K^*(892)^{0}$  obtained by the ALICE experiment in pp collisions at several collision energies, event multiplicities and as a function of transverse spherocity. The results include the transverse momentum spectra, yields and their ratio to long-lived particles. The measurements will be compared with model predictions and measurements at lower energies.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "In the past several years there has been increasing interest in the chirality imbalance $n_5$, which is the difference between right- and left-handed fermions. The chirality imbalance is expected to be produced from the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly(ABJ-anomaly) and plays a key role to understand anomalous transport phenomena in the hot/dense quark matter or the Dirac/Weyl semimetals under the magnetic field. One of interesting transport phenomena in the presence of chirality imbalance is the chiral magnetic effect(CME), appearance of electric current in direction of the external magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe ABJ-anomaly relation implies that the electric field gives a crucial contribution to the emergence of the chirality imbalance in addition to the magnetic field. In the previous work, we have studied the chirality imbalance and the CME using the solution of the Dirac equation in the constant magnetic and general time-dependent electric fields, and found that the time-dependence of the gauge field is essentially important for the production of $n_5$. In particular, we found that $n_5$ and CME at $t \\to \\infty$ are solely determined by the probability distributions of the fermion created non-perturbatively by the electric field.  \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we study the emergence of the chirality imbalance and the electric current under spatially-uniform and parallel electromagnetic field in the vacuum of massive fermion. For the time-dependence, we assume the constant magnetic field, but do not impose any specific form for the electric field with boundary conditions $E(t \\to \\pm \\infty) \\to 0$.  We solve the Dirac equation and calculate vacuum expectation values of the currents with the gauge invariant regularization.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, asymptotic forms of $n_5$ and CME consists of a constant part and an oscillating part independent of details of intermediate time-dependence of the gauge potential. The non-zero constant term is proportional to a relativistic velocity and the momentum distribution of the created particle, and understood as a classical analogue of the electric current. We discuss how the chirality imbalance arises by the time-dependent electric field.",

Light produced by particles striking the tile is captured by a wavelength shifting fiber that routes the light to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) at one end of the tile.  The geometry of the mid-rapidity calorimeter is novel, tilted in azimuth such that particles coming from the interaction region traverse a number of scintillating tiles.  The scintillator tiles come in different shapes based on their location in pseudorapidity.  Tiles of the same shape are grouped together azimuthally in sets of five forming a “tower,” and the readout from a tower is the aggregate of the signals of each tile within a tower.  Results of beam tests carried out at Fermilab have shown that the detector has the required energy resolution to accomplish sPHENIX’s physics goals; additionally, in order to optimize the performance of the calorimeter, towers will be constructed out of tiles with similar behavior.  Testing has begun at Georgia State University to characterize the performance of each individual tile relative to a baseline reference by analyzing their response to cosmic rays. This poster will detail the design of the test setup, the analysis procedure, and the current results of the performance characterization studies of the sPHENIX HCal tiles.",

The energy dependence of the second order off-diagonal over diagonal cumulant ratios cannot be fully described by different model calculations [1]. We extend such measurements to the third-order off-diagonal cumulants. These measurements provide important insights on the correlations between different conserved charges from the QGP and hadronic phase, as well as their dependence with temperature and baryon chemical potential.

The RU board consists of two FPGAs, one for reading the stave data and sending data using CERNs rad-hard GBT links over fiber to the FELIX board and a second FPGA which is used for scrubbing (SEU detection).  The FELIX board consists of an FPGA that reads out the data over the fiber link and sends its data to a 16 lane PCIe interface, placing the data to disk.

Several systematic uncertainties cancel when comparing the ratio of the awayside yield to the nearside yield in d+Au and $^3$He+Au systems to p+p revealing a quantifiable modification in these systems. In addition, $p_{out}$ distributions for the p+A collisions is measured. An increasing trend in the width of the $p_{out}$ distributions in p+Al and p+Au compared to p+p is observed as a function of $N_{coll}$.

A neural network is successfully trained to recognize the different phases of this system and to predict the value of various observables, based on the field configurations. We analyze a broad range of chemical potentials and find that the network is robust and able to recognize patterns far away from the point where it was trained. Aside from the regressive analysis, which belongs to supervised learning, an unsupervised generative network is proposed to produce new quantum field configurations that follow a specific\r\ndistribution. An implicit local constraint fulfilled by the physical configurations was found to be automatically captured by our generative model.

Furthermore,  the non-universal parameters needed to map temperature T and µ to the universal properties of the second order chiral phase transition also have been determined by lattice QCD calculations. Motivated by these observations, first, we determine the analytic structure of the partition function - the so-called Lee-Yang edge singularity - in the QCD crossover regime, solely based on universal properties. Then, utilizing the lattice calculated non-universal parameters,  we map this singularity to the real T and complex µ plane, and determine the closest singularity to µ=0 in the QCD crossover regime. These results lead to two important implications: (i) An universality based estimate of the radius of convergence for lattice QCD calculations at µ>0; (ii) Universality and lattice QCD based constraints on the location of the QCD critical point in the T-µ plane.",

      "Abstract": "We present a formulation of the initial state of heavy ion collisions that generalizes the 2+1D boost invariant IP-Glasma [1] to 3+1D through JIMWLK rapidity evolution of the pre-collision Wilson lines. The rapidity dependence introduced by the JIMWLK evolution means that 1) the system no longer trivially satisfies Gauss’ law at the initial time and 2) the form of the 2+1D initial gauge fields will give rise to nonphysical energy deposition outside of the interaction region of the colliding nuclei. To address these issues, we enforce Gauss’ law locally and modify the form of the initial gauge fields in order to accommodate non-vanishing rapidity derivatives. This makes the initial condition consistent with a non-boost invariant system, and thus allows for temporal evolution on a 3-dimensional lattice.\r\n\r\nWhile the transverse physics of QGP has been studied nearly exhaustively, the effect of longitudinal fluctuations introduced by the JIMWLK evolution has yet to be studied in detail phenomenologically. Hence, we couple our 3+1D IP-Glasma model to MUSIC+UrQMD, for completely 3+1D simulations of heavy ion collisions. Specifically, we consider Pb-Pb collisions at \\sqrt{s} = 2.76 TeV and study the rapidity dependence of the charged hadron v_n (η) via the η-dependent flow factorization ratios r_n(ηa,ηb) as measured by CMS [2], as well as the charged hadron multiplicity dN_ch /dη.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n[1] Bjoern Schenke and Soeren Schlichting. “3D glasma initial state for relativistic heavy ion collisions”.

The rapidity dependence of these processes is particularly sensitive to nPDFs, but further information can be gained by studying the mass dependence of DY production, measured for the first time in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV, down to 15 GeV. In addition, differential measurements in the dimuon $p_{\\text{T}}$ or $\\phi^{*}$ (an angular variable correlated with $p_{\\text{T}}$ measured for the first time in pPb) provide insights on soft gluon emission at low $p_{\\text{T}}$.

      "Abstract": "Evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions has dominantly come from the agreement of the measured yield of produced hadrons with those from statistical thermal models. Ideally for a thermalized system, in addition to mean, the higher orders of the moments of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles should also show agreement with thermal models. In this respect, studying the moments of the event-by-event distributions of conserved quantities like net-baryon, net-strangeness and net-charge number is best suited. \r\n\r\nWe have carried out a systematic study of comparing the results from a thermal hadron resonance gas model with data on higher moments of net-proton, net-kaon and net-charge distributions measured at RHIC beam energy scan program. The experimental acceptances in terms of rapidity and transverse momentum are used in the model calculations carried out for central Au+Au collisions at the centre of mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. For the first time, the hadron resonance gas model results are found to explain the measurements up to third order of moment with a common temperature and baryonic chemical potential. These calculations have tested the thermal nature of produced net-particle distributions up to third order, thereby providing evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Implications of the findings on our understanding of the phase structure of QCD matter will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "There have been various attempts to give lower limits on the location of the QCD critical endpoint via lattice simulations. These mostly rely on expanding the pressure in a Taylor series near zero chemical potential, and use estimators for the radius of convergence, mostly the ratio estimator. If the radius of convergence can be found, it gives a lower limit on the location of a true phase transition. I will give an analytic argument that shows that the ratio estimator will not converge in the generic case and explain how to obtain improved  estimators with guaranteed and faster convergence, as was described in Phys. Rev. D 99, 114510. \r\nAs a next step in this research program, we calculate these estimators for the case of Nf=2+1 flavour QCD with physical quark masses, using a stout improved staggered action, two different lattice spacings, and several volumes. On the roughest lattice spacing, we perform a full finite volume scaling study of the radius of convergence of the Taylor series. We also compare with results using an alternative algorithm that directly looks for the closest singularity of the free energy in the complex chemical potential plane, without relying on Taylor expansion coefficients.",

The situation of strangeness neutrality and matter with a fixed electric charge-to-baryon ratio, resembling that of heavy nuclei, is considered for the application to relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This increases the values of baryon chemical potential, modifying the fireball trajectory in the phase diagram.

Lattice computations provide a reliable tool for extracting such information for correlation functions in the space-like domain of momenta, for example for screening phenomena. However, the approach to equilibrium of QCD matter requires knowledge of correlation functions in the time-like domain.\r\n\r\nAnalytic continuation of correlation functions from space-like to time-like momenta require knowledge of a spectral function. There are few known constraints on the nature of spectral functions at finite temperature. Computations in the weak-coupling theory, provide constraints at high momenta. Analytic continuations of lattice data otherwise have used ``zero-knowledge schemes'' such as MEM. However, any further information on the nature of spectral functions would help to guard against unknown theoretical biases.\r\n\r\nHere we apply an effective field theory (EFT) which was developed recently to examine correlators of axial currents. This is a generalization of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model applied to finite temperatures. This was parametrized to describe lattice data obtained with two flavours of light dynamical Wilson quarks.\r\n\r\nWe use this effective field theory to examine the analytic continuation of correlation functions of composite pion operators below T_c from the space-like to the time-like domain. Several interesting phenomena are observed: the analytic continuation of the pion mass and decay constant are non-trivial.  We discuss the complex behaviour of the corresponding spectral function.",

      "Abstract": "Recently there have been rapidly growing interests in understanding the properties and phase structures of matter under extreme fields like magnetic field or global rotation. Examples of such physical systems come from a variety of different areas, such as the hot quark-gluon plasma in peripheral heavy ion collisions, dense nuclear matter in rapidly spinning neutron stars, lattice gauge theory in rotating frame, cold atomic gases as well as certain condensed matter materials. In particular rotation has nontrivial interplay with microscopic spin degrees of freedom through the rotational polarization effect and could often induce novel phenomena. For example, there are highly nontrivial anomalous transport effects such as the chiral vortical effect and chiral vortical wave in rotating fluid with chiral fermions. A generic effect is the rotational suppression of  fermion pairing in the zero angular momentum states, which has been demonstrated for e.g. chiral phase transition and color superconductivity in the strong interaction  system (Y.~Jiang & J.~Liao, Phys. Rev. Lett. **117**, no. 19, 192302 (2016)).\r\n\r\nWe investigate the mesonic condensation in isospin matter under rotation and demonstrate two important effects of the rotation on its phase structure: a rotational suppression of the scalar-channel condensates, in particular the pion condensation region; and a rotational enhancement of the rho condensation region with vector-channel condensate. A new phase diagram for isospin matter under rotation is   mapped out on the $\\omega-\\mu_I$ plane  where three distinctive phases, corresponding to $\\sigma$, $\\pi$, $\\rho$ dominated regions respectively, are separated by a second-order line at low isospin chemical potential and a first-order line at high rotation which are further connected at  a tri-critical point.\r\n\r\nRefs: arXiv: 1812.11787; Phys.

      "Abstract": "Quarkonium production measurements represent a key probe to investigate the space-time properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements in small systems, namely pA and proton-proton (pp), are crucial in order to interpret correctly results in heavy-ion collisions. Potential initial-state effects can be constrained through the measurement of the nuclear modification factor in pA collisions ($R_{\\rm pA}$), defined as the ratio of quarkonium yields in pA to the reference production in pp collisions, collected at the same center-of-mass energy and scaled by the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Besides serving as reference, results in pp collisions represent a benchmark test of QCD based models in both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. \r\n\r\nThe ALICE detector has unique capabilities at the LHC for measuring quarkonia down to zero transverse momentum. Measurements are carried out at both central \r\nand forward rapidity, in the dielectron and dimuon decay channel, respectively. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution the latest quarkonium measurements performed by the ALICE collaboration in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented. Recent nuclear modification factor measurements at mid-rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be shown for both prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ mesons, the latter originated from the decays of long-lived beauty-flavored hadrons. The status of mid-rapidity J/$\\psi$ analyses in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, using both minimum bias and high $p_{\\rm T}$ triggered (using ALICE TRD detector) events and including the study of non-prompt J/$\\psi$ contribution, will be also presented. In addition the centrality, rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of $R_{\\rm pPb}$ for $\\psi$(2S), $\\Upsilon$(1S) and $\\Upsilon$(2S), measured at forward rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, will be shown. Regarding pp collisions, recent J/$\\psi$ cross-section measurements at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5 and 13 TeV performed at central and forward rapidity, including the status of the analysis for the separation between prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ components at mid-rapidity, will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Charged particles in small collision systems such as $pp$ and $p$+Pb have been observed to have significant azimuthal modulations of their momenta, commonly interpreted as flow, up to a transverse momentum of $p_{T} \\approx 10$~GeV. In large collision systems such as Pb+Pb, lower but non-zero flow coefficients at higher $p_{T}$ ($> 10$~GeV) are usually understood to reflect jet quenching, and specifically the path-length differential energy loss in elliptical events. Extending these measurements in small systems to high-$p_{T}$ particles, which are predominantly produced in jets, can thus provide crucial information on the origin of these collective phenomena. This talk presents a new measurement by ATLAS of two-particle angular correlations in 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb events with a jet trigger. An additional restriction on the associated particle positions is used to suppress the large non-flow contributions in the jet events. Measurements of the resulting single-particle second- and third-order flow coefficients are presented for charged-hadrons from $p_{T}$ = 0.5 to 50 GeV, in selections of $p$+Pb event activity. The $p_{T}$-dependent results are compared to those from minimum-bias $p$+Pb events, and the differences between the two event samples are analyzed in terms of the different origin of particles in these events, such as the different fraction of particles that arise from the jet fragmentation process.",

We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of large and small systems.   With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when  the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as expected in small systems.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.  Additionally, this framework elucidates the  generic features of the system evolution that are responsible for the  impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold  even in cases when hydrodynamics is not applicable.",

The analysis is based on long-range, two-particle correlations. Results for nonprompt $D^{0}$ mesons from B meson decay are also presented to explore the possible collective flow of bottom quarks.

We measured $\\pi^0$s in the central rapidity region $|eta|<0.35$ in $p$+Au, $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions at 200 GeV. For central collisions, the $R_{AB}$ shows an ordering with collision system size with a pronounced peak in the range $2< p_T <7$ GeV/$c$ in $p$+Au. This peak decreases in magnitude as the projectile size increases. At higher $p_T$, $R_{AB}$ is below unity and converges towards a common value. We observe a similar centrality dependence for all three systems. The $R_{AA}$ of $\\phi$ mesons has been measured at forward, backward, and central rapidities in $p$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions.

For the hydrodynamics scenario, we generate initial conditions using TRENTO and work within a linear response approximation to obtain the final flow harmonics. For the CGC scenario, we use the explicit calculation of two-gluon correlations taken in the high-$p_T$ ``(semi)dilute-(semi)dilute'' regime to express the flow harmonics in terms of the density profile of the collision. We consider ultracentral collisions of deformed ions as a testbed for these comparisons because the difference between tip-on-tip and side-on-side collisions modifies the multiplicity dependence in both scenarios, even at zero impact parameter. We find significant qualitative differences in the multiplicity dependence obtained in the initial conditions+hydrodynamics scenario and the CGC scenario, allowing these collisions of deformed ions to be used as a powerful discriminator between models. We also find that sub-nucleonic fluctuations have a systematic effect on the elliptic and triangular flow harmonics which are most discriminating in $0-1\\%$ ultracentral symmetric collisions of small deformed ions and in $0-10\\%$ $\\mathrm{d} {}^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$ collisions.

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, it is well-established that geometrical shapes of the initial density distribution in transverse plane are responsible for the observed harmonic flow, through the hydrodynamic response of a set of modes. In particular, elliptic flow $V_2$ is linearly proportional to initial eccentricity $\\mathcal{E}_2$. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize the framework to study hydrodynamic response along the longitudinal direction. We propose a differential hydrodynamic response relation, $V_2(\\eta)=\\int d\\xi G(\\eta-\\xi) \\mathcal{E}_2(\\xi)$, to describe the formation of a pseudo-rapidity dependent elliptic flow, in response to a 3D initial density profile. By analyzing the medium expansion using event-by-event simulations of 3+1D MUSIC, with initial conditions generated via the AMPT model for the Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV, the differential response relation is verified and expansion coefficients to very high orders are identified in the response function $G(\\eta-\\xi)$.\r\n\r\nOur investigations of the hydrodynamic response function have yielded two important insights: 1. The two-point auto-correlation of elliptic flow in pseudo-rapidity (an observable in heavy-ion experiments), can be separated as medium response and two-point correlation of initial $\\mathcal{E}_2$. Especially, shear viscosity of the medium reduces the correlation length systematically. 2. Higher order expansion coefficients increase exponentially, which implies a finite radius of convergence of the gradient expansion in the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics. The radius of convergence in the response function results in a minimal length scale that can be used to estimate the applicability of hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions, which provides a possible solution to the question of fluidity in small systems.",

      "Abstract": "In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, a very strong (on the order of $10^{16}~\\mathrm{Tesla}$) and transient (lifetime on the order of $10^{-1}~\\mathrm{fm/c}$) electromagnetic (EM) field is expected to be generated inside the medium formed in the collision. This EM field, generated by the collision participants and spectators, is predicted to produce a difference in the $v_n$ harmonics for positive- and negative-charged particles, with the magnetic field mainly responsible for a splitting in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$), and the Coulomb electric field leading to a charge-dependent splitting in the $v_2$ and average $p_T$ values of emitted particles. Because of their large mass, charm quarks are expected to be created very early in the collision, and thus have a better chance of interacting with this strong EM field than light flavor hadrons. In this talk, measurements of $D^0$ ($\\bar{u}c$) and $\\bar{D^0}$ ($u\\bar{c}$) meson flow harmonics ($v_1$ and $v_2$) are presented as functions of rapidity ($y$), transverse momentum ($p_T$), and collision centrality for PbPb collisions at $5.02~\\mathrm{TeV}$, using high statistics data samples collected by the CMS detector during the LHC Run 2. The results are compared to model calculations, where they provide important constraints on the electrical conductivity and the drag coefficient assumed for the QGP medium. The wide rapidity coverage ($|y|<2$) of these new charm mesons measurements allow for a better understanding of the 3-dimensional evolution of the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Using deep neural network, the nature of the QCD transition can be identified from only the final-state pion spectra from hybrid model simulations of heavy-ion collisions. Within this hybrid model, a viscous hydrodynamic model is coupled to a hadronic cascade “after-burner”. Two different types of equations of state (EoS) of the medium are used in the hydrodynamic evolution. The resulting spectra are used as the input data to train the neural network to distinguish EoS. Different scenarios for the input data are studied and compared in a systematic way. A clear hierarchy is observed in the prediction accuracy when using the event-by-event, cascade-coarse-grained and event-fine-averaged spectra as input for the network, which are about 80\\%, 90\\% and 99\\%, respectively. Thus the high-level correlations of pion spectra learned by a carefully-trained neural network can serve as an effective \"EoS-meter\" to distinguish the nature of the QCD transition even in a simulation scenario which is close to the experiments.",

Nevertheless, due to the small masses of current quarks one can still probe critical phenomena at the LHC energy, which can be confronted with the ab-initio LQCD calculations at vanishing baryon chemical potential. In this report recent results on event-by-event fluctuation measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV will be presented. Together with the measured first four cumulants of net-protons in Pb-Pb collisions, differential studies on the second moments of net-charge distributions and their evolution from pp through p-Pb, Xe-Xe to Pb-Pb interactions will be highlighted.

We find that the azimuthal angle dependence of the hyperon polarization strongly depends on the choice of the so-called 'spin chemical potential'. If it is chosen to be proportional to the temperature vorticity, our simulation shows qualitatively coincidental results with the recent measurements at RHIC for both the longitudinal and transverse polarization.

We demonstrate that in equilibrium field theory calculus the axial anomaly is canceled by the pseudo-scalar condensate for any mass. In a real-time formulation with in- and out-states, we show that the axial Ward identity leads to the chirality production rate consistent with the Schwinger formula. We illuminate that such an in- and out-states formulation makes clear the chiral magnetic effect in and out of equilibrium, and we discuss further applications to real-time condensates.",

In this picture, the vacuum-like parton branchings, as triggered by the parton virtualities, are factorized in time from the medium-induced emissions responsible for the energy loss by the jet. We implement this picture in a Monte Carlo generator that we use to study two phenomenologically important observables: the jet nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the $z_g$ distribution reflecting the jet substructure.  In both cases, the outcome of our Monte Carlo simulations is in good agreement with the LHC measurements. We find that the energy loss by the jet is increasing with the jet transverse momentum, due to a rise in the number of partonic sources via vacuum-like emissions. This is a key element in our description of both $R_{AA}$ and $z_g$. For the latter, we identify two main nuclear effects: incoherent jet energy loss and hard medium-induced emissions. As the jet transverse momentum increases, we predict a qualitative change in the  ratio between the $z_g$ distributions in PbPb and pp collisions: from increasing at small $z_g$, this ratio becomes slightly decreasing.",

Subsequent studies have shown that the energy lost by jets is redistributed to large angle and in multiplicities of softer particles. In this talk, we report on the CMS results on jet energy redistribution using PbPb data at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02 TeV$, including new results on radial scans of anti-$k_\\mathrm{t}$ jet spectra with resolution parameter R from 0.2 to 1.0. These measurements are complementary to jet substructure measurements, which will also be discussed in this talk. These results can distinguish between mechanisms of parton-medium interaction as encoded in various Monte Carlo event generators and provide insight into the medium response.",

      "Abstract": "We present a systematic study of the hydrodynamic medium response to jet shower propagation, based on a strongly-coupled description of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A causal formulation for the space-time profile of energy-momentum source terms is incorporated with a multi-stage jet evolution and (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamics within the JETSCAPE 2.0 framework. In this work, we employ a causal relativistic diffusion equation to model the evolution of the localized energy and momentum depositions by jet partons before injection into the QGP fluid. This formulation provides the source terms with a space-time profile that naturally preserves causality. The diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time used in this model are directly connected to the transport properties of the QGP, such as its specific shear viscosity, and determine the size and shape of the source-term profile.\r\n\r\nUtilizing this new framework, we quantify the effects of the hydrodynamic response of a strongly-coupled medium on jet substructures (e.g. jet shape and jet fragmentation functions), by comparing with results for a weakly-coupled QGP where the medium response is modeled with recoil partons. Furthermore, we explore the dependence on the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time in the diffusion of the sources to show how the transport properties of the QGP manifest themselves in the medium response to jet propagation.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The spatial anisotropy of QGP, formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, is commonly inferred form models of early QGP evolution. These studies (e.g. MC-Glauber, EKRT, IP-Glasma, MC-KLN), based on different methods, lead to notably different predictions, with a notable effect in the resulting predictions for both low and high pt data. On the other hand, energy loss of high-pt particles traversing QCD medium is an excellent probe of QGP properties, particularly since there is a wealth of accumulated high pt experimental data. Therefore, as a novel and complementary approach, we here propose using high pt theory and data to infer the shape of initial QGP droplet. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we use DREENA framework, which is fully optimized computational procedure based on our state-of-the art dynamical energy loss formalism. Our most recent results show that, when embedded in 3+1D hydro medium model, DREENA provides a very good joint agreement with both $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data, contrary to the $v_2$ puzzle faced by models with simpler energy loss mechanisms. This, together with good joint agreement of our model with a wide range of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data (obtained with no fitting parameters used in model testing) shows that DREENA can realistically descibe high pt parton-medium interactions. By using DREENA framework, we show, through analytical arguments, numerical calculations, and comparison with experimental data, that $v_2$/(1−$R_{AA}$) reaches a well-defined saturation value at high pt, which is in turn proportional to the initial anisotropy. We provide first anisotropy estimates from our approach, and compare them with the predictions of early QGP evolution models. With expected future significant reduction of experimental errors, the anisotropy extracted from experimental data will strongly constrain the calculations of initial particle production in heavy-ion collisions, and thus test our understanding of QGP physics.",

We compare the predicted dijet relative azimuthal angle distributions for jets propagating through both perturbative (wQGP/HTL) and nonperturbative (sQGMP) models of the color structure of QCD perfect fluids as described by the VISHNU viscous hydro framework.  Our strategy to discriminate between these pictures of the QGP is based on the different parametric dependence of the jet path energy loss functionals, $\\Delta E[x[t]] \\propto <\\hat{q}L^2>$; and the width of the dijet azimuthal angle distribution, which is proportional the transverse saturation squared path functional, $Q_s^2[x[t]] \\propto <\\hat{q}L>$. By constraining $\\Delta E[x[t]]$ using inclusive hadron and jet suppression data, the medium-induced dijet acoplanarity is predicted by CUJET3 to be approximately twice as large in sQGMP than in wQGP. Future trigger+jet coincidence measurements at RHIC and LHC will have sufficient precision to resolve this difference on top of the expected large acoplanarity background due to vacuum Sudakov radiation.

PHENIX recently improved the width measurements extracted from $\\pi^{0}$-hadron correlations after removing the higher ordered flow terms in the underlying event. Measurements of the awayside jet correlated with direct photons have shown an increase in low momentum particle production at wide angles consistent with theoretical expectations for energy loss. The use of isolation cuts to select direct photons now allows us to measure this effect as a function of centrality. The system size dependence of energy loss is further investigated at PHENIX by measuring the absolute yield and $R_{AA}$ for various hadron species at high $p_T$ in several collision systems including U+U and Cu+Au.

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor physics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is a promising and active area to study the `` jet quenching \" effects both at the RHIC and the LHC. The recent reported $D^0$ meson radial profiles in jets measured by CMS collaboration provide new experimental constraints on the mechanisms of heavy flavor production in proton-proton collisions and give new insights into the in-medium interaction mechanisms of heavy quarks inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this talk, we present the first theoretical calculations of the $D^0$ meson radial distributions relative to the jet axis both in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, which show a nice agreement compared to the experimental data. In our work, the in-medium parton propagations are described by a Monte Carlo transport model which uses the next-to-leading order (NLO) plus parton shower (PS) event generator SHERPA as input and includes elastic (collisional) and inelastic (radiative) interaction for heavy quarks as well as light partons. Our simulated results show that, at low $D^0$ $p_T$, the radial distribution shifts to larger radius indicating a strong diffusion effect of charm quarks due to the in-medium interactions, but no significant modification observed at high $D^0$ $p_T$, which are consistent with the experimental data. In the further study, we estimate the net effect on the charm diffusion from collisional and radiative mechanism, and demonstrate the $p_T$ dependence of this diffusion effect. We find that collisional process has significant effects at low $p_T$, especially dominates at $0-5$ GeV, and the radiative process has a non-zero effect even at high $p_T\\sim 50$ GeV. The total diffusion effect decreases with $D^0$ $p_T$ which explains the significant modification at low $D^0$ meson $p_T$ observed in experiment. Besides, for unit energy loss, the collisional interaction shows much stronger angular deviation than radiative interaction indicating an essential difference between these two mechanisms.  For completeness, we also present the calculations of $D^0$ meson radial distribution in jets in p+p and $0-10\\%$ Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV, and estimate the nuclear modification factor of charm jet in central Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$ TeV.",

In the low mass region (LMR, $M_{ee}$<$M_{\\phi}$), the mass spectra of vector mesons are modified due to their interaction with the medium which is related to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, $M_{\\phi}$<$M_{ee}$<$M_{J/\\Psi}$), dielectrons from thermal radiation are predicted as a QGP thermometer, although the contributions from heavy quark semi-leptonic decays make the extraction of the thermal radiation contribution very challenging. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the dielectron spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 27, 54.4 and 200 GeV with the STAR experiment.

At low invariant mass, the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the medium related to the chiral symmetry \r\nrestoration. In the intermediate-mass region, the main component of the dielectron continuum is coming from correlated electron pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, which carry information about heavy-quark energy loss and collectivity. In this mass region, thermal \r\nradiation from the QGP gives insight into the early temperature of the medium. Finally, \r\nat very low momenta initial photon annihilation and photonuclear processes, triggered by \r\nthe coherent electromagnetic fields of the incoming nuclei, are expected to play a role \r\nin more peripheral collisions.\r\n\r\nTo study the dielectron production in heavy-ion collisions, it is crucial to first understand the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum with minimum-bias proton-proton collisions and to disentangle hot from cold-nuclear matter effects with p--Pb collisions. Moreover, observations of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions show surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions, which can be further investigated with the measurement of dielectrons in such collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give an overview of the latest measurements of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ \r\npair production in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions recorded by ALICE at different energies.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Inducing an electric field in the QCD medium generates an electric current which is proportional to the matter’s electric conductivity. Since quarks and hadrons also carry baryon and strange charge, such a field also respectively produces a baryon and strangeness current whose amplitude depends on baryo-electric and strange-electric conductivities. We dub the combination of these 3 properties of matter the cross-conductivity and proceed to calculate it in the hadron gas phase at and below temperatures corresponding to the phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon plasma. We use the newly-released SMASH transport code to simulate the hadron gas and the Green-Kubo formalism to extract the transport coefficients. After validating the approach for a simple system for which analytical results can be calculated (namely, pions, kaons and protons interacting with constant cross-sections), we gradually increase the number of degrees of freedom, up to reaching a state-of-the-art hadronic resonance gas as described by our current knowledge. Our results show that there are significant differences in the temperature dependence of the different components of the cross-conductivity as a function of the number of degrees of freedom. This new observable can in principle be computed on the lattice, and as such could be used to further constrain the properties of the hadron gas in the low temperature region.",

      "Speaker": "Niklas Mueller",
      "Institute": "Brookhaven National Laboratory",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Nuclear structure functions and parton Wigner distributions of protons and nuclei are principal components of QCD phenomenology. Their first principle computation is an outstanding problem in QCD, because they involve non-perturbative nucleon/nuclear matrix elements of electromagnetic currents that are light-like separated in Minkowskian spacetime. Real-time correlation functions are a difficult problem for lattice computations, which are only feasible in Euclidean space time.  To overcome restrictions of classical computing, we outline a strategy to compute nuclear structure functions in the high energy Regge limit of QCD using a hybrid quantum computer [1]. Our approach takes advantage of the representation of the fermion determinant in the QCD path integral as a quantum mechanical path integral over 0+1-dimensional fermionic and bosonic world-lines in background gauge fields [2].  While extremely challenging in general, the problem simplifies in the Regge limit, where the interaction of the world-lines with gauge fields is strongly localized in proper time and the corresponding quantum circuits can be written down.  As a proof principle, we employ the Color Glass Condensate effective theory of high energy QCD to construct the algorithm for a first straightforward application of the framework, specifically, the problem of computing the well-known dipole model result for the structure function $F_2$ [3]. We outline how this computation can be systematically scaled up in complexity and extended in scope to other real-time correlation functions, for example to describe non-equilibrium transport of quarks and gluons in a Quark-Gluon-Plasma, where the restrictions of euclidean lattice computations are evident.\r\n\r\n[1] N.

A closed analytic formula encompassing both regimes is so far lacking.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Quark-hadron continuity has been well understood for three-flavor symmetric nuclear and quark matter, which is however a theoretically over-idealized environment.  In this talk we clarify how quark-hadron continuity can be applied to neutron matter in the realistic neutron star environment.  Our key observation is that neutron matter can be smoothly connected to the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) state mixed with a condensate of $\\langle dd\\rangle$.  We give three convincing arguments:  The first one is the symmetry-breaking argument, the second one is the argument based on rearrangement of gauge-invariant order parameters, and the last one is the dynamical argument associated with nuclear forces in terms of $d$-quark exchanges.  Interestingly, in the quark sector, we have found a universal dynamical mechanism to favor $^3 P_2$ superfluidity above a certain threshold density, below which the ground state is a $^0 S_1$ superfluid.  Such transitional behavior of the favored ground state has been long known in nuclear physics, and as should be the case if quark-hadron continuity holds for neutron matter, quark matter turns out to share the same properties.\r\nOur finding provides us with an important theoretical foundation for the phenomenological construction of the equation of state (EoS) in the neutron star environment.  We conclude that, even in the presence of a $^3 P_2$ component of superfluidity, a prescription to interpolate the EoS smoothly between the nuclear and quark sides perfectly makes sense.  We also emphasize that such a state of the 2SC with tensorial $\\langle dd\\rangle$ in accord with $^3 P_2$ superfluidity is an absolutely novel state of quark matter that nobody had ever considered.  We discuss physical properties of this novel color-superconducting state and give an account of possible enhancement of tensorial $\\langle dd\\rangle$ due to Fierz mixing with the energy-momentum tensor.",

      "Abstract": "The measurement of low-energy cosmic anti-deuterons may reveal the existence of exotic processes such as dark-matter annihilation, since the production rate of these ions through ordinary secondary processes is very low. However, the lack of experimental data at low energies, where both the anti-deuteron production and inelastic cross sections are very poorly known, prevents precise predictions of anti-deuteron fluxes near Earth.\r\n\r\nIn ultra-relativistic collisions of protons and lead ions at the CERN LHC, matter and anti-matter is produced in almost equal abundances. This allows us to study the production cross sections of (anti-)deuterons with high precision as well as to measure the absorption process of produced (anti-)deuterons in the detector material.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the first results on the anti-deuteron absorption cross section in the ALICE detector material. The analysis is performed with p-Pb data collected $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The reconstructed anti-deuteron to deuteron ratio is compared to the results from full-scale GEANT4 simulations of the ALICE detector. Experimental constraints on the anti-deuteron nuclear inelastic cross-section are extracted in the momentum range between 0.5 and 4.0 GeV/$c$. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for indirect Dark Matter searches using cosmic anti-deuterons.",

The HFT allows precise measurements of open heavy flavor hadron production in heavy-ion collisions over a wide range of transverse momentum at RHIC. After the 2$^{\\rm{nd}}$ long shutdown (LS2) during 2019 to 2020, the ALICE detector will be upgraded to enable the read-out of all interactions and accumulate more than 10 nb$^{-1}$ of Pb+Pb collisions in Run 3 (2021 - 2023) and Run 4 (2026 - 2029). One of the key components of the ALICE LS2 upgrade programme is that a new low material and high-resolution silicon pixel detector for the Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on the next generation of MAPS technology will be built, which has been adopted by sPHENIX and NICA/MPD experiments for faster vertex detector development in coming years.\r\nThe Chinese group has constructed a complete assembly line and built an experienced team on large area pixel chip integration and testing at CCNU. As one of five ALICE ITS Outer Barrel (OB) Hybrid Integrated Circuit (HIC) construction sites, CCNU has completed the OB HIC construction with a yield of about 80\\%, approximately 20\\% of the ITS OB HIC modules (equal share planned over 5 sites).

Development of the MAPS-based pixel detector for the HIC experiments at CCNU is introduced in this poster, and the advanced techniques involved in the detector assembly and test are described.

We couple quarks to this theory and compute the one-loop polarization effects. Dense matter in two-color QCD should possess the diquark condensate which is color-singlet, and hence neither electric nor magnetic screening effects appear at the scale less than the diquark gap.

      "Speaker": "Rishi Sharma",
      "Institute": "TIFR",
      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "Effective Field Theories (EFTs) provide a systematic framework in which all terms consistent with the symmetries up to a specific mass dimension are written down in the lagrangian. We explore the consequence of the assumption that a fermionic EFT describes the QCD crossover. \r\n\r\nThis EFT was analyzed for zero quark number chemical potential ($\\mu=0$) in Ref. [1] considering all chirally symmetric terms up to dimension $6$. Following previous literature [3,4] the only explicit chiral symmetry breaking term considered was the quark mass $m_q\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$. The independent coupling constants of the theory were fit to Euclidean $\\pi$ velocity and the $\\pi$ screening mass measured on the lattice [2] at $T=0.84T_{co}$ ($T_{co}$ is the crossover temperature) and yielded an independent prediction: $\\pi$ decay constant $f$ which agreed with the lattice data. The theory describes the variations of these $\\pi$ properties near the crossover temperature at $\\mu=0$.\r\n\r\nIn this work we analyze the implications of the effective theory for finite $\\mu$. From the symmetry point of view a finite quark mass $m_q\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ breaks chiral symmetry, $\\mu\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^4\\psi$ breaks CP symmetry. Usually, analysis is simplified by assuming that only soft symmetry breaking terms (dimension less than $4$) appear which means that these two are the only explicit symmetry breaking terms in the lagrangian. In an effective theory with a cutoff however, a softly broken symmetry will inevitably lead to terms of dimension greater than $4$, which break the symmetry under consideration -- also known as hard symmetry breaking.\r\n\r\nWe study the consequences of adding hard breaking of symmetries in fermionic effective theory models for QCD. We focus on the behaviour of two mean fields, the chiral condensate $\\langle\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\rangle$ and the number density $\\langle\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^4\\psi\\rangle$ in the QCD phase diagram. In the absence of hard breaking terms, the two condensates are connected by mean field definitions of the mass and the chemical potential.    \r\n\r\nAt $\\mu=0$ the impact of hard chiral symmetry breaking is simply a redefinition of the four Fermi coupling constant and is inconsequential. For finite chemical potential in the chiral limit no new terms appear but we show using an analysis with two mean fields that the curvature of the critical line changes. This depends on a new linear combination of the coupling constants of the dimension $6$ operators and this combination can be chosen to match the value of the curvature calculated on the lattice [5]. This resolves the discrepancy of our previous calculation [1] of the curvature of the critical line and the lattice.\r\n\r\nFinally, when $m_q$ and $\\mu$ are both finite, hard breaking induces a direct coupling between the two condensates. This additional coupling affects the location of the crossover temperature (defined as the maximum of chiral  susceptibility) as a function of the chemical potential. The curvature of the crossover line can be used to match this additional constant and this fixes the phase diagram in this framework.

A double differential study of the identified particle production and  freeze-out scenario  of  the  produced  system  as  a function of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse spherocity in pp collisions would shed light into the underlying event dynamics. The light flavored particle production would help to understand the bulk of the system while the heavy flavored hadrons would retain the entire interaction history in QGP. We report a double differential study of both light and heavy-flavored hadron production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV as a function of charged-particle multiplicity and transverse spherocity using PYTHIA8 event generator. We also report the possible chemical freeze-out and kinetic freeze-out parameters using Thermal model, Boltzmann-Gibbs blast wave model and Tsallis non-extensive statistics. We observe that, while studying the QGP-like conditions in small systems, one should separate the isotropic events from the spherocity-integrated events, as the production dynamics are different. The present study, while exploring the particle production mechanism in different class of high-multiplicity pp events, paves a way for making proper experimental investigations.",

      "Speaker": "Chunjian Zhang",
      "Institute": "Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In heavy ion collisions, the transverse size or centrality of the QGP is not a boost-invariant concept. Due to forward-backward multiplicity fluctuations, the centrality of the system, defined as $N_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ in a given $\\eta$ range, also fluctuates in the longitudinal direction. This longitudinal fluctuation leads to decorrelation of centrality along $\\eta$, analogous to the decorrelation of harmonic flow $v_n$ along $\\eta$. In this work, we quantify the strength of centrality decorrelation using multi-particle cumulants (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) using a sub-nucleon Glauber model as well as dynamical event generators HIJING and AMPT. We found the behaviors of multiplicity cumulants in ultra-central collisions (UCC) are extremely sensitive to the particle production implemented in the models, and therefore can be used to quantify the centrality resolution and constrain the particle production mechanism. We further studied the influence of centrality fluctuation and decorrelations on $v_n$ and mean transverse momentum $\\langle p_{\\mathrm {T}}\\rangle$ in each event. We show that the event-by-event probability distribution of these quantities such as $p(v_n)$, $p(v_n, v_m)$, $p(\\langle p_{\\mathrm {T}}\\rangle)$ and $p(v_n,\\langle p_{\\mathrm {T}}\\rangle)$, accessible via mixed-observable multi-particle cumulants, are sensitive to the strength of the fluctuation and longitudinal decorrelations of centrality. We laid out an experimental strategy on how to constrain the centrality dependence of particle production, based on measurements of these mixed-observable cumulants in UCC for systems of different sizes.",

      "Abstract": "With our coupled jet-fluid model, we study the nuclear modifications of full jets and jet structures for single inclusive jets and $\\gamma$-jets in Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$ ATeV and $2.76$ ATeV. The in-medium evolution of full jet shower is described by a set of coupled transport equations including the effects of collisional energy loss, transverse momentum broadening and medium-induced splitting process. The dynamical evolution of bulk medium is simulated by solving relativistic hydrodynamic equation with source term which accounts for the energy and momentum deposited by hard jet shower to soft medium. Our study demonstrates that the hydrodynamic medium response to jet propagation significantly enhances the broadening of jet shape at large angles and is essential for the cone-size dependence of jet energy loss and nuclear modification factor of inclusive jet production. It is also found that the nuclear modification pattern of jet shape is sensitive to jet energy but has weak dependence on the flavor of the parton that initiates the jet.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Ning-Bo Chang, Guang-You Qin, Phys.Rev,C94,024902 (2016)\r\n[2] Yasuki Tachibana, Ning-Bo Chang and Guang-You Qin, Phys.Rev,C95,044909 (2017)\r\n[3] Ning-Bo Chang, Yasuki Tachibana and Guang-You Qin, arXiv:1906.09562 (2019)",

      "Abstract": "In this talk we investigate the response of the medium of chiral fermions to time and space dependent external electromagnetic fields and chiral imbalance. The axial-vector--vector--vector (AVV) three-point function is studied in a real-time approach at finite temperature in the linear response approximation.\r\nThe different orders of limits lead to different results as the external fields reach to the constant configuration in both space and time. We classify these different scenarios, involving the well-known case dictated by the chiral anomaly and even the case of vanishing chiral magnetic conductivity. The physical interpretation of these different scenarios is discussed through the anomalous conservation of the chiral charge. The result emphasizes the importance of whether or not the assumption of thermal equilibrium is justified for a system with chiral imbalance.\r\nTwo non-static examples are discussed in details: we analyze the AVV response function for i.) arbitrary space-time dependent chiral chemical potential when the magnetic field is constant and ii.) for arbitrary magnetic field with constant chiral imbalance. In the non-interacting limit the response function can be given even analytically, revealing a relatively simple form in both cases. \r\nWe also discuss the phenomenological implications on the electric charge polarization in a high-energy nuclear collision scenario. The effects of quenches and inhomogeneities of the chiral charge are especially explored, assuming the majority of the chiral charge is of QCD origin and that its generation can be described by a stochastic process.",

      "Abstract": "In heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC, quarkonium yields have been measured at various collision energies. The experimental findings reveal different characteristic behavior: sequential suppression dominates for bottomonium and recombination for charmonium. A comprehensive understanding of this phenomenology requires a genuine quantum mechanical treatment, in particular to capture the phenomenon of decoherence central to a unified description of suppression and recombination.\r\n\r\nRecently progress has been made in understanding the in-medium dynamics of a quarkonium based on the framework of open quantum system. It allows us to derive the dynamics of quarkonium in the quark-gluon-plasma systematically from QCD and already has helped improve our understanding of the complex in-medium potential. In a previous study, based on the stochastic potential approximation [1], we have elucidated the role of decoherence on the stability of in-medium heavy quarkonium, identifying it as a novel mechanism for quarkonium dissociation via scattering with the medium [2], in addition to the well-known Debye screening.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present results [3], where for the first time color degrees of freedom are taken into account in fully quantum mechanical fashion without invoking a semi-classical approximation. I.e. we simulate a genuine color SU(3) stochastic Schrödinger equation. We discuss how SU(3) color degrees of freedom affect the real-time evolution of quarkonium color singlet and octet states. We find the preservation of quarkonium parity in the colorful stochastic potential. We also show how the decoherence proceeds in the color octet states and discuss the availability of classical description for the gluo-dissociation process.\r\n\r\n[1] Y. Akamatsu and A.

      "Abstract": "We calculate the first four cumulants of the net-proton number distribution in partial chemical equilibrium (PCE). Such results serve as a necessary baseline for the identification of any critical phenomena in the collision energy dependence of the cumulants. The PCE scenario is relevant for scenarios of the nuclear collisions where chemical freeze-out coincides with hadronisation, but the fireball cools down further until kinetic freeze-out is reached. As a consequence, each stable hadronic species acquires its own chemical potential which depends on the temperature. Since proton number is not a conserved quantity, it may additionally fluctuate due to random nature of the resonance decays. We calculate the first four cumulants of the net-proton number distribution as functions of temperature for different chemical freeze-outs, which correspond to different collision energies. Interestingly, their temperature dependence is rather flat. Hence, this proves that the results obtained for the cumulants at the chemical freeze-out can still be regarded as relevant.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, there have been significant experimental progresses in observing and/or controlling spin-dependent bulk quantities in broad areas in physics, e.g., relativistic heavy-ion collisions, spintronics.  Although hydrodynamics is one of the most powerful theoretical frameworks to describe bulk quantities, its extension to a spinful fluid has not been developed well, especially for relativistic systems.  \r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we formulate relativistic spin hydrodynamics with first-order dissipative corrections for the first time [1].  Our formulation is based on the phenomenological entropy-current analysis, in which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are utilized to constrain constitutive relations.  We also clarify that spin should be a non-hydrodynamic (diffusive) mode by explicitly solving the obtained hydrodynamic equations within the linear-mode analysis on top of a global thermal equilibrium configuration.  This diffusive behavior is a consequence of the mutual convertibility between spin and orbital angular momentum.  \r\n\r\n[1] K. Hattori, M. Hongo, X.-G. Huang, M. Matsuo, H.

      "Abstract": "A better understanding of parton dynamics in the nucleus, in particular in the small-x region, is extremely important as it is needed to understand the nature of recently observed and unexpected phenomena like particle anisotropies in small collision systems. PHENIX can explore the small and large-x regions in the nucleus through measurements in the muon arms and forward vertex trackers. These detectors cover the forward ($1.2<\\eta<2.2$) and backward ($-2.2<\\eta<-1.2$) rapidity range, which in p+Au collisions at 200 GeV gives access to an average   x$\\sim$0.005 and x$\\sim$0.1, respectively. In this talk PHENIX present new results, including on charged hadrons, muon pairs from bottom decays, and Drell-Yan muon pairs. The ratio of p+Au to p+p data reveals interesting patterns of suppression and enhancement in the p+Au data. When comparing the results to pQCD calculations using nuclear parton distribution functions, reasonable agreement is found only over part of the accessible kinematic range, indicating the possible presence of other nuclear effects.",

      "Speaker": "Hui Zhang",
      "Institute": "No affiliation",
      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "**Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)** is the macroscopic manifestation of the fundamental chiral anomaly, and emerges as an anomalous transport current in a many-body system of chiral fermions such as the hot quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions. Experimental observation of CME would provide a tantalizing evidence for the chiral symmetry restoration as well as QCD topological fluctuations. Measurements at RHIC and LHC so far show intriguing hints but remain inconclusive, due to strong background contamination and relatively small CME signal. To address these challenges and to understand sensitivity of various proposed observables, it is crucial to have a sophisticated modeling framework that realistically quantify both the CME signal and background correlations. In this talk, we present such a new tool, the **Event-By-Event Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics** (EBE-AVFD) framework. The EBE-AVFD starts with event-wise fluctuating initial conditions for the bulk+axial charge+magnetic fields, simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the data-validated bulk fluid evolution from either VISHNU or MUSIC, samples freeze-out particles with local charge conservation implemented, to be followed by URQMD hadron scattering stage that includes resonance decay contributions. We use this tool to characterize the various features of CME signal and related backgrounds, to validate the simulation parameters with existing experimental data, and to investigate the sensitivity of several different observables with respect to signal and backgrounds. Finally, we present the state-of-the-art quantitative predictions for the **CME signatures in isobaric collisions** (RuRu v.s. ZrZr), which will provide the unique opportunity for potential discovery of CME in heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\n**Refs:**  CPC42(2018)011001; AnnalsPhys.394(2018)50; NPA967(2017)748; NPA982(2019)539; in preparation",

It allows us to describe the Langevin dynamics of quarkonia in a quantum mechanical manner. In particular, quantum dissipation as well as decoherence of quarkonia attract much attention recently.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we consider the relative motion of a heavy quark pair in the QGP. We derive and numerically simulate the master equation in the Lindblad form in one spatial dimension. We analyze the effects of the quantum dissipation to its equilibration.

      "Speaker": "Shi-Yong Chen",
      "Institute": "CCNU",
      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "Event shape observables, such as transverse sphericity $S_{\\perp}$, have long been proposed to study geometrical properties and patterns of the energy flow, and provide a probe of multi-jet topologies  in an interaction. For example, the event is pencile-like when transverse sphericity $S_{\\perp}\\rightarrow 0$, whereas the event is sphere-like when $S_{\\perp}\\rightarrow 1$.  It is well-known that jet quenching in the QGP may lead to the suppression of hadron and jet spectra in heavy-ion collisions, but how jet quenching effect modifies the global geometrical proporties of jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions is still an unexplored problem. In this talk, we show the first theoretical results of the medium modification of transverse sphericity distribution due to jet quenching effect in heavy-ion collisions. In our investigation, POWHEG+PYTHIA is employed to provide the p+p baseline up to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy with rusummation by the matched parton shower. The Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model of the parton energy loss is implemented to simulate the in-medium evolution of jets. We calculate the event normalized medium modification factor as a function of transverse sphericity distributions in the overall region. An enhancement at small transverse sphericity region and a suppression at large transverse sphericity region are observed in A+A collisions compared to their p+p references, which implies that the event in heavy-ion collisions becomes more pencile-like relative to that in p+p.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe further explore the underlying reasons of the medium alteration of transverse sphericity distribution $S_{\\perp}$.  Our numerical results show that the parton energy loss effect on multiple jet events ($n_{jet}\\geq 3$) may cause the event more pencil-like, because  in this kind of process jets usually have relatively smaller energies and may fall off the jet selection kinematic cut after their energy loss in the medium. Furthermore, we plot the event normalized azimuth angle correlation factor ($\\Delta \\phi_{j1,j2}$) between the two leading jets for the full events both in p+p and A+A collisions. We demonstrate that jet quenching effect will enhance the fraction of events in back-to-back region ($\\Delta \\phi_{j1,j2}\\sim \\pi$) and naturally lead the full events to be more \"jetty\".  Therefore, even though medium-induced gluon radiation may lead to a more isotropic event, the disappearing of less energetic jets and the enhanced fraction of back-to-back  ($\\Delta \\phi_{j1,j2}\\sim \\pi$) reaction are more pronounced and thus give rise to an overall more pencil-like event in high-energy nuclear collisions with respect to that in p+p.",

However, if there is a critical point in the QCD phase diagram then all characteristic temperatures should converge  and, depending on the universality class, some of the hydrodynamic transport coefficients themselves may diverge.  In order to explore out-of-equilibrium effects in the QCD phase diagram we use 1+0D (Bjorken flow) viscous hydrodynamics to study the hydrodynamical lifetime, cavitation, and attractor physics in a simple cross-over phase transition versus one with a critical point (where we expect all characteristic temperatures to converge).  Comparisons between results obtained using an equation of state with nonzero baryon, strange, and electric charge chemical potentials and results obtained using the assumption of only a finite baryon chemical potential (i.e. $\\mu_S=\\mu_Q=0$) are also made.",

It was found that the electrons from heavy quarks (charm, and bottom) are less or similarly suppressed compared to that of light hadrons. However, the mass ordering of the suppression between charm and bottom was not clear by now due to a large uncertainty in the measurement. We have fully exploited the events recorded at PHENIX from Au+Au collisions in the 2014 RHIC run. Combined with the new charm and bottom $p_{T}$ spectra from p+p collisions from the 2015 RHIC run, we can obtain the new $R_{AA}$ for charm and bottom quarks with smaller uncertainties. We will show the latest results on $p_{T}$ spectra and $R_{AA}$ of charm and bottom quarks separately, and discuss the quark mass dependence of the energy loss",

      "Abstract": "The equation of state of dense nuclear matter, while central in simulations of QCD systems under extreme conditions, is currently inaccessible to first principles calculations. Using relativistic density functional theory, we model the thermodynamics and single-particle equations of motion of nuclear matter over a broad range of temperatures and densities encompassing nuclei, neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and relativistic heavy ion collisions. We obtain a flexible and thermodynamically consistent framework to parameterize the known properties of ordinary nuclear matter and postulate a family of equations of state compatible with the QCD phase transition. Eventually, these equations of state will be constrained by comparison with experimental data. As a first step, we implement the corresponding relativistically covariant single-particle equations of motion within a hadronic transport model and investigate the behavior of dense nuclear matter close to the phase transition.",

Investigation of the space-time structure of hadron emissions at various phase transition points using Bose-Einstein correlation of identical bosons will provide insight on the location of the critical endpoint. PHENIX has performed comprehensive measurements of the Bose-Einstein correlation in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 15, 19, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV, where we incorporated Levy-type source function to describe the measured correlation functions. We also extended our analysis from two particles to three particle correlations to characterize the nature of the hadron emission source. We put particular focus on one of the parameters in the Levy-type source function, the index of stability $\\alpha$, which is related to one of the critical exponents (the so-called correlation exponent $\\eta$). We have measured its collision energy and centrality dependence. In addition, we have discovered a product of Levy parameters which has a dimension of length which is linear in $m_T$ whose interpretation is still under debate. The three particle correlations confirmed the findings of the two-particle correlations, and also provided insight on pion production mechanism beyond Core-Halo models. We will present the latest PHENIX results on the multi-particle Bose-Einstein correlation, and discuss its physics interpretation.",

      "Abstract": "We explore the directed, elliptic, triangular and quadrangular flow of deuterons in Au+Au reactions at a beam energy of 1.23 AGeV within the UrQMD approach. These investigations are of direct relevance for the HADES experiment at GSI that has recently presented first data on the flow of light clusters in Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV. To address the deuteron flow, UrQMD has been extended to include deuteron formation by coalescence. We find that this ansatz provides a very good description of the measured deuteron flow data, if a hard equation of state is used for the simulation. In addition we show that light cluster formation has a sizable impact on the proton flow and has to be taken into account to obtain reliable results in the forward/backward region. Based on the observed scaling of the flow, which is a natural result of coalescence, we conclude that deuteron production at GSI energies is a final state recombination effect. Finally, we also discuss the scaling relations of the higher order flow components up to $v_4$. We show that $v_3 \\sim v_1v_2$ and $v_4 \\sim v_2^2$ as function of transverse momentum and that the integrated $v_2^2 \\sim v_4$ over the investigated energy range from $E_{lab}$=0.1 AGeV to 40 AGeV.",

It was suggested that the CVE can be generalized to systems of higher-spin particles and, particularly, to photons. However, there is no local gauge invariant definition of photonic helicity current. This problem can be overcome with an appropriate choice of the polarization measure.  Recently, it was shown that there is a vortical effect in photonic zilch current (ZVE), which can play the role of a local gauge invariant helicity separation measure. In this work we study the zilch current in terms of chiral kinetic theory and show that the ZVE can be related to the non trivial topological properties of the system in momentum space manifested through the Berry phase. We also show how the ZVE arises in terms of the Wigner-function formalism for vector particles.",

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, quark-gluon plasma can have a supersonic motion in the longitudinal direction. The quark-gluon plasma also has barotropic equation of state, negligibly small $\\eta/s$ ratio, and irrotational velocity profile (specially in the central collisions, where there is no net initial angular momentum). Thus it can be used to construct an analog model of gravity, and there is possibility to have analog (acoustic) black hole Hawking radiation  in the fluid. The plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions has a large velocity gradient in the longitudinal direction. Therefore, analog Hawking temperature, produced in the fluid, can not be neglected in comparison to the background temperature of the fluid. Using ultra-relativistic quantum molecular  dynamics model (UrQMD), we show that it is possible to have temporarily static sonic horizon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions allowing the applicability  of conventional ideas of Hawking radiation. We also study the time evolution of conformal factor (energy density/baryon density where fluid velocity is zero) arising in the acoustic metric and discuss its possible implications (as well as the implications of moving acoustic horizon). We propose possible observational signal for this Hawking radiation in the experiment.",

      "Abstract": "Jets are collimated bunches of hadrons produced from fragmentation and hadronization of hard scattered partons (quarks and gluons) in high energy collisions. Due to the different color charges of quarks and gluons, differences in the fragmentation of the two types of partons are expected. Therefore jets originated from primary quarks and gluons, are predicted to have different properties. Experimental measurements of inclusive jets have contributions from both types of partons. The partonic fraction in the inclusive jets is expected to be reflected in their properties. The gluonic contribution increases with increasing $\\sqrt{s}$ due to an increase in gluon density inside the hadron. The gluonic contribution is argued to vary with event multiplicity as well. Jet properties are therefore expected to depend on $\\sqrt{s}$ and event multiplicity. In this work, we will present a detailed study to estimate the change in the inclusive jet properties as a function of $\\sqrt{s}$ and event multiplicity for pp collisions using Monte Carlo simulations at LHC energies.",

With this method we are able to study the correlations as a function of particle pseudorapidity gap between each particle in the multiparticle correlations.

      "Abstract": "We present an object-oriented software framework for performing the anisotropic flow analysis in collisions of ions and hadrons. The framework operates on flow Q-vectors and provides an abstraction layer for the analysis of two and multi-particle correlation functions. Its modular design and flexible interface allows to use it as an external software package, which fits the scope of any experimental setup.\r\n\r\nThe current version implements commonly used flow observables, multi-differential corrections of Q-vectors with the possibility for data preprocessing to account for detector azimuthal non-uniformity. The extension of the core functionality and the definition of new observables and correction steps is straightforward. The framework supports multi-differential flow analyses with statistical uncertainty propagation based on subsampling and/or bootstrapping algorithms. To illustrate the flexibility and powerful functionality of the framework, examples of application to data analyses of ALICE at the LHC, NA49 and NA61/SHINE at SPS, and the future CBM experiment at FAIR will be shown.",

      "Abstract": "Because of their early production, charm quarks are sensitive to the entire evolution of the system created in ultra-relativistic collisions of heavy ions. In particular, charm quark elliptic ﬂow (v2) is a valuable tool for study of charm transport in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recent results from the STAR experiment show that in 10-40% central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy the D0-meson v2 follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark(NCQ) scaling similarly as light-ﬂavor hadrons. To gain more insight into the charm quark dynamics it is of interest to study their ﬂow in events with different initial conditions.\r\n\r\nIn this poster,  we will present D0-meson v2 measurement with the event-shape-engineering technique applied in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The measurement utilizes the STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker and the combined datasets recorded during RHIC 2014 + 2016 runs. D0 v2 will be reported as a function of the reduced ﬂow vector q2 and compared to that of light-ﬂavor and strange hadrons. Furthermore, we utilize the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) detector covering the range of 2.5 < η < 4. The large η-gap helps to reduce the non-ﬂow contribution in the D0 v2 measurement. These results will be compared to model calculations and physics implications on the charm quark diffusion coefficient will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the thermalized matter is tilted in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity, while the production profile of partons from hard scatterings is symmetric in rapidity [1]. This leads to a rapidity-odd asymmetry in the medium path length traversed by the hard partons and results in a rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$). Measurements of high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ hadron $v_1$ can provide valuable constraints on the initial longitudinal distribution of the fireball as well as the path length-dependent momentum loss of the partons. A similar effect, producing significantly large directed flow for heavy flavor mesons, was predicted [2] and has been observed for $D^0$ mesons (at 3$\\sigma$ significance) by STAR recently.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the first measurement of pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the $v_1$ of high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ ($>$ 5 GeV/c) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 54.4 and 200 GeV. The $v_1$ of charged hadrons is found to change sign twice as a function of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and show large negative slope at high-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$, similarly to $D^0$ mesons.

      "Abstract": "The sPHENIX detector at BNL’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will enable a spectrum of new or improved cold QCD measurements, enhancing our understanding of the initial state for nuclear collisions. With its excellent tracking and full calorimetry (hadronic and electromagnetic) in the central pseudo-rapidity region, sPHENIX provides excellent opportunities for the studies of the partonic structure and dynamics in nucleons and nuclei. This includes the studies of the polarized structure of the proton utilizing RHIC's polarized proton collisions. With enhanced RHIC luminosity anticipated in 2020+, and sPHENIX high rate capabilities, the expected precisions will far exceed that achieved at RHIC by now. Among such measurements are high precision polarized gluon distribution in the proton utilizing jet, hadron and direct photon probes, gluon dynamics studies in protons and nuclei through twist-3 correlation functions with heavy flavor measurements, and studies beyond the collinear distributions involving intrinsic transverse momentum kT and fragmentation transverse momentum jT through the correlation measurements. A potential upgrade to sPHENIX with forward instrumentation could significantly enhance these physics capabilities, expanding the probed kinematic range to lower and higher parton momentum fraction x. Nuclear parton distributions will be constrained from direct photon and Drell-Yan electron-positron pair measurements. A unique opportunity to study nuclear effects with polarized probes will be utilized through the high precision measurements of transverse spin asymmetry in hadron production in p+p versus p+A collisions over a wide kinematic range. These and other Cold QCD physics measurements for the proposed sPHENIX midrapidity detector as well as the enhanced program enabled with forward upgrades will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "We explore features of harmonic flow in ultra-relativistic collisions involving light nuclei. For the light-light nuclear collisions, such as 16O-16O reaction considered for the upcoming experimental program at RHIC and the LHC, we make definite predictions based on ratios of cumulants. We also point out very interesting aspects of the light-heavy collisions, where the light nucleus is clustered, thus carries intrinsic deformation. There has been a quest for alpha clustering in nuclei over the last 80 years, but evidence at low energies has usually been rather indirect through theoretical studies of binding energies and nuclear sizes. We present here direct experimental signatures of clusterization of light nuclei in ultra-relativistic collisions of 7,9Be, 12C, and 16O on heavy nuclei. Clustering leads to very specific spatial correlations of the nucleon distributions in the ground state of the light nucleus and in the formed fireball, which via collective evolution become manifest in the harmonic flow coefficients of the produced hadron distributions [1-3]. In particular, the elliptic flow is sensitive to clusterization in 7,9Be, and the triangular flow to clusterization in 12C and 16O. \r\n\r\n1.

      "Abstract": "Anisotropic flow is a useful observable to quantify the transport properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions and to probe the hydrodynamic flow in small collision systems e.g. proton-proton (pp) and proton-lead (p--Pb) collisions. The experimental observed \"correct\" signs of multi-particle cumulants of $v_n$ coefficient in small collision systems, in particular, the negative sign of $c_{2}\\{4\\}$, are usually interpreted as the signature of hydrodynamic flow. In this talk, I present the investigations on 2- and multi-particle cumulants in high-multiplicity pp collisions, using iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model with HIJING initial condition. Although the model with tuned parameters could nicely describe almost all experimental measurements of two-particle correlations, however, it could not generate the negative $c_{2}\\{4\\}$. In addition, I will show that this positive $c_{2}\\{4\\}$ in hydro is not caused by possible non-flow contributions (resonances decay), multiplicity fluctuations (fake flow) or the multi-particle cumulant method itself (statistical stability). Further investigations by replacing HIJING initial conditions with super-MC and TRENTo initial conditions, and by including pre-equilibrium effects and kinetic theory, can not have the ability to reproduce the observed negative $c_{2}\\{4\\}$. It is also seen that the hydrodynamic evolution generates an additional non-linear (cubic) response of $v_{2}$ to initial eccentricity $\\varepsilon_2$, which results in a positive $c_{2}\\{4\\}$ despite the negative $\\varepsilon_{2}\\{4\\}$ obtained in the first place.\r\n\r\nTwo new questions then appear, whether the success of hydrodynamic calculations in 2-particle correlations and failure of hydrodynamic descriptions of multi-particle cumulants requires a novel understanding of initial conditions or the one fluid may not rule them all. In this talk, together with the new calculations from AMPT transport model with various scenarios and also PYTHIA model (with and without color reconnection, with and without string shoving), I will address that using the well known 2- and multi-particle cumulants we can answer the unknown initial versus final stage effects in small collision systems.",

We find that the systematic ordering of the magnitude of elliptic and triangular momentum anisotropies between different small systems requires the presence of final state effects. We further study the time evolution of the momentum ansiotropy and the correlation between the orientation of the spatial geometry and the momentum flow, which reveals qualitative differences between large and small systems.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions have demonstrated long-range azimuthal correlations between charged particle pairs, commonly interpreted as arising from a single particle azimuthal anisotropy. To better illuminate the origin and nature of these collective signatures, ATLAS presents studies in proton-proton collisions with a novel handle on event geometry, and in photo-nuclear collisions. In proton-proton collisions, the impact-parameter dependence of these correlations are studied in events containing a Z-boson, which acts as an independent handle on the impact parameter. This talk presents updated measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy in such Z-tagged $pp$ collisions at 8 and 13 TeV. The measurements include studies of the $p_{T}$, event-multiplicity, and collision energy dependence of the anisotropy as well as their comparisons to the inclusive $pp$ collisions. In addition, two-particle correlations are presented in a qualitatively new collision system of ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. Even if the passing nuclei are well-separated and do not interact hadronically in these collisions, a quasi-real photon from the EM field of one nucleus can interact with the other nucleus. The photons may reach energies up to 80 GeV and readily fluctuate into vector meson configurations. Thus these photo-nuclear collisions may proceed as rho-nucleus collisions albeit at a significantly lower collision energy than the equivalent nucleon-nucleon energy. This talk presents new measurements of two-particle correlations and characterizes particle production in photo-nuclear collisions, which have multiplicities significantly smaller than $pp$ collisions and center of mass energies between those available at RHIC and the LHC.",

Motivated by these data, we develop a unified and a phenomenological description of the QGP formation based on the dynamical initialization model [3].\r\n\r\nFirst we obtain the initially produced partons using PYTHIA8 on an event-by-event basis. From these initial partons, we generate initial conditions of QGP fluids as a dynamical process. Here we assume the core--corona picture: Local equilibrium is likely to be achieved among highly populated partons\r\ndue to multi-secondary scatterings, while partons tend to traverse without being QGP components when these are in low density regions.\r\nNext we separate dynamically initial partons into QGP fluids (core: dense/soft components) and surviving partons (corona: dilute/hard components) under this assumption. After hydrodynamic evolution, the QGP fluids (the core) are particlized in the decoupling hypersurface, while surviving partons (the corona) are hadronized through string fragmentation in PYTHIA. The final hadron spectra is a sum of both contributions from the core and the corona in this model.\r\n\r\nWe show the (multi-)strangeness yield ratios monotonically increase with multiplicity due to the competition between core and corona components and successfully reproduce the tendency of experimental data [2]. We also find that the ratios scale with multiplicity regardless of collision energies or system size, which is consistent with experimental findings [2]. Moreover, we calculate the fraction of fluidized energy as a function of multiplicity from small to large systems and find that initial partons are almost fluidized in mid-rapidity even in $\\langle dN/d\\eta \\rangle > \\sim 10$.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Y.Kanakubo, M.Okai, Y.Tachibana and T.Hirano, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics 2018, no.12, 121D01  (2018).\r\n\r\n[2] J.Adam et al.

      "Abstract": "The ATLAS collaboration has recently shown that anisotropic flow exhibits a strong centrality dependence in ultracentral collisions [arXiv:1904.04808]. In particular, the 4-particle cumulant of elliptic flow changes sign, and the centrality at which this change of sign occurs depends on the observable which is used to determine the centrality. We show that these features are universal consequences of impact parameter fluctuations within a centrality bin. More precisely, they naturally follow from the fact that the relation between the impact parameter and the experimentally-determined centrality is not one to one.",

Then, using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, we make an explicit connection between the initial geometry and these principal components. The usual eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow implies only a leading principal component, but by including more terms in a cumulant expansion, we can also describe subleading PCA modes, and explicitly show what properties of the initial state generate these subleading fluctuations.  In particular, subleading elliptic flows are generated by higher order cumulants, and therefore probe small length scales of the initial state.  Conversely, subleading triangular flow is more sensitive to nonlinear, mixed harmonic geometric anisotropies. With this information, it will be possible to put new constraints on properties of the early-time dynamics of a heavy-ion collision, including small-scale structure, as well as properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] M.

      "Abstract": "To assess the properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions, correlations between the mean transverse momentum, [$p_{T}$], and the magnitude of the flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, are measured by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.  The analysis uses data samples of lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV and proton-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 22 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$ and 28 nb$^{-1}$, respectively. The correlations are measured using a modified Pearson coefficient that is independent of multiplicity fluctuations. To suppress any short-range correlations, the [$p_{T}$] is measured at mid-rapidity and the flow harmonics are measured at forward rapidity.\r\nIn Pb+Pb collisions, significant (non-zero) values of the correlation coefficients are observed for all studied harmonics, which show a strong centrality  dependence but vary only weakly with the charged particle $p_{T}$ range used in the measurement. On the other hand, in $p$+Pb collisions, the correlation coefficient measured for the 2$^{nd}$ harmonic is found to show only a weak centrality dependence. The predictions of a 3+1D viscous-hydrodynamic model are found to be qualitatively consistent with the data, indicating hydrodynamic origin of these correlations in $p$+Pb collisions.\r\nAs an independent test for the hydrodynamic description of collectivity observed in $p$+Pb collisions, measurements of two-pion HBT correlations as a function of the angle of the pion pair with respect to the second-order event plane angle are presented. The HBT correlation functions, corrected for event plane resolution, are measured as a function of $q_{out}$, $q_{side}$ and $q_{long}$ in intervals of pair transverse momentum and second-order flow-vector magnitude. The correlation functions are fit using the Bowler-Sinyukov form with the exponential HBT correlation function. The extracted HBT radii, $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$ and $R_{long}$ and a significant out-side cross-term are found to exhibit significant modulation with respect to the second-order event plane, similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions. Results of the measurements and physics implications of the result, will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The applicability of fluid-dynamical models in the extreme conditions produced in heavy ion collisions has not yet been properly understood from a theoretical point of view. This happens mostly because the derivation of hydrodynamics from microscopic theory often relies on the assumption that the system is sufficiently close to local equilibrium -- something difficult to justify in the rapidly expanding systems created in heavy ion collisions. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution we propose a more general derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from kinetic theory, in which the fluid is assumed to be close to an isotropic non-equilibrium state instead of an equilibrium one. We demonstrate that, for a wide variety of non-equilibrium states, one obtains a hydrodynamic theory described by equations of motion that are identical to those commonly solved in heavy ion collisions. The only difference appears in the form of the transport coefficients that enter the equations of motion. Simulations of the relativistic Boltzmann equation equation in 0+1D Bjorken flow in the ultrarelativistic limit are performed to demonstrate this effect, showing that the time evolution of the energy-momentum tensor appears to be fluid-dynamical even when the momentum distribution of the underlying degrees of freedom differs significantly from an equilibrium distribution.",

      "Institute": "University of Illinois at Chicago",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Recent measurements and hydrodynamic model calculations suggest that the higher-order flow coefficients, $v_{n}$ (n $>$ 3), have two contributions: a linear contribution driven by the initial-state eccentricities, $\\epsilon_{n}$, and a mode-coupled contribution derived from the lower-order eccentricity coefficients $\\epsilon_{2}$ and $\\epsilon_{3}$. Measurement of these two contributions to $v_{n}$ provides crucial insights to discern initial-state models and to constrain the temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity, $\\eta/s(T)$, of the plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we have employed the traditional, two- and three-subevents cumulant techniques to provide the first beam-energy and collision-system dependence of the linear and mode-coupled contributions to the higher-order flow harmonics and the associated correlations between different flow symmetry planes. Our results will be presented and discussed for several transverse momenta selections, particle species, and centrality intervals for U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 193 GeV, Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200, 54.4, 39 and 27 GeV and Cu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The results are compared with similar studies performed by ALICE/CMS/ATLAS experiments at LHC. The measurements will also be compared to several viscous hydrodynamic calculations to pin down the respective influence of initial-state fluctuations, mixed harmonic correlations, system-size, shape ($\\varepsilon$) and $\\eta/s(T)$ on $v_{n}$.",

      "Abstract": "Jets engender physics over a multitude of scales, from the hardest interactions in a heavy-ion collision (up to a TeV at the LHC), down to the scale of the freeze-out temperature. A complete description of jet modification must address the role and interplay of the physics at each of these scales and their effect on a wide variety of integrated and differential jet observables. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present such a comprehensive study by performing a model-to-data comparison for leading hadrons, inclusive jets, and jet substructure observables [1,2]. Using the JETSCAPE framework [3], we succeed in providing a simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor for single hadrons and jets, jet shape, and jet fragmentation function within a unified multi-stage framework which spans multiple centralities, energies and jet radii. This multi-scale approach includes a high virtuality (radiation dominated) generator (MATTER), followed by an on-shell energy loss generator (LBT/MARTINI) or a strongly coupled drag energy loss (AdS/CFT) stage [4]. Each stage transitions to the next at a parton-by-parton level, depending on local quantities such as the parton’s energy, virtuality, and the local density. Measurements of jet and single hadron $R_{AA}$ set strong constraints on the phase-space available for each stage of the energy-loss. We also incorporate jet-medium response through a weakly-coupled transport description with recoil particles excited from the QCD medium. We highlight the central role played by recoil in the description of both integrated jet observables and the sub-structure of the jet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] JETSCAPE Collaboration, C.

The splitting history of the D meson initiated jet is mapped onto the Lund plane, where appropriate cuts can be made to suppress hadronisation effects. The reported variable is the splitting angle with respect to the D meson axis, which is updated after each splitting. Track-based jet finding, along with the low $p_{\\rm T}^{\\rm ch}$ reach of the ALICE detector, allow for an accurate reconstruction of the splitting angle in the phase-space where the dead-cone effect is expected to be largest.

      "Abstract": "The observed suppression of inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions at LHC has a very weak $p_{T}$ dependence over a large range of $p_{T}$ = 50-1000 GeV and is almost independent of the colliding energy, though the initial energy density of the formed QGP has increased significantly from $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 to 5.02 TeV. This interesting phenomenon is fully investigated in the linear Boltzmann transport(LBT) model for jet propagation combined event-by-event 3+1D hydro backgrounds. We found that the $p_{T}$ dependence of jet $R_{AA}$ is determined by the initial spectrum in $pp$ collisions and jet quenching in which medium response has a significant contribution. Furthermore, the energy loss distribution is extracted directly from experimental data within a Beyesian method, which provides a model-independent approach to understand jet quenching in detail. The extracted jet energy loss distributions have a scaling behavior and indicate that jet quenching is caused on the average by only a few out-of-cone scatterings.",

I will show that\r\nthe dynamical description of this phase transition, in nuclear collisions, will lead to the formation of dense baryon clusters at the phase boundary [2]. Using state-of-the-art machine learning methods I will show that the coordinate space clumping leaves characteristic imprints on the spatial net density distribution in almost every event. On the other hand the momentum distributions do not show any clear event-by-event features. In fact only a few events can be systematically differentiated when only the momentum space information is available. In such a scenario conventional observables, like the baryon number cumulants seem to be the best hope at finding signals for the phase transition. Indeed it is shown that the third order cumulant, the skewness, shows a peak at the beam energy where the system, created in the heavy ion collision, reaches the deconfinement phase transition.

      "Speaker": "Yi Yin",
      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Upcoming experimental programs, like the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC, will look for signatures of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram in fluctuation observables. To understand and predict these signatures, one must account for the fact that the dynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium: because of critical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the droplet of QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their out-of-equilibrium dynamics must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the cooling droplet. The recently developed Hydro+ formalism allows for a consistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations, including the feedback between them. We shall provide the first demonstration of how this works, setting up a Hydro+ simulation in a simplified setting: a rapidity-independent fireball undergoing radial flow with an equation of state in which we imagine a critical point close to the μB = 0 axis of the phase diagram. Within this setup, we show that we can quantitatively capture non-equilibrium phenomena, including critical fluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore,  we show the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the hydrodynamic flow of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical fluctuations lag relative to how they would evolve if they stayed in equilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to the  out-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports fluctuations outwards by advection.",

New results on deuteron production as a function of multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented, as well as the measurement of $^{3}$He in (triggered) p-Pb collisions. The goal is to study whether (anti-)nuclei production in small systems is better described by the coalescence model or by the statistical hadronisation model. The coalescence parameter $B_{A}$ is studied as a function of transverse momentum in the different systems and as a function of the event multiplicity. In addition, the measurement of the (anti-)deuteron production in jets will be presented and compared with theoretical models.",

This is done by carefully stacking individual parton-level\r\nnucleon-nucleon collisions together according to the so-called\r\nAngantyr model.  The sub-events are produced using the full Pythia8\r\nmachinery with initial and final state parton showers and multi-parton\r\ninteractions, and the combined heavy-ion event is hadronised with the\r\nLund String Fragmentation model to give a detailed picture of the\r\nhadronic final state.\r\n\r\nThe Angantyr model, which will be described in this talk, includes an\r\nadvanced Glauber model where fluctuations in the nucleon wave function\r\nare taken into account to characterise the nature of each individual\r\nnucleon-nucleon collision. This information is then used to steer the\r\ngeneration of the corresponding sub-event.\r\n\r\nThe model successfully describes general features, such as\r\nmultiplicity and rapidity distributions, in both AA and pA events at\r\nthe LHC and elsewhere. Together with the excellent overall description\r\nof pp data provided by Pythia8 itself, this gives a perfect platform\r\nfor studying the the transition from small to large systems.\r\n\r\nCurrently there are, however, no collective effects included for\r\nheavy-ion collisions in Pythia8, and the program is mainly used as a\r\nbaseline for investigating eg. non-flow effects on observables\r\nsensitive to collective effects. However, it can also be used as a\r\nframework for implementing and testing microscopic models of\r\ncollective behaviour.

Exploiting its optimal particle identification capabilities, the ALICE experiment is able to measure pion, kaon (anti-)proton, strange and multi-strange hadron production in a wide transverse momentum range. We report on the study of the light-flavour hadron production as a function of multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions in ALICE, showing results which \r\nsuggest qualitatively similar mechanisms in play in Pb-Pb collisions and high-multiplicity pp or p-Pb ones.

The mass dependence of the sequential hadron formation provides us a new tool for studying the quark-gluon plasma hadronization in high energy nuclear collisions.

We focused on particle lists which differ largely in the number of resonant states. By doing so, our analysis determines the effect of the amount of resonances included in the HRG model on the freeze-out conditions. In view of the future $\\Lambda$ fluctuation measurements, we predict the $\\Lambda$ variance over mean and skewness times variance at the light and strange chemical freeze-out parameters. We observe that the $\\Lambda$ fluctuations are sensitive to the difference in the freeze-out temperatures established in this analysis.

      "Abstract": "A precise understanding of the Equation of State of dense objects like neutron stars is limited by the knowledge about the hyperon interaction and the precision of the models describing the latter. Traditionally, meson exchange models are used to describe the hyperon sector and are constrained by the scarce scattering and hypernuclei data, almost exclusively available for $\\Lambda$ hyperons. Recently the HAL-QCD collaboration conducted calculations without relying on constraints by data and with quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom. Their results converge for the interactions between heavier $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ hyperons and nucleons and in the p-$\\Omega$ system they predict a bound state.\r\nFemtoscopy measurements in small systems make it possible to map the core of the potential at small distances and are currently the only viable way to provide a sensitive experimental measurement to test the lattice potentials. In this talk, we present the first precise study of the p$\\Xi^-$ and p$\\Omega^-$ interactions measured in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. For the first time, clear signatures of the strong attractive interaction can be observed for these particles. The potentials provided by HAL-QCD calculations and meson-exchange are transformed so they can be compared to the measured correlation functions. For the p$\\Xi^-$ interaction the HAL-QCD prediction is strongly favoured by the data with respect to the meson-exchange model. For the p$\\Omega^-$ channel, strongly bound systems are excluded and the comparison between data and calculations leaves only room for binding energies below 1 MeV.",

      "Abstract": "Strangeness (especially the multi-strangeness) production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy ion collisions. The ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of nuclear matter, such as the strangeness chemical potential and the chemical freeze-out temperature. The yield ratios $(N_{K}N_{\\Xi})/(N_{\\phi}N_{\\Lambda})$ and $(N_{K}N_{\\Omega})/(N_{\\phi}N_{\\Xi})$  are suggested in [1] to be sensitive to strange quark density fluctuations. Studying these ratios as a function of collision energy may provide a unique probe to the fluctuation of strange quark densities during the phase transition from the QGP to hadronic matter. Furthermore,  the STAR fixed-target program extends the low energy reach from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 3.0 GeV, corresponding to baryon chemical potential from 420 MeV to about 700 MeV. The comparison between the asymmetric system (Al+Au) and symmetric system (Au+Au) at almost equal number of participating nucleons from most central to mid-central collisions provides useful information on nucleon stopping, which is key to understanding the baryon chemical potential. Moreover, in the asymmetric Al+Au system, the peaks of the rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$) are not aligned with the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass rapidity. The magnitude of the peak shift varies with particle species and also with centrality and can serve as a measure of the baryon stopping. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present new measurements of mid-rapidity $K^0_{S}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 54.4 and 27 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The thermodynamic properties of high temperature and high density QCD-matter are explored within the Chiral SU(3)-flavor parity-doublet Polyakov-loop quark-hadron mean-field model, CMF. The applications of the CMF model to the lattice QCD data, heavy-ions physics, and static neutron stars are presented. In the CMF-model the transition between hadron-dominated and quark-dominated regimes is performed according to the lattice QCD data at zero net-baryon density. At low temperatures the CMF model reproduces known properties of nuclear matter while quarks become dominant at densities $\\approx 7$ times nuclear saturation density. In the scope of the lattice QCD data the CMF model predictions for lines of constant physics as well as the baryon number susceptibilities are discussed. The calculated skewness and kurtosis predict three consecutive transitions in phase diagram, the nuclear first-order liquid-vapor phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration, and the cross-over transition to pure quark matter. The deviations from the free ideal hadron gas baseline at $\\mu_B=0$ and $T\\approx 100-200$ MeV can be attributed to remnants of the first order phase transition in the nuclear matter. The chiral crossing transition and cross-over to quark matter determine the baryon fluctuations at much higher $\\mu_B$. The trajectories of heavy-ion collisions along the phase diagram are calculated. The CMF model also describe well the static properties of neutron stars in agreement with data extracted from GW170817 neutron star merger event.\r\n\r\n[1]  A. Motornenko, J. Steinheimer, V.

      "Abstract": "In the presence of the large initial angular momentum occurring in non-central heavy-ion collisions, vector mesons can be polarized due to spin-orbital-angular-momentum interaction or they can be polarized during the hadronization process from polarized quarks. Experimentally, this phenomenon can be studied by measuring the angular distribution of the decay daughters of vector mesons with respect to a quantization axis in the rest frame of vector meson. This quantization axis can be the normal to the production plane (defined by the momentum of vector meson and the beam axis) or normal to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter and the beam axis) of the system. The study of the angular distribution leads to the estimation of the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$. A significant deviation of the value of $\\rho_{00}$ from 1/3, which causes a non-uniform angular distribution, would indicate the presence of spin alignment.\r\n\r\nWe will present recent measurements of spin alignment for K$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $\\phi(1020)$ mesons at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb and pp collisions with the ALICE detector.

The global spin alignment is quantified by the diagonal spin density matrix element ($\\rho_{00}$) with respect to the quantization axis, i.e. normal to the reaction plane. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, a large initial global angular momentum is expected to be present. This can induce a non-vanishing polarization for hadrons with non-zero spin reflecting the dynamics of the medium. Furthermore, since the magnetic moment of charged and neutral $K^{*}$ mesons differ by about a factor of seven, the comparison of their  $\\rho_{00}$ may offer an additional insight into the rotation of the fireball. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe will present transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and collision centrality dependence of $\\rho_{00}$ of $K^{*0} (d\\bar{s})$, $\\overline{K}^{*0}(\\bar{d}s)$,  $K^{*+} (u\\bar{s})$, $K^{*-}(\\bar{u}s)$ and $\\phi (s\\bar{s})$ vector mesons in Au + Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 27, 54.4 and  200~GeV using high statistics data sets collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

It is based on scatterings of particles as wave packets, an effective method to deal with particle scatterings at specified impact parameters. The polarization is then the consequence of particle collisions in a non-equilibrium state of spins. The spin-vorticity coupling naturally emerges from the spin-orbit one encoded in polarized scattering amplitudes of collisional integrals when one assumes local equilibrium in momentum but not in spin.",

At weak coupling, we demonstrate the emergence of early hydrodynamic behavior--prescaling--around a nonthermal fixed point, which is qualitatively different from the more conventional hydrodynamics around equilibrium. Prescaling is a far-from-equilibrium phenomenon which describes the rapid establishment of a universal scaling form of distributions much before the universal values of their scaling exponents are realized. The dynamics in the prescaling regime is encoded in a few time-dependent scaling exponents, whose slow evolution gives rise to far-from-equilibrium hydrodynamic description.\r\n\r\nReference: A.

In this formulation, the transport coefficients of far-from-equilibrium fluid dynamics depend not only on the microscopic properties of the system but also on the nonlinear properties of the underlying state of the fluid itself. In contrast to previous works, no additional assumptions about the symmetries of the flow are necessary. An example of this proposal is constructed using Israel-Stewart theory and, in this case, the resummed transport coefficients decrease with increasing Knudsen number according to formulas that can be readily investigated in current numerical simulations of the quark-gluon plasma. We check numerically the existence of attractor solutions in simulations of AA and pA collisions. This is particularly important to understand the apparent hydrodynamic behavior observed in small systems where gradients are extremely large and resummation techniques should be employed.",

These measurements are sensitive to the effects of color screening, color recombination, and possibly to other, new phenomena affecting dynamics of heavy quarks in the QCD  medium. In the large-statistics Run 2 lead-lead collision data, these phenomena can be probed with unprecedented precision. In this talk, the new ATLAS results on bottomonium nuclear modification factor and excited-to-ground state ratio using 2018 Pb+Pb data and 2017 pp data both at 5.02 TeV will be presented as a function of transverse momentum and event centrality.  Additionally, new measurements on the correlation of the J/$\\psi$ and jet production will be presented, which may help understanding the mechanism of the suppression of J/$\\psi$ measured at high transverse momenta of few tens of GeV.",

      "Abstract": "In holographic heavy ion collisions it is possible to follow both the energy density and a globally conserved (baryon) number density throughout the evolution, dual to a metric and Maxwell field in the dual bulk theory, respectively. At infinite coupling, past work has shown that after the collision the baryon number ends up around mid-rapidity, which is different from high energy heavy ion collisions. In this talk I will present first results for the flow of baryon number in holographic collisions away from the infinite coupling limit, which also means we study the collisions at a larger shear viscosity over entropy density ratio than 1/4π. I will give an introduction to the holographic set-up, which is interesting since it contains an extra coupling of the gravitational Ricci scalar with the Maxwell field. Remarkably, depending on the value of this extra coupling, we find that the flow of baryon number during the collision can be affected drastically. In particular, we find that at intermediate coupling it is possible for almost no baryon number to end up at mid-rapidity. We further show how the matter produced in the collision relaxes into a flow as described by hydrodynamics with a conserved baryon current.",

In this study, we reproduce the centrality dependence of rapidity decorrelation in Pb+Pb collision at LHC by constructing an integrated dynamical model with hydrodynamic fluctuations [1,2] and initial longitudinal fluctuations.\r\n\r\nHydrodynamic fluctuations are thermal fluctuations arising during the hydrodynamic stage of high-energy nuclear collisions. We include hydrodynamic fluctuations obeying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [1]. For initial longitudinal fluctuations, we employ an initial model discussed in Ref. [3]. In this model, we run PYTHIA for each binary $p+p$ collision, scale it by the number of participants and regard the distribution of produced particles as entropy density distribution.

These instabilities are associated with large, anti-collinear, double logarithms which occur when the NLO corrections are computed from the evolution of the *dilute projectile*. We explain how to rewrite the NLO evolution in terms of the rapidity of the *dense target*. This avoids the large anti-collinear contributions but introduces new,  *collinear*, instabilities, which are however milder since disfavoured by  the typical BK evolution. We propose several prescriptions for resumming these new double logarithms and find only little scheme dependence. The  resummed equations are non-local in rapidity and can be extended to full NLO accuracy. We present the first applications of these resummed equations to proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC and deep inelastic scattering at the proposed Electron-Ion Collider.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Lambda polarization $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ was measured by the STAR collaboration [1], confirming the existence of extremely large vorticities within the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A recent study using a high-statistics data set at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV has shown the dependence of $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ on collision centrality, azimuthal angle ($\\varphi$), transverse momentum ($p_T$), pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), etcetera [2][3]. Additionally suggested in [1] is an enhanced $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ relative to $P_{\\Lambda}$ across all beam energies; however, the statistics are too limited to make a significant measurement. No such splitting is observed in the high-statistics $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV data set, but this splitting is expected to increase at lower beam energies. The splitting in polarization would be consistent with the effects of hyperon magnetic-moment coupling with the magnetic field sustained in the QGP; it would have far-reaching consequences important to magnetic-field-dependent observables such as the chiral magnetic effect and would set the scale on the conductivity of the QGP.\r\n\r\nRecently, STAR has taken high-statistics data sets at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 27$ and 54.4 GeV. The 27 GeV data set is considered suitable to study the splitting between $P_{\\Lambda}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ since it includes the recently installed Event-Plane Detector (EPD), which significantly increases the event-plane resolution. Both data sets are used to study the splitting between $P_{\\Lambda}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ as well as the various differential measurements of $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$. Implications of these measurements will also be discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] The STAR Collaboration, Global $\\Lambda$ hyperon polarization in nuclear collisions, Nature 548 (2017) 62.\r\n[2] The STAR Collaboration, Global polarization of Lambda hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, Phys.

This general connection is demonstrated both for a single particle and for a fluid vortex. Applying the idea for heavy ion collisions we propose it as a new mechanism for generating long-lived in-medium magnetic fields. We estimate the magnitude of this new magnetic field in the AuAu colliding systems across a wide span of collisional beam energy. Such a magnetic field is found to rapidly increase toward lower beam energy and could account for a significant amount of the experimentally observed global polarization difference between hyperons and anti-hyperons. Its time-integrated effect could make considerable contributions to the Chiral Magnetic Effect. Further predictions are discussed and experimental tests are suggested.",

Furthermore, a kinetic equation for this dipole moment is derived. Carefully taking the massless limit we find agreement with previous results. The case of global equilibrium with rotation is also studied. Finally, we outline the derivation of fluid-dynamical equations from the components of the Wigner function. The conservation of total angular momentum is promoted as an additional fluid-dynamical equation of motion.

      "Abstract": "The problem of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions presents a set of unique theoretical challenges – from the relevant production mechanism of $J/\\psi$s and $\\Upsilon$s \r\nto the relative significance of distinct cold and hot nuclear matter effects in the observed attenuation of quarkonia. In the well-defined leading power factorization limit of non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) we show conclusively that in spite of certain similarities in the suppression of $J/\\psi$s of moderate transverse momenta to the one of light/heavy hadrons, the familiar parton energy loss picture is distinctly incompatible with the hierarchy of the attenuation of ground and excited quarkonium states.  With this in mind, for heavy quarkonia of moderate energy we generalize the relevant successful theory NRQCD to include interactions in nuclear matter. The new resulting theory, NRQCD with Glauber gluons, provides for the first time a universal microscopic description of the interaction of heavy quarkonia with a strongly interacting medium, consistently applicable to a range of phases, such as cold nuclear matter, dense hadron gas, and quark-gluon plasma. The effective field theory we present in this work is derived from first principles and is an important step forward in understanding the common trends in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus data on quarkonium suppression. We explicitly show the lowest order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) interaction terms in the Lagrangian and discuss the connection of the LO result to existing phenomenology.",

      "Abstract": "We propose and develop a new formalism that generalizes the Color Glass Condensate approach to high energy scattering by including both small and large $x$ gluons in the wave function of a target proton or nucleus. This allows one to treat particle production at both low and high transverse momenta on the same footing. We illustrate the formalism by calculating the differential cross section for scattering of a quark (or gluon) on a target proton or nucleus and show that inclusion of both small and large $x$ gluon modes in the target allows one to investigate forward-backward (in rapidity) asymmetries in high energy collisions. It also leads to both even and odd anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions as well as double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ in polarized proton-proton (light nucleus) scattering. We comment on how the formalism can be extended to study jet energy loss in Quark-Gluon Plasma created in high energy heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Nowadays powerful accelerators collide heavy-ions at high energies in order to recreate the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) which is a hot and dense state of matter that is believed to have filled our universe shortly after the Big Bang. We propose a new approach to study the QGP by using very energetic jets produced in the same collisions which can be utilized as controllable hard probes. Measuring the properties of the QGP such as the temperature or transport coefficients relies on whether it is possible to reliably separate the production of the probe and the formation of the medium. This concept is known as QCD factorization. Starting from an established factorization formalism in proton-proton collisions, we introduce medium modified jet functions to capture the interaction of jets with the QGP. Within a global analysis using a Monte Carlo sampling technique we find that it is indeed possible to describe the data obtained at the LHC. Our results thus support the validity of QCD factorization in the complex heavy-ion environment, and open up a new door to analyze heavy-ion jet data. In addition, our results may serve as guidance for constructing microscopic models of the QGP.",

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "Cross sections for photon production in hadronic scattering processes have been calculated according to an effective chiral field theory. For $\\pi + \\rho \\to \\pi  + \\gamma$  and  $\\pi + \\pi \\to \\rho  + \\gamma$  processes, these cross sections have been implemented into a novel hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which is suitable for collisions at low and intermediate energies. The implementation is verified by systematically comparing the thermal photon rate to theoretical expectations. The impact of form factors is assessed, and scattering processes mediated by ω mesons are found to contribute significantly to the total photon production. The photon rates we obtain are compared with parametrizations commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations, and also with previous works addressing the production of direct photons from the hadronic stage. Finally, the impact of considering the finite width of the $\\rho$ meson is investigated, and a significant enhancement of photon production in the low-energy region is observed. This work is the first step towards a consistent treatment of photon emission in hybrid hydrodynamics+transport approaches, and towards a genuine dynamical description. It will further quantify the importance of the hadronic stage for the resolution of \"the direct photon flow puzzle\" and can be applied to identify equilibrium and non-equilibrium effects in the hadronic afterburner.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nA.

      "Abstract": "We present the first study quantifying the sensitivity of hadron and photon observables to the early-time evolution in heavy-ion collisions which implements a realistic pre-equilibrium stage with effective QCD kinetic theory [1, 2] and a state-of-the-art hybrid (IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD) framework [3]. We calculate photon emission from the pre-equilibrium phase by folding the system's energy momentum-tensor with thermal photon emission rates including their viscous corrections. By changing switching  time and  coupling parameters inherent to the pre-equilibrium evolution, we study how the non-equilibrium phase influences the hadron and photon flow coefficients in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, and O+O collisions at 5 TeV. Because the space-time volume scales differently from the number of binary collisions from O+O to Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions, a systematic system size comparison of photon production can further shed light on the relative contributions from thermal and prompt sources and provide further insight into early time QGP dynamics.\r\n\r\nRecent Bayesian extractions of the QGP bulk viscosity using hadronic observables alone [4]  cannot disentangle easily a large narrow peak temperature dependence of bulk viscosity from a broader $\\zeta/s(T)$ with a lower maximum value. Utilizing the power of photons as clean and penetrating probes, we demonstrate how thermal photon production and its flow coefficients can improve constraints on QGP bulk viscosity owing to its sensitivity to early stages of the QGP evolution.\r\n\r\n[1] A.

      "Abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, one expects copious rates of $\\gamma+\\gamma$ processes through the interaction of the large electromagnetic fields of the nuclei, which can produce new particles (e.g. leptons) or even lead to light-by-light scattering via loop diagrams.  The latter process is a notable prediction of QED and was only recently observed by ATLAS using the full 2018 dataset.  In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), characterized by large impact parameter between the nuclei, the outgoing leptons and photons are produced exclusively, and exhibit a strong back-to-back momentum correlation, with long tails induced by higher-order QED effects. This talk presents measurements of dilepton production and light-by-light scattering performed by the ATLAS collaboration.  The angular correlations as well as differential production cross sections in UPCs are measured and compared to theoretical models, including final state QED radiation.  The role of forward neutron production in disentangling pure QED and dissociative processes will also be discussed.  Finally, limits on axion-like particle production, from the observed light-by-light cross sections, will be discussed.  Muon pairs produced the same two-photon scattering process in hadronic Pb+Pb collisions also potentially provide a sensitive probe of the quark gluon plasma.  First measurements by ATLAS and STAR of dileptons produced via two-photon scattering in non-ultra-peripheral (non-UPC) nucleus-nucleus collisions showed an unexpected centrality-dependent broadening of the angular correlation between the two leptons and/or of the two-lepton $p_T$ distribution. ATLAS has recently measured dimuons produced via two-photon scattering in non-UPC Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using data collected during the 2018 Pb+Pb run at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.73~\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$.  This data set represents a factor of $\\sim4$ increase in statistics over the 2015 data set used for the first ATLAS measurement.  The increased statistics allow new features to be observed in the data, as well as differential studies of the dependence of the pair-distribution on the transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity of the two muons.  The results of the new measurement and the possible physics implications will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are expected to produce some of the strongest magnetic fields ($10^{13}−10^{16}$ Tesla) in the Universe [1]. Recently, there has been intense interest in the magnetic fields produced by heavy ion collisions and their possible observational impacts through phenomena like the Chiral Magnetic Effect. The initial strong electromagnetic fields produced in heavy ion collisions have been proposed as a source of linearly-polarized, quasi-real photons [2] that can interact to produce $e^+e^−$ pairs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present STAR measurements of $e^+e^−$ pair production in ultra-peripheral and peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Multi-differential measurements of the pair kinematics are presented to distinguish the $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^+e^−$ process from other possible production mechanisms. These measurements provide an important experimental tool and baseline for the possible measurement of medium effects driven by strong final state magnetic fields or from Coulomb multiple scattering through the QGP.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we present the first observation of a 4th-order azimuthal modulation of $e^+e^−$ pairs produced in heavy ion collisions. The observed 4th-order angular modulation, a result predicted for the collision of linearly-polarized photons [3], has general implications for fermion, anti-fermion pair production in the collision of polarized fields.

This is demonstrated by the reduced sensitivity on the choice of non-flow subtraction methods as well as a closure test of these methods with the HIJING and AMPT models; 3) the $v_2$ signal is also extracted using four-particle subevent cumulant method in d+Au and $^3$He+Au, and compared with that from two-particle correlations to gain insight on the flow fluctuations in small systems.

The kinetic theory results are compared to data on azimuthal flow coefficients over a wide centrality range in PbPb collisions at the LHC, in AuAu collisions at RHIC, and in pPb collisions at the LHC.  By comparing kinetic transport to viscous fluid dynamics we find that non-hydrodynamic excitations make the dominant contribution to collective flow signals in pPb collisions at the LHC and contribute significantly to flow in peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions, while fluid-like excitations dominate collectivity in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies.",

      "Abstract": "It is the aim of the RHIC BES program and the future FAIR and NICA facilities to produce compressed baryonic matter. In such experiments, strong gradients in baryon density are expected, and therefore the diffusion of baryon number could play a major role in the description of the fireball. The constituents of the produced matter carry a multitude of conserved charges, namely the baryon number, strangeness and electric charge, so that the diffusion currents of conserved charge couple with each other. Therefore, baryon density gradients in the above-mentioned high-density collision experiments will generate equalizing currents in all conserved charges. In common fluid dynamic studies of the evolution of the fireball, this coupling of currents was not accounted for. We provide for the first time a fluid dynamical approach including the complete diffusion coefficient matrix describing the evolution of a dense system with multiple conserved charges. A novel phenomenon arising from the coupled diffusion currents is the generation of positive and negative net-strangeness domains from originally net-strangeness neutral matter.  We show how these domains are generated dynamically, and argue that observing the rapidity dependence of net-strangeness can give an experimental access to diffusion.",

The suppression is observed to have little dependence on $p_{T}$, although cold nuclear matter effects, such as shadowing, anti-shadowing, nuclear or comover absorption, play a significant role at low $p_{T}$. Measurements of the $J/\\Psi$ production in p+A collisions can help us to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects from the hot medium effects in A+A collisions. In this talk, we will present the measurement of $J/\\Psi$ production in p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ will be presented as a function of the event activity (i.e. \"centrality\") and compared to theoretical models. In addition, we will present recent STAR measurements of $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in p+p collisions including their dependence on the charged-particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity.

Finally, we discuss the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential measurements of charged hadrons' $v_{\\rm 2}$ with 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-particle cumulants in context of the underlying PDF.\r\n\r\nWe report the measurements of $\\pi^{\\pm}$, ${\\rm K}^{\\pm}$, ${\\rm p + \\bar{p}}$, $\\rm \\Lambda + \\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\rm \\Xi^{\\pm}$, $\\rm \\Omega^{\\pm}$, $\\rm \\phi$ and inclusive charged hadrons $v_{\\rm n}$ fluctuations, measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN}=5.02{\\rm TeV}$ using multi-particle cumulants with the ALICE detector. Measurements are performed in central pseudorapidity region $|\\eta|<0.8$ and cover a wide transverse momentum range.

For the strangeness neutral case ($\\mu_S=0$) at fixed ratio of electric charge to baryon number density ($\\frac{n_Q}{n_B}=0.4$), which is appropriate for a comparison with heavy ion collisions, we present results for $\\kappa_X \\sigma_X^2$ and  $S_X \\sigma_X$ and $S_X \\sigma_X^3/M_X, (X=B,Q,S)$ on the crossover line for the chiral transition ($T_{pc}(\\mu_B)$). Continuum extrapolations for this pseudo-critical transition line have recently been reported by HotQCD up to baryon chemical potentials $\\mu_B\\simeq 300$ MeV (arXiv:1812.08235). These cumulant ratios thus are of direct relevance for comparisons with corresponding ratios measured by STAR in the BES-I and II runs at beam energies  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge 20$ GeV. In particular, we point out that recent high  statistics results on skewness and kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions obtained by STAR at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV put strong constraints on freeze-out parameters and are consistent with predictions from thermal QCD. Additionally, we show that, unlike in the case of net-baryon number  fluctuations, the kurtosis ratios for strangeness and electric charge are  only weakly dependent on $\\mu_B$.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we also construct Taylor series for baryon-strangeness and baryon-charge correlations up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^4)$ and present results for these observables on the crossover transition line. We point out that these correlations are dominated by correlations in the baryon sector of QCD, which is consistent with recent findings of the STAR collaboration (arXiv:1903.05370). Correlations of proton fluctuations with kaon or pion fluctuations, respectively, thus are poor proxies for studying such correlations on the freeze-out line in heavy ion collisions.",

Recently, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured the elliptic flow and the related number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of identified hadrons in p+Pb collisions at  $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV, which are important observables to probe the partonic degree of freedom in the created small system. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we focus on the coalescence model calculations for the NCQ scaling of  at intermediate $p_T$ for the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions, which includes thermal-thermal, thermal-jet and jet-jet partons recombinations, using the thermal partons from hydrodynamics and jet partons after the energy loss of the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. Such coalescence model calculations have also been smoothly connected with the low hydrodynamic calculation and with high jet fragmentation. Within such combined framework, we present a nice description of the spectra and elliptic flow over the $p_T$ range from 0 to 6 GeV, and obtain the approximately NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$ as measured in experiment. We also switch off the coalescence process of partons and find that without such coalescence, one can not describe the differential elliptic flow and related NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$.  Such comparison calculations also demonstrate the importance of the partonic degree of freedom and indicate the possible formation of QGP in the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions.",

A data-driven statistical method is used to correct for uncorrelated jet background, which includes multi-partonic interactions. This trigger-normalized coincidence approach does not require the association of event activity with collision geometry in order to measure jet quenching, in contrast to inclusive observables, and has been used to set a stringent limit on jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions at the LHC. The magnitude of jet quenching is quantified by comparing recoil jet distributions for low and high-multiplicity pp collisions.",

However, so far no clear  demonstration of jet energy losses in small system collisions have been observed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present correlations of mid-rapidity charged particles to backward-rapidity (Au-going direction) event activity (EA) in 200 GeV p+Au collisions at STAR. They demonstrate an expected positive correlation between high EA at backward-rapidity and the probability of finding a high energy particle at mid-rapidity. Intriguingly, this correlation softens for increasingly energetic triggers. We will also present  semi-inclusive jet spectra at mid-rapidity which, due to self normalization, avoid the difficulties of applying the Glauber model in small systems. The measured high-EA spectrum is distinctly suppressed relative to the low-EA spectrum. We will present comparison of these results to those in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively. EA-dependent modification of the jet spectrum has been observed at the LHC but only for jets at forward-rapidities and appears to scale with Bjorken-$x$. The presented mid-rapidity jet spectra span a similar Bjorken-$x$ range, allowing the Bjorken-$x$ scaling to be tested.",

This experiment will offer the possibility to find signatures of discontinuous transition from QGP to hadronic phase and the QCD critical point where the first order phase transition ends. In the search of the QCD phase transition and its speculated critical point, the most reliable way is to study the fluctuations of conserved charges such as net-baryon (B), net-charge (Q), and net-strangeness (S) number with collision energy in the event by event basis. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss the feasibility studies of conserved charge fluctuations in Au--Au collisions with CBM at SIS100 energies.Au--Au minimum bias events are generated at $E_{lab} = 10$ AGeV using UrQMD model and transported through the CBM detector setup using GEANT3.

These cumulants provide information on the event-by-event fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients $v_{n}$ and correlated fluctuations between two harmonics $v_{n}$ and $v_{m}$. \r\nFor the first time, a non-zero four-particle cumulant is observed for dipolar flow, $v_{1}$. The four-particle cumulants for elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, and triangular flow, $v_{3}$, exhibit a strong centrality dependence and change sign in ultra-central collisions. This sign change is consistent with significant non-Gaussian fluctuations in $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. The four-particle cumulant for quadrangular flow, $v_{4}$, is found to change sign in mid-central collisions. Correlations between two harmonics are found to decrease in strength towards central collisions and either approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse momentum dependent. \r\nThese results provide new information to disentangle flow fluctuations from the initial and final states, as well as new insights on the influence of flow observables by centrality fluctuations.",

      "Abstract": "We present two approaches to handle the dominant elliptic flow ($v_2$) background in the observable, $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$  (charge separation across second-order event plane), sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect (CME).\r\n\r\nIn the first approach, we present the $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ and $\\Delta\\gamma_{123}$ measurements in U+U and Au+Au collisions. While hydrodynamic simulations including resonance decays and local charge conservation predict that $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ scaled by $N_{\\rm part}/v_2$ will be similar in U+U and Au+Au collisions, the projected B-field exhibits a distinct difference between the two systems and with varying $N_{ \\rm part}$. Therefore, U+U and Au+Au collisions provide a two-system configuration to contrast signal and background expectations for the CME. The charge separation across third-order event plane $\\Delta\\gamma_{123}$ scaled by $N_{\\rm part}/v_3$ provides necessary system dependence only from backgrounds. Although some features of our data appear to hint CME interpretation driven by B-field, the background expectations capture most of the observed trends at 200 GeV. We repeat our measurements with the recent high statistics Au+Au collisions data at 27 GeV to see if such a trend persists at lower collision energies. The newly installed forward event plane detector helps to suppress non-flow correlations.\r\n\r\nIn the second approach, we handle the $v_2$ background by measuring $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ with respect to the planes of spectators $\\Psi_{ \\rm ZDC}$ and elliptic anisotropy $\\Psi_2$. These measurements contain different amounts of contributions from CME signal (along B-field, due to spectators) and $v_2$ background (determined by the participant geometry). With the two $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$  measurements, the possible CME signal and the background contribution can be determined. Applying this method, we have previously reported the measurements of possible CME signal fraction in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, revealing dominant background contribution. Here, we report our findings in U+U collisions where the spectator-participant plane correlations are expected to differ from those in Au+Au collisions.",

We attempt to correct for uncorrelated background effects and instrumental effects in the fragmentation functions, and will present preliminary results for central and peripheral collisions.

The multi-differential representations of hadron and dilepton spectra, collective effects and particle correlations will be confronted with results of other experiments as well as with hitherto model calculations.\r\n\r\nTo provide a deeper understanding of the temperature and density dependence of the intriguing results obtained in the Au+Au and Ar+KCl runs, HADES has recently completed a run studying Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.55 GeV, optimized to reach a high enough beam energy for abundant strangeness and vector meson production while yet realizing a large interaction volume. The results obtained for heavy-ion collisions are confronted to studies of elementary reactions serving as a reference for medium effects.",

      "Abstract": "The exotic meson $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$, also known as $X(3872)$, was discovered a decade ago, but the structure of this new state is still under debate. The masses of possible charmonium states from calculations using constituent quark models are too large, and therefore an explanation of the underlying characteristics of this meson remains a challenge. The similarity of the $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ mass and the $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ mass threshold inspired the interpretation that $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is a $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” with small binding energy. Another explanation is that this meson is a tetra-quark, consisting of a di-quark and di-antiquark. Relativistic heavy ion collisions produce an extremely hot and strongly interacting medium, which provides a new environment in which to study the nature of multi-quark states. Because of the dramatically different radii of a $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” and a tetra-quark, the interactions of these two proposed states are expected to interact differently with the medium. Therefore, the yield of $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ in heavy ion collisions can provide insight into its structure. The ratios of production cross-section of fully reconstructed $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ over $\\psi(2S)$ in PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector are presented.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The study of the QCD interaction at high temperature in the heavy quark (HQ) sector has attracted a wide interest in the last decade. The theoretical efforts to build realistic phenomenological models able to predict the main observables for D mesons, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, has lead to a first estimate of the Ds space diffusion of charm quarks. This has been a successful program that  has allowed to have a general consensus that the charm quark interaction is non-perturbative, the estimated Ds is in agreement with current lattice QCD calculations and its thermalization time is of the order of QGP lifetime [1].\r\nGiven the success of this first stage of the study, very recently new important perspectives are emerging. These can lead from one hand to improving the determination of Ds and on the other hand open the way for employing HQ as a novel probe of the initial stage of the ultra-relativistic collisions. \r\nMore directly related to the determination of the HQ diffusion and hadronization are:\r\n- The surprisingly large $\\Lambda_c$ production at both RHIC and LHC energies. We will show that this affects the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ also of the D meson and hence the determination of the HQ interaction [2]. We show also that an hadronization by coalescence plus fragmentation can largely account for this new finding and discuss new prediction for $\\Lambda_b$/B ratio. \r\n- The correlation between the $v_n$ anisotropies of the bulk matter and the one of HQs ($v_n(light), v_n(heavy)$) and, in particular, the normalized variance of $\\sigma_n/ < v_n >$ constitute a novel and more powerful tool to constraint the Ds transport coefficient [3]. \r\n\r\nHQs have been poorly explored as a probe of the initial vorticity and electromagnetic field. We will show that a large directed flow v1 can be generated by the longitudinal initial tilt along with a splitting between D0 and anti-D0 [3]. The last can be seen also as a probe of the deconfined phase. Predictions in agreement with preliminary STAR data will be presented together with first results compared to ALICE data. A correlation study of the D0 splitting in $v_1$ with the one of muons from Z0 decay can provide a new insight into the determination of the initial magnetic field and its lifetime.\r\nFurthermore, we will show a novel approach that studies the potential impact of a glasma phase on the HQ dynamics and how this can provide a link between pA and AA collisions [4].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] X.Dong and V.

The principal components of anisotropic flow reproduce the trends seen in data, but multiplicity fluctuations show an interesting difference in transverse momentum dependence. We checked this is also the case for other hydro models. To investigate this, we construct an analytical toy model and verify that hydrodynamic simulations agree with its predictions. We find that the discrepancy in the momentum trend is likely  due to the fact that hydrodynamic models typically have transverse momentum  fluctuations that are larger than seen experimentally. \r\n\r\nWe conclude that the n=0 principal components open a new window on initial fluctuations, which can be used to rule out initial condition models.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found in arXiv:1906.03045",

      "Abstract": "The last decade of hadron spectroscopy has unveiled a wealth of states that do not have the properties expected of particles composed of 2 or 3 valence quarks.  Among the most intriguing of these exotics is the X(3872), which various models attempt to describe as a hadronic molecule, a compact tetraquark, an unexpected charmonium state, or their mixtures.  To date, most experimental studies of the X(3872) have focused on its production through B meson decays.  Heavy ion collisions, as well as high multiplicity pp collisions, offer a new window on the properties of this poorly understood hadron.  In these systems, promptly produced X(3872) hadrons can interact with other particles in the nucleus and/or those produced in the collision. The influence of these interactions on the observed X(3872) yields provides information that can help discriminate between the various models of its structure, as well as give insight into the dynamics of the bulk particles produced in these collisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a full range of precision vertexing, tracking, and particle ID capabilities covering 2 to 5 in units of rapidity, the LHCb experiment is especially well suited to measurements of both prompt and non-prompt exotic hadrons.  This talk will present new LHCb measurements X(3872) production in high multiplicity pp collisions and pPb collisions through the decay to $J/\\psi \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A remarkable achievement of the relativistic heavy-ion program is the realization that relativistic fluid dynamics can describe the evolving system of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from its early moments to a time when the growing mean-free-paths drive the system out of equilibrium. The effectiveness of this hydrodynamic description is judged by comparing calculated hadronic observables with experimental measurements. Alternatively, electromagnetic radiation could be considered a more distinguishing signal as it is emitted throughout the evolution of the hadronic system. Considerable work has gone into the calculation of photons [1] and dileptons [2] using modern hydrodynamic approaches, however, the calculation of the electromagnetic emissivity of the pre-hydro stage is currently less advanced. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we use a transport approach that models the time-evolution of gluons and fermions by solving coupled Boltzmann transport equations in the diffusion approximation [3]. The transport equations are solved numerically to study how the system relaxes towards equilibrium. The initial state is a gluon distribution of a form inspired by the colour glass picture, where quarks and anti-quarks are then generated through interactions.  The early stage evolution is modeled by a 1D expansion, during which non-equilibrium parton interactions can also produce real and virtual photons. We show how reliably these Glasma photons can report on the initial momentum anisotropy of the early parton distributions and on the presence or absence of a transient Bose-Einstein condensate of gluons. Additionally, we show that the non-equilibrium contribution can leave an imprint on the low $p_T$ spectrum of the measured photons and estimate the effect of the anisotropy on the spectrum measured at RHIC and at the LHC (i.e. the photon $v_2$ puzzle). This opens the exciting possibility that measurements of the electromagnetic signal can access fine details of the partonic distributions as they appear during the very first instants of heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n[1] Jean-François Paquet, Chun Shen, Gabriel S.

      "Speaker": "Verônica Dexheimer",
      "Institute": "Kent State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Merging binaries of neutron stars are not only strong sources of gravitational waves, but also have the potential of revealing states of matter at densities and temperatures not accessible in laboratories. A crucial and longstanding question in this context is whether quarks are deconfined as a result of the dramatic increase in density and temperature following the merger. We present the first fully general-relativistic simulations of merging neutron stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched off consistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we can determine clearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase transition would leave in the gravitational-wave signal. We show that if after the merger the conditions are met for a phase transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation density, they would lead to a post-merger signal considerably different from the one expected from the inspiral, that can only probe the hadronic part of the equations of state, and to an anticipated collapse of the merged object. We also show that the phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core that, when it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different from the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in heavy-ion collisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and density in the merger remnant to illustrate the properties of the phase transition in a QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\n**Primary reference:** Phys.Rev.Lett. 122 (2019) no.6, 061101.",

      "Abstract": "Based on Refs. [1] and [2], we discuss the new constraints on gluon parton distribution function (PDF) in lead nucleus, derivable with the Hessian PDF reweighting method from the 5.02 TeV p+Pb measurements of CMS dijet [3] and LHCb $D^0$-meson [4] nuclear modification ratios. The impact is found to be significant, placing stringent constraints in the mid- and previously unconstrained small-$x$ regions. The CMS dijet data confirm the existence of gluon anti-shadowing and onsetting of small-$x$ shadowing, as well as reduce the gluon PDF uncertainties in the larger-$x$ region. The gluon constraints from the LHCb $D^0$ data, reaching down to $x \\sim 10^{-5}$ and derived for the first time in a fully NLO perturbative QCD based approach, provide a remarkable reduction in the small-$x$ uncertainties with a strong direct evidence of gluon shadowing. Furthermore, we find a good description of the data even down to zero transverse momentum of the produced $D^0$-meson within a purely DGLAP-based approach without the need of imposing any non-linear effects. Importantly, the constraints obtained from the dijet and $D^0$ data are mutually fully consistent, supporting the universality of nuclear PDFs in hard-scattering processes.\r\n\r\n[1] K.J. Eskola, P.

      "Abstract": "One of the most important objectives of Beam energy scan (BES) program at the Relativistic Heavy ion collider (RHIC) is to search for the critical point in the QCD matter via performing nucleus-nucleus collisions with wide collision energies (7.7 - 200 GeV). At such energies, the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter has sizable net baryon density at the central rapidity region due to baryon stopping power. Therefore, the dissipation of net-baryon current plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense QCD matter produced in RHIC-BES heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic has been very successful in describing the collective behavior of the QGP fireball at zero chemical potential. In order to study the properties of QGP and the dissipative phenomena of net baryon current at a non-zero baryon environment of the BES energies, we extend the CLVisc [1, 2] hydrodynamic model to include the  equation of net baryon charge conservation and Israel-Stewart-like equations about dissipative baryon current with NEOSB [3] equation of state. Assuming instantaneous smooth energy density and net baryon density distribution at the initial proper time, we study the impact of the net-baryon dissipation on particle yields, pT spectra and anisotropic flows in the final state of BES heavy-ion collisions.\r\n[1] Pang, Long-Gang et al.

Recently, the Signed Balance Function (SBF), based on the idea of examining the momentum ordering of charged pairs along the in- and out-of-plane directions, has been proposed as a probe of  Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [1].  In this approach a pair of observables are invoked, they are, the out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of fluctuation of the difference between signed balance functions measured in pairs rest frame ($r_{rest}$), and the ratio ($R_{B} = r_{rest}/r_{lab}$) of it to a similar measurement made in the laboratory frame ($r_{lab}$).

In this talk, we consider parton propagation in cold nuclear matter within the framework of high-twist expansion, which has been shown to be a successful approach to describe the nuclear effects as observed in heavy ion collisions. Through global analysis of world data on transverse momentum broadening in semi-inclusive eA deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan process and heavy quarkonium production in pA collisions, as well as the nuclear modification of the structure functions in DIS related to the coherent dynamical shadowing, we perform the first global extraction of jet transport coefficient for cold nuclear matter. This provide the first evidence that the medium transport property, rather than a constant value as commonly used in heavy ion collisions, depends on the probing scale similar to that in standard parton distribution functions of proton. We expect the extracted scale dependence of qhat for cold nuclear matter can be extended to precisely identify the fundamental property of quark gluon plasma.",

      "Abstract": "We study the heavy-quark momentum diffusion coefficient in far from equilibrium gluon plasma in a self-similar regime using real-time lattice techniques. We use 3 methods for the extraction: an unequal time electric field 2-point correlator integrated over the time difference, hard loop (HTL) perturbation theory and a kinetic theory formula, both using our recently acquired data on the gluon spectral function. The time-evolution of the momentum diffusion coefficient extracted from all three methods is consistent with an approximate $t^\\frac{-1}{2}$ power law. We also study the extracted diffusion coefficient as a function of the upper limit of the time integration. We find that combining HTL expressions with the infrared enhancement of the equal-time correlation function that we have observed improves the agreement with the data for transient time behavior considerably. This is a gauge invariant confirmation of the infrared enhancement previously observed only in gauge fixed correlation functions.",

      "Abstract": "As a conserved quantity in the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions, the total angular momentum consists of two sectors: the orbital angular momentum (OAM) caused by kinetic motion, and the intrinsic spin angular momentum of quarks and gluons. In a heavy-ion collision event, the system starts with finite OAM but un-polarized spin density (unless prepared specifically). Microscopic scattering processes allow a coupling between these two components. Therefore, spin polarization can eventually develop that may have a non-trivial influence on the QGP evolution. In the current hydrodynamic frameworks, the stress tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ is assumed to be symmetric, hence OAM and spin are conserved independently, and the spin effect is mostly neglected. A hydrodynamic theory, with the aforementioned spin polarization effect properly taken into account, is required, especially for quantitative studies of the polarization rate of observed hadrons, e.g. $\\Lambda$-hyperon. The latter has been observed in RHIC experiment, serving as an evidence of the most vortical fluid in the universe.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we start with **chiral kinetic theory** and construct the **spin hydrodynamic framework** for a chiral spinor system. We obtain the equations of motion of **second-order dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics with non-trivial spin polarization density**. In a chiral spinor system, the spin alignment effect could be treated in the same framework as for Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE). However, the fluid vorticity induces not only the CVE current but also asymmetric stress tensor as well as spin polarization of final state hadrons, all of which emerge as quantum corrections. The consequences for current measurements related to angular momentum observables will be discussed.",

We confirm the previously\r\nreported effect of the electromagnetically induced currents, that is a charge-odd directed flow\r\n$\\Delta v_1$ that is odd in rapidity, noting that it is induced by magnetic fields (a la Faraday and Lorentz)\r\nand by electric fields (the Coulomb field from the charged spectators). In addition, we find a\r\ncharge-odd $\\Delta v_3$ that is also odd in rapidity and that has a similar physical origin. We furthermore\r\nshow that the electric field produced by the net charge density of the plasma drives rapidity-even\r\ncharge-dependent contributions to the radial flow $\\langle p_T \\rangle$ and the elliptic flow $\\Delta v_2$. Although their\r\nmagnitudes are comparable to the charge-odd $\\Delta v_1$ and $\\Delta v_3$, they have a different physical origin, namely the Coulomb forces within the plasma.

      "Speaker": "Sigtryggur Hauksson",
      "Institute": "McGill University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A primary goal in heavy-ion collisions is to learn about non-equilibrium properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the size of its thermalization timescale and the values of its transport coefficients. Hard experimental probes like jets and heavy quarks, as well as photons [1], give direct access to these non-equilibrium properties. However, theoretical challenges have hindered calculating their dynamics in a non-equilibrium QGP. Some of these challenges stem from gauge field instabilities that arise in non-equilibrium, weakly-coupled plasma, and lead to exponentially growing gauge fields [2]. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we show how to handle the gauge field instabilities consistently. We first derive the time evolution of gluon correlators analytically. Building on the formalism elaborated in [1] then allows for a microscopic calculation of jet-medium interaction in a non-thermal QGP. Specifically, we evaluate how jets radiate gluons when they traverse a non-equilibrium medium and show that the medium effects can be factorized into transverse kicks on the jet [3] and a new Schwinger-like effect in the exponentially growing gauge fields. We solve the resulting equations numerically and comment on phenomenological implications for jets and photons. Our calculations not only apply to jets, but also to the kinetic theory of quarks and gluons. We compare our results to commonly used simplifications of the collision kernel in numerical kinetic theory calculations. Finally, we discuss how to explore the effect of non-equilibrium physics on other probes of the QGP, such as the heavy-quark potential. \r\n\r\n[1] S. Hauksson et al., Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "The production of light neutral mesons in AA collisions probes the physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is formed in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. More specifically, the centrality dependent neutral meson production in AA collisions compared to its production in minimum-bias pp collisions, known as nuclear modification factor, provides information on the energy loss of partons traversing the QGP. The measurement allows to test with high precision the predictions of theoretical model calculations. In addition, the decay of the $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ mesons are the dominant backgrounds for all direct photon measurements. Therefore, pushing the limits of the precision of neutral meson production is key to learning about the temperature and space-time evolution of the QGP.\r\n\r\nIn the ALICE experiment neutral mesons can be detected via their decay to two photons. The latter can be reconstructed using the two calorimeters EMCal and PHOS or via conversions in the detector material. Combining the excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low $p_{T}$ and the high reconstruction efficiency and triggering capability of calorimeters at high $p_{T}$, we are able to measure the light neutral mesons over a wide kinematic range.\r\n\r\nCombining state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques with the high statistics delivered by the LHC in Run 2 gives us the opportunity to enhance the precision of our measurements. In this talk, new run 2 results for neutral meson production in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at LHC energies, as measured with the ALICE experiment, will be presented and contrasted with theoretical predictions.",

      "Abstract": "A wide variety of recent measurements from small systems indicate that there are collective flow phenomena in these systems, which are well described by hydrodynamics. However, it is widely understood that all flow measurements are affected by non-flow correlations. In order to disentangle the genuine hydrodynamical flow from other contributions, we have systematically studied the $v_2$ as a function of $p_T$ and $\\eta$ in p+Au and d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with a mixture of different detector combinations and by comparing several non-flow subtraction methods. We have also measured 4-particle cumulants in p+Au and d+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with subevents, which kinematically suppress non-flow via removal of short-range correlations. As found in heavy ion collisions, the quark mass dependence of the flow will further provide an evidence of collective effects. PHENIX has measured $v_2$ vs $p_T$ of muons at forward rapidity originating from heavy quark decays in d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We will show these results and discuss implications for the underlying mechanism that drives both light and heavy quark collectivity.",

Uncertainties originating from modeling the late hadronic rescattering stage of the collisions are also investigated by preliminary comparisons of SMASH and UrQMD as afterburners. The newly obtained Bayesian constraints are validated by comparisons with additional measurements, including high-statistics observables that are currently too challenging to include in Bayesian calibrations.",

      "Abstract": "High energy jets, evolving from a single parton, produced with transverse momentum up to a TeV, have a variety of scale dependent interactions with the QGP. The mass of heavy-quarks introduce another scale within this evolution. Modeling both the heavy quark shower and the fluid dynamical medium event by event, we demonstrate that in the high virtuality portion of a jet, where the dead-cone effect can be ignored, light and heavy-flavor evolution are indeed similar. However, in the later lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of the parton, heavy quarks radiate differently. Recently, it has been suggested that longitudinal drag and diffusion can stimulate radiation from heavy-quarks. The effect of this new channel is shown to partially compensate for the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. All these factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy flavors (and heavy-flavor tagged jets).\r\n\r\nWe present an extensive, comparative study that explores the importance of differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms with a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a multi-stage calculation within the JETSCAPE Framework [2]. The highly virtual and very energetic portion of the shower inside the QGP is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models the energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quark’s showering inside with the QGP. The shower transitions from one stage to the other at a parton-by-parton level depending on the energy and virtuality of the parton, and the local density. The boundary between these stages can be extracted from a comparison with data. This allows us to explore the effect and interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium. Energy momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, is carried out using a weak coupling recoil approach.",

      "Speaker": "Wen-Jing Xing",
      "Institute": "Central China Normal University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion experiments have observed similar quenching effects for (prompt) $D$ mesons compared to charged hadrons for transverse momenta larger than 6-8 GeV, which remains a mystery since heavy quarks typically lose less energies in quark-gluon plasma than light quarks and gluons. Recent measurements of the nuclear modification factors of $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons by the CMS Collaboration provide a unique opportunity to study the flavor hierarchy of jet quenching. Using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics simulation, we study the energy loss and nuclear modification for heavy and light flavor jets in high-energy nuclear collisions. By consistently taking into account both quark and gluon contributions to light and heavy flavor hadron productions within a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD framework, we obtain, for the first time, a satisfactory description of the experimental data on the nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons, $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons simultaneously over a wide range of transverse momenta (8-300 GeV). This presents a solid solution to the flavor puzzle of jet quenching and constitutes a significant step towards the precision study of jet-medium interaction. Our study predicts that at transverse momenta larger than 30-40 GeV, $B$ mesons also exhibit similar suppression effects to charged hadrons and $D$ mesons, which may be tested by future measurements.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n[1] Wen-Jing Xing, Shanshan Cao, Guang-You Qin, and Hongxi Xing, arXiv:1906.00413",

      "Speaker": "Xiaojun Yao",
      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma. The initial insight was that due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark-antiquark pair is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they “melt”. In addition to the screening of the color attraction, quarkonium dissociates when enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process. The inverse process of dissociation, recombination, can also happen inside the medium when the plasma temperature allows quarkonium formation and is as crucial as dissociation. To explain experimental results on quarkonium production, we have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. One traditional approach is to use a transport equation through which the phase space distribution of quarkonium is evolved. In recent years, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. It is learnt that dissociation can be understood as a decoherence of the wavefunction of the heavy quark-antiquark pair. Recombination is automatically included in this framework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present a connection between the open quantum system formalism and the transport equation. I will discuss new insights about the quarkonium dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of quantum information. I will show that under the weak coupling and Markovian approximations, the evolution equation of the open system, the Lindblad equation, turns to a Boltzmann transport equation after a Wigner transform is applied to the system density matrix. I will demonstrate how the separation of physical scales justifies the approximations, by using effective field theory of QCD. Finally, by coupling the transport equations of quarkonia and open heavy flavors, I will study how the system of open and hidden heavy flavors reaches thermal equilibrium inside a quark-gluon plasma box. Phenomenological results on the nuclear modification factor and the azimuthal angular anisotropy of quarkonium, based on the coupled transport equations will also be presented.",

      "Speaker": "Weiyao Ke",
      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The heavy-flavor transport coefficients contain important information on the strong interaction at finite temperatures. Extraction of these numbers from experimental data requires dynamical modeling of heavy-flavor transport that is coupled to a realistic medium evolution. Furthermore, meaningful extractions necessitate both a faithful implementation of the physical inputs to be tested and the quantification of model uncertainty. For these purposes, we have developed a partonic transport model LIDO. It has improved treatment of in-medium parton bremsstrahlung, which has been calibrated to analytical theoretical baselines in a simple medium to reduce modeling uncertainty. Regarding the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium, few-body perturbative scatterings are applied to large-momentum transfer (Q) processes, while a diffusion equation models the dynamics of small-Q processes. Such a separation restricts the explicit use of medium quasi-particles to large-Q processes only. Another advantage is that deviations from the leading-order probe-medium coupling can be parameterized as an additional contribution to the diffusion coefficient.\r\n\r\nThe heavy quark transport coefficients are then extracted with uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian analysis including both RHIC and LHC data. The results are found to be consistent with earlier extractions of the light-quark transport coefficients at high momentum and are comparable to lattice calculations of the heavy-flavor diffusion coefficient in the static limit at low momentum.",

      "Speaker": "Daniel Pablos",
      "Institute": "McGill",
      "Country": "McGill",
      "Abstract": "In this work we present an analysis of the role that the quark-gluon plasma resolution length, the minimal distance by which two nearby colored charges in a jet must be separated such that they engage with the plasma independently, plays in the understanding of modifications of jet substructure modification due to interaction with QGP. The shorter the resolution length of QGP is the better the resolving power of this medium. We identify a set of observables that are very sensitive to whether jets are quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the medium has the ability to resolve the internal structure of the jet instead. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose because it is very sensitive to effects of the particles coming from medium response, groomed observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings, the momentum sharing fraction, or the groomed mass are particularly well suited to discriminate the degree to which the medium resolves substructure within the jet. In order to find the optimal grooming configuration, we explore different cuts on the Lund plane that allow for a clear identification of the regions of phase space that enhance the difference in jet substructure between vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present data seems to disfavor an “infinite resolution length”, which is to say it disfavors the hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it were a single energetic colored object.  Our analysis indicates that as the precision of experimental measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over uncertainties in their calculation improves, it will become possible to use comparisons like this to constrain the value of the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma as well as to see how the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it.",

In heavy-ion collisions, the measurement of beauty hadron production is a unique tool to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.

      "Institute": "Wayne State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Parton energy loss has been established as an essential signature of the QGP in heavy ion collisions since the earliest measurements at RHIC indicating suppression of hadron spectra at high $p_{T}$ and coincidence yields. Understanding this phenomenon of jet quenching is a requirement for extracting the microscopic properties of the QGP via jet-tomography. STAR has recently introduced a technique called Jet Geometry Engineering (JGE) wherein we enforce particular selection criteria imposed on the jet collection, such as recoiling off a high $p_{T}$ hadron trigger along with an additional transverse momentum threshold for jet finding in events with back-to-back di-jets. With JGE, we are able to control the extent of energy loss ranging from quenched/imbalanced to recovered/balanced recoil jets. Since jet quenching is also expected to be dependent on the resolution/transverse-length scales with which the jet probes the medium, it is necessary to perform differential measurements with a handle on both momentum and angular scales. With the large 2014 Au+Au data sample at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV we are able to quantitatively constrain parton energy loss via JGE and measure it differentially as a function of both the jet $p_{T}$ and opening angle between the two leading sub-jets ($\\theta_{sj}$). We probe the medium response to jets at varying resolution scales by measuring the recoil jet yield and the di-jet asymmetry and search for significant differences between wide and narrow $\\theta_{sj}$ jets. These double differential measurements in $p_{T}$ and angle, along with JGE, enable us to probe the medium and its coherent or decoherent interaction with a hard scattered parton leading to partonic energy loss.",

Produced in hard scattering processes on a \r\ntimescale shorter than the QGP formation time, they experience the whole evolution \r\nof the medium interacting with its constituents.

In the pp system, \r\nthe measurement of $\\Lambda_c$ production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity \r\nwill be discussed. In the Pb-Pb system, the measurement of the $\\Lambda_c$ production, n\r\nuclear modification factor and the $\\Lambda_c/\\rm D^0$ ratio in central and \r\nsemi-central events in a large transverse-momentum interval \r\n($2 \\le p_{\\rm T} \\le 24$ GeV/$c$) will be discussed together with the comparison \r\nwith similar results in smaller collision systems.

This \r\ntechnique provides precise, data-driven suppression of the large uncorrelated background in such measurements. It uniquely enables the exploration of medium-induced modification of jet production and acoplanarity over wide phase space, including low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ for large jet resolution parameter $R$. This talk will report measurements of medium-induced jet energy redistribution through the comparison of trigger-normalized recoil jet yields \r\nin different centrality intervals and in pp reference collisions, and of jets with different $R$. Medium-induced jet deflection may also occur, with multiple soft scatterings broadening \r\nthe overall azimuthal correlation, and possible Moliere scatterings off quasi-particles in the medium broadening the tail of the correlation with respect to pp collisions. A search \r\nfor these phenemona in Run-1 data using hadron-jet acoplanarity showed no evidence of \r\nlarge-angle jet broadening with respect to vacuum expectation within experimental \r\nuncertainties. However, recent theoretical work has highlighted that low hadron trigger $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and low recoiling jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$ configurations show more sensitivity to in-medium modifications to the acoplanarity. We present a new measurement of hadron-jet acoplanarity using high-statistics Run-2 data, with emphasis on the region of low recoil jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$.\r\n\r\nTo study the jet profile, jet-hadron correlations will also be discussed. Jet-hadron correlations are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using ALICE data. The radial distribution of charged-hadrons is studied with respect to the jet axis. The associated charged hadron yields and peak widths are extracted from two-dimensional angular correlations as a function of associated hadron transverse momentum and event plane orientation and compared in different centrality intervals. The measurements are also compared to model predictions.",

      "Abstract": "The thermalized QCD matter formed in heavy-ion collisions is tilted in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity, while the production proﬁle of partons from hard scatterings is symmetric in rapidity [1]. This leads to a rapidity-odd directed ﬂow (v1) for high-pT hadrons and can provide valuable constraints on the initial longitudinal distribution of the ﬁreball as well as the path length-dependent energy loss of partons. Hydrodynamic models suggest that the double sign change of v1 slope (dv1/dy) at midrapidity for net baryon as a function of beam energy is a signature of the ﬁrst-order phase transition [2]. The light nuclei and strange hadrons might be more sensitive to the early EoS because of their heavy masses and smaller hadronic interaction cross section, respectively. Due to the diﬀerent sensitivity of strange particles to hadronic phases, the mass ordering of elliptic ﬂow (v2) is expected to be violated between proton and φ meson in the low-pT range (pT <1.5 GeV/c) [3].\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the new precise v1 measurement of π, K, p and φ in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 27, 54.4 GeV and deuteron at sNN = 7.7 to 39 GeV. The ﬁrst measurement of pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the v1 of high-pT (>5 GeV/c) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 54.4 and 200 GeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "We propose a new scenario characterizing the transition of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions from a highly non-equilibrium state at early times toward a fluid described by hydrodynamics at late times. In this scenario, the bulk evolution is governed by a set of slow modes, after an emergent time scale τ_{Redu} when the number of modes that govern the bulk evolution of the system is reduced. These slow modes are \"pre-hydrodynamic\" in the sense that they are initially distinct from, but evolve continuously into, hydrodynamic modes in hydrodynamic limit. This picture is analogous to the evolution of a quantum mechanical system that is governed by the instantaneous ground states under adiabatic evolution, and will be referred to as \"adiabatic hydrodynamization\". We shall illustrate adiabatic hydrodynamization using a kinetic description of weakly-coupled Bjorken expanding plasma. We first show the emergence of τRedu due to the longitudinal expansion. We explicitly identify the pre-hydrodynamic modes for a class of collision integrals and find that they represent the angular distribution (in momentum space) of those gluons that carry most of the energy. We use the relaxation time approximation for the collision integral to show quantitatively that the full kinetic theory evolution is indeed dominated by pre-hydrodynamic modes. We elaborate on the criterion for the dominance of pre-hydrodynamic modes and argue that the rapidly-expanding QGP could meet this criterion. Based on this discussion, we speculate that adiabatic hydrodynamization may describe the pre-equilibrium behavior of the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions.",

Additionally, semi-leptonic c-hadron decays can provide a complimentary measurement of charm hadron directed ﬂow (v1).\r\nIn this talk we will present the analyses of single electrons from semi-leptonic b- and c- hadron decays at mid-rapidity in sNN = 200, 54.4, and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are unique tools to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to the large masses, heavy quarks \r\nare produced in hard scattering processes on timescales shorter than the QGP formation time, thus they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents.\r\n\r\nThe hot QCD matter is produced within an unprecedented strong magnetic field, which properties and effects can be probed by charm quarks via investigating the charm-particle \r\ndirected flow $v_{1}$, because the charm quark formation time scale is comparable to the time scale when the magnetic field attains its maximum value. The charm interaction with the medium constituents and its degree of thermalisation can be investigated via the measurement of the second coefficient of the D-meson azimuthal anisotropy, the elliptic flow $v_{2}$, that allows one to study whether low-momentum charm quarks participate in the collective expansion of the system. \r\nFurthermore, the role of the recombination mechanism \r\ncan be studied for charm via the comparison of non-strange D meson $v_{\\rm 2}$ with the $\\rm D_s$ meson $v_{\\rm 2}$. The dynamics of heavy quarks in the QGP can be further \r\ninvestigated through the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) analysis. Measuring the D-meson $v_{2}$ in classes of events defined on the basis of the average flow in a given centrality class allows to evaluate the correlation between the elliptic flow of soft hadrons and D mesons.\r\n\r\nThe interest in heavy-flavour measurements in small systems, like p-Pb and pp, have been for a long time limited to the possibility of providing tests of perturbative QCD, measurements of cold-matter effects in the nuclear medium, and the baseline for observations of hot-medium effects in heavy-ion collisions. However, such measurements have recently gained additional interest due to the possibility of observing final-state like effects typically attributed, in Pb-Pb collisions, to the presence of QGP. The orgin of such effects \r\nis still debated. In this contribution, the measurement of the ${\\rm D}^{0}$ $v_{1}$ together with strange and non-strange D meson $v_{2}$ and the $v_{2}$ ESE analysis in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV will be presented.

We introduce a concept of confluent connection which takes into account the relativity of \"equal time\" in the definition of the equal-time correlator of fluctuation. We also describe the procedure of renormalization of short-distance singularities which eliminates cutoff dependence, allowing efficient numerical implementation of these equations.",

      "Abstract": "We present a new method to calculate the final decay spectrum of direct resonance decays directly from hydrodynamic fields on a freeze-out surface. The method is based on identifying components of the final particle spectrum that transform in an irreducible way under rotations in the fluid-restframe. Corresponding  distribution functions can be pre-computed including all resonance decays. Just a few of easily tabulated scalar functions then determine the Lorentz invariant decay spectrum from each space-time point, and simple integrals of these scalar functions over the freeze-out surface determine the final decay products. This by-passes numerically costly event-by-event calculations of the intermediate  resonances. The method is of considerable practical use for making realistic data to model comparisons of the identified particle yields and flow harmonics, and for studying the viscous corrections to the freeze-out distribution function.\r\n\r\nReference: A.

      "Abstract": "Correlated dielectron pairs are a very promising probe to study the quark-gluon plasma, a deconfined state of quarks and gluons predicted by lattice quantum chromodynamics calculations in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Electrons reach the detector without significant final state interactions. In addition, the low-mass dielectron spectrum comes from various sources, i.e. Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, as well as the radiation from the thermalised system, which are produced at all stages of the collision.  Therefore, dielectron pairs can be used to study the space-time evolution of the system.\r\n\r\nWhile pp collisions provide an important baseline measurement in vacuum for heavy-ion studies, p-Pb collisions can be used to disentangle cold from hot nuclear matter effects. Moreover, recent studies in small colliding systems (pp and p-Pb) showed intriguing collective behaviours similar to observations previously done in heavy-ion collisions. They require further investigations in particular as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity. Searching for the thermal signatures through dielectrons is also important in small systems to disentangle the initial and final state effects.\r\n\r\nIn this poster the latest status of the dielectron analysis with ALICE in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Dielectron production is suggested as an excellent probe of the hot, dense and strongly interacting medium (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to their minimal interactions with the medium and the final state hadrons. Dielectrons can be produced at different evolution stages of the collision system. Different invariant mass ranges are sensitive to different physics processes. In the low mass region ($M_{ee}$<$M_{\\phi}$), dielectron production is sensitive to the in-medium modifications of vector mesons which could provide an access to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region ($M_{\\phi}$<$M_{ee}$<$M_{J/\\psi}$), the dielectron production from the medium thermal radiation is sensitive to the medium temperature, thus can serve as a thermometer of the medium. However, the dominant source in this mass region, semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons, makes the extraction of the thermal radiation contribution very challenging.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present the results from the $1.5$ B minimum-bias events taken in 2018 Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}=$ 27 GeV. This data sample is more than 10 times larger than that from the STAR Beam Energy Scan phase I program and allows a much more precise measurement of the in-medium modification of $\\rho$ mesons. The much lower open charm production rate at this energy compared to RHIC top energies greatly reduces their contributions to the dielectron spectrum at the intermediate mass region, providing a better opportunity to extract the medium temperature. The results will be compared to the measurements from other collision energies and the theoretical model calculations.",

      "Abstract": "Recent results at LHC and RHIC involving small collision systems have found evidence of collective flow behavior consistent with relativistic hydrodynamic expectations, which suggests the formation of tiny specks of quark-gluon plasma in these reactions. However, questions still remain about the nature of the matter formed in these minute systems. One of the main signatures of the quark-gluon plasma, i.e. the suppression of hard probes, has not yet been seen in small systems data. In fact, current experimental measurements indicate no suppression (e.g. $R_{\\rm pPb} \\sim 1$) in small systems. On the other hand, a surprisingly large D meson flow (though still suppressed compared to lighter hadrons) was measured in pPb collisions by the CMS collaboration. In order to reconcile these results we use Trento+v-USPhydro+DAB-MOD [1] to make predictions and propose a system size scan at the LHC involving $^{208}$PbPb, $^{129}$XeXe, $^{40}$ArAr, and $^{16}$OO collisions [2,3]. We find that the nuclear modification factor approaches unity as the system size is decreased, but nonetheless, in the 0--10% most central collisions $v_2\\{2\\}$ is roughly equivalent regardless of system size. Additionally we find that unlike in PbPb collisions the $v_3\\{2\\}$ gets a centrality dependence in smaller systems. These results arise from a rather non-trivial interplay between the shrinking path length in small systems and the enhancement of eccentricities in small systems at high multiplicity. Finally we also find a surprising sensitivity of D mesons $ v_2\\{2\\}$ in 0--10% at $p_T =$ 2--5 GeV to the slight deformation of $^{129}$Xe recently found at LHC.\r\n\r\n[1] R. Katz, C. Prado, J.

      "Abstract": "The quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nuclear collisions is known to behave like a perfect fluid. In hydrodynamic simulations at RHIC and the LHC energies, space-time evolution of the QGP is usually described in expanding coordinates. On the other hand, in SPS and RHIC-BES energies, Cartesian coordinates are used for effective description of hydrodynamic expansion. However, the difference of the coordinates  makes it difficult to describe the reactions in broad range of collision energy in a unified manner.\r\nIn this study, we propose to use the Milne coordinates even at lower collision energies by introducing a dynamic initialization model [1] towards unified description of the reactions at various collision energies. We first generate the initially produced particles by using an event generator, JAM [2]. Instead of putting initial conditions at fixed (proper-)time, fluids are gradually created during the colliding nuclei overlap with each other: We put energy, momentum, and baryon number of the particles into fluids through source terms in hydrodynamic equations at which these are produced. By solving hydrodynamic equations in one-dimensionally expanding coordinates, we describe space-time evolution of thermodynamic variables at RHIC-BES energies. By employing the first-order phase transition model as an equation of state, we describe the trajectories of the system in the energy density-baryon density plane and show the maximum baryon density gradually decreases with increasing collision energy.\r\n\r\n[1] M.

The QCD predicts that partons lose energy via collisions with the plasma constituents and via gluon radiation, and the magnitude of the energy loss depends on the mass and the color charge of the parton. In Pb--Pb collisions, a strong suppression of heavy-flavour yields has been observed at high $p_{T}$ with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions which is attributed to energy loss of heavy quarks in the QCD medium. Further information about the heavy-quark energy loss mechanism can be obtained by measuring the production of jets containing open charm and beauty particles.\r\n\r\nRecently, a positive elliptic flow of open heavy-flavour particles has been observed in pA collisions and the possible formation of the QGP is under scrutiny.\r\nIn this poster, we show the measurements of jets with electrons from open heavy-flavour hadron decays in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=$5.02 TeV.\r\nJet measurements are performed with different resolution parameters ($R=$0.2, 0.3 and 0.4).

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are an effective tool to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Due to their large mass, they are produced during the early stages of the collisions in hard-scattering processes, on a time interval shorter than the QGP formation time. Thus, they experience the whole evolution of the system. The baryon-to-meson ratio is sensitive to the hadronisation mechanism. In particular, it is expected to be enhanced with respect to the proton-proton baseline if charm quarks hadronise via recombination with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. Measurements of charm-baryon production in small systems (pp and p--Pb collisions) provide the reference necessary for interpreting results in Pb--Pb collisions. In addition, in pp collisions, they allow to study the hadronisation of charm quarks, and allow testing QCD calculations. Measurements in p--Pb collisions are fundamental to disentangle cold nuclear matter effects from those deriving from the presence of the QGP.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the latest ALICE measurements on the $\\Lambda_c$ baryon production and the $\\Lambda_c / \\rm D^0$ ratio in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "The positive elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of open heavy-flavour particles observed in semi-central Pb--Pb collisions at LHC energies indicates that heavy quarks suffered strong interactions in the deconfined QCD medium and participated in the collective motion of the medium. Recent observations in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions show remarkable similarities with Pb-Pb collisions and suggest the presence of collectivity, whose origin is still debated.\r\nIn this contribution, the elliptic flow of open heavy-flavour hadron decay muons at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4$) in p--Pb collisions at $8.16$ TeV with the ALICE detector will be presented. The results are obtained using Q-cumulants and two-particle correlation methods. The measurements will set constraints on the initial-state fluctuations on heavy-quark production. Moreover, the results will be compared with measurements obtained in p-Pb collisions at $5.02$ TeV and with those performed at mid-rapidity for electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays. Comparisons with model predictions will be presented as well.",

As the chemical freeze-out temperature  at LHC is found to be close to the pseudo-critical temperature for the QCD chiral transition these cumulants potentially probe remnants of critical behavior in the crossover region. Using results from calculations with smaller than physical quark masses we estimate the singular part contributing to these second and fourth order cumulants. Furthermore, we will show comparisons of our results with  hadron resonance gas (HRG) model calculations and argue that particularly in the electric charge sector there is evidence for strong modifications of the resonance spectrum in the transition region.\r\nWe also will use the updated results of HotQCD on higher order cumulants to constrain the radius of convergence of Taylor series as estimator for the location of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram.",

The measurement of thermal dileptons in the intermediate mass range and at different energies of the CBM energy range would provide a better understanding of the excitation function and therefore could give insights about potential phase transitions in CBM’s region of the QCD phase diagram.

The semi-inclusive recoil jet measurement provides precise, data-driven suppression of the large uncorrelated background and uniquely enables the exploration of medium-induced modification of jet production over wide phase space, including low $p_{\\rm T}$ for large jet resolution parameter $R$. Such measurement provides a good test for pQCD calculations, and sets as a reference for jet quenching study in nucleus-nucleus collisions.",

      "Institute": "Wayne State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Jet modification is now understood to be a multistage effect: a parton produced in a high virtuality initial state, radiates a multitude of partons, giving way to a variety of lower virtuality stages. In the lower virtuality stage, higher energy partons are weakly coupled with the medium and continue to scatter and radiate whereas lower energy partons are strongly coupled with the medium and will eventually thermalize. Hadrons produced in the fragmentation from these partons are clustered within jets. Modeling of these multistage effects involves several parameters: The coupling in the medium, the scales where the shower transitions from one stage to the next, and the parameters of hadronization. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe consider a set of these parameters which have been tuned to successfully describe a variety of jet based data, such as the nuclear modification factors of leading hadrons and jets, the intra-jet fragmentation function and the jet shape, and subject this model to a parameter free validation by calculating the photon production from these in-medium jets. Quarks inside jets can radiate photons along with gluons. Photons are also produced in the hard scattering, via the quark-gluon Compton scattering process. In this work, we study the correlation of photons with jets in p-p and A-A collisions. Photon radiation from the hard scattering, from both the large and small virtuality phases, along with radiation from a PYTHIA based hadronization model are included in this analysis. We focus on the photon jet transverse momentum and angular balance. The calculations of photon production from each stage are calculated in close analogy to gluon radiation, with the exact same approximations, i.e., no new parameters are introduced or tuned either in the p-p or A-A collisions. The level of agreement with experimental data provides an independent verification of the multi-stage theory of jet modification.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Current measurements of the modification of jets in the quark–gluon plasma necessarily average over the quark–gluon composition of the jets in the sample. This introduces substantial complications in measuring differences of energy loss and modification between quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets. Additionally, even in the absence of jet modification, a modified quark–gluon fraction of jets in heavy-ion collisions could give rise to a substantial apparent modification arising just from differences between the production properties of quark- and gluon-initiated jets. We demonstrate a fully data-driven method for separating contributions to jet observables coming from quark- and gluon-initiated jets using a statistical technique called topic modeling. Assuming that jet observable distributions are a mixture of underlying quark and gluon distributions enables us to extract those distributions and their relative fractions from dijet and photon+jet samples. As a proof of concept, we extract the fractions of quark- and gluon-initiated jets as a function of $p_T$ and separately compute $R_{A A}$ for quark and gluon jets. We furthermore use this method to distinguish between modification of an observable that arises from modification of the quark–gluon fraction versus modification of that observable individually for either quark or gluon jets. We show that this distinction is of central importance to even qualitative interpretations of jet modification observables in heavy-ion collisions.",

This contributed artificial slopes to the previous $\\Delta v_{n} (A_{\\rm ch})$ measurements. After eliminating this non-flow artifact, the $\\Delta v_{2}(A_{\\rm ch})$ and $\\Delta v_{3}(A_{\\rm ch})$ slopes, normalized by the respective $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ magnitudes, are consistent with each other within errors.

      "Abstract": "First, we recall that close to the chiral limit, and below the critical temperature, the long wavelength effective theory of QCD is not ordinary hydrodynamics, but SU(2)xSU(2) superfluid hydrodynamics (Son 2000). In this theory the usual hydrodynamic variables such as energy are momentum are augmented by long wavelength pions.  When the pion is massive, the effective theory reduces to normal hydrodynamics at large distances, but is described by the superfluid theory at short distances. Using techniques developed by Akamatsu et al (Akamatsu 2017), we integrate out the superfluid modes to determine how the transport coefficients of QCD such as the bulk viscosity depend on the pion mass below the critical temperature. These expressions are given by the dissipative parameters  in the superfluid theory.

      "Abstract": "The production of quarkonia in hadron-hadron collisions occurs at the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of QCD, resulting in a rich phenomenology that remains far from being fully understood. $J/\\psi$ hadronization dynamics can be studied by measuring the $p_{T}$ fraction, $z \\equiv p_{T,J/\\psi} / p_{T,jet}$, carried by the $J/\\psi$ meson detected inside a jet. The distribution of this quantity, also called fragmentation function, gives us an opportunity to investigate the dominant subprocesses responsible for $J/\\psi$ production. In addition, the production of non-prompt $J/\\psi$, coming from b hadron decays, inside a jet should be sensitive to the fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into b hadrons. The fragmentation of high $p_{T}$ jets containing a $J/\\psi$ meson was measured in pp collisions by LHCb and CMS Collaborations, respectively. The results surprisingly show that non-prompt $J/\\psi$ in jets are well described by models, but that prompt $J/\\psi$ tend to be produced at much lower $z$ than the model predicted.\n\nIn this contribution, we present the measurements of the fragmentation of jets into $J/\\psi$ in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the data collected by ALICE，with the $J/\\psi$ being measured at mid-rapidity in the di-electron decay channel by the central barrel detectors.

      "Abstract": "In this contribution we investigate the properties of the complete Israel-Stewart equations when perturbed around a global equilibrium state. Such analyses have been previously performed including only the effects of the shear-stress tensor and/or bulk viscous pressure and only using the simplified Israel-Stewart equations (which do not include any second order terms, except the one related to the time derivative of the dissipative current). In our studies, we include for the first time the effects of heat flow and study the consequences of the (linear) second order terms that couple the shear stress tensor to the heat flow 4-current. We show that such terms can affect the stability of the theory in the linear regime and find certain bounds that the transport coefficients associated with such terms have to satisfy. Consequences to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem will also be discussed.",

      "Speaker": "Seyed Farid Taghavi",
      "Institute": "Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Over the past years, the observed features in the collisions of small systems which resemble collective flow patterns, are under intense debates. A relevant question is to what extent these observations are related to the real collective evolution of the medium, and if this is the case, the related question is what is the smallest system size which can still accommodate collective behaviour. The present talk attempts to shed new light on these non-trivial questions. Specifically, we address the following problem: what is the smallest system consistent with hydrodynamic equations and with hydrodynamization time $\\tau_\\text{hyd} \\, T \\sim 1$? In order to solve, we employ the Gubser solution as a toy model to perceive the consistency between the hydrodynamization time and the system size. We show that, up to a factor of the order of unity, the rms radius of the system, $\\sigma_\\text{rms}$, cannot be smaller than the inverse of the square root of the total energy in the transverse plane, $\\epsilon_\\text{tot}^{1/2}$. According to our simple model, we find that hydrodynamic is applicable for the core of the systems with size $\\sigma_\\text{rms}\\sim 0.5\\;$ fm corresponds to the  multiplicity around two particles per unit  rapidity. However, a large fraction of particles are emitted from the corona part (hadron gas at the tail of the fireball) for such system. On the other hand, for a system with the same size, the events with multiplicity per unit rapidity above 20 are dominated with particles from the core with strong flow signal. Using perturbation on top of Gubser flow, we  discuss about the hydrodynamic response of an elliptic initial energy density in small systems.",

The low mass region below 2 GeV escapes upper limits set from experiments which have searched for the uuddss dibaryon and did not find it [1].\r\n\r\nDepending on its mass, such state may be absolutely stable or almost stable with decay rate of the order of the lifetime of the Universe therefore making it a possible DarK Matter candidate [1].\r\n\r\nEven though not everyone agrees [2] its possible cosmological implications as DM candidate cannot be excluded and it has been recently searched in the BaBar experiment [3[. \r\n\r\nIts production in heavy ion collisions is expected to have a larger rate as compared to its production via the decay $\\Upsilon \\rightarrow S \\overline{\\Lambda} \\overline{\\Lambda}  $ which is assumed in [3], due to new production modes that open up in heavy ion collisions at high energies namely through parton coalescence and/or thermal production, and the avoidance of requiring a low multiplicity exclusive final state.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe use a model which has very successfully described hadron and nuclei production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC [4], in order to estimate the thermal production rate of Sexaquarks with characteristics such as discussed previously rendering them DM candidates. The model has been extended by new calculations [5] allowing solid estimates for 6 quark states. \r\n\r\nWe show first results on a study of the variation of the Sexaquark production rates with mass, radius and temperature and chemical potentials assumed and their ratio to hadrons and nuclei and discuss the \r\n\r\ninterdependences and their consequences.\r\n\r\nThese estimates are important for future experimental searches and enrich theoretical estimates in the multiquark sector.\r\n\r\n[1] G.

      "Abstract": "Near the QCD critical point (CP), critically slow processes can invalidate the conventional (dissipative) hydrodynamic description, which simply integrates out all non-hydrodynamic modes. We explore the critical dynamics near the QCD CP with the novel Hydro+ framework [1] which extends the conventional hydrodynamic description by coupling it to additional explicitly evolving slow modes. Their slow relaxation is controlled by the correlation length in the critical region, which is independent from the density inhomogeneities of the QCD matter that control the evolution of the hydrodynamic quantities. In this presentation we study the evolution of a single critical slow mode on top of a simplified matter background with non-zero net baryon density undergoing Gubser flow [2], as a function of the slow mode's wave number and the correlation length. We also discuss how the non-equilibrium slow mode affects the bulk properties of the matter, such as the pressure and entropy density. We find that over a wide range of wave numbers the non-equilibrium effects of the slow mode are dominatingly driven by the fluid expansion rather than by critical slowing-down. Last but not least we explore the critical fluctuation dynamics in systems of various sizes and at different collision energies. As one of the first studies based on Hydro+, this work provides guidance to future more realistic, fully (3+1)-dimensional simulations aiming at locating the QCD CP.\r\n\r\n[1] Hydrodynamics with parametric slowing down and fluctuations near the critical point, M.

In this study we set up the frame-\r\nwork to study such possible fluctuations in thermal freezeout conditions and\r\nextract them by comparing the model predictions to mean hadron multiplicities\r\nand their higher moments. We utilise all available data across beam energies\r\nand centralities. The extracted thermal parameters and their higher moments\r\nand the goodness of fits are compared to the standard scenario of constant ther-\r\nmal parameters.

      "Abstract": "Charm quarks, owing to their large mass, are predominantly created through initial hard scatterings in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and thus are ideal probes to study early time dynamics of these collisions. Recent results from STAR show that the slope of $D^{0}$ mesons directed flow ($v_{1}$) versus rapidity is about 25 times larger than that of charged kaons, providing important constraints on the initial geometry and charm quark transport in the QGP. It has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated at early time can induce a difference between the $v_{1}$ of charm and anti-charm quarks, and the magnitude of this difference can be much larger than those of light-flavor hadrons due to the early formation of charm quarks.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will present a new measurement of the directed flow for $D^{0}$ and $\\overline{D^{0}}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using data collected with the HeavyFlavor Tracker during the 2014 RHIC run. The $D^{0}$ ($\\overline{D^{0}}$) mesons are reconstructed by an algorithm based on the Kalman Filter (KF Particle Finder package), which provides estimation of not only the tracking parameters themselves but also the corresponding covariance matrix as well. By using such additional information in the $D^{0}$ reconstruction, the signal significance is improved considerably. The $D^{0}$ and $\\overline{D^{0}}$ meson $v_{1}$ and their difference will be presented as a function of rapidity and $p_{T}$, and compared with the results for light-flavor hadrons. These results will also be compared to model predictions and physics implications will be discussed.",

In order to further investigate the behavior of conserved quantities, BES-II has started in 2019 focusing on lower collision energies. For the experiment, a new detector named Event Plane Detector (EPD) was installed. The EPD is a scintillation detector located in the large rapidity region and expected to improve the determination of collision centrality with less self-correlation effect in the fluctuation measurements.

The study of charged particle production at high-$R_{\\rm T}$ gives us the opportunity to test the presence of non-trivial soft-QCD dynamics, such as colour reconnections or other collective phenomena.\r\nWe present a study of unidentified charged-particle production in the leading jet and in the UE for pp collisions at 13 TeV, using both conventional multiplicity estimators and $R_{\\rm T}$.

      "Speaker": "Dusan Zigic",
      "Institute": "Institute of Physics Belgrade",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "DREENA framework is based on our dynamical energy loss formalism, which takes into account ﬁnite size, ﬁnite temperature QCD medium consisting of dynamical (moving) partons. Both radiative and collisional energy losses are calculated under the same theoretical framework in the dynamical energy loss formalism, which is applicable to both light and heavy ﬂavor observables. We generalized the formalism to the case of ﬁnite magnetic mass, running coupling, and towards removing widely used soft-gluon approximation. Importantly, DREENA provides a natural framework where temperature profile from any medium evolution can be straightforwardly implemented. We exploit this by implementing different state-of-the-art medium evolutions (both event-by-event hydrodynamics and kinetic transport theory) within DREENA framework. DREENA does not use free parameters, i.e. its only input is the temperature profile that comes directly from various hydrodynamic and kinetic theory models. This opens possibility to use DREENA on both light and heavy flavor to test and differentiate between different available QGP evolution models, including both large and smaller systems, making DREENA a multipurpose QGP tomography tool. Our results on these tests will be presented, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the bulk QGP medium created at RHIC and LHC. As a highlight, contrary to the existing models, which for full hydro evolution models lead to $v_2$ puzzle, with DREENA we surprisingly obtain a very good joint agreement between $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data. This well known puzzle therefore appears to be a consequence of a simplified energy loss commonly used by other models once a proper description of parton-medium interactions is used, $v_2$ puzzle is abolished. While a widely accepted paradigm is that proper medium evolution description dominates in explaining high $p_{\\perp}$ data, this result strongly suggests that proper description of parton-medium interactions is much more important.",

      "Abstract": "Various recent measurements of high-multiplicity pp and p-A collisions at the LHC center-of-mass energies have revealed, surprisingly, that these small collision systems exhibit some of the quark-gluon plasma features, e.g. collective behaviour and strangeness enhancement, formerly thought to be achievable only in heavy-ion collisions. A promising method to narrow down the origin of this behaviour is to study the effect of Multi-Parton Interactions (MPIs). The underlying event (UE), which is the collection of particles not originating from the primary hard parton-parton scattering or the related fragmentation, is thought to be highly sensitive to the MPIs. To access the mean number of MPIs experimentally, it has been proposed to use the self-normalised charged particle density in the region transverse to a jet, $R_\\mathrm{T} = N_\\mathrm{ch}^\\mathrm{trans} / \\langle N_\\mathrm{ch}^\\mathrm{trans} \\rangle$, as it effectively disentangles the soft processes of interest from the hard component.\n\nIn this contribution, we report on the $\\pi$, $p$, $K$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Xi$ transverse momentum spectra—covering both mesons and baryons, as well as non-strange and strange hadrons—as a function of $R_\\mathrm{T}$ in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$TeV measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC.

      "Abstract": "The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) manifests itself via a separation of electric charge along the direction of the magnetic field, produced by spectator protons in heavy-ion collisions. The experimental searches for the CME, based on the charge-dependent angular correlations [1] have, however, remained inconclusive till date, because the observed features of charge separation in data are also compatible with non-CME background sources. Recently, the CMS collaboration attempted to disambiguate the origin of charge separation by measuring charge-dependent angular correlations or $\\gamma$-correlators with respect to second-order ($\\Psi_{2}$) and third-order ($\\Psi_{3}$) symmetry planes defined as $\\gamma_{112}$ and $\\gamma_{123}$ respectively, in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions [2]. The idea is that an equality is expected in $\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma_{112}}{\\Delta\\delta \\times v_{2}}$ ($\\kappa_{112}$) and $\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma_{123}}{\\Delta\\delta \\times v_{3}}$ ($\\kappa_{123}$), if the charge separations are dominated by non-CME backgrounds \\cite{CMS_3p}. The CMS measurements indeed reveal such equality across light-ion and heavy-ion collision systems, suggesting the observed charge separation in data arises from non-CME background contributions to a large extent. However, the signals and backgrounds in data are so entangled that such an interpretation may be naive. Instead, non-CME background models could provide a testing ground to verify or falsify such relations. In this poster, we will present  results of different harmonics of $\\gamma$-correlators calculated from a charge-conserved version of a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. In contrary to the CMS expectation, the AMPT model calculations show $(\\kappa_{132} \\approx 1) < (\\kappa_{112} \\approx 1.3) < (\\kappa_{123} \\approx 2)$.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] “Parity violation in hot QCD: how to detect it”, S.

The experimental searches for the CME, based on the charge-dependent angular correlations [1] have, however, remained inconclusive till date, because the observed features of charge separation in data are also compatible with non-CME background sources. Recently, the CMS collaboration attempted to disambiguate the origin of charge separation by measuring charge-dependent angular correlations or $\\gamma$-correlators with respect to second-order ($\\Psi_{2}$) and third-order ($\\Psi_{3}$) symmetry planes defined as $\\gamma_{112}$ and $\\gamma_{123}$ respectively, in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions [2]. The idea is that an equality is expected in $\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma_{112}}{\\Delta\\delta \\times v_{2}}$ ($\\kappa_{112}$) and $\\frac{\\Delta\\gamma_{123}}{\\Delta\\delta \\times v_{3}}$ ($\\kappa_{123}$), if the charge separations are dominated by non-CME backgrounds \\cite{CMS_3p}. The CMS measurements indeed reveal such equality across light-ion and heavy-ion collision systems, suggesting the observed charge separation in data arises from non-CME background contributions to a large extent. However, the signals and backgrounds in data are so entangled that such an interpretation may be naive. Instead, non-CME background models could provide a testing ground to verify or falsify such relations. In this poster, we will present  results of different harmonics of $\\gamma$-correlators calculated from a charge-conserved version of a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. In contrary to the CMS expectation, the AMPT model calculations show $(\\kappa_{132} \\approx 1) < (\\kappa_{112} \\approx 1.3) < (\\kappa_{123} \\approx 2)$.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] “Parity violation in hot QCD: how to detect it”, S.

      "Abstract": "The PHENIX experiment recently found a remarkably simple scaling law for the number of photons emitted in relativistic heavy ion collisions. When the direct-photon invariant yields are divided by $(dN_{ch}/d\\eta)^{1.25}$, data from large systems falls onto a single curve in the low transverse momentum (\"thermal\") region. What is remarkable is that this is true if $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ is varied by collision energy from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 to 200 GeV up to 2.76 TeV, by collision centrality, or size of the colliding ions down to about $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ of 20. Data from small systems suggests a rapid turn on of the scaling behavior over a rather narrow range in $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ between 5 to 20. While these findings could have many explanations, perhaps the most intriguing is that the bulk of the thermal photons are produced near the transition from QGP to hadron gas combined with an onset of QGP formation at low $dN_{ch}/d\\eta$. In this talk PHENIX complements the published results with new measurements from both small and large collision systems.",

      "Abstract": "One of the big puzzles in quarkonia production is how heavy-quark pairs, produced in the initial hard process, hadronize into final quarkonia states. This uncertainty affects the estimation of quarkonia breakup cross sections and color screening in heavy ion collisions. According to Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics, quarkonia are formed from several intermediate singlet and color octet states. The relative fraction of each contribution can only be determined by experimental data, including yields and angular decay (polarization) measurements in a broad kinematic region. The PHENIX experiment has measured inclusive J/psi polar and azimuthal angular decay coefficients in the mid ($|y|<0.35$) and forward ($1.2<|y|<2.2$) rapidity regions in $p$+$p$ collisions at 200 GeV and 510 GeV. We find that the polarization coefficients are consistent with zero at mid-rapidity and negative at large rapidity. This talk will present the analysis strategy as well as the results in different angles/frames. We will discuss how the results can be explained in terms of singlet and color octet states.",

      "Speaker": "Bojana Ilic (Blagojevic)",
      "Institute": "Institute of Physics Belgrade",
      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Commonly, only low-$p_{\\perp}$ sector is used to infer the features of initial stages before QGP thermalization. On the other hand, recently acquired wealth of high-$p_{\\perp}$ experimental data paves the way to utilize the high-$p_{\\perp}$ particles energy loss in exploring the initial stages. However, the results of such explorations are up to now either inconclusive or questionable. We here concentrate on high-$p_{\\perp}$ $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ observables, and study the effects of four different commonly considered initial stages scenarios, which have the same temperature profile after - but differ in the temperature profiles before - thermalization. For the study, we use our recently developed DREENA framework, which is a fully optimized computational procedure in which our state-of-the-art dynamical energy loss is employed. Contrary to the common expectations, we surprisingly obtain that high-$p_{\\perp}$ $v_2$ is insensitive to the initial stages of medium evolution, being unable to discriminate between different scenarios. On the other hand, $R_{AA}$ is notably sensitive to these conditions, strongly preferring later thermalization times and free streaming during the initial stages of QGP formation. Moreover, we also reconsider the validity of widely-used procedure of fitting the energy loss parameters for different initial-stage cases to reproduce the experimentally observed $R_{AA}$. We here find that the reported sensitivity of $v_2$ to different initial-stage scenarios is mainly an artifact of the $R_{AA}$ fitting, with no real physical process to support it. Therefore, such a procedure may lead to erroneous conclusions, masking the underlying nature of jet-medium interactions. Consequently, the simultaneous study of high-$p_{\\perp}$ $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ is necessary for imposing reliable constraints on the initial stages.",

Extensive efforts in the ALICE upgrade projects are currently being  made toward LHC-Run3 (2021-2024). The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), one of the new detectors, will be installed upstream of the hadron absorber in front of the Muon Spectrometer (MUON). The vertex information is smeared out with the present MUON setup due to multiple scattering occurring in this absorber. This prevents us from precisely measuring the track direction which plays a crucial role in determining the mass resolution especially in the low transverse momentum region. The chiral nature of the phase transition can be investigated via low mass vector meson measurements with superior mass resolution provided by MFT. The present uncertainty in the vertex region prevents us from distinguishing between charm and beauty, and between prompt and displaced J/$\\psi$.\\par\r\n The matching performance between MFT and MUON is therefore crucial to improve the dimuon mass resolution and reject muons from hadron decays in the hadron absorber. The matching efficiency is calculated including multiple scatterings in the hadron absorber simulated by Geant4. The measured charged particle multiplicity and a quality of muon tracks are carefully taken into account in the calculation. In this poster, we present the results of the evaluation of the muon track matching efficiency.\r\n\r\n\\end{document}",

Recently, CMS collaboration applied the PCA technique to analyze the data in Pb+Pb collisions, and a non-zero subleading mode has been extracted and interpreted as arising from subleading eccentricity [1][2]. In this talk, we study the performance of PCA method in the study of the factorization breaking effects of harmonic flow in two-particle correlation analysis [3]. We show that the choice of weighting factor in the orthogonality criteria, and $p_T$ range of the analysis, and even the statistical uncertainty of the input data could lead to significantly different results in the extracted single-particle flow modes. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the sensitivity of PCA procedure to these issues before one could attach any physics interpretation of the subleading flow modes obtained.\r\n\r\n[1] CMS Collaboration, Phys.Rev.

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Cumulants of conserved quantities are the powerful tools to study the QCD phase structure. According to the Lattice Gauge Theory calculations, at vanishing baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_{B}$) a \"smooth crossover\" for the transition from quark-gluon plasma to hadronic system occurs in heavy-ion collisions [1]. One of the possible experimental ways to search for the evidence is to analyze the higher-order cumulant ratios of net-baryon distributions from high-energy nuclear collisions. The sixth-order ($C_{6}$) to second-order ($C_{2}$) cumulant ratio of baryon number fluctuations is predicted to be negative at the freeze-out temperature if it is close to the chiral transition temperature [2]. Net-proton multiplicity distributions can be studied as a reasonable proxy for net-baryon distributions [3,4]. In this poster, we present the centrality dependence of net-proton $C_{6}/C_{2}$ at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 54.4 and 200 GeV from a high statistics Au+Au collisions data set in the STAR experiment.

The tracking system will consist of a silicon detector (MVTX) based on MAPS (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors), followed by an Intermediate Tracker (INTT), and then by a TPC.  The calorimetry system consists of an electromagnetic calorimeter, and, for the first time at a RHIC experiment, a mid-rapidity hadronic calorimeter.\r\nThe calorimeter signals are sampled with silicon photomultipliers and waveform digitizing electronics. The digitized waveforms are read out with custom PCIe boards in a ``classic'' event-driven scheme.  Conversely, the three tracking detectors are read out in streaming mode, where data are pushed from the front-end and captured continuously.  Only streaming data overlapping with RHIC beam crossings that were triggered for the calorimeter readout are permanently stored.\r\nStreaming readout is widely believed to be the readout method best suited for the detectors at a future Electron-Ion Collider.  A sPHENIX TPC prototype has successfully been read out with near-final readout electronics at the Fermilab test beam in streaming mode. The analysis of the streaming data is under way.

Delayed propagating discharges to the readout plane are a potential threat to the stable operation of GEM detectors and can cause permanent damage to the detector.  An experimental setup enabling simultaneous electrical and optical measurements is used to provide novel insights regarding the physical mechanism of the delayed discharge, including the microsecond time delay between the primary and secondary discharges.

Two approaches, Q-Cumulant ($v_2 \\{2\\}$ and $v_2\\{4\\}$) and event-plane ($v_2(EP)$) methods, are used to measure $v_2$ of $\\pi^{\\pm}$ at low transverse momenta in order to evaluate the non-flow contributions in the $v_2$ measurement. $v_2\\{2\\}$ and $v_2(EP)$ with pseudorapidity gaps can reduce the short-range non-flow contributions. $v_2\\{4\\}$ can suppress non-flow contributions and is believed to be more sensitive to the reaction plane (and hence the magnetic field). Thus $v_2\\{4\\}$ can be more sensitive to the CMW dynamics. The centrality dependence of $r_{2}$ will be compared across different collision systems and beam energies.

This was recently revisited by Alford et al. in [1] using state-of-the-art merger simulations which showed that damping of high-amplitude oscillations due to bulk viscosity is expected to play an important role in gravitational wave emission and, as such, this should be taken into account and thoroughly investigated in realistic merger simulations. However, viscous effects have not yet been included in merger simulations because this requires a formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics, including bulk viscosity, that is causal in the strong nonlinear regime probed by the mergers. This has been an open problem in the field since Israel and Stewart's seminal work in 1979. In this work we solve this problem and prove [2] that the Einstein-Israel-Stewart equations, describing the dynamics of a relativistic fluid with bulk viscosity and nonzero baryon charge dynamically coupled to gravity, are causal in the full nonlinear regime. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers, which will provide key information about the novel out-of-equilibrium properties of highly dense QCD matter in neutron stars.\r\n\r\n[1] M.G.

Helping to enable the broad measurement capabilities of sPHENIX is the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal), which is the primary detector for identifying and measuring the energy of photons and electrons. The EMCal is constructed of scintillating fibers embedded in blocks of tungsten powder in an epoxy matrix, with the emitted light collected with acrylic light guides and read out through Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs).

      "Country": "BR",
      "Abstract": "The aim of relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created at high-enough temperatures and/or densities. For this purpose, heavy-quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are very useful probes for the characterization of the QGP. They are produced at the early stages of the collisions via initial hard scatterings and, therefore, they experience the full evolution of the system. However, to quantify the QGP effects it is first needed to understand the heavy-quark production in proton-proton collisions as a reference system and further in p-Pb collisions to subtract cold nuclear matter effects. In particular, the production mechanisms of heavy flavours can be studied through their angular correlations which is inherited by their decay products, such as electrons.\r\n\r\nAt leading order the heavy-flavour pair is created back to back through flavour creation. On the other hand, PYTHIA creates pairs also via higher order processes like flavour excitation and gluon splitting with different angular correlation functions. While gluon splitting produces pairs with small angles, flavour excitation processes produce pairs without preferred angular correlation. In this poster we present the current analysis of angular distribution functions between correlated heavy-flavour electron-positron pairs in proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV measured with the ALICE detector and the comparison with simulated mechanisms processes obtained by PYTHIA and POWHEG generators. Angular correlation functions will also be compared to HVQMNR NLO calculations, which show that they are sentistive to $k_{\\rm T}$ broadening.",

In spite of the success of the flow measurements and the hydrodynamic descriptions, one essential question is why the Fourier expansion is a natural way to analyze the flow data. In this talk, I will address this question with one of the machine learning techniques, called the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In more details, we will investigate if a machine (unsupervised learning technique) could directly discover flow from the huge amount of data of the relativistic fluid systems without explicit instructions from human beings. \r\n\r\nAfter apply PCA to the raw data of hydrodynamic simulations, we found that the obtained PCA eigenvectors are similar to but not identical with the traditional Fourier bases. Correspondingly, the PCA defined flow harmonics vn are also similar to the traditional vn for n = 2 and 3, but largely deviated from the Fourier ones with n≥4 . A further study on the symmetric cumulants and the Pearson coefficients indicates that mode-coupling effects are reduced for these flow harmonics defined by PCA. Our work also demonstrated the hydrodynamic system is not highly non-linear as generally believed before, which should be reevaluated with such PCA bases for the flow definition.  \r\n\r\n[1] Z.

      "Abstract": "Recent experimental and theoretical obsevations suggest that production of (multi-)strange hadrons and charged hadrons in (non-)deformed nuclei is a complex physical process. The properties of charged hadrons produced in deformed nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC energies contradict many of the theoretical models result including two-component Monte Carlo Glauber model. Unlike light hadrons, the production mechanism of (multi-)strange hadrons is quite involved as they do not simply produce according to their statistical weights as described in grand canonical ensemble. In recent past, several efforts have been made to provide a mechanism for (non-)strange hadron production in symmetric and asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments. However, an unified theoretical or simulation model which reproduce the multiplicity distribution of (multi-)strange hadrons alongwith multiplicity of charged hadrons is still lacking. In this article, we have used HYDJET++ model to calculate multiplicity distribution of (non-)strange hadrons with various control parameter in symmetric collision of (non-)deformed nuclei at RHIC and LHC energies. We have calculated the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum distribution and elliptic flow distribution of charged hadrons with different control parameters.We observed that HYDJET++ along with certain parameters can adequately provide a unified model for light as well as strange hadron production in various type of collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Strangeness enhancement in central heavy-ion collisions (A+A) relative to proton-proton interactions (pp) has long been a well-recognized signature for QCD deconfinement or the formation of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The energy scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in BNL or at CERNs' Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) have presented evidence that are typical of the enhanced strangeness production via their measurements of kaon to pion ratios which exhibit a non-monotonic energy dependence. Similar indication was also observed in the baryon sector based on the measurements of anti-lambda to anti-proton ratio as a function of beam energy. Later it was thought to be a cleaner probe because their quark compositions have only anti-quarks, which are produced in the reaction and not transported. More-over their high mass resonance contributions are less. However, the final yields of both anti-lambda and anti-proton are sensitive to the baryon-antibaryon (B$\\bar{B}$) annihilation in hadronic rescatterings phase. In this work, we present an investigation of the beam energy dependence of $\\bar\\Lambda$ over $\\bar{p}$ ratio within a hadronic transport model, UrQMD and observe that the final state yields of $\\bar\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{p}$ are strongly influenced by B$\\bar{B}$ annihilation channel and has a significant impact of on the $\\bar\\Lambda$ to $\\bar{p}$ ratio. In fact, the trend of $\\bar\\Lambda$ to $\\bar{p}$ ratio enhancement in data can be qualitatively described within the UrQMD model because the spectral shapes of $\\bar\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{p}$ are modified differently due to different annihilation cross sections of these two species. This suggests that the observed features of beam energy dependence of $\\bar\\Lambda$ to $\\bar{p}$ ratio enhancement may not relate to the strangeness enhancement unambiguously.",

Jet observables are a particularly useful probe of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions since the hard scatted partons that fragment into final state jets are strongly “quenched”, losing energy to the medium as they traverse it.  To answer fundamental questions about the physics of this process, we need to characterize the medium induced modification of the jet fragmentation pattern and the correlation of the lost energy with the jet axis.  The measurements require removal of the soft, underlying event (UE), and we will show the performance of different UE subtraction techniques for calorimetric jets in sPHENIX.  The performance of the detector for photon-jet and jet fragmentation observables will also be shown.",

In this talk I will discuss new modification terms [1] in fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), which determines the power of hydrodynamic noise fields, and also discuss its importance in the point of view the fluctuation theorem [2], which is a relation of the entropy production probability known in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on heavy-ion observables such as flow coefficients and longitudinal decorrelation $r_n(\\eta_a, \\eta_b)$ are recently analyzed in event-by-event simulations by dynamical models [3-6]. Also the thermal fluctuations near the critical point also play an important role in the critical dynamics. In this sense the hydrodynamic fluctuations in dynamical models are becoming more and more important. The FDR used in dynamical models is normally obtained in the global equilibrium. However, in expanding systems such as matter created in the nuclear collisions, the FDR is non-trivial. I obtain new modification terms to the FDR in the second-order causal dissipative hydrodynamics by considering the linear-response in non-static and inhomogeneous backgrounds. I discuss its relation to the steady-state fluctuation theorem. Also, by performing the numerical simulations of non-linear relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics assuming the Bjorken flow, I investigate the non-linear fluctuation effects to the fluctuation theorem.\r\n\r\n - [1] K.

However, these calculations have an opposite sign comparing to the experiment measurement [3].\r\n\r\nTo resolve this sign puzzle, we further study the effect of feed-down decay on local $\\Lambda$ polarization [6]. We develop a theoretical framework to study how spin polarization is transferred from parent to daughter particle in two-body decay. After Monte-Carlo simulation, we find that the feed-down effect suppresses the primordial $\\Lambda$ polarization, but can not flip the sign.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR collaboration, Nature 548 (2017) 62-65.\r\n[2] STAR collaboration, Phys.Rev.

      "Abstract": "Utilizing our developed relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code [1] to analysis of proton-lead and lead-lead collisions at the LHC [2], we investigate applicability of hydrodynamics, QGP bulk property and viscosities effects at hadronization process. Here we focus on one-particle distributions such as rapidity distributions and particle identified transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows. \r\n We show that relativistic viscous hydrodynamics works for explanation of experimental data of central and mid-central proton-lead collisions. Furthermore, we find that modification of particle distribution due to bulk viscosity at hadronization process affects determination of value of bulk viscosity of QGP. For example, extracted values of bulk viscosities of QGP are much smaller than those of our previous study where bulk viscosity effect at hadronization process is neglected [3]. \r\n According to our results of mean transverse momentum, effect of final state interactions in the small system is smaller than that in the large system. It indicates that produced particles in the small system keep information of the QGP fluid in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We also discuss thermalizeation of systems from comparison between small and large systems. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] K. Okamoto and C. Nonaka, Eur. Phys. J. C 77, no. 6, 383 (2017).\r\n[2] J.

These particles have small hadronic re-scattering cross sections and supposed to be sensitive to partonic phase. It is argued that the additional radial flow gained in the hadronic phase modifies the $v_{2}(p_{T})$ shape. Due to the different sensitivity to hadronic interactions of protons and $\\phi$ mesons, the mass ordering of $v_{2}$ could be broken between protons and $\\phi$ mesons in the low $p_{T}$ range ($p_{T} < $1.5 GeV/c) . The energy dependence of mass ordering between proton and $\\phi$ meson $v_{2}$ in the low $p_{T}$ region will be discussed. These results provide us an opportunity to study hadronic contributions on $v_{2}$ measurements as a function of collision energy.",

      "Abstract": "The origin of long-range collective azimuthal correlations in small-system collisions is an area of intense research in the heavy ion community. To disentangle between collectivity associated with initial-state intrinsic momentum anisotropy and the collectivity arising as a final-state response to the collision geometry, we studied the development of collectivity in 5.02 TeV and 0.2 TeV $p$+Pb collisions with both initial-state and final-state effects included in a transport model AMPT. We find that the initial momentum anisotropy may not be fully isotropized through parton interactions, and the final-state partonic harmonic flow $v_n$ in general are correlated with both the initial momentum anisotropy and the shape of the collision geometry. The initial momentum anisotropy also influences the event by event fluctuation of $v_n$. Therefore the mere evidence of geometry response of the collective flow does not rule out the presence of large contributions from the initial state[1].\r\n\r\nWe also compared the results between 5.02 TeV and 0.2 TeV[2], which have the same Glauber geometry but different parton densities (each nucleon produces three times more particles at 5.02 TeV than 0.2 TeV). We found that results are NOT the same for the same $N_{part}$ nor for the same $N_{ch}$, suggesting a non-trivial influence of different particle production at the two energies. We discuss the prospect of disentangling the non-equilibrium transport or near-equilibrium hydrodynamics in future small system run ($p$+A and O+O) at RHIC and the LHC. \r\n\r\n[1] M. Nie, L. Yi, J.

      "Abstract": "The $\\phi$ vector mesons have much smaller hadronic cross section which makes them less influenced at late-stage interactions than other hadrons [1-4]. Thus their anisotropies like the elliptic flow should be small if the system is always in a hadronic phase. This, in turn, makes $\\phi$ meson $v_2$ especially sensitive to the energy where quark-gluon plasma turns off. Measurements from STAR at 7.7 and 11.5 GeV have seen $\\phi$ $v_2$ at highest transverse momentum close to zero [5] and $\\phi$ directed flow, $v_1$, is consistent with zero [6] with conclusions limited by statistics. On the other hand, the closeness of $\\phi$ mass to the nucleon and its $s$ $\\bar{s}$ constituent quarks makes them suitable to test the deviation of net-nucleon and net-meson $v_1$ at energies below 7.7 GeV where could be a breakdown of the assumption that $s$ and $\\bar{s}$ quarks have the same flow [6]. Measurements of directed and elliptic flow of $\\phi$ vector meson at 3.0 and 4.5 GeV Au+Au collisions at STAR will be presented and compared with RHIC Beam Energy Scan results from 7.7-39 GeV. Measurements will have better precision with increased particle acceptance and 100 more statistics at 3.0 GeV compared to 4.5 GeV from the STAR fixed-target run.

      "Abstract": "Forward hadron lead/scintillator sampling calorimeter (Projectile Spectator Detector, PSD) consisting of 44 longitudinally segmented modules is developed and already constructed for the future Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR. The original approaches in the energy calibration with cosmic muons and in the signal analysis are proposed. The longitudinal segmentation of individual modules allows for the reconstruction of the cosmic muon tracks in the PSD. It makes possible to estimate the muon pass length in each longitudinal section with the subsequent correction of energy depositions in the scintillators. The developed method takes into account more accurately the muon energy deposition and improves the precision of the energy calibration.\r\nThe short (about 40 nsec) PSD analog signals from photodetectors in each longitudinal section will be digitized by 125 MS/s sampling ADCs. To improve the precision of the PSD energy calibration, the procedure of signal waveform fitting based on the Prony least squares method was developed. This method represents the waveform as a linear combination of exponential functions and allows the measurement of signal amplitude with high accuracy. The fit of the signals with a predefined function permits to discriminate the small muon signals from the electronic noises of comparable amplitudes.  The speed of the applied fitting procedure is a few orders faster than the standard iteration methods. It allows the signal analysis on the fly.  The developed method makes also possible the selection of pileup signals at a high counting rate.",

      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic effect is a good observable to investigate the topological and electromagnetic properties of the QGP. But the $\\gamma$ correlator, a common observable used to detect the CME, contains both contribution from the CME and its background. This observable can not identify the CME from its background. Recently, a new observable of $R_{\\Psi_{m}}$ has been proposed[1-4], which is expected to distinguish the CME from the background. We apply mixing particles method and shuffling particles method to calculate $R_{\\Psi_{m}}$ using a multiphase transport model without or with a percentage of CME-induced charge separation[5,6]. From the results, we found that the shape of final $R_{\\Psi_{2}}$ distribution is flat for the case without CME[7], but concave for that with some amount of the CME. By comparing the responses of $R_{\\Psi_{2}}$ and $\\gamma$ to the strength of the CME, we found that the CME signal can survive only when the initial charge separation percentage is large enough (more than $5\\%$), which indicates a nonlinear sensitivity of these observables to the CME due to strong final state interactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]N.

      "Abstract": "Quark-hadron continuity [1] is a scenario that the hadronic matter is continuously connected to a color superconducting phase without phase transitions as the baryon chemical potential increases. This scenario is based on the fact that the two phases have the same symmetry breaking pattern, in the spirit of Landau's classification of phases. When we consider quantum phases of matter, it is known that the classification based on symmetry is insufficient: it fails to detect so-called topological orders. We address the question whether this continuity is true as quantum phases of matter, which requires the treatment beyond Ginzburg-Landau description [2,3]. \r\nTo examine the topological nature of color superconductor, we study the low-energy theory describing U(1) Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons and vortices of the color-flavor locked phase, and discuss the fate of emergent higher-form symmetries. The theory has the form of a topological BF theory coupled to NG bosons, and fractional statistics of test quarks and vortices arises as a result of an emergent Z3 two-form symmetry. We find that the two-form symmetry is not spontaneously broken, indicating that quark-hadron continuity is still a consistent scenario. \r\n\r\n[1] T. Schafer and F. Wilczek, Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "Fluctuations in physics observables and flow effects in heavy-ion collisions have been topics of particularly interest in recent years as they may provide important signals regarding the formation of quark-gluon plasma, the existence  of a critical point and the evolution of the system. Moreover, the fluctuations and correlations measured in the final stage have their sources at least partly  in the initial fluctuations and the initial-state geometry provided the initial effects are not largely altered by the intermediate evolution of the system.   GLISSANDO is a versatile Monte-Carlo generator for Glauber-like models of the initial stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  The current version incorporates the wounded parton model and, within this model, one can study nucleon substructure fluctuation effects. The code also includes the possibility of investigating collisions of light nuclei as 3He and 3H, or the alpha-clustered 7Be,9Be,12C,16O, where the deformation of the intrisic wave function influences the transverse shape of the initial state. The code can provide output in the format containing the event-by-event source location, which may be further used in modeling the intermediate evolution phase with hydrodynamics or transport models.   \r\n\r\nThe distributions which illustrate the new features implemented in GLISSANDO 3  will be presented.

It is predicted that the local density fluctuations near critical point exhibit power-law scaling, which can be probed with a intermittency analysis of the scaled factorial moments ($F_{q}$) for charged particles. The power-law behavior of $q^{th}$ order scaled factorial moments can be expressed as: $F_{q}\\sim (M^{2})^{\\phi_{q}}$, where $M^{2}$ is the number of equally sized cells in momentum space, and $\\phi_{q}$ is the intermittency index. The scaling exponent, $\\nu$, related to the critical component can be derived from the ratio, $\\phi_{q}/\\phi_{2}$. The  energy dependence of $\\nu$ could be used to search for the signature of the QCD critical point. Such measurement is actively being pursued by the NA49 and NA61 Collaborations in large and small collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are ideal probes of the QGP matter. To consistently describe the medium evolution and heavy-quark-medium interaction, we improve the  linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model [Phys. Lett. B777 (2018) 255-259] by modeling QGP as a collection of quasi-particles with equation of state (EOS) fitted to the lattice QCD data. We call this QLBT model, in which the in-medium scatterings of heavy quarks are described using the linear Boltzmann transport that includes both elastic and inelastic energy loss of heavy quarks within the perturbative QCD framework. The temperature dependences of the quasi-particle masses, as well as the strong coupling parameter among them, are systematically extracted from two different sets of lattice EOS (Hot QCD and Wuppertal­-Budapest) with a Bayesian statistical analysis method. With all model parameters fixed by the lattice QCD calculations, QLBT naturally provides a good description of the nuclear modification factors and elliptic flow coefficients of heavy mesons at high transverse momenta. Systematical uncertainties arising from applying two different lattice equations of states are evaluated and turn out to be small for heavy flavor observables.",

      "Abstract": "Recent ALICE results on the yield of strange particles in pp and p-Pb collisions reveal the possibility that similar strange quark production mechanisms could be present in all collision systems. The $p_{\\rm T}$-dependent baryon-to-meson yield ratio in hadronic and nuclear collisions is sensitive to the collective expansion of the system, the partonic recombination into hadrons, the jet fragmentation and hadronization.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we explore the connection between (multi-)strange hadron yields enhancement and jet production via the measurement of the $p_{\\rm T}$-differential spectrum of strange and multi-strange particles (${\\rm K}_{\\rm S}^{0}$,  $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ and $\\Xi$) within jets and in the underlying event, in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV, respectively. To gain insight on the fragmentation of jets containing a ${\\rm V}^{0}$s, an alternative approach that uses two-particle correlation is considered. Both the near-side and away-side components of the correlation functions between the high-momentum ${\\rm K}_{\\rm S}^{0}$, $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ (${\\rm V}^{0}$s) and charged hadrons as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ of the trigger and associated particles as well as the event multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "The High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) is measuring properties of baryonic matter at moderate temperatures in A+A collisions at the SIS18 accelerator at GSI, Darmstadt. After a long shutdown of SIS18 to prepare for the future FAIR facility, beamtimes have been resumed within the FAIR Phase-0 program in March 2019.\r\nMeanwhile, the HADES experiment has undergone several upgrades. In this presentation the successful upgrade of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH) with MAPMTs will be reported as well as first performance studies from the beamtime in March 2019. This success is also an important step towards the realization of the CBM-RICH detector in due time for the start of  the SIS100 physics program.\r\n\r\nThe RICH detector of the HADES experiment measured for nearly two decades with a CsI photocathode based readout which now has been replaced with modern Hamamatsu H12700 MAPMTs that have been purchased already for the CBM-RICH detector. The complete readout chain of the subdetector was replaced by newly developed DiRICH frontend boards.  The update to a MAPMT based readout has been a big steps to excellent timing property, high quantum efficiency, fine pixel granularity and low dark noise. As key features the new readout chain can work at higher rates than before and also provided a substantial gain in photoelectrons per ring.\r\n\r\nThe updated HADES RICH MAPMT plane is build up with 428 H12700 MAPMTs where the inner part of the plane is coated with a wavelength shifter to increase the number of photons per ring. The readout electronics is based on the TrbNet system and uses FPGA based TDCs for signal measurements. Each of the 856 DiRICH frontend boards measures on 32 channels - half a MAPMT – and provides a prepacked dataflow.\r\nAs a second central improvement the radiator gas of the HADES RICH was exchanged from C4F10 to C4H10 which reduced the amount of scintillation light. As measured in previous tests the old CaF2 window, a separator between the old radiator and the photocathode volume, was unmounted to reduce the scintillation light in the detector by orders of magnitudes.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the new TrbNet readout, new MAPMTs, temperature measurements and the change of the radiator gas brought the HADES RICH upgrade to a full success. The HADES RICH detector participated with unprecedented performance in the HADES beamtime in March 2019 recording Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV.\r\n\r\n\r\n*supported by BMBF 05P15R6FCA and 05P19R6FCA",

In addition, high multiplicity pp collisions show similar collective behavior as found in heavy-ion collisions with comparable event activities, such as long-range correlations or the $v_{n}$ coefficients. In pp collisions, these effects may be caused by multiple-parton interactions or other QCD effects, therefore, the measurements in different multiplicity intervals will provide insights to understand the properties of small interacting system. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we will present charged jet cross section measurement in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV with the high statistics collected by ALICE. The jet cross section ratio for various jet resolution parameters will be also shown. Such kind of cross section ratio is sensitive to the transverse energy profile of the jets.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Recent STAR measurements of global hyperon polarization in AuAu Collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)  have attracted significant interest and generated wide enthusiasm. The data present an intriguing puzzle, showing a difference in the global spin polarization between hyperons and anti-hyperons, especially at relatively low collision beam energy. One possible cause of this difference is the potential presence of in-medium magnetic field. In this talk, we report our study on the phenomenological viability of this interpretation. Using the AMPT model framework, we quantify the influence of different magnetic field evolution scenarios on the size of the polarization difference in a wide span of collision beam energies. We find that such difference is very sensitive to the lifetime of the magnetic field and also mildly dependent on the precise form of magnetic field time dependence. Assuming magnetic polarization as the mechanism to enhance anti-hyperon signal while suppress hyperon signal, we phenomenologically extract an upper limit on the needed magnetic field lifetime in order to account for the experimental data. The so-obtained lifetime values are in a quite plausible ballpark and follow approximately the scaling relation of being inversely proportional to the beam energy. The time-integrated magnetic field shows an interesting non-monotonic dependence on the collision beam energy. Possible implications on other magnetic field related effects are discussed. Finally, we also report predictions for polarization effect in the CuCu and CuAu colliding systems, demonstrating an interesting hierarchy CuCu > CuAu > AuAu due to interplay between hyperon production timing and the evolution of vorticity. These predictions can be readily tested by future experimental analysis. [Refs: (1) arXiv:1905.12613; (2) Phys. Lett. B788(2019)409.]",

      "Abstract": "Identified light flavour particles, such as the $\\pi$, K, $\\phi$ mesons and the p, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$  baryons, constitute interesting probes to investigate the collective behaviour recently observed in small collision systems. The underlying mechanisms of light flavour production are currently not well understood, and the mechanisms are explained in the framework of different models. pQCD models based on hard scatterings, such as PYTHIA, describe light flavour production via string-breakings and rope hadronization. Other thermal and statistical models, mainly dominated by soft processes, predict a mechanism for the production of light flavour particles based on mass hierarchies in (grand) canonical ensembles.\r\n\r\nThis analysis is aimed to disentangle and isolate events that are dominated by soft processes (\"isotropic\") and hard processes (\"jetty\") by using the transverse spherocity observable. The light flavour production is then studied in both events with jet-like topologies and isotropic topologies, which are assumed to be dominated by hard and soft processes, respectively. This is done in an effort to pin-point the underlying mechanisms of the collective behaviour observed in small systems, such as radial flow and long-range angular correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution we report about the measurement of transverse momentum spectra of strange and non-strange mesons and baryons in transverse spherocity selected events. The results are obtained by exploiting the data collected with ALICE in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy, $\\sqrt{s}$, of 13 TeV.",

Exploiting its optimal particle identification capabilities, the ALICE experiment is able to measure pion, kaon and (anti-)proton transverse momentum spectra from hundreds of MeV/$c$ up to 20 GeV/$c$. Measurements of the production of pions, kaons and (anti-)protons in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions at the highest center of mass energies provided during the LHC Run 2 data taking period, are reported.

Yields from particles coming from these gluons obtained in nuclear collisions are suppressed relative to $p$+$p$ collisions because of initial-state effects such as shadowing, energy loss and gluon saturation. Precise measurement of yields coming from small-x, small-$Q^2$ gluons are essential to understand these effects which have a significant contribution to the suppressions observed in A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC. The inverse Compton process $q+q\\rightarrow \\gamma+q \\rightarrow \\gamma+h$ is one of the few which can access and provide information on the gluon $x$ and $Q^2$ in the region where nPDFs are not well constrained. The LHCb detector can measure photons through the Electromagnetic Calorimeter or photon conversion to dielectrons in the pseudorapidity range 2$<\\eta<$5, covering $x>5\\times 10^{-6}$ and $Q^2>2$GeV$^2$ in the case of inverse Compton processes. This unique coverage allow us to search for the gluon saturation scale, the transition between dilute and saturated gluons, predicted by the Color-Glass Condensate effective theory. This presentation will show the status of the isolated $\\gamma+$hadron correlation analysis using data collected in $p$+Pb and Pb+$p$ collisions at 8.16 TeV and $p$+$p$ collisions at 8 TeV.

We analyze the energy spectra of Dirac fermions in the presence of rotation and magnetic field. We find that the Landau degeneracy is resolved by rotation. A drastic change in the energy dispersion relation leads to the “rotational magnetic inhibition” that is a novel phenomenon analogous to the inverse magnetic catalysis in a magnetic system at finite chemical potential. Then we take in to account the boundary condition to perserve the casuality find that mode accumulation at the boundary occurs for large angular momenta and that the magnetic effect is enhanced on the boundary surface. Using a simple fermionic model, we confirm that the magnetic catalysis is strongly amplified at the boundary due to the mode accumulation. Besides, we also find that there is a competition between the rotational inhibition of the spin zero pairing and the enhancement of the pion BEC.",

The solutions of these equations exhibit attractor behavior which we analyze in the context of Lyapunov exponents from several different techniques. We also compare attractors of second-order Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory, transient DNMR theory, third-order theory and exact solution of Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation. We demonstrate that the third-order theory provides a better approximation to the exact kinetic theory attractor compared to MIS and DNMR theories. Further, we find analytical solutions for these higher-order theories by assuming different forms of shear relaxation time and use these solutions to study the analytical attractors. Finally, we propose a new way to characterize and uniquely determine the hydrodynamic attractors, as well as the Lyapunov exponents, by studying the universal behavior of these solutions at small as well as large Knudsen numbers.",

Owing to the short lifetime of resonances $(\\sim 10^{-23}$s), their characteristic properties such as mass, width and yield are very sensitive to the collision dynamics and in-medium effects. Multiple resonances have been studied in ALICE, including $\\rho(770)$, $K^{*}(892)$, $\\phi(1020)$, $\\Lambda(1520)$ . However there are higher excited state resonances like $K^{*}(1430)$ and $K_2(1770)$ which have not yet been studied in the experiment because of their low production rate and difficulties in separating them cleanly from the underlying correlated background. Recent high statistics data in pp collisions collected by ALICE allow us to study the higher excited kaon state $K^{*}(1430)$. The lifetime of the $K^{*}(1430)$ ($\\sim$1.5 fm$\\thinspace /c$) is smaller than that of $K^{*}(892)$ ($\\sim$4 fm$\\thinspace /c$), it is expected that $K^{*}(1430)$ will be affected more by re-scattering in the late hadronic phase and hence measuring $K^{*}(1430)$ production in pp collisions will provide a baseline for similar measurements in Pb--Pb collisions. \r\n \r\nWe will present the first measurement of the $K^{*}(1430)$ meson reconstruced through its hadronic decay channel, $K^{*}(1430)\\rightarrow K\\pi$ at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.5$) in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV using the ALICE detector.

      "Abstract": "We study [1] the suppressions of high transverse momentum single hadron and dihadron productions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions based on the framework of a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD parton model combined with the higher-twist energy loss formalism [2,3]. Our model can provide a consistent description for the nuclear modification factors of single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ in central and non-central nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC energies. \r\n\r\nWe quantitatively extract the value of jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ via a global $\\chi^2$ analysis, and obtain the scaled jet quenching parameter ${\\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 4.1 \\sim 4.4$ at $T = 378$ MeV for 0.2 TeV Au+Au collisions and ${\\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 2.6 \\sim 3.3$ at $T = 486$ MeV for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions, which are consistent with the results from JET Collaboration [4]. We also get the ${\\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 2.5 $ at $T=516$ MeV for 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions, ${\\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 3.5$ at $T= 469$ MeV for 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions only via single hadron productions and provide the predictions for the dihadron $I_{AA}$ of these two collisions. The above numerical analysis shows that ${\\hat{q}}/{T^3}$ has some temperature dependence: it decreases as one increases the temperature, which can be understood as decreasing jet-medium interaction strength with increasing temperature.\r\n\r\nHere are some other interesting results that the dihadron $I_{AA}$ are typically larger than single hadron $R_{AA}$ given the same nucleus-nucleus collision conditions and the values of $I_{AA}$ also increase as one increases the trigger hadron $p_T$. These results can be explained by that high $p_T$ single hadrons mainly come from surface bias emission jets, while high $p_T$ dihadrons come from a combination of surfacial and tangential jets as well as punching-through jets [5,6]. And with increasing trigger hadron $p_T$, the contribution from punching-through jets increases [7]. On average in a A + A event, the total energy loss for jets in the surface bias case is larger than in the case with punching-through jets.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] M. Xie, S. Y. Wei, G. Y.

Model comparisons are essential to decipher the properties of the QGP. In this talk, we study the correlations between flow harmonics $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ over a wide centrality range with two-particle correlations in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}}=2.76$ TeV simulated by the HYDJET++ and AMPT models. We compare the model results to the experimental data from ATLAS and find both models are in good agreement with data for $v_2$-$v_3$ correlation. For $v_2$-$v_4$ and $v_3$-$v_4$ correlations, while AMPT is still in good agreement, HYDJET++ gives stronger slopes in the correlations than the ATLAS data. The AMPT model qualitatively predicts a boomerang-like shape in the correlations as observed in the experimental data, however, they quantitatively disagree. The HYDJET++ model fails completely to reproduce such a boomerang shape. We study flow fluctuations by the $v_2$ obtained with different Q-cumulant orders, namely $v_2\\{2\\}, v_2\\{4\\}, v_2\\{6\\},$ and $v_2\\{8\\}$. In particular, we study the skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of the $v_2$ distribution, by the ratio of \r\n$v_{2}\\{6\\} - v_{2}\\{8\\}$ and $v_{2}\\{4\\} - v_{2}\\{6\\}$.

It has been shown that in the large-N$_c$ limit (N$_c$ is the number of colours of quarks) there exist duality correspondences, which are the symmetries of the thermodynamic potential and the phase structure itself. The first one is a duality between the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and the charged pion condensation (PC) phenomena. The dualities were shown to exist in the matter with chiral imbalance that can be produced in compact stars or heavy ion collisions. One of the key conclusions of these studies is the fact that chiral imbalance generates charged PC in dense baryonic/quark matter even in the case of charge neutral matter, which is interesting in the context of neutron stars. It was also shown that the duality can be observed in lattice QCD. Moreover, they were used for prediction of catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking by chiral imbalance. It is known that chiral imbalance can occur due to temperature and sphaleron transitions. Our studies show that chiral imbalance can occur in the cores of neutron stars or in heavy ion collisions at NICA, FAIR, where large baryon densities can be reached, due to other phenomena the so-called chiral separation and chiral vortical effects. Even if the phase diagram contains phases with inhomogeneous condensates, it still possesses the duality. Just by the duality we obtained, in the inhomogeneous case, without any calculations, a full phase diagram of chirally asymmetric dense quark matter. This shows that the duality is an instrument of high predictivity power. The obtained phase diagram is quite rich and contains various spatially inhomogeneous phases.\r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n Phys.Rev.

      "Abstract": "We study the behaviour of the η′ around above the pseudocritical temperature by use of lattice QCD simulations with two families of dynamical quarks. Due to its  anomalous component the η′ carries significant informations on the nature of the phase transition, and the role of the anomaly.   We contrast and compare the results for the η′ with the behaviour of chiral observables as well as with predictions of models.  Results are obtained from the analysis of the gluonic defined topological charge density correlator after gradient flow. Our results indicate the growth of the η′ mass above the pseudocritical temperature, associated with the chiral symmetry restoration. In the vicinity of the pseudocritical temperature the results are consistent with a small dip in the η′ mass. The magnitude of the dip is compatible with the reduction of the η′ mass obtained by experimental analysis and suggests that η′ mass comes close to zero temperature non-anomalous contribution. We outline the current status of our study and the upcoming steps.",

      "Abstract": "The production of charm quarks occurs predominantly in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of a heavy-ion collision, and due to their relatively long lifetimes they experience the full evolution of the system. In ALICE, charmed mesons ($D^0$,$D^+$,$D^{*+}$ and $D_{s}^{+}$) are reconstructed in their hadronic decay channels, allowing the full kinematic information of the original particle to be retained. Their nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) evaluated as the modification of the D meson production $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to the one in proton--proton collisions gives insight into the energy loss mechanisms charm quark undergoes as it traverses the strongly interacting medium (QGP). In particular comparisons with lighter hadrons give insight into the possible mass and flavour dependence of the in-medium energy loss. Comparative studies between particle species in Pb--Pb and pp collision systems allow us to test possible differences in the production of different charge states and resonances such as $D^{*+}$. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, charmed hadrons with strangeness content, such as $D_{s}^{+}$, are of particular interest as they allow us to probe the effect of the hot and dense medium on charm hadronisation such as the possible recombination of charm and strange quarks in the strangeness-rich QGP. In this case one expects a difference in the $R_{\\rm AA}$ of strange and non-strange D mesons.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution will be presented the latest ALICE results for the production of strange and non-strange D mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, using the data provided by the 2018 run of the LHC. The nuclear modification factor of strange and non-strange D-mesons will be shown, along with the relative production ratios of the strange and non-strange D-meson species. Of particular interest is the extremely low $p_{\\rm T}$ reach ALICE is able to achieve on the measurement of the production of $D^0$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions that allows to evaluate the $D^0$ $R_{\\rm AA}$ down to $\\sim$ 0 $p_{\\rm T}$ and opens the possibility to determine the total $D^0$ production cross-section in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nFinally, comparisons of the measurements with theoretical model calculations and lighter-flavour particles will be discussed.",

      "Country": "SE",
      "Abstract": "One of the remaining puzzles in heavy-ion physics is that strangeness enhancement - believed to be a signature of the Quark-Gluon Plasma - is not only observed in heavy-ion collisions, but also in high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. Various phenomenological models have been developed to try to understand this, such as rope hadronisation (used in the Angantyr extension of Pythia) and core-corona models (used in EPOS). A prediction of the string/rope model is that strangeness is produced in $s\\bar{s}$ pair breakings, so there will be correlations between strange and anti-strange hadrons in the same event, even between different hadronic species. By studying these correlations one can learn more about the strangeness production mechanism and test if it changes with multiplicity.\r\n\r\nIn this study, these predictions are tested by comparing angular correlations between in particular $\\Xi^--K^+$ ($\\overline{\\Xi}^+-K^-$) and the reference $\\Xi^--\\pi^+$ ($\\overline{\\Xi}^+-\\pi^-$) as a function of multiplicity, in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13\\,\\rm TeV$ using the ALICE detector. The results are compared to theoretical predictions by Angantyr and EPOS. A comparison will also be done between $\\Xi-$baryon and $\\Xi-$meson correlations. While this probes different physics, it further aids in the understanding of the production of multi-strange hadrons in small systems.",

In asymmetric collisions, the produced particle yields are different at the forward and backward rapidities. The rapidity asymmetry (${Y}_\\mathrm{Asym}$) studies are sensitive to nuclear modification effects, like shadowing, the Cronin enhancement, multiple scattering and energy loss.\r\n     We will report on the measurement of the production of  K$^{*0}$ and $\\phi$ resonances in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{\\it{s}_{NN }}$ = 8.16 TeV.

      "Abstract": "We investigate fluid-to-particle conversion using the usual Cooper-Frye approach but with more general local equilibrium distributions than the Boltzmann or Bose/Fermi distributions typically used. Even though we study ideal fluids (i.e., shear stress and bulk pressure are zero everywhere), we find a suppression of elliptic flow ($v_2$) at high transverse momenta ($p_T>1.5$ GeV/c), relative to results obtained with the traditional Boltzmann distributions [1].  The non-viscous suppression shows qualitatively similar features to the well-known shear viscous suppression of $v_2$; for example, it increases with $p_T$, and it is smaller for heavier species as seen in self-consistent kinetic theory calculations. Our results question whether all of the $v_2$ suppression seen in the data can be attributed to viscous effects, and indicate that shear viscosities extracted from RHIC and LHC elliptic flow data might be overestimated.

One of the major observables addressed by both experiments is dilepton production.\r\n\r\nA central goal is to establish the excitation function of dilepton emission for heavy collision systems. While HADES is studying the lowest collision energies up to 1.5$A$ GeV, CBM, in a first campaign, will continue the excitation function to 12$A$ GeV. Central component of both detector setups is Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors (RICH), which are intended to identify and select leptons among all other particles.\r\n\r\nDalitz decays of long-lived neutral mesons ($\\pi^0$, $\\eta$) constitute an important source of dielectrons in the LMR (hadronic cocktail). The presented analysis aims to reconstruct neutral mesons using conversion ($\\pi^0/\\eta \\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow (e^+e^-)+(e^+e^-)$ or $\\pi^0/\\eta \\rightarrow e^+e^-\\gamma \\rightarrow e^+e^-+(e^+e^-)$) inside the target or in first detector layers in order to provide an independent measurement of the respective multiplicities needed to constrain the hadronic cocktail with sufficient precision. Proper counting of these mesons requires an exact description of the combinatorial background below $\\pi^0/\\eta$ invariant mass peaks, which is achieved using the event mixing technique.\r\n\r\nThe poster will present first results from the conversion based analysis of $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ multiplicities using the new HADES data set obtained for Ag+Ag at 1.58$A$ GeV collisions in spring this year.

We study the interplay between the shower history for different evolution variables and the phase space affected by parton energy loss. In particular, we implement effects of jet quenching in the dense and dilute medium limits, and highlight the role of color coherence effects [1,2]. We compare the results of the different evolutions to existing Monte Carlo shower implementations on the parton level by analyzing primary and secondary Lund planes. Finally, we study the sensitivity of quenched jets to the choice of evolution variable by confronting our results for certain key observables, such as the inclusive jet spectrum, the (groomed) momentum sharing fraction or the jet mass, against theoretical expectations and experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] D.

Highly efficient registration of such short-lived products of nuclear interactions using vertex silicon detectors will play a key role in the analysis of the possible onset of deconfinement in nuclear matter. \r\n     An Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) is under design by the emerging MPD ITS collaboration in Dubna and Wuhan. The ultra-light carbon fiber structure carries five layers of CMOS ALPIDE sensors  recently elaborated by the ALICE collaboration. The two layers of the Outer Barrel (OB) are built out of 42 staves developed for the new ALICE ITS to be installed at CERN next year. The MPD ITS mainframe mechanics and the OB installation is planned to be completed in 2023. The Inner Barrel (IB) will  use novel MAPS sensors of enlarged area and reduced thickness to be developed together with the ALICE collaboration within 2020-2025 and installed after the reduction of the diameter of the MPD beam pipe to optimal value of 38 mm will become possible.

      "Abstract": "One of the important goals of heavy-ion collision experiments is to test the predictions of Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD). One such QCD prediction is the formation of Quark-Gluon Plasma(QGP) in the heavy-ion collision experiments. Quarkonia suppression has been suggested as a sign of formation of QGP in heavy ion collision, where it could exist as a transient state. We have developed a model to predict the suppression of quarkonia in QGP. It incorporates quarkonia production and suppression due to hot nuclear matter effects like color screening, collisional damping, gluonic dissociation and cold nuclear matter effect namely, nuclear shadowing. We have considered the possibility of regeneration of quarkonia due to correlated/uncorrelated quark and anti-quark pair in QGP medium. Since our model had employed Bjorken's (1+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics, we were restricted to predict suppression at mid-rapidity only. A complete rapidity dependence of suppression was also missing in our previous work. Both of these shortcomings are taken care by switching to (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics using MUSIC, a C++ code. MUSIC uses Kurganov-Tadmor algorithm to solve hydrodynamic conservation equations. In the present work, we compare the bottomonium suppression calculated by using our current (3+1)-dimensional expansion based model with the experimentally measured suppression, $R_{AA}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity.",

      "Abstract": "The system created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions quickly reaches local equilibrium and its evolution is usually modeled with relativistic hydrodynamics. However, the effects of the early, pre-equilibrium stages of system evolution on final-state observables are largely unknown. In this work, we study the effects of pre-hydrodynamic evolution on final-state observables in various heavy-ion collision systems. We employ state-of-the art hydrodynamic simulations coupled to different pre-hydrodynamical scenarios, including Kompost, a recently-developed effective kinetic transport theory evolution model. We find that the addition of a pre-equilibrium stage can have a significant effect on the development of transverse momentum, but only a small effect on flow and fluctuations, even differentially in transverse momentum. These results impose constraints on the way in which the initial particle production immediately after the initial hard scattering is connected to the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the system.",

      "Abstract": "A Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is a good candidate as the main tracking device for many experiments. \r\nA TPC measures space points of charged tracks, which provide momentum resolution and particle identification for a variety of measurements. \r\nIn high multiplicity environments a TPC has to cope with the build-up of space charge in the drift volume which is created by two major effects; primary ionization and Ion Back Flow (IBF) from an amplification device.\r\nPrimary ionization is inevitable and one concentrates on combating IBF. Traditionally, this is accomplished with a temporarily powered gating grid which absorbs all charge carriers. However, this limits the operation of a TPC to very limited readout rates. To overcome this limit micropattern gas detectors (MPGD) will be implemented in future TPCs. MPGDs are inherently capable to reduce IBF yet not at an optimum level. A passive or statically powered gating grid might optimize the IBF reduction.\r\nWe have simulated woven wire meshes, different patterns of etched meshes, hexagonal micropattern meshes and static bi-polar wire gating grids. We have studied several options to achieve good electron transparency for the primary electrons and high blocking for the ions coming from the amplification stage. In this presentation, we will discuss the results and provide conclusions for overcoming IBF.",

The cumulants of conserved quantities (net-charge, net-baryon number, net-strangeness) are directly related to the quark number susceptibilities calculated with lattice QCD.

      "Abstract": "Ideal Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model is a well-known tool to describe hadron multiplicities in relativistic nuclear collisions and for modelling hadronic equation of state. The model relies on the assumption that all hadronic resonances are free particles, which is valid, given that their decay widths are negligible. However, when the temperature is close to the crossover region, the model does not agree with lattice QCD data for observables like second order charge susceptibility ($\\chi^2_Q$), the difference between second and fourth order baryon susceptibility ($\\chi^2_B -\\chi^4_B$) and the baryon-strange correlator ($C_{BS}$). Interaction among constituent hadrons is expected to affect these observables. We have implemented interactions among hadrons in the HRG model using $S$-matrix framework. The elements of $S$-matrix are related to the two body scattering phase shifts of interacting hadrons. The positive phase shifts, related to attractive interactions are calculated using $K$-matrix formalism while the negative phase shift, related to repulsive interactions are obtained from experimentally measured phase shifts. We observe a good agreement between results from our $S$-matrix formalism and lattice QCD data for the aforementioned higher order susceptibilities along with bulk properties like the speed of sound and interaction measure etc. Further, we use the $S$-matrix formalism to calculate the temperature ($T$) and baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) dependence of transport coefficients (shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, heat conductivity and diffusion coefficient) for the multi-component system of hadrons. Our calculation predicts lower values of shear viscosity coefficient as a function of temperature as compared to previous results in the literature.",

      "Abstract": "At low temperature and low density, the chiral symmetry is broken dynamically to form hadronic phase. While, at high temperature and/or high density, this symmetry is restored and consequently the quark gluon plasma (QGP) appears. In the QCD phase diagram with temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$, it is established from first-principle calculations that the transition from hadronic matter to the QGP is crossover at $\\mu_B = 0$. On the other hand, in the finite density region ($\\mu_B > 0$), the equation of state is still unknown due to the difficulty in the first-principle calculations, namely, the sign problem. Nevertheless, some effective models predict the existence of a critical point connected with a first-order phase transition line [1]. The precise position of the point is still unknown.\r\nIn this study, we construct a model of the equation of state in the entire phase space with a critical point which is connected with a first-order phase transition line by smoothly connecting several equations of state. By making use of the fact that the critical phenomena of QCD and the 3D Ising model belong to the same universality class [2], we construct an equation of state near the critical point [3]. The bag model is used in the high temperature and high density region, the lattice QCD calculation in the high temperature and low density region, the hadron resonance gas model with mean field potential in the low temperature and low density region, and the three-dimensional Ising model near the critical point. The model is designed to place the critical point at any position in the QCD phase diagram so that one can utilize it in the hydrodynamic model of nuclear collisions for critical point search. We discuss the relationship between the position of the critical point and the collision energy using the constructed equation of state.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Asakawa and K. Yazaki, Nucl. Phys.

Elliptic flow in ultra-central collisions is driven mainly by fluctuations rather than collision geometry. Therefore, magnitudes of elliptic flow and triangular flow coefficients are almost identical. Some hydrodynamic models, which have been successful in describing non-central data, fail to reproduce elliptic flow and triangular flow coefficients simultaneously in ultra-central collisions. We try to resolve the issue by investigating effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on anisotropic flow coefficients in ultra-central collisions.\r\nWe employ an integrated dynamical model [1] to describe the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy. Here, we introduce hydrodynamic fluctuations into relativistic hydrodynamic model through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [2]. Hydrodynamic fluctuations are thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution. Since anisotropic flow is driven mainly by fluctuations in ultra-central collisions, hydrodynamic fluctuations play an important role in understanding their coefficients. The gap between magnitudes of elliptic flow and triangular flow is expected to decrease because hydrodynamic fluctuations enhance higher order flow coefficients more effectively. Setting impact parameter to be vanished to remove geometric effects, we first compare the results with hydrodynamic fluctuations and without them. Next, we analyze the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on azimuthal flow in ultra-central collisions. We also analyze the correlation between initial transverse eccentricity $\\varepsilon_n$ and final anisotropic flow $v_n$ in ultra-central collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] T. Hirano et al., Prog. Part. Nucl.

Therefore, they experience the full evolution of hot and dense QCD matter in which quarks and gluons are de-confined (Quark-Gluon Plasma, QGP) created by such collisions, and can be an effective probe to study the QGP properties. In particular, while traversing the medium, partons can loose energy via both collisional and radiative processes, and in-medium parton energy loss is expected to depend on the parton color charge and mass. Since beauty quarks are heavier than charm quarks, the mass dependence of the in-medium parton energy loss can be studied by the comparison between nuclear modification factors ($\\it{R}_{\\rm{AA}}$) of charm and beauty hadrons. \r\nIn the ALICE experiment, beauty production is studied by means of non-prompt D mesons and electrons from beauty-hadron decays at mid-rapidity.

      "Abstract": "In this talk, I will present a new procedure for dynamically generating conserved charges (baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge) to supplement an arbitrary initial condition for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.  This algorithm, which we denote ICCING (Initial Conserved Charges in Nuclear Geometries), treats an initial distribution of energy density as if it were composed entirely of gluons.  It then samples the probabilities for a gluon to split into a quark-antiquark pair, which we have calculated in the color-glass condensate framework, to redistribute this energy density in space along with the conserved charges carried only by quarks.  In this way, we provide a new tool to the community which can be incorporated into any initial-condition framework to initialize the conserved charges.  Interestingly, we find that the quark flavors couple differently to the collision geometry: up and down quarks are produced by the bulk event geometry, while strange and charm quarks are preferentially produced from hot spots.  As such, different quark flavors can possess significantly different eccentricities which drive the ensuing flavor-dependent flow response.",

In particular, there are hints of suppression of the $\\rm K^{*}(892)^{\\rm 0}$/$\\rm K$ ratio with increasing charged-particle multiplicity. A study of $\\rm K^{*}(892)^{\\rm \\pm}$ production can provide further evidence to confirm the observed trend.\r\nIn this poster the measurement of $\\rm K^{*\\rm \\pm}$ production at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at 13 TeV as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity will be presented and discussed.

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions produce asymmetric pressure gradients which convert via interactions the initial spatial asymmetry into an anisotropy in final state momentum space, a phenomenon referred to as anisotropic flow. Anisotropic flow is characterized using the harmonic coefficients $v_{\\rm n}$ in a Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles relative to the symmetry plane in a collision. It is found that flow fluctuates event-by-event due to fluctuations in the initial geometry, which allows for an efficient selection of events that correspond to a specific initial geometry. This technique, called Event Shape Engineering, was applied to select events within the same centrality but having very different values of the elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow coefficients. For those events, we present results on centrality, transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$)&nbsp;and event-shape dependence of anisotropic flow for inclusive and identified ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, ${\\rm p}+\\overline{\\rm p}$, $\\Lambda + \\overline{\\Lambda}$, $\\rm K^{0}_{\\rm S}$, $\\Xi^{-} + \\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$, and $\\Omega^{-} + \\overline{\\Omega}^{+}$) particles in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV recorded by the ALICE detector in 2015 and 2018.

We work beyond the collinear rescattering expansion and the soft gluon emission limit, and derive a closed formula for the medium-induced single gluon emission spectrum from a heavy or light quark jet interacting with the dense nuclear medium via transverse and longitudinal scatterings. Without performing the collinear rescattering expansion, the medium-induced gluon emission spectrum is controlled by the full distribution of the differential elastic scattering rates between the propagating partons and the medium constituents. We then use two different models, heavy static scattering centers and the effective HTL dynamical medium, to characterize the traversed nuclear matter. If one utilizes heavy static scattering centers and takes the soft gluon emission limit, our result can reduce to the first order in opacity Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formula (with zero mass for radiated gluon). If we take the effective HTL spectral functions for the exchanged gluon field correlation, our result with similar approximations can reduce to Djordjevic-Heinz formula for medium-induced gluon emission in dynamical QCD medium (with zero thermal mass for radiated gluon).\r\n\r\n[1] Le Zhang, De-Fu Hou, Guang-You Qin, arXiv:1812.11048 [hep-ph].\r\n[2] Le Zhang, De-Fu Hou, Guang-You Qin, Phys.Rev.

One basic observable that needs to be understood before assessing more complex correlations and fluctuations is the rapidity distribution of net protons, that determines the net baryon density of the system. \r\nThe stopping dynamics of baryons is still lacking a quantitative understanding from the theory side. Here, we implement a string model for the description of hadronic interactions within a newly developed transport approach, SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons). The free parameters of the string model are determined by comparing to experimental measurements in elementary proton-proton collisions. With the adjusted parameters, we advance to heavy ion collisions, where the experimentally observed change of the shape of the net proton rapidity spectrum from a single peak structure to a double peak structure with increasing beam energy is reproduced.\r\nBy adjusting details of the formation process of string fragments, a good agreement with the measured rapidity spectra of protons and pions is achieved while insights on the fragmentation process are obtained.\r\nWithin the presented framework, dynamic 3-dimensional event-by-event initial conditions for hydrodynamic calculations can be provided.",

      "Abstract": "One of the important results of the LHC Run 1 was the observation of an enhanced production of strange particles in high multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions at 7 and 5.02 TeV, respectively. A smooth evolution of yields of strange particles relative to the non-strange ones with event multiplicity has been observed in those systems. Results from Run 2 at the top LHC energy allows us to improve previous measurements by exploiting a dedicated high multiplicity trigger. This offers the unique opportunity to study, in elementary collisions, the multiplicity range covered by semi-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. We present the latest results obtained with ALICE on the multiplicity-dependent strangeness production. The strangeness enhancement is investigated by measuring the evolution with multiplicity of single-strange and multi-strange baryon production relative to non-strange particles. In addition recent measurements of mesonic and baryonic resonances in small collision systems are shown. We investigate the system size dependence in different collision systems as well as lower collision energies to study how the hadronic scattering processes affect measured resonance yields, as well as the interplay between canonical suppression and strangeness enhancement. The measurement of the $\\phi$(1020) meson as a function of multiplicity provides crucial constraints in this context. Energy and system-type invariance are discussed and an extensive comparison with statistical hadronization and QCD-inspired models are presented.",

      "Abstract": "The validity of the Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM) has been successfully tested to adequately reproduce hadronic particle abundances over nine orders of magnitude in high energy collisions of heavy ions.  Assuming a thermally equilibrated system, experimental particle yields at RHIC and the LHC serve as an anchor for the determination of common freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram -- namely, the baryo-chemical potential ($\\mu_B$) and the chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{ch}$) -- via thermal fits in the SHM framework.  A point of interest arises when comparing the extracted freeze-out parameters obtained using different sets of particles in the thermal fit;  namely, the $T_{ch}$ differences between the light hadrons and the strange hadrons.  In this talk, I will show recent calculations of the freeze-out parameters using STAR and ALICE particle yields measured at collision energies ranging from 7.7 GeV to 7 TeV.  Employing the Grand Canonical approach within the framework of the Thermal-FIST HRG model package, I will show evidence for a flavor-dependent freeze-out in the QCD crossover region and compare our findings with lattice calculations.  Lastly, I will compare the quality of the extrapolated fits using various treatments of strangeness conservation under different freeze-out conditions.  I will focus on system size dependence by applying the same approach to pp and pPb collisions and show that the statistical hadronization approach is applicable to small systems and that flavor dependencies in the freeze-out parameters lead to a natural explanation of strangeness enhancement from small to large systems.",

We present here measurements of two particle azimuthal correlation with neutral pion$(\\pi^0)$, neutral kaon$(k^0)$ and proton as trigger particles having the highest transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and associated charged hadrons of transverse momentum $(p_{T}) >$ 0.5 in an event on the basis of the difference in azimuthal angle  ($\\Delta \\phi$) and pseudorapidity ($\\Delta \\eta$) at midrapidity in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the pQCD inspired model PYTHIA8. Multiplicity dependent study of these measurements can explain the production and hadronization of particles at different multiplicities. In order to explain the collective behavior of the medium formed, we can use this analysis. Mixed event technique is used to obtain the pure correlation distribution and afterward, the per-trigger yields are extracted on the near side ($ |\\Delta \\phi| < 0.7$) as well as on the away side ($ |\\Delta \\phi - \\pi|<1.1$). The modification in the per-trigger yields is given by a factor $I_{AA}$ which is the ratio of near-side to away-side yields. The collectivity of the medium is explained by the Fourier coefficient ($v_{2}$) extracted from the two particles angular correlation function. This explains the collective motion of the particles. The mass dependency of particles and the behavior of mean transverse momentum ($\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$) as a function of charged-particle multiplicity is presented.",

Theoretically, many works have however been conducted assuming infinite nuclear matter [4-5], which is not realistic from an experimental point of view. To relate theoretical predictions with experimental observables, a thorough understanding of the actual reaction, in which the $\\phi$ meson is produced in a nucleus, is required. For the past E325 experiment at KEK [1] and the future E16 experiment at J-PARC [3], this is a pA reaction with initial proton energies between 10 and 30 GeV. To simulate such a reaction, we make use of the PHSD transport approach, which is based on a covariant microscopic transport model [6]. In this framework, the $\\phi$ meson spectral function obtained theoretically as a function of density, can be used as an input, while the output of the simulation can be compared with experimentally observed dilepton spectrum. \r\nIn this presentation, I will give an overview of first results obtained in simulations of the p-Cu reactions probed at the E325 experiment at KEK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] R.

      "Abstract": "In this talk a pair of observables are proposed as alternative ways to study the charge separation induced by Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in relativistic heavy ion collisions. They are, the out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of fluctuation of the difference between signed balance functions measured in pairs rest frame, and the ratio of it to similar measurement made in the laboratory frame. Both observables have been studied with simulations including flow-related backgrounds, and for the first time, backgrounds that are related to resonance’s global spin alignment. The two observables have similar positive responses to signal, and opposite, limited responses to identifiable backgrounds arising from resonance flow and spin alignment. Both observables have also been tested with two realistic models, namely, a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model and anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (AVFD) model. These two observables, when cross examined, will provide useful insights in the study of CME-induced charge separation.\r\n( https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04622)",

      "Abstract": "Correlation femtoscopy is a standard technique for the experimental analysis of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. The measured two-particle correlation function is clearly non-Gaussian, and so it is often better reproduced by Levy stable distribution than a Gaussian one. It has been suggested that a particular shape of a Levy-stable distribution may help to identify the QCD critical endpoint. In order to set up a baseline for this statement, we show that there are non-critical effects that may influence its shape as well. By making use of two independent models (hydrodynamical simulation and a blast wave parametrisation) we estimate how much the individual effects modify the shape. We show that the Levy index may deviate considerably from 2 due to effects such as non-spherical shape, resonance decays, event-by-event fluctuations and functional dependence on $q_{inv}$ and/or $q_{lcms}$.",

      "Abstract": "The presence of coherence in pion emission will suppress the strength of the final-state pion HBT correlations. The recently observed significant pion HBT suppressions in both Pb-Pb and pp collisions at the LHC indicate the pion emissions may be partially coherent in such violent collisions. In this talk we will show that the coherence in particle emission can give rise to a remarkable long-range azimuthal correlation.\r\n\r\n  In Ref [1], we study the pion transverse-momentum spectrum and elliptic anisotropy of an expanding coherent source with a classical current radiation model. It is found that the elliptic anisotropy of coherent emission is connected to the source initial geometry through an *interference* effect but is *not* sensitive to the source expansion (flow effect). We further construct a partially coherent source by adding an incoherent emission component described by a viscous hydrodynamic model. The partially coherent source model can successfully reproduce the experimental data on the pion $p_T$ spectrum, $v_2(p_T)$ as well as 4-pion HBT correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.\r\n\r\n  Furthermore, we focus on the coherence phenomena in pp collisions in Ref [2]. We extend the coherent pion source by incorporating a Bjorken longitudinal expansion and study the long-range two-particle angular correlations. A “*ridge*” structure is found to arise from the interferences in coherent emission and to be largely related to the source transverse shape and size at the initial time. From the 2-pion HBT measurement at the LHC, we extract a coherent fraction *increasing* with the charged-particle multiplicity, as an input of a partially coherent pion emission model, and the calculations suggest a more pronounced ridge effect from the coherent pion emission in high-multiplicity pp collisions.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Peng Ru, G.

      "Abstract": "At the early stage of heavy ion collisions, non-trivial topologies of the gauge fields can be created resulting in an imbalance of axial charge density and eventually separation of electric charges along the direction of the magnetic field produced in such collisions. This process is called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). In this work we implement such a charge separation at the partonic level in AMPT for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV to study its consequence on experimental observables. We present the effects on the pion elliptic flow ($v_2$) and the charged particle balance function (BF) for varying strengths of initial charge separation. We find that the shape of the balance function is sensitive to the increasing charge separation. $v_2$ of pion shows a strong decreasing trend at higher transverse momenta ($p_T$) with increasing charge separation. Charge balance functions show a peak at $\\Delta\\phi \\sim 180 $ with charge separation implemented in the partonic level as expected for the parity violation. We have also calculated parity observable $\\gamma$ in the form of BF's moments. $\\gamma$ shows a decreasing trend with charge separation. It has a negative value for charge separation produced by flipping more than 30 $\\%$ of quarks in the parton level. We also notice that $<\\gamma>$ for the same charge correlation and the opposite charge correlation shows negative and positive values, respectively.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are believed to be produced predominately in hard scattering processes at early stage of the collisions before the QGP production so they can pass through the hot-dense medium completely, and their production yields can be calculated by perturbative-QCD, which makes them ideal probes for QGP. According to the theoretical prediction, energy loss of heavy quarks is less than that of light quarks due to the suppression of the gluon radiation angle by the quark mass. Heavy quarks could be more difficult to be thermalized than light quarks in the hot-dense medium and moved following the collective flow during the expansion of the partonic matter. Because of its three times larger mass compared with that of charm, beauty could have different properties in terms of its interactions with QGP medium from charm.\r\n\r\nWe develop a data-driven method to isolate charm and beauty contributions from the inclusive heavy flavor electrons based on the most recent open charm hadron measurements in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC. The individual electron nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) from charm and beauty decays will be reported. Model comparisons and discussions will also be given.",

      "Abstract": "“Hybrid Hadronization” is a new Monte Carlo package to hadronize systems of partons. It smoothly combines quark recombination applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems, following the picture outlined by Han et al. [PRC 93, 045207 (2016)]. Hybrid Hadronization integrates with PYTHIA 8 and can be applied to a variety of systems from $e^++e^-$ to A+A collisions. It takes systems of partons and their color flow information, for example from a Monte Carlo parton shower genera-tor, as input. In addition, if for A+A collisions a thermal background me-dium is provided, the package allows to sample thermal partons that con-tribute to hadronization. Hybrid Hadronization is available for use as a standalone code and is also part of the JETSCAPE 2.0 release.\r\nIn this presentation we review the physics concepts underlying Hybrid Hadronization and how users can use the code with parton shower Monte Carlos. We demonstrate how Hybrid Hadronization affects multiplicities, hadron chemistry, fragmentation functions and jet shapes in $e^++e^-$, p+p and A+A collisions when combined with different parton shower Monte Carlos using PYTHIA 6, PYTHIA 8 and JETSCAPE/MATTER. We compare to calculations using pure Lund string fragmentation as well as to data from LEP, RHIC and LHC. In particular we demonstrate observable effects of the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons. As a benchmark we compare to pure PYTHIA 8 string fragmentation and to data.",

      "Abstract": "We study the evolution of jetty and underlying parts of the transverse momentum spectra as a function of multiplicity in pp 13 TeV collisions at midrapidity (|eta|<0.8) using pythia8 event generator. We observe that beyond a multiplicity of dN/deta ~ 40 the maximum reachable leading transverse momentum gets smaller and at the same time the slope of the spectra both in the jetty and underlying parts show a continuous rise. At high multiplicity (>70) a rise in pT spectra at very low momenta (~ 1GeV/c) is also observed. We interpret this as a possible  loss of the momentum at a certain particle/energy density in pp collisions. \r\n\r\nThe similarity in the behavior of transverse momentum spectra in Pb-Pb and pp collisions (shown in  arXiv:1805.04572v2) indicate that the same mechanism could be responsible for the parton energy loss in heavy ions collisions. Although the behaviour of the spectra at low momenta are usually explained by hydro flow mechanisms, we demonstrate that with the present mechanism the low momentum features are perfectly explained by the overall hardening of the spectra. The saturation of the sum of the transverse momenta with multiplicity gives strong base to our observations.\r\n\r\nWe will present the results obtained with Pythia8 using different multiplicity estimators (central multiplicity estimator and the one based on the multiplicity in the transverse side) for different pseudorapidity ranges.",

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a strongly interacting medium known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is produced.  Quarks and gluons from incoming nuclei collide to produce partons at high momenta early in the collisions.  By fragmenting into collimated sprays of hadrons, these partons form `jets'.  The resulting jets, which in vacuum are well understood within the framework of perturbative QCD, are attenuated by medium interactions, a process known as jet quenching.  The jet shape variable, $\\rho(\\Delta r)$, reveals the radial profile of transverse momentum distribution inside the jet.  By measuring the modifications of the jet shape, properties of the QGP at different length scales can be studied.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, the differential jet shape for full (charged + neutral) jets in mid-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV with the STAR experiment at RHIC will be presented and compared to a baseline p+p measurement.  As the first measurement of its kind at RHIC energies, this work will extend the kinematic range offered at the LHC to lower $\\it{p}_{T}$ and demonstrate whether there is a modification and a broadening of the jet profile at RHIC energies.  The jet shape measurement is extended to include an event plane (defined by the beam direction and the vector of the impact parameter) dependence to study the path length dependence of medium modifications to the jets and their associated hadrons.  To further explore how the substructure of jets are modified in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions, the dependence on centrality and jet size ($R$) will be investigated.",

Photons are measured in the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) and reconstructed as EMCal clusters. Higher-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ neutral mesons decay into photons with a small opening angle, which can produce a single cluster with both photons when the photon showers overlap; this starts to happen for neutral pions at around 6 GeV/$c$, for example. A deep neural network is trained to distinguish between clusters containing one or two photons. Thus the energy distribution in the cluster (the ``shower shape'') can be encoded with the output of this deep neural network as well as with a geometric variable. The shower shape distribution of isolated clusters in the data can then be fit to two templates. The purity can then be extracted from the result of the template fit and is used in the isolated photon correlation measurements. This poster will present the details and results of calculating the photon purity with a template fit procedure using both the deep neural network and the geometric variable in multiple collision systems. The photons are measured in a $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range (12--60 GeV/$c$) that provides access to a regime in which the largest modifications due to the QGP are expected and which is thus far unexplored. However, this $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ range is technically challenging due to the large number of neutral mesons produced relative to prompt photons.",

In particular, the baryonic resonance $\\Lambda(1520)$ is important because of its lifetime ($\\tau \\sim$ 12.6 fm/$\\it c$), which lies in between the lifetimes of $ K^*$ and $\\phi$ resonances. \r\nIts study will indicate the dominance of re-scattering or regeneration in the yields and support results obtained for other resonances having different lifetimes. The reconstruction of $\\Lambda(1520)$ as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV has been performed via its hadronic decay channel. New measurements of the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) spectra, $p_{\\rm{T}}$-integrated yield ($\\langle dN/dy\\rangle$), $\\langle p_{\\rm{T}}\\rangle$  and $\\Lambda(1520)/ \\Lambda$ yield ratio in different multiplicity classes will be presented and discussed. The results obtained are expected to provide more information on strange resonance production and the system-size evolution of the hadronic phase in small systems. Furthermore, these results are important for studies of the multiplicity-dependent enhancement of multi-strange hadrons in small systems.",

      "Abstract": "The Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a state of matter at extremely high energy density, where the quark and gluon constituents of nucleons become deconfined. Although there is strong evidence at RHIC and the LHC that the QGP is created in A+A collisions, it was initially assumed to be absent in smaller systems, such as p+p and p+A collisions. However, the observation of flow-like correlations in such collisions at the LHC and RHIC has made the existence of the QGP in small systems an open question. High momentum partons produced at early stages of heavy ion collisions generate collimated sprays of hadrons called \\textit{jets}. These partons lose energy when passing through the medium. This effect, usually referred to as \\textit{jet quenching}, is well established as a probe of the existence and properties of the QGP.\r\n\r\nIn this analysis, we aim to investigate p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV at STAR for possible evidence of jet quenching by studying the binary-scaled inclusive jet yield. Measurements for both full (charged + neutral) and charged jets will be presented. We will present preliminary results on jet spectra along with our analysis process, and compare the jet yields in different backward (Au-going direction) event activity bins. Progress on our simulation procedures will be shown, including the Glauber model calculation and detector response simulations. Progress towards the resultant nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{pAu}}$, after we scale with the average number of binary nucleon collisions from the Glauber model calculation, will also be discussed.",

In the present study, we incorporate for the first time this mechanism in a transport model that is based on the chiral kinetic equations. For a system of rotating and unpolarized quarks in a box, we find that the side-jump mechanism can dynamically generate the spin polarization of quarks with its final value consistent with that of massless quarks in thermal equilibrium in a self-consistent nonzero vorticity field. The total angular momentum of the system is also seen to be conserved during the evolution of the system. We further employ this angular momentum conserved chiral transport model to study the spin polarizations of quarks in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Besides the global polarization of massless quarks, results from this model can also help understand the puzzles in the local spin polarizations measured in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider [2]. \r\n[1]J.-Y.

It also captures the qualitative features of bremsstrahlung in a finite-size and expanding medium.\r\nThe model with these features makes possible a more reliable space-time description of jet propagation in the quark-gluon plasma.\r\n\r\nIn a finite brick medium, early time splittings receive larger transverse-momentum broadening than those received by later time splittings. \r\nTo study such relation between momentum broadening and locations of splitting vertices in an event-by-event fluctuating and expanding medium,  we look into the transport evolution history after calibrating the model to inclusive jet $R_{AA}$.\r\nWe demonstrate that the early/high-temperature regions of the medium can be probed by large-angle splittings, while small angle splittings are favorably produced at later times of the evolution.\r\nWe discuss how measurable quantities in jet experiments can help probe different space-time regions of the medium evolution.",

Recent STAR measurements indicate that in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 200 GeV $D^{0}$ mesons develop large $v_{2}$ similarly as light-favor hadrons, implying that charm quarks interact strongly with the thermalized medium at the top RHIC energy. Interestingly, at lower collision energies the electrons from heavy-flavor decays seem to exhibit much lower $v_{2}$, unlike the light-flavor hadrons. However, the precision of the previous results from STAR at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 62.4 and 39 GeV did not allow for firm conclusions.\r\n\r\nThanks to the large data samples recorded by STAR in 2017 and 2018, we are now able to perform more precise measurements of the elliptic flow of electrons from heavy-flavor decays in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}= 54.4$  and $27$ GeV, respectively. The data sample size for each energy is more than 10 times higher than that of $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}= 62.4$ GeV taken in 2010.

Because the magnetic field direction is more strongly correlated with $\\Psi_{2}^{SP}$ than with $\\Psi_{2}$, $\\textbf{the relative difference of the chiral magnetic effect observable with respect to}$ $\\Psi_{2}^{SP}$ $\\textbf{is expected to}$ $\\\\$ $\\textbf{be able to reflect much cleaner information about the CME with less influences of deformation}$[1].\r\n\r\nWhat is more, with the presence of magnetic field, the coupling of the vector and axial currents induced by the chiral anomaly can motivate a collective gapless excitation in QGP, i.e. CMW. The CMW can lead to an electric quadrupole moment in relativistic heavy-ion collision, which explains the observed charge-dependent elliptic flow of pions. In our study, a dipolar distribution of $\\bf E \\cdot B$ is observed at the non-central collisions in Au+Au collisions at the RHIC energy $\\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV. More importantly, we find that the coupling of the dipole QED anomaly and magnetic field $\\bf B$ can also induce an electric quadrupole moment which can further lead to the difference in elliptic flows between positive charged particles and negative charged particles through final interactions. The centrality dependence of the density of $\\bf E \\cdot B$ is similar to the trend of the slope parameter $r$ measured from the difference in elliptic flows between positive pions and negative pions by the STAR collaboration. Therefore, $\\textbf{the novel mechanism for electric quadrupole moment generation can offer a new}$ $\\textbf{interpretation of the observed charge-dependent elliptic flow of pions, but without the}$ $\\textbf{formation}$ $\\\\$ $\\textbf{of CMW}$[2].\r\n\r\n[1] X.

It is designed to measure up to 1000 charged particles in A+A collisions between 0.1 and 10 MHz interaction rate, to achieve a momentum resolution in a 1 Tm dipole magnetic field of better than 2%, and to be capable of identifying complex particle decays topologies, e.g., such with strangeness content. The STS employs high-granularity double-sided silicon strip sensors matching the non-uniform track density, and fast self-triggering electronics with a free streaming data acquisition system and online event selection. With the resulting 1.8 million readout channels, it poses the most demanding requirements regarding bandwidth and density of all CBM detectors.\r\nIn the context of FAIR phase 0, the mini-CBM (mCBM) project aims to prove the concept of free-streaming data generation, transport and reconstruction, as well as to provide a test setup for all CBM subsystems using the existing GSI/FAIR accelerator facilities. The STS deployed a demonstrator of one small tracking station with full readout chain. The prototype, called mSTS, has been operated in Ag+Au collisions at energies above 1.59 AGeV and overall interaction rates up to 40 MHz, which is similar to a realistic experimental scenario. This allows evaluating the detector performance integrated with other subsystems into a free-streaming DAQ. This presentation aims to describe the main technical challenges and prospects for the STS and to summarize the results of the latest test campaign.",

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia suppression has been long predicted \\cite{satz19861} and explored as a defining signature of formation of quark-gluon-plasma (QGP). Various physical processes \\cite{satz19861,laine20071,brambilla20081} have been understood to contribute to the dynamics of a Q-$\\bar{Q}$ traversing through the QGP. The proper framework to implement a Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, which takes into account the dynamical nature of the above problem, is treating the system as an open quantum system \\cite{akamatsu20121,akamatsu20151}. \r\n \r\nIn our calculation, we implement a stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation which describes the evolution of the Q-$\\bar{Q}$ pair starting from a pure state.\r\nIn the first part, we start with an extension of the results obtained in \\cite{akamatsu20181} by extending the calculation to three-dimensional case and including the full-color structure of a Q-$\\bar{Q}$ pair (including color-octet states as well). We do so by expanding the equations obtained in \\cite{akamatsu20151} in small $\\vec{r}$ limit. This is not an ad hoc approximation but is rather motivated by the idea of effective-field-theory (EFT) methods, such as pNRQCD \\cite{brambilla20081}. Further, in a simple calculation, we check how much of an error small `$\\vec{r}$' expansion brings. This is an example of a Markovian process as shown in \\cite{akamatsu20151}. This formalism does not include on-shell gluon emission or absorption.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the calculation is a dynamical implementation of the physical process called gluo-dissociation \\cite{brambilla20081} by the means of stochastic evolution. This necessarily involves kernels which remember correlation in time as the process occurs at a finite frequency. This is an example of a non-Markovian process. If one wants to use results from lattice (since the QGP formed at RHIC and LHC is an example of a strongly coupled system), one would like to understand the relative importance of these physical processes. We suggest that this can be done by comparing correlation functions of color electric-fields at zero and non-zero frequencies. It appears that non-Markovian dynamics will play an important role when higher-excited states are considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{satz19861}\r\nT. Matsui, H.

      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (i.e charm and beauty quarks) are effective probes to investigate the properties of the hot, dense and strongly-interacting medium, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their large masses, they are produced in the initial stages of the collision via hard partonic scatterings and hence, they experience the full evolution of the medium. The measurements of prompt  $\\rm D$-meson production in small systems like p--Pb collisions allow us to decode the Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects such as the modification of parton densities in nuclei and $k_{\\rm T}$-broadening or parton energy loss. Recent studies show that the high-multiplicity events of p--Pb collisions at the LHC exhibit unforeseen collective behaviour and the origin remains unclear. For a deeper understanding on the collective-like effects in high-multiplicity p--Pb events, the study of D-meson production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity can give further insight into the interplay between hard and soft mechanisms of particle production. Furthermore, to understand the role of initial-state geometry on the final-state observables in p--Pb collisions, a more differential study can be attempted based on the technique of Event-Shape Engineering (ESE) by selecting events of different initial geometry at similar multiplicity. The modification of production cross sections of D mesons in different shape-engineered events would strengthen our understanding of influence of initial geometry on the final state particle production mechanisms.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, the production cross sections of D mesons (${\\rm D}^{0}$, ${\\rm D}^{+}$, ${\\rm D}^{*+}$ and ${\\rm D}_{\\rm s}^{+}$) measured at mid-rapidity in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}= 5.02$ TeV with ALICE detector will be presented. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm pPb}$) for minimum bias p--Pb collisions will be shown. The results will be compared with model predictions including CNM effects. The prompt D-meson transverse momentum distributions in p--Pb collisions relative to pp collisions ($Q_{\\rm pPb}$), measured in several multiplicity/centrality classes, will also be discussed.",

      "Country": "France",
      "Abstract": "The recent detection of gravitational wave signal from binary \r\ncompact star merger has set a strong constraint on tidal defomability, \r\nwhich motivated a large amount of studies about the equation of state. \r\nBut the tidal deformability of compact star depends not only on the \r\nequation of state, but also on the spin and magnetic field of the star. \r\nIn this study, we calculated for the first time the contribution of \r\ntidal deformability from magnetic field. Both the magnetic field and \r\ntidal field act as a perturbation of a spherical star. We found that \r\nthey are independent with each other at first order because of linearity \r\nof perturbed equations, and their coupling firstly appears in the second \r\norder of perturbation. Our results show that the correction of tidal \r\ndeformability is only about 0.1% for magnetic field at surface of star \r\nis 10^15 gauss. We explored the difference of our results from neutron \r\nstar and quark star. the possibility of detection for this difference \r\nfrom magnetic field in the future gravitational wave observations are \r\nalso discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Classical and quantum Tsallis distributions have been widely used in many branches of natural sciences. But, the quantum field theory of the Tsallis distributions is relatively a less explored arena. In the article **arXiv:1906.02893v2 [hep-ph]**, we derived the expressions for the thermal two-point functions for the Tsallis statistics with the help of the corresponding statistical mechanical formulations. In the conference, we will show that the quantum Tsallis distributions used in the literature appear in the thermal part of the propagator much in the same way the Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions appear in the conventional thermal field theory. As an application of our findings, the thermal mass in the  $ \\phi^4 $ scalar field theory within the realm of the Tsallis statistics will also be discussed.  For small system like quark gluon plasma (QGP) where the application of Boltzmann-Gibbsstatistics is uncertain, the thermal field theoretic formulation developed in this work for Tsallis statistics will have crucial importance. The thermal spectral function of quarks and gluons estimated using BG and Tsallis statistics will differ (as the case for $ \\phi^4 $   interaction) which may have significant impact on the signals of QGP.",

      "Abstract": "For the discovery of the QCD critical point it is crucial to develop dynamical models of the fluctuations of the net-baryon number that can be embedded in simulations of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the implementation of net-baryon number fluctuations near the critical point in an expanding system. We include the coupling to the fluctuations of energy density and momentum flow explicitly. We study the dynamical formation of the correlation length and its relation to the critical enhancement of higher-order cumulants for boost-invariant initial conditions. By adding second order fluid dynamical relaxation equations we distinguish between the propagative and the damped critical mode contributions.",

      "Institute": "Universita e INFN Torino (IT)",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The region of the QCD phase diagram at high $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ can be accessed by fixed-target experiments working at future or existing facilities providing nuclear beams in the multi-GeV energy range. In particular, the CERN SPS is able to provide high-intensity beams over a wide energy interval ($\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 5-17 GeV) that are ideal for the study of rare signals. Recently, an expression of interest has been presented for a new experiment at the CERN SPS, NA60+, aimed at measuring hard and electromagnetic probes in nuclear collisions with unprecedented precision with an energy scan.  The physics goals of such an experiment are very broad and ambitious. On one hand, NA60+ proposes the investigation of the order of the phase transition to the QGP in the region $\\mu_{\\rm B}\\sim$ 200-400 MeV with the first measurement of a caloric curve, and the first direct measurement of $\\rho-a_1$ chiral mixing by a precision measurement of the dimuon yield in the $a_1$ mass region.\r\n\r\nThese physics topics can be addressed via the study of the dimuon continuum from threshold up to 3 GeV.  On the other hand, the study of the transport properties of the QGP close to the threshold energy for the occurrence of deconfinement can be accessed for the first time by a simultaneous precision study of hidden and open charm. The measurements of charmonium and open charm states are performed through dimuon and hadronic decays, respectively.  In this talk, the physics case of the experiment will be reviewed with a detailed discussion of the results of the physics performance studies. The talk will stress the competitiveness and complementarity of the NA60+ program in the landscape of the proposals foreseen at other facilities in the next decade.",

      "Abstract": "Previous measurements in small systems indicate that the modifications to jets relative to p+p collisions is small. However, looking at more differential measurements may reveal if any modifications do exist. In particular, we compare $\\pi^0$-hadron correlations measured with PHENIX in small systems to those observed in p+p collisions to probe any initial state effects. Several systematic uncertainties cancel when comparing the ratio of the awayside yield to the nearside yield in d+Au and $^3$He+Au systems to p+p revealing a quantifiable modification in these systems. In addition, $p_{out}$ distributions for the p+A collisions is measured. An increasing trend in the width of the $p_{out}$ distributions in p+Al and p+Au compared to p+p is observed as a function of $N_{coll}$. The potential implications of these measurements in conjunction with the PHENIX results for reconstructed jets in small systems will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "We explore the perspectives of machine learning techniques in the context of quantum field theories. In particular, we discuss two-dimensional complex scalar field theory at nonzero temperature and chemical potential – a theory with a nontrivial phase diagram. A neural network is successfully trained to recognize the different phases of this system and to predict the value of various observables, based on the field configurations. We analyze a broad range of chemical potentials and find that the network is robust and able to recognize patterns far away from the point where it was trained. Aside from the regressive analysis, which belongs to supervised learning, an unsupervised generative network is proposed to produce new quantum field configurations that follow a specific\r\ndistribution. An implicit local constraint fulfilled by the physical configurations was found to be automatically captured by our generative model. We elaborate on potential uses of such a generative approach for sampling outside the training region.",

We study the Lifshitz Regime using both a large N expansion and using numerical simulations at small N.  Experimentally, we contrast the fluctuations in net proton number when one injects momenta from a condensate at zero momentum, near a CEP, to that at non-zero momentum, in a Lifshitz Regime. This is done using a hydrodynamic code, including especially the effect of the rapid expansion of the local rest frame of the medium.",

A MAPS-based vertex detector upgrade to sPHENIX, the MVTX, will provide a precise determination of the impact parameter of tracks relative to the primary vertex in high multiplicity heavy ion collisions. The MVTX utilizes the latest generation of MAPS technology to provide precision tracking with high tracking efficiency over a broad momentum range in the high luminosity RHIC environment. These new capabilities will enable precision measurements of open heavy flavor observables, covering an unexplored kinematic regime at RHIC.  The physics program, its potential impact, and recent detector development of the MVTX will be discussed in this talk.",

      "Speaker": "Vladimir Skokov",
      "Institute": "Brookhaven national laboratory",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Recent lattice QCD calculations show strong indications that the chiral crossover of QCD at zero baryon chemical potential (µ) is a  remnant of the second order chiral phase transition. Furthermore,  the non-universal parameters needed to map temperature T and µ to the universal properties of the second order chiral phase transition also have been determined by lattice QCD calculations. Motivated by these observations, first, we determine the analytic structure of the partition function - the so-called Lee-Yang edge singularity - in the QCD crossover regime, solely based on universal properties. Then, utilizing the lattice calculated non-universal parameters,  we map this singularity to the real T and complex µ plane, and determine the closest singularity to µ=0 in the QCD crossover regime. These results lead to two important implications: (i) An universality based estimate of the radius of convergence for lattice QCD calculations at µ>0; (ii) Universality and lattice QCD based constraints on the location of the QCD critical point in the T-µ plane.",

      "Speaker": "Sangyong Jeon",
      "Institute": "McGill University",

      "Abstract": "We present a formulation of the initial state of heavy ion collisions that generalizes the 2+1D boost invariant IP-Glasma [1] to 3+1D through JIMWLK rapidity evolution of the pre-collision Wilson lines. The rapidity dependence introduced by the JIMWLK evolution means that 1) the system no longer trivially satisfies Gauss’ law at the initial time and 2) the form of the 2+1D initial gauge fields will give rise to nonphysical energy deposition outside of the interaction region of the colliding nuclei. To address these issues, we enforce Gauss’ law locally and modify the form of the initial gauge fields in order to accommodate non-vanishing rapidity derivatives. This makes the initial condition consistent with a non-boost invariant system, and thus allows for temporal evolution on a 3-dimensional lattice.\r\n\r\nWhile the transverse physics of QGP has been studied nearly exhaustively, the effect of longitudinal fluctuations introduced by the JIMWLK evolution has yet to be studied in detail phenomenologically. Hence, we couple our 3+1D IP-Glasma model to MUSIC+UrQMD, for completely 3+1D simulations of heavy ion collisions. Specifically, we consider Pb-Pb collisions at \\sqrt{s} = 2.76 TeV and study the rapidity dependence of the charged hadron v_n (η) via the η-dependent flow factorization ratios r_n(ηa,ηb) as measured by CMS [2], as well as the charged hadron multiplicity dN_ch /dη.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n[1] Bjoern Schenke and Soeren Schlichting. “3D glasma initial state for relativistic heavy ion collisions”.

In this presentation, the measurements of the neutral Drell-Yan (DY) process and of the W bosons are presented in pPb collision at the center of mass energy of 8.16 TeV with the CMS detector. The rapidity dependence of these processes is particularly sensitive to nPDFs, but further information can be gained by studying the mass dependence of DY production, measured for the first time in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV, down to 15 GeV. In addition, differential measurements in the dimuon $p_{\\text{T}}$ or $\\phi^{*}$ (an angular variable correlated with $p_{\\text{T}}$ measured for the first time in pPb) provide insights on soft gluon emission at low $p_{\\text{T}}$. Comparisons to theory calculations show that these data are sensitive to the presence of nuclear modifications to the parton distributions in the lead nucleus, and can help improve and constrain theoretical calculations.",

      "Abstract": "Evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions has dominantly come from the agreement of the measured yield of produced hadrons with those from statistical thermal models. Ideally for a thermalized system, in addition to mean, the higher orders of the moments of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles should also show agreement with thermal models. In this respect, studying the moments of the event-by-event distributions of conserved quantities like net-baryon, net-strangeness and net-charge number is best suited. \r\n\r\nWe have carried out a systematic study of comparing the results from a thermal hadron resonance gas model with data on higher moments of net-proton, net-kaon and net-charge distributions measured at RHIC beam energy scan program. The experimental acceptances in terms of rapidity and transverse momentum are used in the model calculations carried out for central Au+Au collisions at the centre of mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. For the first time, the hadron resonance gas model results are found to explain the measurements up to third order of moment with a common temperature and baryonic chemical potential. These calculations have tested the thermal nature of produced net-particle distributions up to third order, thereby providing evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Implications of the findings on our understanding of the phase structure of QCD matter will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "There have been various attempts to give lower limits on the location of the QCD critical endpoint via lattice simulations. These mostly rely on expanding the pressure in a Taylor series near zero chemical potential, and use estimators for the radius of convergence, mostly the ratio estimator. If the radius of convergence can be found, it gives a lower limit on the location of a true phase transition. I will give an analytic argument that shows that the ratio estimator will not converge in the generic case and explain how to obtain improved  estimators with guaranteed and faster convergence, as was described in Phys. Rev. D 99, 114510. \r\nAs a next step in this research program, we calculate these estimators for the case of Nf=2+1 flavour QCD with physical quark masses, using a stout improved staggered action, two different lattice spacings, and several volumes. On the roughest lattice spacing, we perform a full finite volume scaling study of the radius of convergence of the Taylor series. We also compare with results using an alternative algorithm that directly looks for the closest singularity of the free energy in the complex chemical potential plane, without relying on Taylor expansion coefficients.",

There are few known constraints on the nature of spectral functions at finite temperature. Computations in the weak-coupling theory, provide constraints at high momenta. Analytic continuations of lattice data otherwise have used ``zero-knowledge schemes'' such as MEM. However, any further information on the nature of spectral functions would help to guard against unknown theoretical biases.\r\n\r\nHere we apply an effective field theory (EFT) which was developed recently to examine correlators of axial currents. This is a generalization of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model applied to finite temperatures. This was parametrized to describe lattice data obtained with two flavours of light dynamical Wilson quarks.\r\n\r\nWe use this effective field theory to examine the analytic continuation of correlation functions of composite pion operators below T_c from the space-like to the time-like domain.

      "Abstract": "Recently there have been rapidly growing interests in understanding the properties and phase structures of matter under extreme fields like magnetic field or global rotation. Examples of such physical systems come from a variety of different areas, such as the hot quark-gluon plasma in peripheral heavy ion collisions, dense nuclear matter in rapidly spinning neutron stars, lattice gauge theory in rotating frame, cold atomic gases as well as certain condensed matter materials. In particular rotation has nontrivial interplay with microscopic spin degrees of freedom through the rotational polarization effect and could often induce novel phenomena. For example, there are highly nontrivial anomalous transport effects such as the chiral vortical effect and chiral vortical wave in rotating fluid with chiral fermions. A generic effect is the rotational suppression of  fermion pairing in the zero angular momentum states, which has been demonstrated for e.g. chiral phase transition and color superconductivity in the strong interaction  system (Y.~Jiang & J.~Liao, Phys. Rev. Lett. **117**, no. 19, 192302 (2016)).\r\n\r\nWe investigate the mesonic condensation in isospin matter under rotation and demonstrate two important effects of the rotation on its phase structure: a rotational suppression of the scalar-channel condensates, in particular the pion condensation region; and a rotational enhancement of the rho condensation region with vector-channel condensate. A new phase diagram for isospin matter under rotation is   mapped out on the $\\omega-\\mu_I$ plane  where three distinctive phases, corresponding to $\\sigma$, $\\pi$, $\\rho$ dominated regions respectively, are separated by a second-order line at low isospin chemical potential and a first-order line at high rotation which are further connected at  a tri-critical point.\r\n\r\nRefs: arXiv: 1812.11787; Phys.

Measurements in small systems, namely pA and proton-proton (pp), are crucial in order to interpret correctly results in heavy-ion collisions. Potential initial-state effects can be constrained through the measurement of the nuclear modification factor in pA collisions ($R_{\\rm pA}$), defined as the ratio of quarkonium yields in pA to the reference production in pp collisions, collected at the same center-of-mass energy and scaled by the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Besides serving as reference, results in pp collisions represent a benchmark test of QCD based models in both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. \r\n\r\nThe ALICE detector has unique capabilities at the LHC for measuring quarkonia down to zero transverse momentum. Measurements are carried out at both central \r\nand forward rapidity, in the dielectron and dimuon decay channel, respectively. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution the latest quarkonium measurements performed by the ALICE collaboration in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented. Recent nuclear modification factor measurements at mid-rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be shown for both prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ mesons, the latter originated from the decays of long-lived beauty-flavored hadrons. The status of mid-rapidity J/$\\psi$ analyses in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, using both minimum bias and high $p_{\\rm T}$ triggered (using ALICE TRD detector) events and including the study of non-prompt J/$\\psi$ contribution, will be also presented. In addition the centrality, rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of $R_{\\rm pPb}$ for $\\psi$(2S), $\\Upsilon$(1S) and $\\Upsilon$(2S), measured at forward rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, will be shown. Regarding pp collisions, recent J/$\\psi$ cross-section measurements at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5 and 13 TeV performed at central and forward rapidity, including the status of the analysis for the separation between prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ components at mid-rapidity, will be presented.

In large collision systems such as Pb+Pb, lower but non-zero flow coefficients at higher $p_{T}$ ($> 10$~GeV) are usually understood to reflect jet quenching, and specifically the path-length differential energy loss in elliptical events. Extending these measurements in small systems to high-$p_{T}$ particles, which are predominantly produced in jets, can thus provide crucial information on the origin of these collective phenomena. This talk presents a new measurement by ATLAS of two-particle angular correlations in 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb events with a jet trigger. An additional restriction on the associated particle positions is used to suppress the large non-flow contributions in the jet events. Measurements of the resulting single-particle second- and third-order flow coefficients are presented for charged-hadrons from $p_{T}$ = 0.5 to 50 GeV, in selections of $p$+Pb event activity. The $p_{T}$-dependent results are compared to those from minimum-bias $p$+Pb events, and the differences between the two event samples are analyzed in terms of the different origin of particles in these events, such as the different fraction of particles that arise from the jet fragmentation process.",

We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of large and small systems.   With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when  the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as expected in small systems.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.

This peak decreases in magnitude as the projectile size increases. At higher $p_T$, $R_{AB}$ is below unity and converges towards a common value. We observe a similar centrality dependence for all three systems. The $R_{AA}$ of $\\phi$ mesons has been measured at forward, backward, and central rapidities in $p$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions.

We consider ultracentral collisions of deformed ions as a testbed for these comparisons because the difference between tip-on-tip and side-on-side collisions modifies the multiplicity dependence in both scenarios, even at zero impact parameter. We find significant qualitative differences in the multiplicity dependence obtained in the initial conditions+hydrodynamics scenario and the CGC scenario, allowing these collisions of deformed ions to be used as a powerful discriminator between models. We also find that sub-nucleonic fluctuations have a systematic effect on the elliptic and triangular flow harmonics which are most discriminating in $0-1\\%$ ultracentral symmetric collisions of small deformed ions and in $0-10\\%$ $\\mathrm{d} {}^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$ collisions. The collision systems we consider are ${}^{238}\\mathrm{U} {}^{238}\\mathrm{U}$, $\\mathrm{d} {}^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$, ${}^{9}\\mathrm{Be} {}^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$, ${}^{9}\\mathrm{Be} {}^{9}\\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He} {}^{3}\\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He} {}^{197}\\mathrm{Au}$.",

      "Institute": "Fudan University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, it is well-established that geometrical shapes of the initial density distribution in transverse plane are responsible for the observed harmonic flow, through the hydrodynamic response of a set of modes. In particular, elliptic flow $V_2$ is linearly proportional to initial eccentricity $\\mathcal{E}_2$. \r\n\r\nIn this work, we generalize the framework to study hydrodynamic response along the longitudinal direction. We propose a differential hydrodynamic response relation, $V_2(\\eta)=\\int d\\xi G(\\eta-\\xi) \\mathcal{E}_2(\\xi)$, to describe the formation of a pseudo-rapidity dependent elliptic flow, in response to a 3D initial density profile. By analyzing the medium expansion using event-by-event simulations of 3+1D MUSIC, with initial conditions generated via the AMPT model for the Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV, the differential response relation is verified and expansion coefficients to very high orders are identified in the response function $G(\\eta-\\xi)$.\r\n\r\nOur investigations of the hydrodynamic response function have yielded two important insights: 1. The two-point auto-correlation of elliptic flow in pseudo-rapidity (an observable in heavy-ion experiments), can be separated as medium response and two-point correlation of initial $\\mathcal{E}_2$. Especially, shear viscosity of the medium reduces the correlation length systematically. 2. Higher order expansion coefficients increase exponentially, which implies a finite radius of convergence of the gradient expansion in the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics. The radius of convergence in the response function results in a minimal length scale that can be used to estimate the applicability of hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions, which provides a possible solution to the question of fluidity in small systems.",

This EM field, generated by the collision participants and spectators, is predicted to produce a difference in the $v_n$ harmonics for positive- and negative-charged particles, with the magnetic field mainly responsible for a splitting in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$), and the Coulomb electric field leading to a charge-dependent splitting in the $v_2$ and average $p_T$ values of emitted particles. Because of their large mass, charm quarks are expected to be created very early in the collision, and thus have a better chance of interacting with this strong EM field than light flavor hadrons. In this talk, measurements of $D^0$ ($\\bar{u}c$) and $\\bar{D^0}$ ($u\\bar{c}$) meson flow harmonics ($v_1$ and $v_2$) are presented as functions of rapidity ($y$), transverse momentum ($p_T$), and collision centrality for PbPb collisions at $5.02~\\mathrm{TeV}$, using high statistics data samples collected by the CMS detector during the LHC Run 2. The results are compared to model calculations, where they provide important constraints on the electrical conductivity and the drag coefficient assumed for the QGP medium. The wide rapidity coverage ($|y|<2$) of these new charm mesons measurements allow for a better understanding of the 3-dimensional evolution of the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Using deep neural network, the nature of the QCD transition can be identified from only the final-state pion spectra from hybrid model simulations of heavy-ion collisions. Within this hybrid model, a viscous hydrodynamic model is coupled to a hadronic cascade “after-burner”. Two different types of equations of state (EoS) of the medium are used in the hydrodynamic evolution. The resulting spectra are used as the input data to train the neural network to distinguish EoS. Different scenarios for the input data are studied and compared in a systematic way. A clear hierarchy is observed in the prediction accuracy when using the event-by-event, cascade-coarse-grained and event-fine-averaged spectra as input for the network, which are about 80\\%, 90\\% and 99\\%, respectively. Thus the high-level correlations of pion spectra learned by a carefully-trained neural network can serve as an effective \"EoS-meter\" to distinguish the nature of the QCD transition even in a simulation scenario which is close to the experiments.",

Nevertheless, due to the small masses of current quarks one can still probe critical phenomena at the LHC energy, which can be confronted with the ab-initio LQCD calculations at vanishing baryon chemical potential. In this report recent results on event-by-event fluctuation measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV will be presented. Together with the measured first four cumulants of net-protons in Pb-Pb collisions, differential studies on the second moments of net-charge distributions and their evolution from pp through p-Pb, Xe-Xe to Pb-Pb interactions will be highlighted.

We find that the azimuthal angle dependence of the hyperon polarization strongly depends on the choice of the so-called 'spin chemical potential'. If it is chosen to be proportional to the temperature vorticity, our simulation shows qualitatively coincidental results with the recent measurements at RHIC for both the longitudinal and transverse polarization.

The pair production rate is exponentially suppressed with mass according to the Schwinger formula, while the mass dependence of chirality production in the axial Ward identity appears in the pesudo-scalar term. We demonstrate that in equilibrium field theory calculus the axial anomaly is canceled by the pseudo-scalar condensate for any mass. In a real-time formulation with in- and out-states, we show that the axial Ward identity leads to the chirality production rate consistent with the Schwinger formula. We illuminate that such an in- and out-states formulation makes clear the chiral magnetic effect in and out of equilibrium, and we discuss further applications to real-time condensates.",

We present a first principles study of the chirality transfer between gauge fields and fermions based on classical-statistical real-time lattice simulations. We demonstrate that a chirality imbalance in the fermion sector triggers plasma instabilities in the gauge field sector, which ultimately lead to the emergence of turbulent behavior characterized by a self-similar infrared cascade of magnetic helicity. We comment on the differences between abelian and non-abelian gauge theories, and discuss consequences for modeling anomalous transport phenomena in heavy-ion collisions",

A measurement of the angular distribution of charged particles around the jet axis in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV is presented. The measurement is performed for jets with radius parameter $R = 0.4$ and is extended outside the jet cone to a radial distance of 0.8 in intervals of charged particle and jet transverse momentum. The talk also presents studies of fragmentation functions and distributions of transverse momentum of charged particles inside a jet. \r\n  Furthermore, a new measurement of how the suppression of large-radius jets depends on the internal jet structure is presented. This measurement brings new information about the evolution of the parton shower in the medium and tests the sensitivity of the jet quenching to color coherence effects.",

      "Abstract": "Within perturbative QCD, we develop a new picture for the parton shower generated by a jet propagating through a dense quark-gluon  plasma.  In this picture, the vacuum-like parton branchings, as triggered by the parton virtualities, are factorized in time from the medium-induced emissions responsible for the energy loss by the jet. We implement this picture in a Monte Carlo generator that we use to study two phenomenologically important observables: the jet nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the $z_g$ distribution reflecting the jet substructure.  In both cases, the outcome of our Monte Carlo simulations is in good agreement with the LHC measurements. We find that the energy loss by the jet is increasing with the jet transverse momentum, due to a rise in the number of partonic sources via vacuum-like emissions. This is a key element in our description of both $R_{AA}$ and $z_g$. For the latter, we identify two main nuclear effects: incoherent jet energy loss and hard medium-induced emissions. As the jet transverse momentum increases, we predict a qualitative change in the  ratio between the $z_g$ distributions in PbPb and pp collisions: from increasing at small $z_g$, this ratio becomes slightly decreasing.",

A causal formulation for the space-time profile of energy-momentum source terms is incorporated with a multi-stage jet evolution and (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamics within the JETSCAPE 2.0 framework. In this work, we employ a causal relativistic diffusion equation to model the evolution of the localized energy and momentum depositions by jet partons before injection into the QGP fluid. This formulation provides the source terms with a space-time profile that naturally preserves causality. The diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time used in this model are directly connected to the transport properties of the QGP, such as its specific shear viscosity, and determine the size and shape of the source-term profile.\r\n\r\nUtilizing this new framework, we quantify the effects of the hydrodynamic response of a strongly-coupled medium on jet substructures (e.g. jet shape and jet fragmentation functions), by comparing with results for a weakly-coupled QGP where the medium response is modeled with recoil partons. Furthermore, we explore the dependence on the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time in the diffusion of the sources to show how the transport properties of the QGP manifest themselves in the medium response to jet propagation.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The spatial anisotropy of QGP, formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, is commonly inferred form models of early QGP evolution. These studies (e.g. MC-Glauber, EKRT, IP-Glasma, MC-KLN), based on different methods, lead to notably different predictions, with a notable effect in the resulting predictions for both low and high pt data. On the other hand, energy loss of high-pt particles traversing QCD medium is an excellent probe of QGP properties, particularly since there is a wealth of accumulated high pt experimental data. Therefore, as a novel and complementary approach, we here propose using high pt theory and data to infer the shape of initial QGP droplet. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we use DREENA framework, which is fully optimized computational procedure based on our state-of-the art dynamical energy loss formalism. Our most recent results show that, when embedded in 3+1D hydro medium model, DREENA provides a very good joint agreement with both $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data, contrary to the $v_2$ puzzle faced by models with simpler energy loss mechanisms. This, together with good joint agreement of our model with a wide range of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data (obtained with no fitting parameters used in model testing) shows that DREENA can realistically descibe high pt parton-medium interactions. By using DREENA framework, we show, through analytical arguments, numerical calculations, and comparison with experimental data, that $v_2$/(1−$R_{AA}$) reaches a well-defined saturation value at high pt, which is in turn proportional to the initial anisotropy. We provide first anisotropy estimates from our approach, and compare them with the predictions of early QGP evolution models. With expected future significant reduction of experimental errors, the anisotropy extracted from experimental data will strongly constrain the calculations of initial particle production in heavy-ion collisions, and thus test our understanding of QGP physics.",

We compare the predicted dijet relative azimuthal angle distributions for jets propagating through both perturbative (wQGP/HTL) and nonperturbative (sQGMP) models of the color structure of QCD perfect fluids as described by the VISHNU viscous hydro framework.  Our strategy to discriminate between these pictures of the QGP is based on the different parametric dependence of the jet path energy loss functionals, $\\Delta E[x[t]] \\propto <\\hat{q}L^2>$; and the width of the dijet azimuthal angle distribution, which is proportional the transverse saturation squared path functional, $Q_s^2[x[t]] \\propto <\\hat{q}L>$. By constraining $\\Delta E[x[t]]$ using inclusive hadron and jet suppression data, the medium-induced dijet acoplanarity is predicted by CUJET3 to be approximately twice as large in sQGMP than in wQGP. Future trigger+jet coincidence measurements at RHIC and LHC will have sufficient precision to resolve this difference on top of the expected large acoplanarity background due to vacuum Sudakov radiation.

PHENIX recently improved the width measurements extracted from $\\pi^{0}$-hadron correlations after removing the higher ordered flow terms in the underlying event. Measurements of the awayside jet correlated with direct photons have shown an increase in low momentum particle production at wide angles consistent with theoretical expectations for energy loss. The use of isolation cuts to select direct photons now allows us to measure this effect as a function of centrality. The system size dependence of energy loss is further investigated at PHENIX by measuring the absolute yield and $R_{AA}$ for various hadron species at high $p_T$ in several collision systems including U+U and Cu+Au.

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor physics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is a promising and active area to study the `` jet quenching \" effects both at the RHIC and the LHC. The recent reported $D^0$ meson radial profiles in jets measured by CMS collaboration provide new experimental constraints on the mechanisms of heavy flavor production in proton-proton collisions and give new insights into the in-medium interaction mechanisms of heavy quarks inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this talk, we present the first theoretical calculations of the $D^0$ meson radial distributions relative to the jet axis both in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, which show a nice agreement compared to the experimental data. In our work, the in-medium parton propagations are described by a Monte Carlo transport model which uses the next-to-leading order (NLO) plus parton shower (PS) event generator SHERPA as input and includes elastic (collisional) and inelastic (radiative) interaction for heavy quarks as well as light partons. Our simulated results show that, at low $D^0$ $p_T$, the radial distribution shifts to larger radius indicating a strong diffusion effect of charm quarks due to the in-medium interactions, but no significant modification observed at high $D^0$ $p_T$, which are consistent with the experimental data. In the further study, we estimate the net effect on the charm diffusion from collisional and radiative mechanism, and demonstrate the $p_T$ dependence of this diffusion effect. We find that collisional process has significant effects at low $p_T$, especially dominates at $0-5$ GeV, and the radiative process has a non-zero effect even at high $p_T\\sim 50$ GeV. The total diffusion effect decreases with $D^0$ $p_T$ which explains the significant modification at low $D^0$ meson $p_T$ observed in experiment. Besides, for unit energy loss, the collisional interaction shows much stronger angular deviation than radiative interaction indicating an essential difference between these two mechanisms.  For completeness, we also present the calculations of $D^0$ meson radial distribution in jets in p+p and $0-10\\%$ Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV, and estimate the nuclear modification factor of charm jet in central Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$ TeV.",

In the low mass region (LMR, $M_{ee}$<$M_{\\phi}$), the mass spectra of vector mesons are modified due to their interaction with the medium which is related to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, $M_{\\phi}$<$M_{ee}$<$M_{J/\\Psi}$), dielectrons from thermal radiation are predicted as a QGP thermometer, although the contributions from heavy quark semi-leptonic decays make the extraction of the thermal radiation contribution very challenging. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the dielectron spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$ = 27, 54.4 and 200 GeV with the STAR experiment.

Lower heavy quark semi-leptonic decay contributions compared to those at top RHIC energies and the large data samples may allow the first extraction of the medium temperature with IMR dielectrons at RHIC. The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) installed at STAR in 2014 enables a better understanding of the semi-leptonic decay contributions by providing high-precision tracking and vertex information.

In the past several years there has been an astounding amount of work aimed at understanding the heavy quarks coupling with the medium.  Nevertheless, the longitudinal dependence of common observables have not yet been throughly explored.  Forward rapidity observables can provide further insight on the dynamics of the medium due to the interplay between the medium size directly affecting the path length of the heavy quark probes, and the differences in the production spectra.  In this work we investigate the nuclear modification factor $R_\\text{AA}$ and flow coefficients $v_n$ of B and D mesons, as well as heavy flavor leptons, in the rapidity range $-4.0 < y < 4.0$.  We use relativistic Langevin equation with gluon radiation coupled with the CLVisc (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamics medium background for AuAu at $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}} = 200$ GeV, and PbPb at $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV collisions.  Comparison with current data is shown for mid-rapidity observables as well as forward rapidity muons.  We provide predictions for different rapidity ranges for B and D mesons observables.",

      "Abstract": "The production of low-mass dielectrons is the most promising tool for the understanding of the chiral symmetry restoration and of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) \r\ncreated in heavy-ion collisions. At low invariant mass, the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the medium related to the chiral symmetry \r\nrestoration. In the intermediate-mass region, the main component of the dielectron continuum is coming from correlated electron pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, which carry information about heavy-quark energy loss and collectivity. In this mass region, thermal \r\nradiation from the QGP gives insight into the early temperature of the medium. Finally, \r\nat very low momenta initial photon annihilation and photonuclear processes, triggered by \r\nthe coherent electromagnetic fields of the incoming nuclei, are expected to play a role \r\nin more peripheral collisions.\r\n\r\nTo study the dielectron production in heavy-ion collisions, it is crucial to first understand the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum with minimum-bias proton-proton collisions and to disentangle hot from cold-nuclear matter effects with p--Pb collisions. Moreover, observations of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions show surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions, which can be further investigated with the measurement of dielectrons in such collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will give an overview of the latest measurements of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ \r\npair production in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions recorded by ALICE at different energies. The results will be shown as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the event, \r\nor the centrality of the collision. They will be compared to the expected dielectron yield from known hadronic sources and in Pb-Pb collisions with several predictions for the \r\nthermal radiation from the hadron gas and QGP phases and photo-production of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$. Their implications for the production of heavy quarks and quasi-real \r\nvirtual-photons will be discussed as well.",

      "Speaker": "Jean-Bernard Rose",
      "Institute": "No affiliation",
      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Inducing an electric field in the QCD medium generates an electric current which is proportional to the matter’s electric conductivity. Since quarks and hadrons also carry baryon and strange charge, such a field also respectively produces a baryon and strangeness current whose amplitude depends on baryo-electric and strange-electric conductivities. We dub the combination of these 3 properties of matter the cross-conductivity and proceed to calculate it in the hadron gas phase at and below temperatures corresponding to the phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon plasma. We use the newly-released SMASH transport code to simulate the hadron gas and the Green-Kubo formalism to extract the transport coefficients. After validating the approach for a simple system for which analytical results can be calculated (namely, pions, kaons and protons interacting with constant cross-sections), we gradually increase the number of degrees of freedom, up to reaching a state-of-the-art hadronic resonance gas as described by our current knowledge. Our results show that there are significant differences in the temperature dependence of the different components of the cross-conductivity as a function of the number of degrees of freedom. This new observable can in principle be computed on the lattice, and as such could be used to further constrain the properties of the hadron gas in the low temperature region.",

      "Speaker": "Niklas Mueller",
      "Institute": "Brookhaven National Laboratory",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Nuclear structure functions and parton Wigner distributions of protons and nuclei are principal components of QCD phenomenology. Their first principle computation is an outstanding problem in QCD, because they involve non-perturbative nucleon/nuclear matrix elements of electromagnetic currents that are light-like separated in Minkowskian spacetime. Real-time correlation functions are a difficult problem for lattice computations, which are only feasible in Euclidean space time.  To overcome restrictions of classical computing, we outline a strategy to compute nuclear structure functions in the high energy Regge limit of QCD using a hybrid quantum computer [1]. Our approach takes advantage of the representation of the fermion determinant in the QCD path integral as a quantum mechanical path integral over 0+1-dimensional fermionic and bosonic world-lines in background gauge fields [2].  While extremely challenging in general, the problem simplifies in the Regge limit, where the interaction of the world-lines with gauge fields is strongly localized in proper time and the corresponding quantum circuits can be written down.  As a proof principle, we employ the Color Glass Condensate effective theory of high energy QCD to construct the algorithm for a first straightforward application of the framework, specifically, the problem of computing the well-known dipole model result for the structure function $F_2$ [3]. We outline how this computation can be systematically scaled up in complexity and extended in scope to other real-time correlation functions, for example to describe non-equilibrium transport of quarks and gluons in a Quark-Gluon-Plasma, where the restrictions of euclidean lattice computations are evident.\r\n\r\n[1] N.

      "Speaker": "Yuki Fujimoto",
      "Institute": "The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Quark-hadron continuity has been well understood for three-flavor symmetric nuclear and quark matter, which is however a theoretically over-idealized environment.  In this talk we clarify how quark-hadron continuity can be applied to neutron matter in the realistic neutron star environment.  Our key observation is that neutron matter can be smoothly connected to the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) state mixed with a condensate of $\\langle dd\\rangle$.  We give three convincing arguments:  The first one is the symmetry-breaking argument, the second one is the argument based on rearrangement of gauge-invariant order parameters, and the last one is the dynamical argument associated with nuclear forces in terms of $d$-quark exchanges.  Interestingly, in the quark sector, we have found a universal dynamical mechanism to favor $^3 P_2$ superfluidity above a certain threshold density, below which the ground state is a $^0 S_1$ superfluid.  Such transitional behavior of the favored ground state has been long known in nuclear physics, and as should be the case if quark-hadron continuity holds for neutron matter, quark matter turns out to share the same properties.\r\nOur finding provides us with an important theoretical foundation for the phenomenological construction of the equation of state (EoS) in the neutron star environment.  We conclude that, even in the presence of a $^3 P_2$ component of superfluidity, a prescription to interpolate the EoS smoothly between the nuclear and quark sides perfectly makes sense.  We also emphasize that such a state of the 2SC with tensorial $\\langle dd\\rangle$ in accord with $^3 P_2$ superfluidity is an absolutely novel state of quark matter that nobody had ever considered.  We discuss physical properties of this novel color-superconducting state and give an account of possible enhancement of tensorial $\\langle dd\\rangle$ due to Fierz mixing with the energy-momentum tensor.",

      "Abstract": "The measurement of low-energy cosmic anti-deuterons may reveal the existence of exotic processes such as dark-matter annihilation, since the production rate of these ions through ordinary secondary processes is very low. However, the lack of experimental data at low energies, where both the anti-deuteron production and inelastic cross sections are very poorly known, prevents precise predictions of anti-deuteron fluxes near Earth.\r\n\r\nIn ultra-relativistic collisions of protons and lead ions at the CERN LHC, matter and anti-matter is produced in almost equal abundances. This allows us to study the production cross sections of (anti-)deuterons with high precision as well as to measure the absorption process of produced (anti-)deuterons in the detector material.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the first results on the anti-deuteron absorption cross section in the ALICE detector material. The analysis is performed with p-Pb data collected $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The reconstructed anti-deuteron to deuteron ratio is compared to the results from full-scale GEANT4 simulations of the ALICE detector. Experimental constraints on the anti-deuteron nuclear inelastic cross-section are extracted in the momentum range between 0.5 and 4.0 GeV/$c$. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for indirect Dark Matter searches using cosmic anti-deuterons.",

For the light-light nuclear collisions, such as 16O-16O reaction considered for the upcoming experimental program at RHIC and the LHC, we make definite predictions based on ratios of cumulants. We also point out very interesting aspects of the light-heavy collisions, where the light nucleus is clustered, thus carries intrinsic deformation. There has been a quest for alpha clustering in nuclei over the last 80 years, but evidence at low energies has usually been rather indirect through theoretical studies of binding energies and nuclear sizes. We present here direct experimental signatures of clusterization of light nuclei in ultra-relativistic collisions of 7,9Be, 12C, and 16O on heavy nuclei. Clustering leads to very specific spatial correlations of the nucleon distributions in the ground state of the light nucleus and in the formed fireball, which via collective evolution become manifest in the harmonic flow coefficients of the produced hadron distributions [1-3]. In particular, the elliptic flow is sensitive to clusterization in 7,9Be, and the triangular flow to clusterization in 12C and 16O. \r\n\r\n1.

The experimental observed \"correct\" signs of multi-particle cumulants of $v_n$ coefficient in small collision systems, in particular, the negative sign of $c_{2}\\{4\\}$, are usually interpreted as the signature of hydrodynamic flow. In this talk, I present the investigations on 2- and multi-particle cumulants in high-multiplicity pp collisions, using iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model with HIJING initial condition. Although the model with tuned parameters could nicely describe almost all experimental measurements of two-particle correlations, however, it could not generate the negative $c_{2}\\{4\\}$. In addition, I will show that this positive $c_{2}\\{4\\}$ in hydro is not caused by possible non-flow contributions (resonances decay), multiplicity fluctuations (fake flow) or the multi-particle cumulant method itself (statistical stability). Further investigations by replacing HIJING initial conditions with super-MC and TRENTo initial conditions, and by including pre-equilibrium effects and kinetic theory, can not have the ability to reproduce the observed negative $c_{2}\\{4\\}$. It is also seen that the hydrodynamic evolution generates an additional non-linear (cubic) response of $v_{2}$ to initial eccentricity $\\varepsilon_2$, which results in a positive $c_{2}\\{4\\}$ despite the negative $\\varepsilon_{2}\\{4\\}$ obtained in the first place.\r\n\r\nTwo new questions then appear, whether the success of hydrodynamic calculations in 2-particle correlations and failure of hydrodynamic descriptions of multi-particle cumulants requires a novel understanding of initial conditions or the one fluid may not rule them all. In this talk, together with the new calculations from AMPT transport model with various scenarios and also PYTHIA model (with and without color reconnection, with and without string shoving), I will address that using the well known 2- and multi-particle cumulants we can answer the unknown initial versus final stage effects in small collision systems.",

We compare to experimental data for $v_n(p_T)$, $c_2\\{4\\}$, and $C_{112}$ from the PHENIX and STAR Collaborations. We discuss the role of initial state momentum anisotropies and the shear stress tensor from the color glass condensate effective theory, which are included in the energy momentum tensor provided by the IP-Glasma model as initial condition for the hydrodynamic simulation. We find that the systematic ordering of the magnitude of elliptic and triangular momentum anisotropies between different small systems requires the presence of final state effects. We further study the time evolution of the momentum ansiotropy and the correlation between the orientation of the spatial geometry and the momentum flow, which reveals qualitative differences between large and small systems. We also present results from the same framework for multi-particle cumulants in Pb+Pb and p+Pb collisions at LHC energies, as well as predictions for O+O collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions have demonstrated long-range azimuthal correlations between charged particle pairs, commonly interpreted as arising from a single particle azimuthal anisotropy. To better illuminate the origin and nature of these collective signatures, ATLAS presents studies in proton-proton collisions with a novel handle on event geometry, and in photo-nuclear collisions. In proton-proton collisions, the impact-parameter dependence of these correlations are studied in events containing a Z-boson, which acts as an independent handle on the impact parameter. This talk presents updated measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy in such Z-tagged $pp$ collisions at 8 and 13 TeV. The measurements include studies of the $p_{T}$, event-multiplicity, and collision energy dependence of the anisotropy as well as their comparisons to the inclusive $pp$ collisions. In addition, two-particle correlations are presented in a qualitatively new collision system of ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. Even if the passing nuclei are well-separated and do not interact hadronically in these collisions, a quasi-real photon from the EM field of one nucleus can interact with the other nucleus. The photons may reach energies up to 80 GeV and readily fluctuate into vector meson configurations. Thus these photo-nuclear collisions may proceed as rho-nucleus collisions albeit at a significantly lower collision energy than the equivalent nucleon-nucleon energy. This talk presents new measurements of two-particle correlations and characterizes particle production in photo-nuclear collisions, which have multiplicities significantly smaller than $pp$ collisions and center of mass energies between those available at RHIC and the LHC.",

      "Abstract": "We investigate whether the quark gluon plasma (QGP) is created in small colliding systems through the analysis of strangeness enhancement using the dynamical core--corona initialization model [1].\r\n\r\nThe yield ratios of (multi-)strange hadrons to charged pions in various colliding systems exhibit monotonic increase and scale with multiplicity at the LHC energies [2]. Motivated by these data, we develop a unified and a phenomenological description of the QGP formation based on the dynamical initialization model [3].\r\n\r\nFirst we obtain the initially produced partons using PYTHIA8 on an event-by-event basis. From these initial partons, we generate initial conditions of QGP fluids as a dynamical process. Here we assume the core--corona picture: Local equilibrium is likely to be achieved among highly populated partons\r\ndue to multi-secondary scatterings, while partons tend to traverse without being QGP components when these are in low density regions.\r\nNext we separate dynamically initial partons into QGP fluids (core: dense/soft components) and surviving partons (corona: dilute/hard components) under this assumption. After hydrodynamic evolution, the QGP fluids (the core) are particlized in the decoupling hypersurface, while surviving partons (the corona) are hadronized through string fragmentation in PYTHIA. The final hadron spectra is a sum of both contributions from the core and the corona in this model.\r\n\r\nWe show the (multi-)strangeness yield ratios monotonically increase with multiplicity due to the competition between core and corona components and successfully reproduce the tendency of experimental data [2]. We also find that the ratios scale with multiplicity regardless of collision energies or system size, which is consistent with experimental findings [2]. Moreover, we calculate the fraction of fluidized energy as a function of multiplicity from small to large systems and find that initial partons are almost fluidized in mid-rapidity even in $\\langle dN/d\\eta \\rangle > \\sim 10$.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Y.Kanakubo, M.Okai, Y.Tachibana and T.Hirano, Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics 2018, no.12, 121D01  (2018).\r\n\r\n[2] J.Adam et al.

Then, using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, we make an explicit connection between the initial geometry and these principal components. The usual eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow implies only a leading principal component, but by including more terms in a cumulant expansion, we can also describe subleading PCA modes, and explicitly show what properties of the initial state generate these subleading fluctuations.  In particular, subleading elliptic flows are generated by higher order cumulants, and therefore probe small length scales of the initial state.  Conversely, subleading triangular flow is more sensitive to nonlinear, mixed harmonic geometric anisotropies. With this information, it will be possible to put new constraints on properties of the early-time dynamics of a heavy-ion collision, including small-scale structure, as well as properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] M.

      "Abstract": "To assess the properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions, correlations between the mean transverse momentum, [$p_{T}$], and the magnitude of the flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, are measured by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.  The analysis uses data samples of lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV and proton-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 22 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$ and 28 nb$^{-1}$, respectively. The correlations are measured using a modified Pearson coefficient that is independent of multiplicity fluctuations. To suppress any short-range correlations, the [$p_{T}$] is measured at mid-rapidity and the flow harmonics are measured at forward rapidity.\r\nIn Pb+Pb collisions, significant (non-zero) values of the correlation coefficients are observed for all studied harmonics, which show a strong centrality  dependence but vary only weakly with the charged particle $p_{T}$ range used in the measurement. On the other hand, in $p$+Pb collisions, the correlation coefficient measured for the 2$^{nd}$ harmonic is found to show only a weak centrality dependence. The predictions of a 3+1D viscous-hydrodynamic model are found to be qualitatively consistent with the data, indicating hydrodynamic origin of these correlations in $p$+Pb collisions.\r\nAs an independent test for the hydrodynamic description of collectivity observed in $p$+Pb collisions, measurements of two-pion HBT correlations as a function of the angle of the pion pair with respect to the second-order event plane angle are presented. The HBT correlation functions, corrected for event plane resolution, are measured as a function of $q_{out}$, $q_{side}$ and $q_{long}$ in intervals of pair transverse momentum and second-order flow-vector magnitude. The correlation functions are fit using the Bowler-Sinyukov form with the exponential HBT correlation function. The extracted HBT radii, $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$ and $R_{long}$ and a significant out-side cross-term are found to exhibit significant modulation with respect to the second-order event plane, similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions. Results of the measurements and physics implications of the result, will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The applicability of fluid-dynamical models in the extreme conditions produced in heavy ion collisions has not yet been properly understood from a theoretical point of view. This happens mostly because the derivation of hydrodynamics from microscopic theory often relies on the assumption that the system is sufficiently close to local equilibrium -- something difficult to justify in the rapidly expanding systems created in heavy ion collisions. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution we propose a more general derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from kinetic theory, in which the fluid is assumed to be close to an isotropic non-equilibrium state instead of an equilibrium one. We demonstrate that, for a wide variety of non-equilibrium states, one obtains a hydrodynamic theory described by equations of motion that are identical to those commonly solved in heavy ion collisions. The only difference appears in the form of the transport coefficients that enter the equations of motion. Simulations of the relativistic Boltzmann equation equation in 0+1D Bjorken flow in the ultrarelativistic limit are performed to demonstrate this effect, showing that the time evolution of the energy-momentum tensor appears to be fluid-dynamical even when the momentum distribution of the underlying degrees of freedom differs significantly from an equilibrium distribution.",

      "Abstract": "Recent measurements and hydrodynamic model calculations suggest that the higher-order flow coefficients, $v_{n}$ (n $>$ 3), have two contributions: a linear contribution driven by the initial-state eccentricities, $\\epsilon_{n}$, and a mode-coupled contribution derived from the lower-order eccentricity coefficients $\\epsilon_{2}$ and $\\epsilon_{3}$. Measurement of these two contributions to $v_{n}$ provides crucial insights to discern initial-state models and to constrain the temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity, $\\eta/s(T)$, of the plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we have employed the traditional, two- and three-subevents cumulant techniques to provide the first beam-energy and collision-system dependence of the linear and mode-coupled contributions to the higher-order flow harmonics and the associated correlations between different flow symmetry planes. Our results will be presented and discussed for several transverse momenta selections, particle species, and centrality intervals for U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 193 GeV, Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200, 54.4, 39 and 27 GeV and Cu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The results are compared with similar studies performed by ALICE/CMS/ATLAS experiments at LHC. The measurements will also be compared to several viscous hydrodynamic calculations to pin down the respective influence of initial-state fluctuations, mixed harmonic correlations, system-size, shape ($\\varepsilon$) and $\\eta/s(T)$ on $v_{n}$.",

      "Abstract": "Jets engender physics over a multitude of scales, from the hardest interactions in a heavy-ion collision (up to a TeV at the LHC), down to the scale of the freeze-out temperature. A complete description of jet modification must address the role and interplay of the physics at each of these scales and their effect on a wide variety of integrated and differential jet observables. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present such a comprehensive study by performing a model-to-data comparison for leading hadrons, inclusive jets, and jet substructure observables [1,2]. Using the JETSCAPE framework [3], we succeed in providing a simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor for single hadrons and jets, jet shape, and jet fragmentation function within a unified multi-stage framework which spans multiple centralities, energies and jet radii. This multi-scale approach includes a high virtuality (radiation dominated) generator (MATTER), followed by an on-shell energy loss generator (LBT/MARTINI) or a strongly coupled drag energy loss (AdS/CFT) stage [4]. Each stage transitions to the next at a parton-by-parton level, depending on local quantities such as the parton’s energy, virtuality, and the local density. Measurements of jet and single hadron $R_{AA}$ set strong constraints on the phase-space available for each stage of the energy-loss. We also incorporate jet-medium response through a weakly-coupled transport description with recoil particles excited from the QCD medium. We highlight the central role played by recoil in the description of both integrated jet observables and the sub-structure of the jet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] JETSCAPE Collaboration, C.

      "Abstract": "The observed suppression of inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions at LHC has a very weak $p_{T}$ dependence over a large range of $p_{T}$ = 50-1000 GeV and is almost independent of the colliding energy, though the initial energy density of the formed QGP has increased significantly from $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 to 5.02 TeV. This interesting phenomenon is fully investigated in the linear Boltzmann transport(LBT) model for jet propagation combined event-by-event 3+1D hydro backgrounds. We found that the $p_{T}$ dependence of jet $R_{AA}$ is determined by the initial spectrum in $pp$ collisions and jet quenching in which medium response has a significant contribution. Furthermore, the energy loss distribution is extracted directly from experimental data within a Beyesian method, which provides a model-independent approach to understand jet quenching in detail. The extracted jet energy loss distributions have a scaling behavior and indicate that jet quenching is caused on the average by only a few out-of-cone scatterings.",

I will show that\r\nthe dynamical description of this phase transition, in nuclear collisions, will lead to the formation of dense baryon clusters at the phase boundary [2]. Using state-of-the-art machine learning methods I will show that the coordinate space clumping leaves characteristic imprints on the spatial net density distribution in almost every event. On the other hand the momentum distributions do not show any clear event-by-event features. In fact only a few events can be systematically differentiated when only the momentum space information is available. In such a scenario conventional observables, like the baryon number cumulants seem to be the best hope at finding signals for the phase transition. Indeed it is shown that the third order cumulant, the skewness, shows a peak at the beam energy where the system, created in the heavy ion collision, reaches the deconfinement phase transition.

      "Speaker": "Yi Yin",
      "Institute": "MIT",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Upcoming experimental programs, like the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC, will look for signatures of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram in fluctuation observables. To understand and predict these signatures, one must account for the fact that the dynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium: because of critical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the droplet of QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their out-of-equilibrium dynamics must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the cooling droplet. The recently developed Hydro+ formalism allows for a consistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations, including the feedback between them. We shall provide the first demonstration of how this works, setting up a Hydro+ simulation in a simplified setting: a rapidity-independent fireball undergoing radial flow with an equation of state in which we imagine a critical point close to the μB = 0 axis of the phase diagram. Within this setup, we show that we can quantitatively capture non-equilibrium phenomena, including critical fluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore,  we show the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the hydrodynamic flow of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical fluctuations lag relative to how they would evolve if they stayed in equilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to the  out-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports fluctuations outwards by advection.",

The excellent performance of the Inner Tracking System, Time-Projection Chamber and Time-Of-Flight detectors provide a clear identification and separation of primary produced light (anti-)nuclei from secondaries. Additionally, the high-energy deposit of Z=2 particles in the Transition Radiation Detector has been exploited to collect a hardware-triggered data sample in the high-interaction rate pp collision at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV. New results on deuteron production as a function of multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented, as well as the measurement of $^{3}$He in (triggered) p-Pb collisions. The goal is to study whether (anti-)nuclei production in small systems is better described by the coalescence model or by the statistical hadronisation model. The coalescence parameter $B_{A}$ is studied as a function of transverse momentum in the different systems and as a function of the event multiplicity. In addition, the measurement of the (anti-)deuteron production in jets will be presented and compared with theoretical models.",

The mass dependence of the sequential hadron formation provides us a new tool for studying the quark-gluon plasma hadronization in high energy nuclear collisions.

We focused on particle lists which differ largely in the number of resonant states. By doing so, our analysis determines the effect of the amount of resonances included in the HRG model on the freeze-out conditions. In view of the future $\\Lambda$ fluctuation measurements, we predict the $\\Lambda$ variance over mean and skewness times variance at the light and strange chemical freeze-out parameters.

      "Abstract": "A precise understanding of the Equation of State of dense objects like neutron stars is limited by the knowledge about the hyperon interaction and the precision of the models describing the latter. Traditionally, meson exchange models are used to describe the hyperon sector and are constrained by the scarce scattering and hypernuclei data, almost exclusively available for $\\Lambda$ hyperons. Recently the HAL-QCD collaboration conducted calculations without relying on constraints by data and with quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom. Their results converge for the interactions between heavier $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ hyperons and nucleons and in the p-$\\Omega$ system they predict a bound state.\r\nFemtoscopy measurements in small systems make it possible to map the core of the potential at small distances and are currently the only viable way to provide a sensitive experimental measurement to test the lattice potentials. In this talk, we present the first precise study of the p$\\Xi^-$ and p$\\Omega^-$ interactions measured in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. For the first time, clear signatures of the strong attractive interaction can be observed for these particles. The potentials provided by HAL-QCD calculations and meson-exchange are transformed so they can be compared to the measured correlation functions. For the p$\\Xi^-$ interaction the HAL-QCD prediction is strongly favoured by the data with respect to the meson-exchange model. For the p$\\Omega^-$ channel, strongly bound systems are excluded and the comparison between data and calculations leaves only room for binding energies below 1 MeV.",

      "Abstract": "Strangeness (especially the multi-strangeness) production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy ion collisions. The ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of nuclear matter, such as the strangeness chemical potential and the chemical freeze-out temperature. The yield ratios $(N_{K}N_{\\Xi})/(N_{\\phi}N_{\\Lambda})$ and $(N_{K}N_{\\Omega})/(N_{\\phi}N_{\\Xi})$  are suggested in [1] to be sensitive to strange quark density fluctuations. Studying these ratios as a function of collision energy may provide a unique probe to the fluctuation of strange quark densities during the phase transition from the QGP to hadronic matter. Furthermore,  the STAR fixed-target program extends the low energy reach from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 3.0 GeV, corresponding to baryon chemical potential from 420 MeV to about 700 MeV. The comparison between the asymmetric system (Al+Au) and symmetric system (Au+Au) at almost equal number of participating nucleons from most central to mid-central collisions provides useful information on nucleon stopping, which is key to understanding the baryon chemical potential. Moreover, in the asymmetric Al+Au system, the peaks of the rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$) are not aligned with the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass rapidity. The magnitude of the peak shift varies with particle species and also with centrality and can serve as a measure of the baryon stopping. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present new measurements of mid-rapidity $K^0_{S}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ from Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}$ = 54.4 and 27 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The thermodynamic properties of high temperature and high density QCD-matter are explored within the Chiral SU(3)-flavor parity-doublet Polyakov-loop quark-hadron mean-field model, CMF. The applications of the CMF model to the lattice QCD data, heavy-ions physics, and static neutron stars are presented. In the CMF-model the transition between hadron-dominated and quark-dominated regimes is performed according to the lattice QCD data at zero net-baryon density. At low temperatures the CMF model reproduces known properties of nuclear matter while quarks become dominant at densities $\\approx 7$ times nuclear saturation density. In the scope of the lattice QCD data the CMF model predictions for lines of constant physics as well as the baryon number susceptibilities are discussed. The calculated skewness and kurtosis predict three consecutive transitions in phase diagram, the nuclear first-order liquid-vapor phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration, and the cross-over transition to pure quark matter. The deviations from the free ideal hadron gas baseline at $\\mu_B=0$ and $T\\approx 100-200$ MeV can be attributed to remnants of the first order phase transition in the nuclear matter. The chiral crossing transition and cross-over to quark matter determine the baryon fluctuations at much higher $\\mu_B$. The trajectories of heavy-ion collisions along the phase diagram are calculated. The CMF model also describe well the static properties of neutron stars in agreement with data extracted from GW170817 neutron star merger event.\r\n\r\n[1]  A. Motornenko, J. Steinheimer, V.

This quantization axis can be the normal to the production plane (defined by the momentum of vector meson and the beam axis) or normal to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter and the beam axis) of the system. The study of the angular distribution leads to the estimation of the spin density matrix element $\\rho_{00}$. A significant deviation of the value of $\\rho_{00}$ from 1/3, which causes a non-uniform angular distribution, would indicate the presence of spin alignment.\r\n\r\nWe will present recent measurements of spin alignment for K$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $\\phi(1020)$ mesons at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb and pp collisions with the ALICE detector.

The global spin alignment is quantified by the diagonal spin density matrix element ($\\rho_{00}$) with respect to the quantization axis, i.e. normal to the reaction plane. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, a large initial global angular momentum is expected to be present. This can induce a non-vanishing polarization for hadrons with non-zero spin reflecting the dynamics of the medium.

The polarization is then the consequence of particle collisions in a non-equilibrium state of spins. The spin-vorticity coupling naturally emerges from the spin-orbit one encoded in polarized scattering amplitudes of collisional integrals when one assumes local equilibrium in momentum but not in spin.",

Prescaling is a far-from-equilibrium phenomenon which describes the rapid establishment of a universal scaling form of distributions much before the universal values of their scaling exponents are realized.

In this formulation, the transport coefficients of far-from-equilibrium fluid dynamics depend not only on the microscopic properties of the system but also on the nonlinear properties of the underlying state of the fluid itself. In contrast to previous works, no additional assumptions about the symmetries of the flow are necessary. An example of this proposal is constructed using Israel-Stewart theory and, in this case, the resummed transport coefficients decrease with increasing Knudsen number according to formulas that can be readily investigated in current numerical simulations of the quark-gluon plasma. We check numerically the existence of attractor solutions in simulations of AA and pA collisions. This is particularly important to understand the apparent hydrodynamic behavior observed in small systems where gradients are extremely large and resummation techniques should be employed.",

These measurements are sensitive to the effects of color screening, color recombination, and possibly to other, new phenomena affecting dynamics of heavy quarks in the QCD  medium. In the large-statistics Run 2 lead-lead collision data, these phenomena can be probed with unprecedented precision. In this talk, the new ATLAS results on bottomonium nuclear modification factor and excited-to-ground state ratio using 2018 Pb+Pb data and 2017 pp data both at 5.02 TeV will be presented as a function of transverse momentum and event centrality.  Additionally, new measurements on the correlation of the J/$\\psi$ and jet production will be presented, which may help understanding the mechanism of the suppression of J/$\\psi$ measured at high transverse momenta of few tens of GeV.",

      "Abstract": "In holographic heavy ion collisions it is possible to follow both the energy density and a globally conserved (baryon) number density throughout the evolution, dual to a metric and Maxwell field in the dual bulk theory, respectively. At infinite coupling, past work has shown that after the collision the baryon number ends up around mid-rapidity, which is different from high energy heavy ion collisions. In this talk I will present first results for the flow of baryon number in holographic collisions away from the infinite coupling limit, which also means we study the collisions at a larger shear viscosity over entropy density ratio than 1/4π. I will give an introduction to the holographic set-up, which is interesting since it contains an extra coupling of the gravitational Ricci scalar with the Maxwell field. Remarkably, depending on the value of this extra coupling, we find that the flow of baryon number during the collision can be affected drastically. In particular, we find that at intermediate coupling it is possible for almost no baryon number to end up at mid-rapidity. We further show how the matter produced in the collision relaxes into a flow as described by hydrodynamics with a conserved baryon current.",

These instabilities are associated with large, anti-collinear, double logarithms which occur when the NLO corrections are computed from the evolution of the *dilute projectile*. We explain how to rewrite the NLO evolution in terms of the rapidity of the *dense target*. This avoids the large anti-collinear contributions but introduces new,  *collinear*, instabilities, which are however milder since disfavoured by  the typical BK evolution. We propose several prescriptions for resumming these new double logarithms and find only little scheme dependence. The  resummed equations are non-local in rapidity and can be extended to full NLO accuracy. We present the first applications of these resummed equations to proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC and deep inelastic scattering at the proposed Electron-Ion Collider.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Lambda polarization $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ was measured by the STAR collaboration [1], confirming the existence of extremely large vorticities within the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). A recent study using a high-statistics data set at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV has shown the dependence of $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ on collision centrality, azimuthal angle ($\\varphi$), transverse momentum ($p_T$), pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), etcetera [2][3]. Additionally suggested in [1] is an enhanced $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ relative to $P_{\\Lambda}$ across all beam energies; however, the statistics are too limited to make a significant measurement. No such splitting is observed in the high-statistics $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV data set, but this splitting is expected to increase at lower beam energies. The splitting in polarization would be consistent with the effects of hyperon magnetic-moment coupling with the magnetic field sustained in the QGP; it would have far-reaching consequences important to magnetic-field-dependent observables such as the chiral magnetic effect and would set the scale on the conductivity of the QGP.\r\n\r\nRecently, STAR has taken high-statistics data sets at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 27$ and 54.4 GeV. The 27 GeV data set is considered suitable to study the splitting between $P_{\\Lambda}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ since it includes the recently installed Event-Plane Detector (EPD), which significantly increases the event-plane resolution. Both data sets are used to study the splitting between $P_{\\Lambda}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\Lambda}}$ as well as the various differential measurements of $P_{\\Lambda/\\bar{\\Lambda}}$.

This general connection is demonstrated both for a single particle and for a fluid vortex. Applying the idea for heavy ion collisions we propose it as a new mechanism for generating long-lived in-medium magnetic fields. We estimate the magnitude of this new magnetic field in the AuAu colliding systems across a wide span of collisional beam energy. Such a magnetic field is found to rapidly increase toward lower beam energy and could account for a significant amount of the experimentally observed global polarization difference between hyperons and anti-hyperons. Its time-integrated effect could make considerable contributions to the Chiral Magnetic Effect. Further predictions are discussed and experimental tests are suggested.",

Furthermore, a kinetic equation for this dipole moment is derived. Carefully taking the massless limit we find agreement with previous results. The case of global equilibrium with rotation is also studied. Finally, we outline the derivation of fluid-dynamical equations from the components of the Wigner function. The conservation of total angular momentum is promoted as an additional fluid-dynamical equation of motion.

      "Abstract": "The problem of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions presents a set of unique theoretical challenges – from the relevant production mechanism of $J/\\psi$s and $\\Upsilon$s \r\nto the relative significance of distinct cold and hot nuclear matter effects in the observed attenuation of quarkonia. In the well-defined leading power factorization limit of non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) we show conclusively that in spite of certain similarities in the suppression of $J/\\psi$s of moderate transverse momenta to the one of light/heavy hadrons, the familiar parton energy loss picture is distinctly incompatible with the hierarchy of the attenuation of ground and excited quarkonium states.  With this in mind, for heavy quarkonia of moderate energy we generalize the relevant successful theory NRQCD to include interactions in nuclear matter. The new resulting theory, NRQCD with Glauber gluons, provides for the first time a universal microscopic description of the interaction of heavy quarkonia with a strongly interacting medium, consistently applicable to a range of phases, such as cold nuclear matter, dense hadron gas, and quark-gluon plasma. The effective field theory we present in this work is derived from first principles and is an important step forward in understanding the common trends in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus data on quarkonium suppression. We explicitly show the lowest order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) interaction terms in the Lagrangian and discuss the connection of the LO result to existing phenomenology.",

We illustrate the formalism by calculating the differential cross section for scattering of a quark (or gluon) on a target proton or nucleus and show that inclusion of both small and large $x$ gluon modes in the target allows one to investigate forward-backward (in rapidity) asymmetries in high energy collisions. It also leads to both even and odd anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ in proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions as well as double spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ in polarized proton-proton (light nucleus) scattering.

Measuring the properties of the QGP such as the temperature or transport coefficients relies on whether it is possible to reliably separate the production of the probe and the formation of the medium. This concept is known as QCD factorization. Starting from an established factorization formalism in proton-proton collisions, we introduce medium modified jet functions to capture the interaction of jets with the QGP. Within a global analysis using a Monte Carlo sampling technique we find that it is indeed possible to describe the data obtained at the LHC. Our results thus support the validity of QCD factorization in the complex heavy-ion environment, and open up a new door to analyze heavy-ion jet data. In addition, our results may serve as guidance for constructing microscopic models of the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "Cross sections for photon production in hadronic scattering processes have been calculated according to an effective chiral field theory. For $\\pi + \\rho \\to \\pi  + \\gamma$  and  $\\pi + \\pi \\to \\rho  + \\gamma$  processes, these cross sections have been implemented into a novel hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which is suitable for collisions at low and intermediate energies. The implementation is verified by systematically comparing the thermal photon rate to theoretical expectations. The impact of form factors is assessed, and scattering processes mediated by ω mesons are found to contribute significantly to the total photon production. The photon rates we obtain are compared with parametrizations commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations, and also with previous works addressing the production of direct photons from the hadronic stage. Finally, the impact of considering the finite width of the $\\rho$ meson is investigated, and a significant enhancement of photon production in the low-energy region is observed. This work is the first step towards a consistent treatment of photon emission in hybrid hydrodynamics+transport approaches, and towards a genuine dynamical description. It will further quantify the importance of the hadronic stage for the resolution of \"the direct photon flow puzzle\" and can be applied to identify equilibrium and non-equilibrium effects in the hadronic afterburner.\r\n\r\nReferences: \r\nA.

      "Abstract": "We present the first study quantifying the sensitivity of hadron and photon observables to the early-time evolution in heavy-ion collisions which implements a realistic pre-equilibrium stage with effective QCD kinetic theory [1, 2] and a state-of-the-art hybrid (IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD) framework [3]. We calculate photon emission from the pre-equilibrium phase by folding the system's energy momentum-tensor with thermal photon emission rates including their viscous corrections. By changing switching  time and  coupling parameters inherent to the pre-equilibrium evolution, we study how the non-equilibrium phase influences the hadron and photon flow coefficients in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, and O+O collisions at 5 TeV. Because the space-time volume scales differently from the number of binary collisions from O+O to Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions, a systematic system size comparison of photon production can further shed light on the relative contributions from thermal and prompt sources and provide further insight into early time QGP dynamics.\r\n\r\nRecent Bayesian extractions of the QGP bulk viscosity using hadronic observables alone [4]  cannot disentangle easily a large narrow peak temperature dependence of bulk viscosity from a broader $\\zeta/s(T)$ with a lower maximum value. Utilizing the power of photons as clean and penetrating probes, we demonstrate how thermal photon production and its flow coefficients can improve constraints on QGP bulk viscosity owing to its sensitivity to early stages of the QGP evolution.\r\n\r\n[1] A.

      "Abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, one expects copious rates of $\\gamma+\\gamma$ processes through the interaction of the large electromagnetic fields of the nuclei, which can produce new particles (e.g. leptons) or even lead to light-by-light scattering via loop diagrams.  The latter process is a notable prediction of QED and was only recently observed by ATLAS using the full 2018 dataset.  In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), characterized by large impact parameter between the nuclei, the outgoing leptons and photons are produced exclusively, and exhibit a strong back-to-back momentum correlation, with long tails induced by higher-order QED effects. This talk presents measurements of dilepton production and light-by-light scattering performed by the ATLAS collaboration.  The angular correlations as well as differential production cross sections in UPCs are measured and compared to theoretical models, including final state QED radiation.  The role of forward neutron production in disentangling pure QED and dissociative processes will also be discussed.  Finally, limits on axion-like particle production, from the observed light-by-light cross sections, will be discussed.  Muon pairs produced the same two-photon scattering process in hadronic Pb+Pb collisions also potentially provide a sensitive probe of the quark gluon plasma.  First measurements by ATLAS and STAR of dileptons produced via two-photon scattering in non-ultra-peripheral (non-UPC) nucleus-nucleus collisions showed an unexpected centrality-dependent broadening of the angular correlation between the two leptons and/or of the two-lepton $p_T$ distribution. ATLAS has recently measured dimuons produced via two-photon scattering in non-UPC Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$~TeV using data collected during the 2018 Pb+Pb run at the LHC corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1.73~\\mathrm{nb}^{-1}$.  This data set represents a factor of $\\sim4$ increase in statistics over the 2015 data set used for the first ATLAS measurement.  The increased statistics allow new features to be observed in the data, as well as differential studies of the dependence of the pair-distribution on the transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity of the two muons.  The results of the new measurement and the possible physics implications will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are expected to produce some of the strongest magnetic fields ($10^{13}−10^{16}$ Tesla) in the Universe [1]. Recently, there has been intense interest in the magnetic fields produced by heavy ion collisions and their possible observational impacts through phenomena like the Chiral Magnetic Effect. The initial strong electromagnetic fields produced in heavy ion collisions have been proposed as a source of linearly-polarized, quasi-real photons [2] that can interact to produce $e^+e^−$ pairs.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present STAR measurements of $e^+e^−$ pair production in ultra-peripheral and peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Multi-differential measurements of the pair kinematics are presented to distinguish the $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow e^+e^−$ process from other possible production mechanisms. These measurements provide an important experimental tool and baseline for the possible measurement of medium effects driven by strong final state magnetic fields or from Coulomb multiple scattering through the QGP.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we present the first observation of a 4th-order azimuthal modulation of $e^+e^−$ pairs produced in heavy ion collisions. The observed 4th-order angular modulation, a result predicted for the collision of linearly-polarized photons [3], has general implications for fermion, anti-fermion pair production in the collision of polarized fields.

This is demonstrated by the reduced sensitivity on the choice of non-flow subtraction methods as well as a closure test of these methods with the HIJING and AMPT models; 3) the $v_2$ signal is also extracted using four-particle subevent cumulant method in d+Au and $^3$He+Au, and compared with that from two-particle correlations to gain insight on the flow fluctuations in small systems.

The kinetic theory results are compared to data on azimuthal flow coefficients over a wide centrality range in PbPb collisions at the LHC, in AuAu collisions at RHIC, and in pPb collisions at the LHC.  By comparing kinetic transport to viscous fluid dynamics we find that non-hydrodynamic excitations make the dominant contribution to collective flow signals in pPb collisions at the LHC and contribute significantly to flow in peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions, while fluid-like excitations dominate collectivity in central nucleus-nucleus collisions at collider energies.",

      "Abstract": "It is the aim of the RHIC BES program and the future FAIR and NICA facilities to produce compressed baryonic matter. In such experiments, strong gradients in baryon density are expected, and therefore the diffusion of baryon number could play a major role in the description of the fireball. The constituents of the produced matter carry a multitude of conserved charges, namely the baryon number, strangeness and electric charge, so that the diffusion currents of conserved charge couple with each other. Therefore, baryon density gradients in the above-mentioned high-density collision experiments will generate equalizing currents in all conserved charges. In common fluid dynamic studies of the evolution of the fireball, this coupling of currents was not accounted for. We provide for the first time a fluid dynamical approach including the complete diffusion coefficient matrix describing the evolution of a dense system with multiple conserved charges. A novel phenomenon arising from the coupled diffusion currents is the generation of positive and negative net-strangeness domains from originally net-strangeness neutral matter.  We show how these domains are generated dynamically, and argue that observing the rapidity dependence of net-strangeness can give an experimental access to diffusion.",

The suppression is observed to have little dependence on $p_{T}$, although cold nuclear matter effects, such as shadowing, anti-shadowing, nuclear or comover absorption, play a significant role at low $p_{T}$. Measurements of the $J/\\Psi$ production in p+A collisions can help us to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects from the hot medium effects in A+A collisions. In this talk, we will present the measurement of $J/\\Psi$ production in p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ will be presented as a function of the event activity (i.e. \"centrality\") and compared to theoretical models. In addition, we will present recent STAR measurements of $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ production in p+p collisions including their dependence on the charged-particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity.

For the strangeness neutral case ($\\mu_S=0$) at fixed ratio of electric charge to baryon number density ($\\frac{n_Q}{n_B}=0.4$), which is appropriate for a comparison with heavy ion collisions, we present results for $\\kappa_X \\sigma_X^2$ and  $S_X \\sigma_X$ and $S_X \\sigma_X^3/M_X, (X=B,Q,S)$ on the crossover line for the chiral transition ($T_{pc}(\\mu_B)$). Continuum extrapolations for this pseudo-critical transition line have recently been reported by HotQCD up to baryon chemical potentials $\\mu_B\\simeq 300$ MeV (arXiv:1812.08235). These cumulant ratios thus are of direct relevance for comparisons with corresponding ratios measured by STAR in the BES-I and II runs at beam energies  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge 20$ GeV. In particular, we point out that recent high  statistics results on skewness and kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions obtained by STAR at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV put strong constraints on freeze-out parameters and are consistent with predictions from thermal QCD. Additionally, we show that, unlike in the case of net-baryon number  fluctuations, the kurtosis ratios for strangeness and electric charge are  only weakly dependent on $\\mu_B$.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we also construct Taylor series for baryon-strangeness and baryon-charge correlations up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu_B^4)$ and present results for these observables on the crossover transition line. We point out that these correlations are dominated by correlations in the baryon sector of QCD, which is consistent with recent findings of the STAR collaboration (arXiv:1903.05370). Correlations of proton fluctuations with kaon or pion fluctuations, respectively, thus are poor proxies for studying such correlations on the freeze-out line in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The collective flow and the possible formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in the small colliding systems are hot research topics in the heavy-ion community. Recently, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations have measured the elliptic flow and the related number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of identified hadrons in p+Pb collisions at  $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV, which are important observables to probe the partonic degree of freedom in the created small system. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we focus on the coalescence model calculations for the NCQ scaling of  at intermediate $p_T$ for the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions, which includes thermal-thermal, thermal-jet and jet-jet partons recombinations, using the thermal partons from hydrodynamics and jet partons after the energy loss of the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. Such coalescence model calculations have also been smoothly connected with the low hydrodynamic calculation and with high jet fragmentation. Within such combined framework, we present a nice description of the spectra and elliptic flow over the $p_T$ range from 0 to 6 GeV, and obtain the approximately NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$ as measured in experiment. We also switch off the coalescence process of partons and find that without such coalescence, one can not describe the differential elliptic flow and related NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$.  Such comparison calculations also demonstrate the importance of the partonic degree of freedom and indicate the possible formation of QGP in the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions.",

The multiplicity is measured using forward scintillation detectors that are separated in phase-space from the central region where the trigger and jet are measured. A data-driven statistical method is used to correct for uncorrelated jet background, which includes multi-partonic interactions. This trigger-normalized coincidence approach does not require the association of event activity with collision geometry in order to measure jet quenching, in contrast to inclusive observables, and has been used to set a stringent limit on jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions at the LHC. The magnitude of jet quenching is quantified by comparing recoil jet distributions for low and high-multiplicity pp collisions.",

However, so far no clear  demonstration of jet energy losses in small system collisions have been observed.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present correlations of mid-rapidity charged particles to backward-rapidity (Au-going direction) event activity (EA) in 200 GeV p+Au collisions at STAR. They demonstrate an expected positive correlation between high EA at backward-rapidity and the probability of finding a high energy particle at mid-rapidity. Intriguingly, this correlation softens for increasingly energetic triggers. We will also present  semi-inclusive jet spectra at mid-rapidity which, due to self normalization, avoid the difficulties of applying the Glauber model in small systems. The measured high-EA spectrum is distinctly suppressed relative to the low-EA spectrum. We will present comparison of these results to those in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively. EA-dependent modification of the jet spectrum has been observed at the LHC but only for jets at forward-rapidities and appears to scale with Bjorken-$x$. The presented mid-rapidity jet spectra span a similar Bjorken-$x$ range, allowing the Bjorken-$x$ scaling to be tested.",

This experiment will offer the possibility to find signatures of discontinuous transition from QGP to hadronic phase and the QCD critical point where the first order phase transition ends. In the search of the QCD phase transition and its speculated critical point, the most reliable way is to study the fluctuations of conserved charges such as net-baryon (B), net-charge (Q), and net-strangeness (S) number with collision energy in the event by event basis. \r\n\r\nWe will discuss the feasibility studies of conserved charge fluctuations in Au--Au collisions with CBM at SIS100 energies.Au--Au minimum bias events are generated at $E_{lab} = 10$ AGeV using UrQMD model and transported through the CBM detector setup using GEANT3. The CBM detector setup for hadronic physics consists of Micro Vertex Detector (MVD), Silicon Tracking System (STS), Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Time-of-Flight Detector (TOF) covering a pseudo-rapidity range, $1.5< \\eta< 3.8$. The particle identification is done using TOF detector. The simulations results on higher order cumulants of net-charge, net-proton (proxy for net-baryon) and mixed cumulants of\r\nproton-kaon (proxy for baryon-strangeness correlation) within the CbmRoot framework at SIS100 energy region will be presented.

The four-particle cumulants for elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, and triangular flow, $v_{3}$, exhibit a strong centrality dependence and change sign in ultra-central collisions. This sign change is consistent with significant non-Gaussian fluctuations in $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. The four-particle cumulant for quadrangular flow, $v_{4}$, is found to change sign in mid-central collisions. Correlations between two harmonics are found to decrease in strength towards central collisions and either approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse momentum dependent. \r\nThese results provide new information to disentangle flow fluctuations from the initial and final states, as well as new insights on the influence of flow observables by centrality fluctuations.",

      "Abstract": "We present two approaches to handle the dominant elliptic flow ($v_2$) background in the observable, $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$  (charge separation across second-order event plane), sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect (CME).\r\n\r\nIn the first approach, we present the $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ and $\\Delta\\gamma_{123}$ measurements in U+U and Au+Au collisions. While hydrodynamic simulations including resonance decays and local charge conservation predict that $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ scaled by $N_{\\rm part}/v_2$ will be similar in U+U and Au+Au collisions, the projected B-field exhibits a distinct difference between the two systems and with varying $N_{ \\rm part}$. Therefore, U+U and Au+Au collisions provide a two-system configuration to contrast signal and background expectations for the CME. The charge separation across third-order event plane $\\Delta\\gamma_{123}$ scaled by $N_{\\rm part}/v_3$ provides necessary system dependence only from backgrounds. Although some features of our data appear to hint CME interpretation driven by B-field, the background expectations capture most of the observed trends at 200 GeV. We repeat our measurements with the recent high statistics Au+Au collisions data at 27 GeV to see if such a trend persists at lower collision energies. The newly installed forward event plane detector helps to suppress non-flow correlations.\r\n\r\nIn the second approach, we handle the $v_2$ background by measuring $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$ with respect to the planes of spectators $\\Psi_{ \\rm ZDC}$ and elliptic anisotropy $\\Psi_2$. These measurements contain different amounts of contributions from CME signal (along B-field, due to spectators) and $v_2$ background (determined by the participant geometry). With the two $\\Delta\\gamma_{112}$  measurements, the possible CME signal and the background contribution can be determined. Applying this method, we have previously reported the measurements of possible CME signal fraction in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, revealing dominant background contribution. Here, we report our findings in U+U collisions where the spectator-participant plane correlations are expected to differ from those in Au+Au collisions.",

The mixed-event technique along with the semi-inclusive approach is further developed for the fragmentation measurement, and applied accordingly to isolate contributions from hard-scattered partons.  We attempt to correct for uncorrelated background effects and instrumental effects in the fragmentation functions, and will present preliminary results for central and peripheral collisions. Similarly, the differential jet shapes are constructed by summing the charged particle yields in radial distance from the jet core weighted by $\\it{p}_{T}$ of the corresponding charged particles.  The presented results will extend the kinematic range offered at the LHC to lower $\\it{p}_{T}$ and demonstrate whether there is a modification and a broadening of the jet profile at RHIC energies.

The masses of possible charmonium states from calculations using constituent quark models are too large, and therefore an explanation of the underlying characteristics of this meson remains a challenge. The similarity of the $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ mass and the $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ mass threshold inspired the interpretation that $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is a $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” with small binding energy. Another explanation is that this meson is a tetra-quark, consisting of a di-quark and di-antiquark. Relativistic heavy ion collisions produce an extremely hot and strongly interacting medium, which provides a new environment in which to study the nature of multi-quark states. Because of the dramatically different radii of a $D-\\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” and a tetra-quark, the interactions of these two proposed states are expected to interact differently with the medium. Therefore, the yield of $\\chi_{c1}(3872)$ in heavy ion collisions can provide insight into its structure.

      "Abstract": "The study of the QCD interaction at high temperature in the heavy quark (HQ) sector has attracted a wide interest in the last decade. The theoretical efforts to build realistic phenomenological models able to predict the main observables for D mesons, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, has lead to a first estimate of the Ds space diffusion of charm quarks. This has been a successful program that  has allowed to have a general consensus that the charm quark interaction is non-perturbative, the estimated Ds is in agreement with current lattice QCD calculations and its thermalization time is of the order of QGP lifetime [1].\r\nGiven the success of this first stage of the study, very recently new important perspectives are emerging. These can lead from one hand to improving the determination of Ds and on the other hand open the way for employing HQ as a novel probe of the initial stage of the ultra-relativistic collisions. \r\nMore directly related to the determination of the HQ diffusion and hadronization are:\r\n- The surprisingly large $\\Lambda_c$ production at both RHIC and LHC energies. We will show that this affects the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ also of the D meson and hence the determination of the HQ interaction [2]. We show also that an hadronization by coalescence plus fragmentation can largely account for this new finding and discuss new prediction for $\\Lambda_b$/B ratio. \r\n- The correlation between the $v_n$ anisotropies of the bulk matter and the one of HQs ($v_n(light), v_n(heavy)$) and, in particular, the normalized variance of $\\sigma_n/ < v_n >$ constitute a novel and more powerful tool to constraint the Ds transport coefficient [3]. \r\n\r\nHQs have been poorly explored as a probe of the initial vorticity and electromagnetic field. We will show that a large directed flow v1 can be generated by the longitudinal initial tilt along with a splitting between D0 and anti-D0 [3]. The last can be seen also as a probe of the deconfined phase. Predictions in agreement with preliminary STAR data will be presented together with first results compared to ALICE data. A correlation study of the D0 splitting in $v_1$ with the one of muons from Z0 decay can provide a new insight into the determination of the initial magnetic field and its lifetime.\r\nFurthermore, we will show a novel approach that studies the potential impact of a glasma phase on the HQ dynamics and how this can provide a link between pA and AA collisions [4].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] X.Dong and V.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "The last decade of hadron spectroscopy has unveiled a wealth of states that do not have the properties expected of particles composed of 2 or 3 valence quarks.  Among the most intriguing of these exotics is the X(3872), which various models attempt to describe as a hadronic molecule, a compact tetraquark, an unexpected charmonium state, or their mixtures.  To date, most experimental studies of the X(3872) have focused on its production through B meson decays.  Heavy ion collisions, as well as high multiplicity pp collisions, offer a new window on the properties of this poorly understood hadron.  In these systems, promptly produced X(3872) hadrons can interact with other particles in the nucleus and/or those produced in the collision. The influence of these interactions on the observed X(3872) yields provides information that can help discriminate between the various models of its structure, as well as give insight into the dynamics of the bulk particles produced in these collisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a full range of precision vertexing, tracking, and particle ID capabilities covering 2 to 5 in units of rapidity, the LHCb experiment is especially well suited to measurements of both prompt and non-prompt exotic hadrons.  This talk will present new LHCb measurements X(3872) production in high multiplicity pp collisions and pPb collisions through the decay to $J/\\psi \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$. This is the first measurement of any exotic hadron in collisions involving a large nucleus.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "A remarkable achievement of the relativistic heavy-ion program is the realization that relativistic fluid dynamics can describe the evolving system of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from its early moments to a time when the growing mean-free-paths drive the system out of equilibrium. The effectiveness of this hydrodynamic description is judged by comparing calculated hadronic observables with experimental measurements. Alternatively, electromagnetic radiation could be considered a more distinguishing signal as it is emitted throughout the evolution of the hadronic system. Considerable work has gone into the calculation of photons [1] and dileptons [2] using modern hydrodynamic approaches, however, the calculation of the electromagnetic emissivity of the pre-hydro stage is currently less advanced. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we use a transport approach that models the time-evolution of gluons and fermions by solving coupled Boltzmann transport equations in the diffusion approximation [3]. The transport equations are solved numerically to study how the system relaxes towards equilibrium. The initial state is a gluon distribution of a form inspired by the colour glass picture, where quarks and anti-quarks are then generated through interactions.  The early stage evolution is modeled by a 1D expansion, during which non-equilibrium parton interactions can also produce real and virtual photons. We show how reliably these Glasma photons can report on the initial momentum anisotropy of the early parton distributions and on the presence or absence of a transient Bose-Einstein condensate of gluons. Additionally, we show that the non-equilibrium contribution can leave an imprint on the low $p_T$ spectrum of the measured photons and estimate the effect of the anisotropy on the spectrum measured at RHIC and at the LHC (i.e. the photon $v_2$ puzzle). This opens the exciting possibility that measurements of the electromagnetic signal can access fine details of the partonic distributions as they appear during the very first instants of heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n[1] Jean-François Paquet, Chun Shen, Gabriel S.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Merging binaries of neutron stars are not only strong sources of gravitational waves, but also have the potential of revealing states of matter at densities and temperatures not accessible in laboratories. A crucial and longstanding question in this context is whether quarks are deconfined as a result of the dramatic increase in density and temperature following the merger. We present the first fully general-relativistic simulations of merging neutron stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched off consistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we can determine clearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase transition would leave in the gravitational-wave signal. We show that if after the merger the conditions are met for a phase transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation density, they would lead to a post-merger signal considerably different from the one expected from the inspiral, that can only probe the hadronic part of the equations of state, and to an anticipated collapse of the merged object. We also show that the phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core that, when it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different from the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in heavy-ion collisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and density in the merger remnant to illustrate the properties of the phase transition in a QCD phase diagram.\r\n\r\n**Primary reference:** Phys.Rev.Lett. 122 (2019) no.6, 061101.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Based on Refs. [1] and [2], we discuss the new constraints on gluon parton distribution function (PDF) in lead nucleus, derivable with the Hessian PDF reweighting method from the 5.02 TeV p+Pb measurements of CMS dijet [3] and LHCb $D^0$-meson [4] nuclear modification ratios. The impact is found to be significant, placing stringent constraints in the mid- and previously unconstrained small-$x$ regions. The CMS dijet data confirm the existence of gluon anti-shadowing and onsetting of small-$x$ shadowing, as well as reduce the gluon PDF uncertainties in the larger-$x$ region. The gluon constraints from the LHCb $D^0$ data, reaching down to $x \\sim 10^{-5}$ and derived for the first time in a fully NLO perturbative QCD based approach, provide a remarkable reduction in the small-$x$ uncertainties with a strong direct evidence of gluon shadowing. Furthermore, we find a good description of the data even down to zero transverse momentum of the produced $D^0$-meson within a purely DGLAP-based approach without the need of imposing any non-linear effects. Importantly, the constraints obtained from the dijet and $D^0$ data are mutually fully consistent, supporting the universality of nuclear PDFs in hard-scattering processes.\r\n\r\n[1] K.J. Eskola, P.

      "Abstract": "One of the most important objectives of Beam energy scan (BES) program at the Relativistic Heavy ion collider (RHIC) is to search for the critical point in the QCD matter via performing nucleus-nucleus collisions with wide collision energies (7.7 - 200 GeV). At such energies, the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter has sizable net baryon density at the central rapidity region due to baryon stopping power. Therefore, the dissipation of net-baryon current plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense QCD matter produced in RHIC-BES heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic has been very successful in describing the collective behavior of the QGP fireball at zero chemical potential. In order to study the properties of QGP and the dissipative phenomena of net baryon current at a non-zero baryon environment of the BES energies, we extend the CLVisc [1, 2] hydrodynamic model to include the  equation of net baryon charge conservation and Israel-Stewart-like equations about dissipative baryon current with NEOSB [3] equation of state. Assuming instantaneous smooth energy density and net baryon density distribution at the initial proper time, we study the impact of the net-baryon dissipation on particle yields, pT spectra and anisotropic flows in the final state of BES heavy-ion collisions.\r\n[1] Pang, Long-Gang et al.

Recently, the Signed Balance Function (SBF), based on the idea of examining the momentum ordering of charged pairs along the in- and out-of-plane directions, has been proposed as a probe of  Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [1].  In this approach a pair of observables are invoked, they are, the out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of fluctuation of the difference between signed balance functions measured in pairs rest frame ($r_{rest}$), and the ratio ($R_{B} = r_{rest}/r_{lab}$) of it to a similar measurement made in the laboratory frame ($r_{lab}$). These two observables give opposite responses to the CME-driven charge separation and background correlations arising from resonance flow and global spin alignment. \r\n\r\nIn this talk,  we will present $r_{rest}$ and $R_{B}$ measurements in Au+Au collisions at 200GeV.

In this talk, we consider parton propagation in cold nuclear matter within the framework of high-twist expansion, which has been shown to be a successful approach to describe the nuclear effects as observed in heavy ion collisions. Through global analysis of world data on transverse momentum broadening in semi-inclusive eA deep inelastic scattering, Drell-Yan process and heavy quarkonium production in pA collisions, as well as the nuclear modification of the structure functions in DIS related to the coherent dynamical shadowing, we perform the first global extraction of jet transport coefficient for cold nuclear matter. This provide the first evidence that the medium transport property, rather than a constant value as commonly used in heavy ion collisions, depends on the probing scale similar to that in standard parton distribution functions of proton. We expect the extracted scale dependence of qhat for cold nuclear matter can be extended to precisely identify the fundamental property of quark gluon plasma.",

The time-evolution of the momentum diffusion coefficient extracted from all three methods is consistent with an approximate $t^\\frac{-1}{2}$ power law. We also study the extracted diffusion coefficient as a function of the upper limit of the time integration. We find that combining HTL expressions with the infrared enhancement of the equal-time correlation function that we have observed improves the agreement with the data for transient time behavior considerably.

      "Abstract": "As a conserved quantity in the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions, the total angular momentum consists of two sectors: the orbital angular momentum (OAM) caused by kinetic motion, and the intrinsic spin angular momentum of quarks and gluons. In a heavy-ion collision event, the system starts with finite OAM but un-polarized spin density (unless prepared specifically). Microscopic scattering processes allow a coupling between these two components. Therefore, spin polarization can eventually develop that may have a non-trivial influence on the QGP evolution. In the current hydrodynamic frameworks, the stress tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ is assumed to be symmetric, hence OAM and spin are conserved independently, and the spin effect is mostly neglected. A hydrodynamic theory, with the aforementioned spin polarization effect properly taken into account, is required, especially for quantitative studies of the polarization rate of observed hadrons, e.g. $\\Lambda$-hyperon. The latter has been observed in RHIC experiment, serving as an evidence of the most vortical fluid in the universe.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we start with **chiral kinetic theory** and construct the **spin hydrodynamic framework** for a chiral spinor system. We obtain the equations of motion of **second-order dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics with non-trivial spin polarization density**. In a chiral spinor system, the spin alignment effect could be treated in the same framework as for Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE). However, the fluid vorticity induces not only the CVE current but also asymmetric stress tensor as well as spin polarization of final state hadrons, all of which emerge as quantum corrections. The consequences for current measurements related to angular momentum observables will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "A primary goal in heavy-ion collisions is to learn about non-equilibrium properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the size of its thermalization timescale and the values of its transport coefficients. Hard experimental probes like jets and heavy quarks, as well as photons [1], give direct access to these non-equilibrium properties. However, theoretical challenges have hindered calculating their dynamics in a non-equilibrium QGP. Some of these challenges stem from gauge field instabilities that arise in non-equilibrium, weakly-coupled plasma, and lead to exponentially growing gauge fields [2]. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we show how to handle the gauge field instabilities consistently. We first derive the time evolution of gluon correlators analytically. Building on the formalism elaborated in [1] then allows for a microscopic calculation of jet-medium interaction in a non-thermal QGP. Specifically, we evaluate how jets radiate gluons when they traverse a non-equilibrium medium and show that the medium effects can be factorized into transverse kicks on the jet [3] and a new Schwinger-like effect in the exponentially growing gauge fields. We solve the resulting equations numerically and comment on phenomenological implications for jets and photons. Our calculations not only apply to jets, but also to the kinetic theory of quarks and gluons. We compare our results to commonly used simplifications of the collision kernel in numerical kinetic theory calculations. Finally, we discuss how to explore the effect of non-equilibrium physics on other probes of the QGP, such as the heavy-quark potential. \r\n\r\n[1] S. Hauksson et al., Phys. Rev.

      "Abstract": "The production of light neutral mesons in AA collisions probes the physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is formed in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. More specifically, the centrality dependent neutral meson production in AA collisions compared to its production in minimum-bias pp collisions, known as nuclear modification factor, provides information on the energy loss of partons traversing the QGP. The measurement allows to test with high precision the predictions of theoretical model calculations. In addition, the decay of the $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ mesons are the dominant backgrounds for all direct photon measurements. Therefore, pushing the limits of the precision of neutral meson production is key to learning about the temperature and space-time evolution of the QGP.\r\n\r\nIn the ALICE experiment neutral mesons can be detected via their decay to two photons. The latter can be reconstructed using the two calorimeters EMCal and PHOS or via conversions in the detector material. Combining the excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low $p_{T}$ and the high reconstruction efficiency and triggering capability of calorimeters at high $p_{T}$, we are able to measure the light neutral mesons over a wide kinematic range.\r\n\r\nCombining state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques with the high statistics delivered by the LHC in Run 2 gives us the opportunity to enhance the precision of our measurements. In this talk, new run 2 results for neutral meson production in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at LHC energies, as measured with the ALICE experiment, will be presented and contrasted with theoretical predictions.",

      "Abstract": "A wide variety of recent measurements from small systems indicate that there are collective flow phenomena in these systems, which are well described by hydrodynamics. However, it is widely understood that all flow measurements are affected by non-flow correlations. In order to disentangle the genuine hydrodynamical flow from other contributions, we have systematically studied the $v_2$ as a function of $p_T$ and $\\eta$ in p+Au and d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with a mixture of different detector combinations and by comparing several non-flow subtraction methods. We have also measured 4-particle cumulants in p+Au and d+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with subevents, which kinematically suppress non-flow via removal of short-range correlations. As found in heavy ion collisions, the quark mass dependence of the flow will further provide an evidence of collective effects. PHENIX has measured $v_2$ vs $p_T$ of muons at forward rapidity originating from heavy quark decays in d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We will show these results and discuss implications for the underlying mechanism that drives both light and heavy quark collectivity.",

      "Abstract": "High energy jets, evolving from a single parton, produced with transverse momentum up to a TeV, have a variety of scale dependent interactions with the QGP. The mass of heavy-quarks introduce another scale within this evolution. Modeling both the heavy quark shower and the fluid dynamical medium event by event, we demonstrate that in the high virtuality portion of a jet, where the dead-cone effect can be ignored, light and heavy-flavor evolution are indeed similar. However, in the later lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of the parton, heavy quarks radiate differently. Recently, it has been suggested that longitudinal drag and diffusion can stimulate radiation from heavy-quarks. The effect of this new channel is shown to partially compensate for the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. All these factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy flavors (and heavy-flavor tagged jets).\r\n\r\nWe present an extensive, comparative study that explores the importance of differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms with a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a multi-stage calculation within the JETSCAPE Framework [2]. The highly virtual and very energetic portion of the shower inside the QGP is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models the energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quark’s showering inside with the QGP. The shower transitions from one stage to the other at a parton-by-parton level depending on the energy and virtuality of the parton, and the local density. The boundary between these stages can be extracted from a comparison with data. This allows us to explore the effect and interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium. Energy momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, is carried out using a weak coupling recoil approach.",

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Relativistic heavy-ion experiments have observed similar quenching effects for (prompt) $D$ mesons compared to charged hadrons for transverse momenta larger than 6-8 GeV, which remains a mystery since heavy quarks typically lose less energies in quark-gluon plasma than light quarks and gluons. Recent measurements of the nuclear modification factors of $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons by the CMS Collaboration provide a unique opportunity to study the flavor hierarchy of jet quenching. Using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics simulation, we study the energy loss and nuclear modification for heavy and light flavor jets in high-energy nuclear collisions. By consistently taking into account both quark and gluon contributions to light and heavy flavor hadron productions within a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD framework, we obtain, for the first time, a satisfactory description of the experimental data on the nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons, $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons simultaneously over a wide range of transverse momenta (8-300 GeV). This presents a solid solution to the flavor puzzle of jet quenching and constitutes a significant step towards the precision study of jet-medium interaction. Our study predicts that at transverse momenta larger than 30-40 GeV, $B$ mesons also exhibit similar suppression effects to charged hadrons and $D$ mesons, which may be tested by future measurements.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n[1] Wen-Jing Xing, Shanshan Cao, Guang-You Qin, and Hongxi Xing, arXiv:1906.00413",

      "Speaker": "Xiaojun Yao",
      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma. The initial insight was that due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark-antiquark pair is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they “melt”. In addition to the screening of the color attraction, quarkonium dissociates when enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process. The inverse process of dissociation, recombination, can also happen inside the medium when the plasma temperature allows quarkonium formation and is as crucial as dissociation. To explain experimental results on quarkonium production, we have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. One traditional approach is to use a transport equation through which the phase space distribution of quarkonium is evolved. In recent years, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. It is learnt that dissociation can be understood as a decoherence of the wavefunction of the heavy quark-antiquark pair. Recombination is automatically included in this framework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will present a connection between the open quantum system formalism and the transport equation. I will discuss new insights about the quarkonium dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of quantum information. I will show that under the weak coupling and Markovian approximations, the evolution equation of the open system, the Lindblad equation, turns to a Boltzmann transport equation after a Wigner transform is applied to the system density matrix. I will demonstrate how the separation of physical scales justifies the approximations, by using effective field theory of QCD. Finally, by coupling the transport equations of quarkonia and open heavy flavors, I will study how the system of open and hidden heavy flavors reaches thermal equilibrium inside a quark-gluon plasma box. Phenomenological results on the nuclear modification factor and the azimuthal angular anisotropy of quarkonium, based on the coupled transport equations will also be presented.",

      "Speaker": "Weiyao Ke",
      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The heavy-flavor transport coefficients contain important information on the strong interaction at finite temperatures. Extraction of these numbers from experimental data requires dynamical modeling of heavy-flavor transport that is coupled to a realistic medium evolution. Furthermore, meaningful extractions necessitate both a faithful implementation of the physical inputs to be tested and the quantification of model uncertainty. For these purposes, we have developed a partonic transport model LIDO. It has improved treatment of in-medium parton bremsstrahlung, which has been calibrated to analytical theoretical baselines in a simple medium to reduce modeling uncertainty. Regarding the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium, few-body perturbative scatterings are applied to large-momentum transfer (Q) processes, while a diffusion equation models the dynamics of small-Q processes. Such a separation restricts the explicit use of medium quasi-particles to large-Q processes only. Another advantage is that deviations from the leading-order probe-medium coupling can be parameterized as an additional contribution to the diffusion coefficient.\r\n\r\nThe heavy quark transport coefficients are then extracted with uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian analysis including both RHIC and LHC data. The results are found to be consistent with earlier extractions of the light-quark transport coefficients at high momentum and are comparable to lattice calculations of the heavy-flavor diffusion coefficient in the static limit at low momentum.",

      "Country": "McGill",
      "Abstract": "In this work we present an analysis of the role that the quark-gluon plasma resolution length, the minimal distance by which two nearby colored charges in a jet must be separated such that they engage with the plasma independently, plays in the understanding of modifications of jet substructure modification due to interaction with QGP. The shorter the resolution length of QGP is the better the resolving power of this medium. We identify a set of observables that are very sensitive to whether jets are quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the medium has the ability to resolve the internal structure of the jet instead. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose because it is very sensitive to effects of the particles coming from medium response, groomed observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings, the momentum sharing fraction, or the groomed mass are particularly well suited to discriminate the degree to which the medium resolves substructure within the jet. In order to find the optimal grooming configuration, we explore different cuts on the Lund plane that allow for a clear identification of the regions of phase space that enhance the difference in jet substructure between vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present data seems to disfavor an “infinite resolution length”, which is to say it disfavors the hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it were a single energetic colored object.  Our analysis indicates that as the precision of experimental measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over uncertainties in their calculation improves, it will become possible to use comparisons like this to constrain the value of the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma as well as to see how the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it.",

      "Abstract": "Parton energy loss has been established as an essential signature of the QGP in heavy ion collisions since the earliest measurements at RHIC indicating suppression of hadron spectra at high $p_{T}$ and coincidence yields. Understanding this phenomenon of jet quenching is a requirement for extracting the microscopic properties of the QGP via jet-tomography. STAR has recently introduced a technique called Jet Geometry Engineering (JGE) wherein we enforce particular selection criteria imposed on the jet collection, such as recoiling off a high $p_{T}$ hadron trigger along with an additional transverse momentum threshold for jet finding in events with back-to-back di-jets. With JGE, we are able to control the extent of energy loss ranging from quenched/imbalanced to recovered/balanced recoil jets. Since jet quenching is also expected to be dependent on the resolution/transverse-length scales with which the jet probes the medium, it is necessary to perform differential measurements with a handle on both momentum and angular scales. With the large 2014 Au+Au data sample at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV we are able to quantitatively constrain parton energy loss via JGE and measure it differentially as a function of both the jet $p_{T}$ and opening angle between the two leading sub-jets ($\\theta_{sj}$). We probe the medium response to jets at varying resolution scales by measuring the recoil jet yield and the di-jet asymmetry and search for significant differences between wide and narrow $\\theta_{sj}$ jets. These double differential measurements in $p_{T}$ and angle, along with JGE, enable us to probe the medium and its coherent or decoherent interaction with a hard scattered parton leading to partonic energy loss.",

This \r\ntechnique provides precise, data-driven suppression of the large uncorrelated background in such measurements. It uniquely enables the exploration of medium-induced modification of jet production and acoplanarity over wide phase space, including low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ for large jet resolution parameter $R$. This talk will report measurements of medium-induced jet energy redistribution through the comparison of trigger-normalized recoil jet yields \r\nin different centrality intervals and in pp reference collisions, and of jets with different $R$. Medium-induced jet deflection may also occur, with multiple soft scatterings broadening \r\nthe overall azimuthal correlation, and possible Moliere scatterings off quasi-particles in the medium broadening the tail of the correlation with respect to pp collisions. A search \r\nfor these phenemona in Run-1 data using hadron-jet acoplanarity showed no evidence of \r\nlarge-angle jet broadening with respect to vacuum expectation within experimental \r\nuncertainties. However, recent theoretical work has highlighted that low hadron trigger $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and low recoiling jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$ configurations show more sensitivity to in-medium modifications to the acoplanarity. We present a new measurement of hadron-jet acoplanarity using high-statistics Run-2 data, with emphasis on the region of low recoil jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$.\r\n\r\nTo study the jet profile, jet-hadron correlations will also be discussed. Jet-hadron correlations are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using ALICE data. The radial distribution of charged-hadrons is studied with respect to the jet axis. The associated charged hadron yields and peak widths are extracted from two-dimensional angular correlations as a function of associated hadron transverse momentum and event plane orientation and compared in different centrality intervals. The measurements are also compared to model predictions.",

      "Abstract": "The thermalized QCD matter formed in heavy-ion collisions is tilted in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity, while the production proﬁle of partons from hard scatterings is symmetric in rapidity [1]. This leads to a rapidity-odd directed ﬂow (v1) for high-pT hadrons and can provide valuable constraints on the initial longitudinal distribution of the ﬁreball as well as the path length-dependent energy loss of partons. Hydrodynamic models suggest that the double sign change of v1 slope (dv1/dy) at midrapidity for net baryon as a function of beam energy is a signature of the ﬁrst-order phase transition [2]. The light nuclei and strange hadrons might be more sensitive to the early EoS because of their heavy masses and smaller hadronic interaction cross section, respectively. Due to the diﬀerent sensitivity of strange particles to hadronic phases, the mass ordering of elliptic ﬂow (v2) is expected to be violated between proton and φ meson in the low-pT range (pT <1.5 GeV/c) [3].\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the new precise v1 measurement of π, K, p and φ in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 27, 54.4 GeV and deuteron at sNN = 7.7 to 39 GeV. The ﬁrst measurement of pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the v1 of high-pT (>5 GeV/c) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 54.4 and 200 GeV will be presented.

      "Abstract": "We propose a new scenario characterizing the transition of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions from a highly non-equilibrium state at early times toward a fluid described by hydrodynamics at late times. In this scenario, the bulk evolution is governed by a set of slow modes, after an emergent time scale τ_{Redu} when the number of modes that govern the bulk evolution of the system is reduced. These slow modes are \"pre-hydrodynamic\" in the sense that they are initially distinct from, but evolve continuously into, hydrodynamic modes in hydrodynamic limit. This picture is analogous to the evolution of a quantum mechanical system that is governed by the instantaneous ground states under adiabatic evolution, and will be referred to as \"adiabatic hydrodynamization\". We shall illustrate adiabatic hydrodynamization using a kinetic description of weakly-coupled Bjorken expanding plasma. We first show the emergence of τRedu due to the longitudinal expansion. We explicitly identify the pre-hydrodynamic modes for a class of collision integrals and find that they represent the angular distribution (in momentum space) of those gluons that carry most of the energy. We use the relaxation time approximation for the collision integral to show quantitatively that the full kinetic theory evolution is indeed dominated by pre-hydrodynamic modes. We elaborate on the criterion for the dominance of pre-hydrodynamic modes and argue that the rapidly-expanding QGP could meet this criterion. Based on this discussion, we speculate that adiabatic hydrodynamization may describe the pre-equilibrium behavior of the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions.",

Single electrons from semi-leptonic decays are an excellent channel to study open heavy ﬂavor due to their large branching fractions and triggering possibilities. Additionally, semi-leptonic c-hadron decays can provide a complimentary measurement of charm hadron directed ﬂow (v1).\r\nIn this talk we will present the analyses of single electrons from semi-leptonic b- and c- hadron decays at mid-rapidity in sNN = 200, 54.4, and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are unique tools to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to the large masses, heavy quarks \r\nare produced in hard scattering processes on timescales shorter than the QGP formation time, thus they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents.\r\n\r\nThe hot QCD matter is produced within an unprecedented strong magnetic field, which properties and effects can be probed by charm quarks via investigating the charm-particle \r\ndirected flow $v_{1}$, because the charm quark formation time scale is comparable to the time scale when the magnetic field attains its maximum value. The charm interaction with the medium constituents and its degree of thermalisation can be investigated via the measurement of the second coefficient of the D-meson azimuthal anisotropy, the elliptic flow $v_{2}$, that allows one to study whether low-momentum charm quarks participate in the collective expansion of the system. \r\nFurthermore, the role of the recombination mechanism \r\ncan be studied for charm via the comparison of non-strange D meson $v_{\\rm 2}$ with the $\\rm D_s$ meson $v_{\\rm 2}$. The dynamics of heavy quarks in the QGP can be further \r\ninvestigated through the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) analysis. Measuring the D-meson $v_{2}$ in classes of events defined on the basis of the average flow in a given centrality class allows to evaluate the correlation between the elliptic flow of soft hadrons and D mesons.\r\n\r\nThe interest in heavy-flavour measurements in small systems, like p-Pb and pp, have been for a long time limited to the possibility of providing tests of perturbative QCD, measurements of cold-matter effects in the nuclear medium, and the baseline for observations of hot-medium effects in heavy-ion collisions. However, such measurements have recently gained additional interest due to the possibility of observing final-state like effects typically attributed, in Pb-Pb collisions, to the presence of QGP. The orgin of such effects \r\nis still debated. In this contribution, the measurement of the ${\\rm D}^{0}$ $v_{1}$ together with strange and non-strange D meson $v_{2}$ and the $v_{2}$ ESE analysis in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV will be presented.

We introduce a concept of confluent connection which takes into account the relativity of \"equal time\" in the definition of the equal-time correlator of fluctuation. We also describe the procedure of renormalization of short-distance singularities which eliminates cutoff dependence, allowing efficient numerical implementation of these equations.",

      "Abstract": "We present a new method to calculate the final decay spectrum of direct resonance decays directly from hydrodynamic fields on a freeze-out surface. The method is based on identifying components of the final particle spectrum that transform in an irreducible way under rotations in the fluid-restframe. Corresponding  distribution functions can be pre-computed including all resonance decays. Just a few of easily tabulated scalar functions then determine the Lorentz invariant decay spectrum from each space-time point, and simple integrals of these scalar functions over the freeze-out surface determine the final decay products. This by-passes numerically costly event-by-event calculations of the intermediate  resonances. The method is of considerable practical use for making realistic data to model comparisons of the identified particle yields and flow harmonics, and for studying the viscous corrections to the freeze-out distribution function.\r\n\r\nReference: A.

      "Abstract": "For the discovery of the QCD critical point it is crucial to develop dynamical models of the fluctuations of the net-baryon number that can be embedded in simulations of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present the implementation of net-baryon number fluctuations near the critical point in an expanding system. We include the coupling to the fluctuations of energy density and momentum flow explicitly. We study the dynamical formation of the correlation length and its relation to the critical enhancement of higher-order cumulants for boost-invariant initial conditions. By adding second order fluid dynamical relaxation equations we distinguish between the propagative and the damped critical mode contributions.",
