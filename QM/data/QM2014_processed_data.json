This symmetric\r\ndouble-ridge pattern extends to large pseudorapidity difference. Long-range\r\ncorrelations were also observed in pp collisions with extreme multiplicity at\r\nLHC energies. The qualitative resemblance of the ridges in pp and p--Pb to\r\nflow-like correlations in Pb--Pb collisions still challenges our\r\nunderstanding of the small collision systems. Current explanations attribute\r\nthe collective effects to initial state saturation and hydrodynamic behavior\r\nof dense matter created in the collisions.\r\n\r\nSaturation effects in p--Pb are expected to be enhanced in the low-x\r\nregime of the nucleus that can be probed at forward rapidities. The ALICE\r\nmuon spectrometer with its forward pseudorapidity coverage can be used to\r\ndetect charged tracks in the range $-4<\\eta<-2.5$. Correlations between\r\nthese forward tracks and particles detected at midrapidity are used to study\r\nthe pseudorapidity dependence of the double ridge.",

Hence this study, on one hand, is a step towards removing the prevalent eikonal approximation in jet-quenching models and on the other hand revisits the notion of dead-cone within the non-eikonal region.",

      "Country": "NL",
      "Abstract": "Correlated unlike sign dielectrons provide important and relatively clean information to access the properties of the hot and dense matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Once they are produced, they traverse the fireball without interacting strongly with the medium. The collective behaviour of the dielectrons with respect to a global event plane provides rich information of the initial stage of the expanding fireball where flow starts developing. \r\n\r\nIn the central barrel ($|\\eta|<0.8$) of the ALICE experiment, electrons (and positrons) can be detected and identified by the Inner Tracking System, the Time Projection Chamber and the Time-Of-Flight. For the study of the dielectron elliptic flow at mid-rapidity, the VZERO scintillators at forward rapidity are used for event plane estimation to avoid auto-correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, a first attempt to measure the elliptic flow of dielectrons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV with the ALICE experiment is presented. An effort is put into removing the background $v_2$ from uncorrelated unlike sign dielectrons with the mixed-event approach. A comparison to the elliptic flow of identified particles measured in the same system, as well as measurements from experiments at RHIC will be discussed. This work is expected to be the first step towards the measurement of the elliptic flow of thermal photons radiated from the fireball, which is regarded as a unique probe to study the formation time of the QGP.",

We investigated the role that Hagedorn states- massive resonances with an exponential mass spectrum and large decay widths- play in the determination of particle ratios at LHC through a scenario of multiparticle reactions and dynamical chemical equilibrium within the hadron gas phase.  We show that it is possible to describe the lower $p/\\pi$ ratio at LHC while still obtaining the experimental ratio of $K/\\pi$ in the Hagedorn state scenario if the protons are underpopulated at the switching temperature from hydrodynamics to the hadron gas phase.",

Femtoscopy analysis allows us to extract information about size of the emission source.

We present results from a fluid dynamical model of the QCD phase transition in heavy ion collisions. Non-equilibrium effects in the evolution of the fluctuations of the order parameters are included via a stochastic propagation according to a Langevin equation. We observe the formation of a supercooled phase at the first-order phase transition and its subsequent fragmentation into domains in the order parameters and droplets in the baryon density. Potential experimental signals, such as an enhancement of higher harmonic flow coefficients, are discussed. Here, the correct treatment of the hadronic phase turns out to be crucial for the development and survival of experimental consequences of the first-order phase transition. Due to critical slowing down, which limits the growth of critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical point, we expect that the discovery of the first-order phase transition might experimentally be more feasible.",

Here we present theoretical calculations of jet shapes in proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at the LHC using soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluon interactions in the medium. We find that large phase space logarithms need to be resummed for precise theoretical predictions. The resummation is performed using renormalization group evolution between different jet scales. We also study the medium modification of the renormalization group evolution and generalize the method to calculate jet shapes in heavy ion collisions. We present a comparison between our calculations with the recent jet shape measurement at the LHC. We also discuss the path to resummation of longitudinal intra-jet observables, such as jet fragmentation functions.",

We show how this unique data can be used to learn about the ultra-dense matter in the compact star interior. The method relies on astro-seismology based on special global oscillation modes (r-modes) that emit gravitational waves. They would prevent pulsars from spinning with their observed high frequencies, unless the damping of these modes, determined by the microscopic properties of matter, can prevent this. We show that for each form of matter there is a distinct region in a frequency/spindown-rate diagram where r-modes can be present. We find that stars containing quark matter are consistent with both the observed radio and x-ray data, whereas for standard neutron stars so far unestablished, enhanced damping mechanisms would be required.",

      "Abstract": "One of the physics observables measured with the ALICE Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) are neutral mesons such as $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ that are reconstructed through their two-photon decay. The EMCal offers a complementary method to the neutral meson measurement with the ALICE tracking system and the PHOS spectrometer. High $p_{\\rm T}$ neutral mesons are used to study the modifications of partons in the medium that is created in heavy-ion collisions. In pp and p-Pb collisions, they can be used to study fragmentation functions, and modification of nuclear PDFs in the lead nucleus, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of high $p_{\\rm T}$ neutral mesons is challenging due to various reasons. First, they are a rare probe that requires the use of triggers to collect sufficient statistics for the measurement. Furthermore, the opening angle of the decay photon decreases with increasing transverse momentum and their electromagnetic showers in the detector showers in the detector have a higher probability to overlap. In this analysis, we focus on using separated showers for the neutral meson reconstruction. We will present the current status of high $p_{\\rm T}$ neutral meson measurement in the EMCal in pp collisions.",

Both of these conditions can be met in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations have small but non-vanishing effects on observables at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Because the amplitudes of the fluctuations are related to viscosity through the fluctuation-dissipation relation, the effects of fluctuations on observables may lead to an independent measurement of transport coefficients in quark-gluon plasma. Numerical simulation of the propagation of thermal noise is necessary even in the linearized limit, and can be used to examine the effect of thermal fluctuations on observables.",

      "Abstract": "We have investigated the properties of quarkonia in a complex potential which is obtained by the in-medium corrections to both the perturbative and nonperturbative term in the potential through the dielectric function in real-time formalism. In isotropic medium, the real-part of the potential becomes stronger\r\nand thus makes the quarkonia more bound whereas the (magnitude) \r\nimaginary-part too becomes larger and thus contribute\r\nmore to the thermal width, compared to the in-medium correction of the Coulomb term alone. With these cumulative observations, we studied the dissociation where a resonance is said to be dissolved in a medium when its binding energy decreases with temperature and eventually becomes equal to its width and have found that the bound states are now dissociated at higher\r\ntemperature, in the absence of nonperturbative term. \r\nFinally we extend our calculation to a medium which exhibits \r\na local momentum anisotropy and calculate both the real- and imaginary-part of potential, by the leading anisotropic corrections to the propagators. The presence of anisotropy makes the real-part of the potential more stronger while the imaginary-part is weakened slightly and hence width of\r\na particular resonance becomes narrower, compared to\r\nan isotropic medium. However, since the temperature\r\ncorrections to the imaginary-part is a small perturbation to the\r\nvacuum part, so overall the anisotropy makes the dissociation\r\ntemperatures higher, compared to isotropic medium.",

Previous measurements at RHIC have shown large suppression and azimuthal anisotopy of open heavy flavor hadrons. In order to further constrain medium properties using heavy flavor probes, the interaction of charm and beauty quarks must be measured separately.

Currently the best measurement at RHIC is made with neutral pions. Charged hadrons have independent sources of systematic uncertainty and thus can provide additional constraints. In PHENIX, the background from conversions and weak decays mimicking high $p_{T}$ particles has limited the measurement of charged hadron to $p_{T} < 10$ GeV/$c$. The recently installed silicon vertex tracker (VTX) will be used to reject this background allowing the measurement of charged hadrons out to $20$ GeV/$c$. The VTX is capable of performing precision tracking measurements of distance of closest approach to the primary vertex (DCA). Conversions and weak decays do not originate from the primary vertex and are vetoed with the VTX by rejecting tracks with large DCA. The status of high $p_{T}$ charged tracking and associated nuclear modification factors will be reported.",

Fundamental questions such as how and why the quark-gluon plasma behaves as a perfect fluid in the vicinity of the critical temperature, can only be fully addressed with world-class \r\njet observables at RHIC energies. Jet probes in medium are crucial to understand the coupling of the quark gluon plasma, the origin of this coupling, and the mechanism of rapid equilibration. During past three years, the PHENIX collaboration has developed a detector development plan for the next decade, referred as sPHENIX, which will incorporate electromagnetic (EMCAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimeters with a large pseudo-rapidity range, and full azimuthal coverage. The HCAL will be first large coverage hadronic calorimeter ever to be used at RHIC, and will enable a systematic study of jets in quark-gluon plasma. A novelty accordion inspired HCAL prototype based on scintillator plates and steel absorber plates has been constructed and tested using test beam at Fermilab. It has two longitudinal sections, and a total depth of 5 interaction length. In this poster, we will present the test beam performance, and single particle GEANT 4 simulation studies for the HCAL prototype.",

      "Speaker": "Peng Huo",
      "Institute": "Stony Brook University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Recent discovery of significant higher-order flow harmonics and theoretical study of the non-linear hydrodynamics have led to the realization of a large set of new event-by-event (EbyE) flow observables that can be measured in heavy-ion collisions. These observables can be expressed generally as a joint probability distribution of flow coefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\\Phi_n$, $p(v_n, v_m, ..., \\Phi_n,\\Phi_m....)$. Initial measurements of a small subset of these flow observables, namely $p(v_n)$ and event-plane correlations $p(\\Phi_n,\\Phi_m....)$ at LHC, have already provided new insights on the geometry fluctuations in the initial state and the non-linear hydrodynamics in the final state. In a recent work, we propose an experimental method to further probe other flow observables based on the recently proposed event-shape selection technique a new event-shape twisting technique. In the first method (arXiv:1311.7091), events in fixed centrality are further divided in bins of $v_n$ values in the forward pseudorapidity ($\\eta_F$). This allows us to measure how the $v_m$ and event-plane correlation respond to the change in $v_n$, which provide access to two classes of observables not studied before: $p(v_n, v_m)$ and $p(v_n, \\Phi_n,\\Phi_m....)$. Furthermore our method also allows a quantitative study of the correlation of $v_n$ in different rapidity: $p(v_n(\\eta_F),v_n(\\eta))$. The robustness of this method is demonstrated using the AMPT model, which is known to describe reasonably the centrality dependence of $v_n$ and event-plane correlations. Strong positive correlations are observed among all even harmonics v2, v4, and v6, between v2 and v5 and between v3 and v5, consistent with the effects of non-linear hydrodynamic response, while a significant anti-correlation is observed between v2 and v3. The $v_n(\\eta)$ for events selected on $v_n(\\eta_F)$ shows a significant forward/backward asymmetry, which indicates the de-correlation of event planes over pseudorapidity. In the second method (paper to be submitted), a twist angle between the event planes in the forward and backward rapidity is enforced by cutting on $\\Delta\\Phi = \\Phi_n(\\eta_F)-\\Phi_n(\\eta_B)$. This twisting procedure leads to a non-zero $\\eta$-dependence $<\\sin(n(\\phi-\\Psi_n))>$ component in between, which can be used to calculate the event plane angle as a function of $\\eta$. This allows us to distinguish between two competing mechanisms for the rapidity de-correlation: a systematic rotation versus a random fluctuation of event plane angles along the $\\eta$ direction. Indeed, a significant fraction of the observed rapidity de-correlation in the AMPT model is found to arise from a systematic rotation of event plane angles along the $\\eta$ direction. Our studies show that the event-shape selection and event-shape twisting techniques promise to provide unprecedented details on the EbyE flow fluctuations. The prospects of applying these techniques to Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and LHC are discussed.",

A realistic calculation of photon rate in QGP phase is important to scrutinize this scenario. Fire ball produced in RHIC and LHC is close to semi-QGP which has a non-trivial value of Polyakov loop. We calculated the photon rate in the semi-QGP and found indeed a suppression of the photon rate due to non-trivial Polyakov loop, as compared to standard thermal perturbative results. We also calculated dilepton rate in the same semi-QGP. On the contrary, we found non-trivial Polyakov loop enhances the dilepton rate.

The Keldysh-Schwinger formalism provides a natural framework to describe such a plasma, in particular when the plasma is weakly coupled and perturbative methods are applicable. However, a perturbative computation of various QCD characteristics requires Faddeev-Popov ghosts to cancel  unphysical degrees of freedom which are present in a wide class of covariant gauges. The question thus arises how to introduce the ghosts for non-equilibrium QCD. Using the functional methods, we derive a relation analogous to the Slavnov-Taylor identity which expresses the ghost propagator of the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism through the gluon one. Then we show that the ghost propagator obtained in this way allows one to construct a gauge invariant perturbative expansion of various characteristics of non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma.",

      "Abstract": "Lepton pairs at low mass from heavy-ion collisions are considered good probes for chiral symmetry restoration and the in-medium properties of vector mesons. However, the broad variety of their sources requires models that can describe the complete nuclear reaction properly. For this, transport approaches (e.g. the UrQMD model) are frequently used, as they yield a realistic microscopic description of the collision dynamics. However, such microscopic models usually do not include any in-medium effects and are limited to hadronic degrees of freedom. We therefore present an alternative approach that uses coarse-grained output from transport calculations to extract local thermodynamic properties and determine thermal dilepton emission rates. The approach has the advantage that it can cover all collision energies and the whole space-time evolution in a unified description. To account for the medium effects on the $\\rho$ meson we apply and contrast the spectral function by Eletsky et al., which is obtained from empirical scattering amplitudes, and the many-body calculation by Rapp et al. We present results for SIS, SPS and RHIC energies and compare them to experimental data as well as the outcome from hydrodynamic and pure transport calculations.",

We argue\r\nthat a condensate of Cooper quartets rather than pairs is a strong\r\ncandidate for the ground state. The quartet is favored by the same QCD\r\nattraction that drives Cooper pairing, but with four quarks rather than\r\ntwo it is easier to construct a translationally invariant condensate\r\nthat includes different flavors without paying an energy penalty due to\r\nthe flavor asymmetry.

With decreasing quark mass, the strength of the explicit breaking of the Z(3) symmetry grows and the first-order transition ends in a critical end point (CEP). The nature of the critical endpoint is examined by studying the longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the Polyakov loop, quantified by the corresponding susceptibilities. The longitudinal susceptibility is enhanced in the critical region, while the transverse susceptibility shows a monotonic behavior across the transition point.

So far, it has been quite naively assumed that their dynamics can be described by the Schrödinger equation with in-medium, screened potential. Such a naïve approach is not correct anymore, in particular if one wants to study their time-evolution. After the discovery of imaginary part in the in-medium potential [1], it must be recognized that quarkoia should be viewed as open quantum systems in the environment of quark-gluon plasma [2].\r\n\r\nIn the open quantum system, master equation instead of the Schrödinger equation describes the quantum dynamics of quarkonia. Open quantum system techniques, such as influence functional approach, have been applied to quarkonia [3]. In this presentation, I will summarize developments in this approach and show an additional step toward a more complete description. In particular, I will show how to obtain the Lindblad-form master equation, which preserves the complete positivity of the density matrix of the system [4].\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] M.

Heavy  quarks (charm and beauty) are an effective probe to investigate  the properties of the QGP. They are produced almost exclusively  in the initial partonic scattering processes and they interact  strongly with the surrounding matter throughout its evolution.  Moreoever, the in-medium parton energy loss is expected to depend  both on the parton mass and its colour charge making  flavour-separated measurements of charm and beauty useful to test  models of in-medium energy loss.\r\n\r\nExperimentally one way to measure heavy quarks is via electrons  from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. The comparison  of the $p_{\\rm T}$  spectra of heavy-flavour decay electrons  in pp and Pb-Pb collisions gives insight into the energy loss of  heavy quarks in the QGP. To achieve a flavour-separated  measurement of heavy-flavour decay electrons, first the electrons  have to be identified. This is done using the excellent particle  identification capabilities of ALICE. In addition the electrons  have to be separated according to their source (e.g. charm and  beauty hadron decays, $\\pi^{0}$  Dalitz decays, photon  conversion etc.). This separation is done statistically using the  impact parameter of the electrons. The latter is typically larger  for electrons from hadrons containing a beauty quark due to the  larger mean proper decay length ($c\\tau\\approx500 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$)  of these hadrons compared to other hadrons decaying into  electrons.

Heavy quarks are very powerful probes to explore the QGP formation and its properties, since they are abundantly produced at LHC energies and they experience the entire evolution of the medium.\r\nThe measurement of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ yield relative to D mesons in Pb-Pb collisions would address the baryon over meson ratio in the heavy-quark sector. In pp and p-Pb collisions, the measurement of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ production cross-section provides the necessary baseline to understand the results from heavy-ion collisions and improves the precision of the measurement of the total charm cross section. \r\nThis baryon is observed with the present detector in pp and p-Pb collisions in the decay channel $\\Lambda_{c}^{+} \\rightarrow {\\rm p K}^{-} \\pi^{+}$.\r\nGiven the small displacement of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ secondary vertex from the interaction vertex ($\\Lambda_{c}$ mean proper decay length c$\\tau$ = 60 $\\mu$m), the charm baryon is reconstructed using mainly kinematical selections and exploiting the ALICE particle identification capabilities. \r\nHowever, the observation of $\\Lambda_{c}$ in Pb-Pb collisions is very challenging with the present detector, because of the large combinatorial background and because the mean proper decay length of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ is smaller than the present vertex resolution for the $\\Lambda_{c}$ decay, reconstructed from the three daughter tracks. An upgrade of the ALICE detector, including a new Inner Tracking System (ITS) is scheduled for the second long shutdown of the LHC. The new ALICE apparatus will provide improved resolution on the track impact parameter (by about a factor of 3) and will allow us to record data with higher rate. These new features will enable us to measure rare probes in Pb-Pb collisions, such as the $\\Lambda_{c}$. Simulation studies, based on a detailed description of the new\r\nITS, indicate that the measurements of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ nuclear modification factor and\r\nazimuthal anisotropy will become possible with the integrated luminosity of\r\n10 nb$^{-1}$, which is the target of the ALICE programme after the upgrade.\r\nWe present the analysis strategy to observe the $\\Lambda_{c}$ signal in various $p_{\\rm T}$ intervals in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV, together with the perspectives for the measurements in Pb-Pb with the upgraded ITS.",

This results in a reduction of beauty-quark energy loss compared to charm-quark energy loss. Therefore the separate study of charm and beauty production allows us to test theoretical predictions. Measurements of medium modifications of heavy-flavour transverse momentum distributions in p-Pb collisions allow us to quantify cold nuclear matter effects in the initial state and to deduce the role of final-state effects in Pb-Pb collisions. With the ALICE central barrel detectors, electrons can be identified with high purity down to low transverse momentum. The production of electrons from beauty-hadron decays can be measured using their displacement from the primary vertex thanks to the long lifetime of the beauty hadrons.

The analysis of D-meson production in p-Pb collisions can provide information on how much the heavy-flavour production in nuclear collisions is influenced by cold nuclear matter effects, such as the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions and initial-state multiple scatterings. \r\n\r\nThe magnitude of cold nuclear matter effects can be investigated by means of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$.

This indicates that charm and beauty quarks interact significantly, losing energy, with the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions. The study of azimuthal correlations between electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays and jets opens the possibility to measure the properties of jets coming from heavy-quark fragmentation, complementing the information on the energy-loss mechanism provided by single-particle observables. In particular, the request of a high $p_{\\rm T}$ 'trigger' electron can select preferentially electrons and jets deriving from quark pairs produced at the surface of the QGP fireball, allowing us to study in more detail the dependence of the energy loss on the path length travelled by the quark in the medium. Furthermore, by varying the jet radius, the angular distribution of the radiated energy can be investigated. \r\nBesides providing a reference for the Pb-Pb case, the analogous study in pp and p-Pb collisions can supplement the measurements of $p_{\\rm T}$-differential cross sections of charm and beauty particles with angular-differential information, adding sensitivity to the different heavy-flavour production processes (e.g. pair production vs. gluon splitting). \r\nThe analysis status and the prospect for such measurements in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "We formulate relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with causal hydrodynamic fluctuations and implement them into our dynamical model for more quantitative analysis of the transport coefficients of the matter created in heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\nThe hydrodynamic fluctuations are thermal fluctuations arising in the event-by-event hydrodynamic evoluation of the system, and its power spectrum is determined through the fluctuation-dissipation relation. While, the higher harmonics $v_n$ ($n>2$) are systematically observed in RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of theoretical and experimental interests. Initial state fluctuations turned out to be important to explain these higher harmonics through event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. The event-by-event hydrodynamic fluctuation, although its average is locally zero, also has effects on the higher harmonics and other observables in the same manner as the initial fluctuations which vanish in the averaged picture of the initial condition.\r\n\r\nRecently, it is actively discussed to extract the shear viscosity from the experimental observables using hydrodynamic simulations with the initial fluctuations. The initial fluctuations are converted to observables through the response of the matter, which enables us to obtain information on the properties of the matter as well as on the initial state. But, the higher harmonics are created not only by initial state fluctuations, and the other sources of fluctuations such as the hydrodynamic fluctuation also play important roles. Therefore, to extract the quantitative properties of the quark-gluon plasma from experimental data, it is important to properly implement all the sources of fluctuations including hydrodynamic fluctuations in an integrated dynamical model with models of initial states, hydrodynamics of quark-gluon plasma and subsequent hadronic cascades.\r\n\r\nFirst, we formulate relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with the hydrodynamic fluctuation \\[1\\] in the context of the causal dissipative hydrodynamics which are commonly used in dynamical models for heavy-ion collisions. In causal dissipative hydrodynamics, the hydrodynamic fluctuation of the dissipative currents becomes colored noise due to the fluctuation-dissipation relation. But, interestingly, noise turns out to be always white in the differential form of the constitutive equations, which comes from general properties of the response function of the dissipative currents including causality and resulting constraints on the structure of the constitutive equations. Next, we implement the hydrodynamic fluctuations into our integrated dynamical model and investigate the behavior of the hydrodynamic fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions and discuss effects on experimental observables. The effect can be more significant in  higher orders of the harmonics $v_n$, and in smaller systems such as peripheral collisions or central pA collisions.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n\\[1\\] Koichi Murase, Tetsufumi Hirano, arXiv:1304.3243 [nucl-th]\r\n\r\n![(2+1)-D example of hydrodynamic fluctuations][2]\r\n\r\n  [2]: http://tkynt2.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~murase/share/murase_qm2014f.gif \"hydrodynamic fluctuations\"",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are ideal probes of the QCD matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are predominantly produced in the early stage of the collision via initial hard parton scatterings. While propagating through the dense matter, they lose energy through elastic scatterings and radiative processes. Theoretical models predict that the energy loss of high-energy partons depends on the color charge and parton mass, with the expectation that in the medium beauty quarks lose less energy than charm and light quarks. These dependencies can be explored by comparing the modification in Pb-Pb collisions, relative to pp collisions, of beauty jets with that of charm or light-parton jets. \r\n\r\nIn this poster we present Monte Carlo based performance studies of different b-jet tagging algorithms in ALICE for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. The algorithms, which benefit from the long lifetime of B mesons, are based on the identification of secondary decay vertices and displaced single tracks. In addition, the identification of electrons in jets can be used to profit from the large semi-electronic decay branching ratios of B mesons. Their capability to discriminate beauty jets from charm and light-parton jets will be discussed along with the analysis strategy and outlook. The performance after the ALICE upgrade, which foresees a new Inner Tracking System with improved spatial resolution, will also be presented.",

      "Abstract": "We take a detailed look at high transverse momentum (high $p_T$) particle and jet production in d-Au collisions at RHIC and p-Pb collision at LHC. In particular, we study the correlation between jet production and the number of charged particles produced, which allows collisions to be binned in centrality. While Hulthen distributions are used to sample the spatial distribution of nucleons in deuteron, nucleon distributions within the larger nucleus are sampled form either correlation-free Woods-Saxon or shell model distributions with nucleon-nucleon correlations. The collision of a nucleon from the deuteron with a column of nucleons in the nucleus is carried out by modifying the PYTHIA event generator. Two methods are presented: one retains exact isospin conservation (prior to weak decays) by tracking each nucleon-nucleon collision and another with exact energy conservation where the energy of a column of $N$ nucleons is incorporated within a single ``super'' nucleon by enhancing the parton distribution functions by $N$. In either case, the energy lost in the production of the jet pair is taken into account exactly. Both methods also include a new implementation of a transverse density dependent event-by-event shadowing. The results for high $p_T$ particle production, binned in centrality by the number of charged particles produced, is compared with experimental results from PHENIX on high-$p_T$ neutral pion production in d-Au collisions, with a focus on the observed enhancement in peripheral collisions.",

This is the first-ever two-gluon production calculation including saturation effects to all orders in one of the nuclei (heavy ion) along with a single saturation correction in the projectile (light ion). The calculation of the correlation function predicted (qualitatively) two identical ridge-like correlations, near- and away-side. This prediction was later supported by experiment findings. Concentrating on the energy and geometry dependence of the correlation functions we find that the correlation function \r\nis nearly center-of-mass energy independent. The geometry dependence of the correlation function leads to an enhancement of near- and away-side correlations for the tip-on-tip U+U collisions when compared with side-on-side U+U collisions, an exactly opposite behavior from the correlations generated by the elliptic flow of the quark-gluon plasma.",

      "Abstract": "High energy proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions provide an excellent tool for studying a wide array of physics effects, many of which are expected to have a significant dependence on the impact parameter of the collision, which is related to the collision centrality. We detail a method, employed by PHENIX, for determining centrality classes in $p(d)+A$ collisions via cuts on the produced charge particle multiplicity in the nucleus-going (-3.9<$\\eta$<-3.0) direction. Using a Glauber Monte Carlo simulation we are able to map the centrality classes to geometric quantities of interest, along with corresponding systematic uncertainties. Within this framework we calculate the centrality bias-correction factors on the nuclear modification factor $R_{p(d)+A}$ due to correlations between a measured process and the multiplicity in the nucleus-going direction. These bias-correction factors are tested further using the HIJING MC generator, confirming that for $d+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV the corrections are small and vary by less than 5% (10%) for hadron production at midrapidty up to $p_{T}$=10(20) GeV/$c$. In contrast, we find that the bias correction factors for $p+$Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV are an order of magnitude larger and exhibit a strong dependence on hadron $p_T$, which likely is due to the larger effect of multiparton interactions.",

      "Abstract": "The HypHI collaboration aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the spectroscopy of hypernuclei produced in heavy-ion and rare isotope induced reactions. A first experiment was performed on October 2009 with a $^{6}$Li beam bombarded on a $^{12}$C carbon fixed target at 2 $A$GeV. In a second experiment in March 2010, a different beam nucleus of $^{20}$Ne at 2 $A$GeV was employed in a similar setup. The experimental approach was developed to measure and study hypernuclei produced in the projectile rapidity region. Such $\\Lambda$-hypernuclei are assumed to be obtained by the coalescence between $\\Lambda$ hyperon produced in the mid rapidity region of the participant zone and projectile spectator fragments from the collision between the beam and target nuclei. Final results of the first experiment $^{6}$Li+$^{12}$C at 2$A$GeV will be presented, demonstrating that $\\Lambda$ hyperon, $^{3}_\\Lambda$H and $^4_\\Lambda$H hypernuclei were observed by performing the vertex reconstruction and the measurement of their invariant mass. Their lifetimes were extracted and were in good agreement with the world data. A review of the lifetime of these light hypernuclei was performed and showed that their measured lifetimes are significantly shorter than the $\\Lambda$ lifetime which bring new interrogation about their fundamental structures. As well, the evidence of a bound state of two neutrons and one $\\Lambda$ hyperon, $^3_\\Lambda$n, will be presented. It corresponds to the first observation of a neutral bound state. Finally the estimation of the production cross section of the observed $\\Lambda$ hyperon and hypernuclei will be shown, corresponding the first experimental estimation of those observables. These estimations will be useful for constraining theoretical models of the hypernuclear production, and an insight on these implications will be given. Future plans to study exotic proton and neutron rich hypernuclei will conclude the presentation.",

The precise measurement of the offset to the primary vertex for the muon tracks, allowed by the MFT, will permit for the first time in ALICE the identification of open charm ($c\\tau \\sim 150~\\mu$m) and beauty ($c\\tau \\sim 500~\\mu$m) production at forward rapidity, rejecting at the same time a large fraction of background muons coming from pion and kaon decays. \r\n\r\nThe setup of the MFT is an assembly of circular planes made of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), to be installed between the interaction point and the hadron absorber of the Muon Arm. The total material budget of the MFT tracking planes, the radiation hardness of their components, coupled with the high granularity of the sensors and the envisaged readout speed, fulfill the conditions for the operation at the energies and luminosities foreseen for the LHC heavy-ion program after 2019. The expected detector performances resulting from realistic simulations of the MFT setup will be shown, together with the various technological issues related to the project.",

      "Abstract": "Experimental data measured in $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions by the LHC experiments show a significant imbalance in the transverse momenta of the two leading reconstructed jets. This momentum imbalance is caused by the different in-medium path lengths and thereby different energy and momentum losses of the di-jets due to the passage through the created hot and dense matter. For investigating this momentum loss we extended the partonic transport model BAMPS which solves the full 3+1D Boltzmann equation for partons based on pQCD cross sections. Among the features of BAMPS is the stochastic modeling of both 2->2 and 2<->3 scattering processes by employing a new, improved Gunion-Bertsch matrix element together with a microscopic running coupling. In this talk we compare our recent results concerning reconstructed jets with different experiments and observables. To this end, we use well-established experimental background subtraction methods and have a closer look at the influence of the further recoil scattering processes of the initial shower partons on the momentum loss of the reconstructed jets.",

The highest net baryon densities will be explored with ion beams up to 45 GeV/nucleon energy delivered by SIS 300 in the next stage of FAIR. Collision rates up to 10$^7$ per second are required to produce very rare probes with unprecedented statistics in this energy range. Their signatures are complex. These conditions call for detector systems designed to meet the extreme requirements in terms of rate capability, momentum and spatial resolution, and a novel DAQ and trigger concept which is not limited by latency but by throughput. In the presentation we describe the concepts of CBM’s central detector, the Silicon Tracking System, and of the First-Level Event Selector, a dedicated computing farm to reduce on-line the raw data volume by up to three orders of magnitude to a recordable rate.

This new algorithm uses a data-driven method to estimate the underlying event level from the forward calorimeter energy distribution, taking into account possible flow modulation. Unlike jet-level subtraction methods, this approach produces a fully subtracted \"hard event\" as input to algorithms such as anti-kT, that automatically clusters to the hard jets. We show its improved performance to the CMS iterative pile-up subtraction, and also compare to other jet reconstruction strategies currently used in heavy ion collisions.",

Thus, measurements of jet quenching as a function of flavor place powerful constraints on the thermodynamical and transport properties of the hot and dense medium. Measurements of the nuclear modification factors of the heavy-flavor-tagged jets in both PbPb and pPb collisions can quantify such energy loss effects. Specifically, pPb measurements provide crucial insights into the behavior of the cold nuclear matter effect, which is required to fully understand the hot and dense medium effects on jets in PbPb collisions.

      "Abstract": "Successful applications of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the description of heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC triggered large interest in the development of the hydrodynamic framework. An example of the new approach to relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics is anisotropic hydrodynamics  --- the framework where effects connected with the expected high pressure anisotropy of the produced matter are included in the leading order of the hydrodynamic expansion. \r\n\r\nVery recently, also the second order anisotropic hydrodynamics has been formulated in [1]. The new approach introduced in [1] allows for description of arbitrary transverse expansion of matter in the way which becomes consistent with more traditional approaches to dissipative hydrodynamics in the small anisotropy limit. This formalism  uses, however, the Romatschke-Strickland form [2] of the distribution function  in the leading order, which implies that the two components of pressure in the transverse plane may be different only if the second-order corrections are taken into account.\r\n\r\nIn this work we present a new methodology for including three substantially different pressure components already in the leading order of hydrodynamic expansion. Our approach is based on the projection method introduced in [3], which has turned out to be a convenient tool to replace complicated tensor equations of relativistic hydrodynamics by a small set of scalar equations. \r\n\r\nWe take into account the radial expansion of the produced matter (in addition to the longitudinal Bjorken flow) but our considerations are confined to the case with cylindrical symmetry. We generalize the Romatschke-Strickland form to the case where all three pressure components may be different. Compared to earlier works on anisotropic hydrodynamics in the leading order, where the zeroth and first moments of the Boltzmann equation have been studied, an important novel feature of our present work is the analysis of the second moment of the Boltzmann equation. We argue that a successful agreement with the Israel-Stewart theory in the limit of small anisotropies may be achieved if we take into account two equations constructed from the second moment of the Boltzmann equation rather than taking one equation from the zeroth moment and another equation from the second moment [4]. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "The event planes have played an important role in the experimental study of fluid dynamics and transport properties of the dense matter in heavy-ion collisions. Recently the correlation of different order event planes has also emerged as a promising tool to study the initial state of the high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.  In the idealized case, event planes at different rapidities are completely correlated. However, initial parton production has significant fluctuations in the longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction. The longitudinal fluctuations of the initial transverse parton density can lead to fluctuations of the longitudinal azimuthal anisotropy at different rapidities and de-correlation of event planes with large rapidity gaps.\r\n\r\n In this work, we will explore the correlations of event planes of the same harmonics with different rapidity gaps in Pb+Pb collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ =2.76 TeV using two different dynamical models that incorporate initial conditions with longitudinal fluctuations in the initial energy density. The dynamical models used in our work are AMPT and a 3+1D ideal hydrodynamic model. The initial conditions for both models are given by the HIJING model that incorporates a Monte Carlo Glauber model for multiple nucleon interactions and two-component model for particle production. Particle production from soft coherent interaction of overlapping nucleons and incoherent semi-hard parton scatterings leads to fluctuations of local energy density in the transverse as well as longitudinal direction. In addition to the event plane correlations as a function of rapidity gap we will also discuss the sensitivity of the event plane correlation to transport properties and Equation of State (EoS) of the medium.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Using event-by-event viscous fluid dynamics to evolve fluctuating initial density profiles for U+U collisions, we find a \"knee\"-like structure in the elliptic flow as a function of collision centrality, located around 0.5% centrality as measured by the final charged multiplicity. This knee is due to the preferential selection of tip-on-tip collision geometries by a high-multiplicity trigger. It arises from a similar knee in the ellipticity distribution in the initial states; hydrodynamic evolution translates the knee in the ellipticity vs. centrality into a knee of the elliptic flow in the final state. The conversion efficiency v2/ε2 is found to be independent of centrality in the knee region. A non-monotonic centrality dependence of v2/ε2 as initially reported by the STAR collaboration can be obtained by normalizing the final v2 values with initial eccentricities calculated from a different initial-state model than the one used in the hydrodynamic simulations. – No knee structure is seen in odd flow harmonics. A weaker knee structure in the centrality dependence of the 4th-order eccentricity is washed out by nonlinear hydrodynamic evolution effects and thus no longer visible in the centrality dependence of the final quadrangular flow v4. – We find that the knee structure in v2 is robust against adding Γ-distributed multiplicity fluctuations, consistent with constraints from measured multiplicity distributions in p+p collisions, but may be washed out when allowing for extreme hot spots as implemented by Rybczynski et al. [Phys. Rev. C 87 (2013) 044908]. – A deeper analysis of these structures is facilitated by imposing additionally a tight cut on complete nuclear overlap by using the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs). We show results exploring the power of such cuts in selecting specific collision geometries and their impact on anisotropic collective flow.",

      "Abstract": "Statistical models of hadron production have become one of the cornerstones of our understanding of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. However, the measured proton abundances in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV at LHC do not agree with the most common versions of the thermal models. Besides the proton anomaly, the same LHC data exhibits the low-transverse-momentum enhancement of pion spectra by about 25-50% with respect to the predictions of various thermal and hydrodynamic models [2]. \r\n\r\nIn the recent work [3] we connect the proton anomaly with the pion enhancement effect and show that the two problems may be solved naturally within the statistical model which assumes chemical non-equilibrium at the freeze-out and a special combination of freeze-out geometry and flow - the Krakow single-freeze-out model in the Monte-Carlo version implemented in THERMINATOR [4].\r\n\r\nWe find a remarkable agreement between our model and the measured transverse-momentum spectra of pions and kaons. Although the protons are not included in the fit, our model explains well their spectrum, in addition to their yield. We also find a satisfactory description of hyperons with the same parameters. \r\n\r\nCorrect description of the low-transverse-momentum enhancement of pions within our model suggests that it may be interpreted as a signature of the onset of pion condensation in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. This is so, since the freeze-out conditions in the model are very close to the pion condensation point. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] P. Braun-Munzinger, D. Magestro, K. Redlich, J. Stachel, Phys. Lett.

      "Country": "IL",
      "Abstract": "Parameters of the initial state of the heavy-ion (HI) interaction are commonly denoted by the term “centrality”. Centrality includes the impact parameter of the interaction, amount of interacting material and relative orientation of colliding nuclei. Unfortunately, none of these parameters can be directly measured. In all currently operating and planned HI experiments centrality is measured indirectly, using particles produced in the HI interactions, usually at high-rapidity. That requires assumptions about the high-rapidity particle production mechanisms that are not very well studied, and also requires a model relating produced particles to the initial state geometry, the Glauber model. These two assumptions lead to significant systematic uncertainties in centrality determination. Further, use of produced particles is affected by the correlations between the centrality determination rapidity and the rest of the detector coverage, where the physics measurements are done. This, in turn, requires additional corrections resulting in additional systematic uncertainties. Recent results from the LHC experiments reveal the importance of the long-range rapidity correlations in HI interactions. The proton-lead results also demonstrate that the Glauber model itself may require further adjustments.\r\n    In collider-based HI experiments there is a unique possibility to measure centrality parameters by registering spectator fragments remaining from the collision on both sides. Spectator fragmentation mechanism is decoupled from particle production mechanism. This approach does not require Glauber model as spectators and participants are related via the total number of nucleons in the colliding species. Spectators continue flying along the direction of the colliding beams retaining practically unmodified longitudinal momentum, however their mass-to-charge ratio is typically lower than that of the colliding species.\r\n       We propose a concept of the Centrality Detector, which measures masses of most of the fragments by measuring their deflection in the magnetic field of the collider elements and their charges. The field, and a set of detectors integrated in the structure of collider rings act as a very precise mass-spectrometer for such fragments. First calculations based on the DPMJet generator show that the Centrality Detector can provide better accuracy than currently used methods. Main factors affecting its performance will be discussed in the presentation.",

      "Abstract": "One of the unsolved problems in the current 'standard model' of heavy ion physics is the apparent rapid thermalization of QCD matter in the pre-equilibrium stage. While it is challenging to probe this mechanism directly, there are now several observables available which allow tomographic imaging of the initial state geometry, which is expected to carry remnant information of the equilibration mechanism. On the fluid dynamics side, scaled fluctuations in the momentum space anisotropy parameters v_n image the initial eccentricity fluctuations epsilon_n almost directly with only a weak dependence on fluid dynamics. From a different direction, due to the strong non-linear dependence of their emission rates on temperature, thermal photons and their v_n are very sensitive to the initial state graininess. Finally, the v_2 and v_3 of high P_T hadrons coming from hard processes reflect the attenuation pattern of partons propagating through the inhomogeneous matter density after some fluid dynamical evolution. Combining information from all these channels does not yet lead to a fully consistent picture, however intriguing trends pointing towards non-trivial initial state dynamics emerge.

The decay rates of the initial color fields are given by the Schwinger formula, and the collision terms are treated in the relaxation-time approximation. By connecting the relaxation time with viscosity we are able to study production and thermalization processes in the plasma characterized by different values of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, ${\\bar \\eta}$. For the lowest (KSS) value of this ratio, $4\\pi{\\bar \\eta} = 1$, and realistic initial conditions for the fields, the system approaches the viscous-hydrodynamics regime within  1--2 fm/c. On the other hand, for larger values of the viscosity, $4\\pi{\\bar \\eta} \\geq 3$, the collisions in the plasma become inefficient to destroy collective phenomena which manifest themselves as oscillations of different plasma parameters. The presence of such oscillations brings in differences between the kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions, which suggest that the viscous-hydrodynamics approach after 1--2 fm/c is not complete if $4\\pi{\\bar \\eta} \\geq 3$ and should be extended to include dissipative phenomena connected with color conductivity.\r\n\r\nPresentation based on the article published as Phys.

      "Abstract": "In this talk, we first argue that a domain structure, which can be inferred from the properties of the Polyakov loop and and is called center domains, is created in the deconfined QCD matter in the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. Its formation is assisted by the gauge configuration in the glasma state created right after the collisions. Then we show that the center domains are an important facet of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma from its birth up to hadronization. They naturally explain the strongly coupled nature of the quark gluon plasma including its major observed properties from its nearly ideal hydrodynamical behavior to strong jet quenching.",

      "Abstract": "Experimental and theoretical studies of relativistic heavy-ion collisions showed that the behavior of matter produced in such collisions is very well described within hydrodynamic models. These results brought a lot of attention to the studies of kinetic coefficients whose values determine the magnitude of important observables such as the elliptic flow. Interestingly, different theoretical methods lead to different values of the kinetic coefficients. Our idea is to perform comparisons of exact solutions of simple kinetic equations with various hydrodynamic approaches, which allows us to select correct forms of these coefficients. For this purpose we exactly solve the relaxation-time approximation Boltzmann equation for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion. We compare the resulting exact numerical solutions \r\nwith approximate solutions available which allows us to find correct expressions for shear and bulk viscosity coefficients.\r\n\r\nPresented work is mainly based on:\r\nW.Florkowski, R.Ryblewski, M.Strickland, Nucl.Phys.

      "Speaker": "Mauricio Martinez Guerrero",
      "Institute": "The Ohio State University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We study medium modifications to the interference pattern between initial and final state radiation. We compute single gluon production off a highly energetic parton that undergoes a hard scattering and subsequently crosses a dense QCD medium of finite size. Multiple soft scatterings with the medium are resumed within the harmonic oscillator approximation. We find the decoherence of correlated partons traversing the medium depends on two scales:  the medium length $L$ and the decorrelation time of the gluon due to the medium $\\tau_f$. This interplay gives origin to two different asymptotic limits of the gluon spectrum: the coherent ($\\tau_f\\gg L$) and incoherent regime ($\\tau_f\\ll L$). We discuss the main characteristics of each regime. We show that in both cases there is a gradual onset of decoherence between the initial and final state radiation due to multiple scatterings, that opens the phase space for large angle emissions. By examining the multiplicity of produced gluons, we observe a potentially large double logarithmic enhancement for dense media and small opening angles. This result points to a possible modification of the evolution equations due to a QCD medium of finite size. We comment on the phenomenological consequences (such as radiative energy loss) of this setup in pA collisions.",

It is one of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program. Due to the high sensitivity to the correlation length [1] of the dynamical system and directly connected to the susceptibilities in theoretical calculations, for example, the Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) calculations [2], higher moments of multiplicity distributions have been applied to search for the QCD critical point in the heavy-ion collision experiment.\r\n\r\nTo extract the CP signal in heavy-ion collisions, it is crucial to understand the non-CP effects, such as the effects of conservations for charges (electric, baryon number and strangeness number) and resonance decays, on the experimental observable.  In this talk, we will present the comparison between baseline/model with recently published experimental results [3]. We will discuss the deviations of the data from Poisson, binomial baselines as well as the implications.

      "Country": "India",
      "Abstract": "The STAR experiment at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has been studying the properties of the QCD matter at extremely high energy density and parton density, created in the heavy ion collisions. Photons are produced at all stages of the colliding system directly as well as through decay of produced particles like neutral pions. The multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distribution of photons on an event-by-event basis is an important measurement complementing the charged particle measurement in a heavy ion collision. The Photon Multiplicity Detector in the STAR experiment measures inclusive photons in the pseudo-rapidity region −3.7 < η < −2.3. The photon multiplicity per participating nucleon pair was observed to be independent of collision centrality for Au + Au collision at √sNN = 200 and 62.4 GeV indicating that photon production is dominated by soft processes [1, 2]. Inclusive photon production at forward rapidity also shows an energy-independent longitudinal scaling at these energies [1, 2]. We will present the multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distributions of photons in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 39, 27 and 19.6 GeV for different event centralities at rapidity close to the beam rapidity to further test the energy and centrality dependence of the longitudinal scaling.  \r\nPhoton multiplicity as well as pseudo-rapidity distributions show more photons as compared to that expected from longitudinal scaling; the deviation increasing for peripheral collisions. We assume that these additional photons from excited spectators due to proximity of PMD to beam rapidity. We propose a simple parameterization to calculate the effective number of photon sources, N’, to include contribution from participants as well as spectators, at all three energies. The photon multiplicity when scaled with N’ exhibits longitudinal scaling even beyond the beam rapidity.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, Phys.Rev.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "The time evolution of the medium created in heavy ion collisions can be described by hydrodynamical models. After expansion and cooling, the hadrons are created in a freeze-out. Their distribution describes the final state of this medium. Exact hydrodynamics provides a tool to have an analytic handle on the connection between the initial state, the dynamic parameters of the system and the observables. Usually azimuthal or elliptical symmetry is assumed in the transverse plane, as these are simple to handle and represent geometries to yield realistic observables like spectra, Bose-Einstein correlation functions and elliptic flow. However, nuclei contain a finite number of nucleons, are thus (on an event-by-event basis) not spherically symmetric. This results in an event-by-event fluctuating initial condition, which gives rise to higher order flow coefficients, with respect to higher order reaction planes. Correlation radii can also be measured with respect to higher order reaction planes, their comparison to higher order flow coefficients gives insight into the dynamics of the system. In this work we show the first exact analytic solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics [Ref1,Ref2] that assume higher order asymmetries (see Fig. [1]) and thus give realistic higher order flow coefficients (see Fig. [2]). Besides presenting the first such model, we also show a comparison of our results to various measured hadronic observables.\r\n\r\nRef1: M.

It is designed for operation in fixed target mode to study ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at beam energies up to 45 AGeV with unprecedented statistical precision.\r\nAn important CBM observable are light vector mesons and charmonium which are experimentally accessible via their decay into lepton pairs. Those are ideal probes of the early, high-density phase of the collision process due to their lack of strong interaction with the hot and dense medium. The measurement of such rare probes requires clean and efficient electron identification which will be provided up to momenta of 8 GeV/c by a gaseous Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The main challenges are the suppression of pions and the precise control of the background in the high multiplicity environment of a heavy ion collision.\r\nWe will present the detector concept developed to meet the requirements and the recent progress in R&D resulting in the CBM-RICH Technical Design Report which has been approved by FAIR in February 2014. Results from in-beam tests with a real-size prototype will be discussed which verify the detector concept and validate the feasibility studies done so far.",

      "Abstract": "We present results of a systematic study of the role of the equation of state in the hydrodynamic model. By using the same initial conditions and freeze-out scenario, the effects of different equations of state are compared by calculating their respective hydrodynamical evolution, particle spectra, elliptic flow and HBT radii. Three different types of equation of state are studied, each focusing on different features, such as nature of the phase transition, strangeness and baryon densities. Different equations of state imply different hydrodynamic responses, the impact thereof on final state anisotropies are investigated. The results of our calculations are compared to the data from RHIC at 130 GeV and 200 GeV. It is found that the three equations of state used in the calculations describe the data reasonably well; differences can be observed, but they are quite small. The insensitivity to the equation of state seems to weaken the need for a locally thermalized description of the system, at least for the observables analyzed in this work. A precise determination of transport coefficients by fitting collective flow parameters in the framework of hydrodynamics still requires caution.",

In these measurements, $D^{0}$ and $D^{*}$ mesons are reconstructed through hadronic decay channels. For both U+U and Au+Au collisions, invariant $D^{0}$ meson production yields are determined from minbias and 0-10$\\%$ central triggered events for the $p_{T}$ range from 0 to 6 GeV/c.

      "Abstract": "\\noindent\r\nWe performed a thorough analysis of two alternative approaches to treat the chemical freeze-out of  strange particles in hadron resonance gas model with the multicomponent hard-core repulsion [1]. \r\nThe first approach accounts for their chemical non-equilibrium via the usual $\\gamma_s$ factor and such a model describes the hadron multiplicities measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions  at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies with $\\chi^2/dof  = 63.4/55 \\simeq$ 1.15. In contrast to earlier beliefs, we find that strangeness rather tends to be enhanced than suppressed at low collision energies, i.e. $\\gamma_s > 1$, at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $  2.7, 3.3, 3.8,  4.9, 6.3, 9.2 GeV. \r\nSecond approach is to treat strange particle freeze-out separately from non-strange particle freeze-out. Conservation laws allow us to connect the freeze-outs of strange and non-strange hadrons and end up with the same number of free parameters as for $\\gamma_s$ approach. We show that this approach works not worse than the $\\gamma_s$ approach with $\\chi^2/dof  = 58.5/55 \\simeq $ 1.06 and for $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 6.3, 12 and 17 GeV it significantly improves the fit quality. For all considered collision energies we see that  $\\bar p/\\pi^-$,   $\\bar \\Lambda/\\Lambda$,  $\\bar \\Xi^-/\\Xi^-$ and  $\\bar \\Omega/\\Omega$ ratios are described better than within the traditional $\\gamma_s$ approach,  since a separation of chemical freeze-outs relaxes the strong connection between the non-strange and strange baryons. \r\nThe novel concept of strange particle freeze-out allows us to describe 111 independent hadron ratios measured at 14 different energies with the highest quality ever achieved. \r\nBasing on these results we conjecture that an apparent strangeness enhancement is due to the separate strangeness chemical freeze-out. \\\\\r\n\\noindent\r\n{\\bf References:}\\\\\r\n1)  K.

      "Abstract": "Soft photons are of particular interest since they are unmodified once\r\nproduced, and thus carry information about the space-time thermal\r\nproperties of the medium.  We present new results on the centrality\r\ndependence of soft single photons in Au$+$Au collisions, down to $p_T\r\n= 400$ MeV/$c$ via photon conversions to $e^+e^-$ pairs.  These\r\nmeasurements provide stringent tests of the hydrodynamic space-time\r\nevolution as a detailed function of the collision geometry.\r\n\r\nThese soft photons have different angular emission patterns depending\r\non their production mechanism. Previous published PHENIX results\r\nindicate that the second order Fourier coefficient ($v_2$) is postive\r\nfor $p_T < 4$ GeV/$c$, which is qualitatively explained by\r\nhydrodynamical model calculations, but not quantitatively.  The\r\n3\\textsuperscript{rd} order Fourier coefficient ($v_3$) of photons has\r\nbeen proposed as a critical additional handle to understand the photon\r\nemission.  Photons emitted under the presence of strong magnetic field\r\ncreated in the collision would have a significant influence on $v_2$\r\nwhile very little on $v_3$.  In contrast, hydrodynamical models\r\npredict a sizable photon $v_3$.

Explaining the\r\nsimultaneously large suppression and flow of heavy quarks has been a\r\nchallenge for the community.

      "Abstract": "In this talk the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles, geometry categorization and bias, and global observables in d+Au collisions at 200 GeV are reported.  In d+Au collisions, the intermediate $p_T$ region between 2 and 5 GeV, there is a significant enhancement of the baryon to meson ratios relative to those measured in p+p collisions.  The enhancement is present in d+Au collisions as well as Au+Au collisions and increases with centrality. We compare a class of peripheral Au+Au collisions with a class of central d+Au collisions which have a comparable number of participants and binary collisions. The $p_T$ dependent ratios for these classes display a remarkable similarity.   The nuclear modification of hadrons at higher  transverse momentum also reveal interesting effects.  Geometry selection in d+Au/p+Pb collisions is crucial for understanding the physics underlying modified nuclear parton distribution functions, gluon saturation and glasma diagrams, initial state energy loss, and possible hydrodynamic flow in these small systems. Data from the p+Pb LHC results indicate potentially large biases in the geometry determination in these small systems. The PHENIX collaboration presents tests of auto-correlation biases.  Our findings indicate that these biases are an order of magnitude smaller at RHIC as compared to the LHC, and are thus well quantified. Geometry tests with neutron-tagged events and the centrality scaling of d$N_{ch}/d\\eta$ and d$E_T/d\\eta$ are presented.",

The in-medium effects are then introduced in the $\\pi\\pi$ cross section through one-loop self-energies of the exchanged $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ mesons. The effect of early chemical freeze-out in heavy ion collisions is implemented through a temperature-dependent pion chemical potential, which increases with decreasing temperature.

Subsequently, by employing the distribution function thus obtained, I derive second-order hydrodynamic evolution equation for the shear stress tensor, directly from its definition [1]. This method of deriving the second-order viscous equation does not make use of the two major approximations/assumptions inherent in the traditional Israel-Stewart theory, namely, Grad's 14-moment approximation and second moment of Boltzmann equation. Eventually, I present the derivation of a novel third-order evolution equation for the shear stress tensor [2].

In this calculation multiplicities of both the thermal hadrons and those decayed from resonances in a certain rapidity interval are calculated separately and the sum is fitted to the data. Usually the measured number of hadrons within a certain rapidity interval is converted into a number of hadrons in the whole rapidity region and the number in the whole rapidity region is regarded as a sum of the thermal ones and those decayed from resonances and fitted. This procedure is correct only when the rapidity distributions of both the thermal hadrons and the decayed ones are same. \r\n\r\nOnce the chemical analysis is done, by fixing the number of thermal hadrons of a certain species as the one at the chemical freeze-out, the transverse momentum spectra of various hadrons are fitted.

      "Abstract": "Local equilibration of a QCD medium has been a long-standing issue in hadron physics since the discovery of a nearly-perfect fluid in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The pre-collision state is considered to be described as color glass condensate, which has a relatively large number of high-momentum gluons but almost no quarks. The success of hydrodynamic approaches, on the other hand, indicate that the medium should quickly turn into an equilibrated quark-gluon plasma in less than 1 fm/$c$.\r\n\r\n Equilibration of a heavy-ion system requires (i) isotropization, (ii) thermalization and (iii) chemical equilibration of partons. In this work we focus on the latter two and aim to provide an efficient description for producing low-momentum quarks and gluons by modeling collinear parton splitting and recombination processes. Parton-medium interaction, which is required for creating off-shell partons, is embedded in the model by drag and diffusion effects in relativistic Fokker-Planck equation. We perform numerical simulation in a transverse direction for qualitative analyses to find that the gluon distribution approaches the thermal one in a very short time, and quark thermal/chemical equilibration is slower than the gluon thermalization though it is reasonably fast. The recombination is suggested to be essential in chemical equilibration as quark production from over-populated low-momentum gluons would be suppressed by Pauli exclusion principle. The results imply that the collinear processes play an important role in early thermal and chemical equilibration of the QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.",

In particular, the comparison of the $R_{\\rm AA}$ of charm, beauty and light-flavour hadrons provides information about the colour charge and parton mass dependence of the energy loss.\r\nOpen heavy-flavour production was measured with ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76~\\mathrm{TeV}$ using D mesons ($ {\\rm D^0} $, ${\\rm D^{*+}}$, $ {\\rm D^{+}} $ and ${\\rm D_s^+}$  ) reconstructed from their hadronic decays and electrons from heavy-flavour decays at central rapidity, and muons from heavy-flavour decays at forward rapidity. The D meson and heavy-flavour decay leptons differential $ R_{ \\rm AA } $ measurements, namely the transverse momentum, rapidity and centrality dependence, will be shown. The comparison of the nuclear modification factors of strange and non-strange D mesons will be presented, as well as the ${\\rm D^0}$ $R_{\\rm AA}$ measured in different azimuthal regions with respect to the reaction plane of the collision. The D meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ will be compared with light-flavour and non-prompt ${\\rm J}/\\psi$ results (from the CMS experiment).

      "Abstract": "Thermal photon $v_3$ is calculated for 0--40% central collisions of Pb nuclei at LHC from event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic model [1]. The differential triangular flow parameter $v_3(p_T)$ calculated with respect to the participant plane (PP) is found to be  non-zero, positive, and shows similar qualitative nature to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2(p_T)$ [2].  At $p_T=$ 1 GeV $v_3$(PP) is found to be about half of  $v_2$(PP) however, for larger values of $p_T$ these two anisotropy parameters  become comparable.  The global geometry of the produced matter as well as the local fluctuations in the initial density distribution are responsible for  this substantial value of the triangular flow parameter for thermal photons  where $v_3$(PP)  probes the initial state geometry in an indirect way via the generation of additional transverse flow.   $v_3$ calculated with respect to the reaction plane as expected is close to zero.  $v_3$(PP) strongly depends on the value of the fluctuation size parameter $\\sigma$ especially in the higher $p_T$ region where, a larger $\\sigma$ results in a smaller $v_3$(PP). In addition, the $v_3$(PP) is found to increase with the initial formation time of the system.  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] R. Chatterjee, D. K. Srivastava, and T. Renk, arXiv:1401.7464.\r\n\r\n[2] R.

In order to carry \r\nout accurate, data-driven jet measurements over a broad kinematic range \r\nat RHIC energies, we developed a novel mixed-event technique that \r\ndescribes the combinatorial jet background over several orders of \r\nmagnitude with high precision. We apply this technique to measure the \r\nsemi-inclusive charged jet distribution recoiling from a high $p_{T}$ \r\nhadron trigger in central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. \r\nWe report the recoil jet distribution for various trigger $p_{T}$ ranges \r\nand jet radii, and study the azimuthal distribution between the recoil \r\njet and trigger hadron. In addition we present the first measurement at \r\nRHIC of the di-jet transverse momentum asymmetry, $A_J$. Both \r\nmeasurements are performed with a very low infrared cutoff on jet \r\nconstituents of 200 MeV.

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, heavy quarks are primarily created from initial hard scatterings. Due to the heavy masses, their intrinsic properties are much less affected by the QCD medium compared to those of light quarks. Therefore heavy quark hadrons are suggested as a clean probe for the studying of early dynamic evolution of the dense and hot medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions. To enhance the study of heavy quark production at RHIC, the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) for the STAR experiment has been built and installed before RHIC Run 14. The HFT consists of four layers of silicon detectors. The two outermost layers are silicon strip detectors and the two innermost layers are made from the state of art ultra thin CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). This is the first application of the CMOS MAPS detector in a collider experiment. The thin pixel sensors plus the carbon fiber supporting design reduces the material to 0.4 % radiation length per pixel detector layer, enabling reconstruction of low pT heavy flavor hadrons.\r\nIn this talk, the status and performance of HFT in the current 200 GeV Au+Au run will be discussed.",

Muon identification at low transverse momentum from the Time-of-Flight detector and the Time Projection Chamber provides STAR a great opportunity to search for a variety of muonic atoms. Muonic atoms are an ideal tool, as suggested by Mel Schwartz, Jack Sandweiss \r\nand the authors of [1] [2], to measure the thermal emission from \r\nthe Quark-Gluon Plasma via a direct measurement of the single muon spectrum because only thermal muons or muons from short-lived resonance decays are capable of forming such atoms.

      "Abstract": "Suppression of quarkonia production in high energy nuclear collisions relative to proton-proton collisions, due to color screening of the quark-antiquark potential, has been predicted to be a sensitive indicator of the temperature of the created QGP. However, initial state cold nuclear matter effects, production via recombination of quark-antiquark pairs in the QGP and dissociation in hadronic phase could also alter the expected suppression picture. Systematic measurements of the quarkonia production in different colliding systems are hence crucial for disentangling relative contributions of these effects. \r\nAt the STAR experiment we can utilize collisions of uranium nuclei to further study the quarkonia suppression pattern. Since the uranium nuclei are non-spherical, we are able to reach higher energy densities in the most central U+U collision compared to Au+Au collisions. In this poster, we will present the transverse momentum spectrum (0<$p_{\\rm T}$<6 GeV/c) and nuclear modification factor of $J/\\psi$ production, reconstructed at midrapidity via di-electron decay channel, in minimum bias U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV in the STAR experiment.",

      "Abstract": "Triangular flow ($v_{3}$), the third harmonic of the azimuthal particle distribution relative to the event plane, is getting more attention in recent years. It is considered that $v_{3}$ is generated by event-by-event initial state fluctuations. Therefore, it is natural to use $v_{3}$ as a tool to study initial state fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of the collision system. Another aspect of identified-particle $v_{3}$ measurements is the study of the energy dependent difference between particles and anti-particles $v_{3}$. That is especially important after the observation of a difference in elliptic flow between particles and anti-particles in Beam Energy Scan data at STAR.\r\n\r\nWe present $v_{3}$ measurements from STAR of identified particles ($\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, $p$, $\\bar{p}$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$) relative to the third-order event plane as a function of $p_\\mathrm{T}$ for different centralities (0\\%-80\\%, 0\\%-10\\%, 10\\%-40\\%, and 40\\%-80\\%) at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} =$ 27 GeV, 39 GeV and 200 GeV. We discuss the hydrodynamics-inspired mass ordering at low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ ($p_\\mathrm{T} < $ 1.5 GeV/c), number-of-consitituent-quarks scaling at intermediate $p_\\mathrm{T}$ (0.5 GeV/c $ < p_\\mathrm{T}/n_\\mathrm{q} < $ 1.5 GeV/c), and the difference between particles and anti-particles as a function of centrality and beam energy. We also present $v_{3}$ for charged hadrons relative to the first-order event plane which is determined from spectator neutrons at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=$ 200 GeV Au+Au and 193 GeV U+U collisions. As this type of event plane represents the reaction plane instead of the participant plane, it helps us to understand the origin of triangular flow.",

      "Abstract": "Long-range pseudo-rapidity ($\\Delta\\eta$) correlations at small azimuthal difference ($\\Delta\\phi$) are observed in high multiplicity p+p and p+Pb collisions at the LHC. Subtraction of the di-hadron correlation in low-multiplicity p+Pb collisions from high-multiplicity ones reveals a back-to-back double ridge structure ($\\Delta\\phi\\approx 0$ and $\\pi$). A similar double ridge is observed in high-multiplicity d+Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment in their limited acceptance. Differences between multiplicity-selected d+Au collisions (and p+p collisions) have been observed before by STAR. However, the question remains open whether the ridge in d+Au collisions is a jet-related difference between central and peripheral collisions, or a new physics phenomenon such as anisotropic flow in d+Au. STAR, with its large acceptance, can rigorously address this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we report di-hadron $\\Delta\\eta$-$\\Delta\\phi$ correlations in d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV. At mid-rapidity (with $|\\Delta\\eta|<2$), the jet-like correlation contribution in ``central$-$peripheral\" method is evaluated. At large $|\\Delta\\eta|\\approx 3$, the comparison of di-hadron correlations in central and peripheral collisions is reported in terms of the Au and deuteron beam directions. The $\\Delta\\phi$ correlation functions are also analyzed via a Fourier series decomposition; the $|\\Delta\\eta|$ and multiplicity dependencies of the Fourier coefficients are investigated.

      "Abstract": "Two-particle momentum correlations carry important information about the space-time characteristics of the particle emission region. Femtoscopic correlations at low relative momentum arise from quantum statistics (for identical particle pairs) and final-state interactions (for both identical and non-identical pairs) and are used to probe the homogeneity lengths of the emitting source. Hydrodynamic models predict a decrease of these homogeneity lengths with increasing pair transverse mass ($m_{\\rm T}$), which has been confirmed by pion analyses. Femtoscopic analyses of heavier particles are able to extend the $m_{\\rm T}$ range and thus further constrain theoretical models. Femtoscopic correlations are also important for studying two-particle systems whose scattering interaction is not well-known. They can be used to extract information about the interaction, such as scattering lengths and effective ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe present measurements of two-particle femtoscopic correlations of several identical and non-identical systems of mesons and baryons measured by ALICE in $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. One-dimensional radii ($R_{\\rm inv}$) and $\\lambda$ parameters for various particle types are extracted, with which an approximate $m_{\\rm T}$-scaling is seen beyond the range of previous pion analyses.

The results on the transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the elliptic flow (v2) obtained from two-, four-, six- and eight-particle cumulants are presented. Higher-order coefficients, v3 and v4 are also derived using two- and four-particle cumulants and shown as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. A reduction of contributions not related to the initial geometry for vn studied with cumulant expansion of correlations between more than two particles is discussed. Event-by-event fluctuations of the flow harmonics evaluated with multi-particle cumulants as a function of transverse momentum and the collision centrality are also presented. These results are complemented with the pT-integrated elliptic flow measured in the pseudorapidity range |$\\eta$|< 2.5 with the event plane method, exploring the range of very low transverse momenta. This was achieved by applying dedicated track reconstruction methods. The centrality dependence of the integrated v2, spanning the range of 0–80% of most central Pb+Pb collisions, is compared to other measurements obtained with higher $p_T$ thresholds. The pseudorapidity dependence of the integrated elliptic flow in different centrality intervals is discussed and compared to the lower energy RHIC data.",

In order to describe the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement transition at the same time, we choose the Nambu-Jana-Lasinio model with Polyakov loop (PNJL model). This model was proposed by combining the Nambu-Jana-Lasinio model which describes the chiral transition and the Polyakov loop which works as an order parameter of deconfinement transition. We calculated an equation of state by an approach beyond the mean field approximation to take thermal excitations of hadrons into account. In this method, mesons can be introduced as auxiliary fields, and their excitations are described as thermal fluctuations of auxiliary fields. We will present an equation of state concerning mesonic excitations at zero quark chemical potential in the two- and three-flavor PNJL model for interacting quarks [1, 2]. In addition, we have thought the way to introduce baryonic correlation as the three body system of quarks at finite chemical potential. In this case, it is necessary to consider how to put interactions between three quarks, unlike mesons as the two body system of quark and anti-quark. We will also discuss about that.\r\n\r\n[1] K.

Since in both formulations the gauge links are integrated out analytically, the sign problem is much milder than in conventional lattice QCD. The resulting dual representation in terms of color singlets allows to better understand the nature of nuclear interactions. Since both fermion discretizations have different lattice artifacts, a comparison is instructive to isolate the physical content which persists as one aims for the continuum limit, in particular the existence of the critical end point.\r\n\r\nThe strong coupling limit of staggered fermions is well established, recent results on the corresponding $\\mu-T$ phase diagram and its corrections to the strong coupling limit are presented. For Wilson fermions, no such results have been obtained yet for QCD, only the Schwinger model has been addressed so far.

      "Abstract": "Recently, an integrated on-line system for the study of the interactions in High Energy Physics, called YaPT, was developed at the calculation center of the Research Centre „Nuclear Matter in Extreme Conditions” [1]. Using this system, a systematic study of the Au-Au collisions at SIS-100 (FAIR-GSI) energies with a few simulation codes, as well as using a phenomenological geometric picture of the relativistic nuclear collisions [2,3] collisions was been done. Three types of charged particles were considered. The predictions of a few simulation codes (UrQMD, AMPT) were used for estimation in the mentioned model of the terms of the equation of state related to energy density, temperature and compressibility. The proton-proton collisions at similar energies have been used for comparisons. When possible, comparisons with existing experimental results at similar energies were included. \r\nThe Rankine-Hugoniot equation permits estimations of the compressibility coefficient, the estimations being between 100 MeV and 1000 MeV. The estimations for viscosity coefficient, according to the model, indicated a significant increase from proton-proton collision to nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same incident energy. A small increase of this coefficient with the increase of the beam energy can be observed, too. A short analysis of the nuclear matter jets formation [4] in nucleus-nucleus collisions at these energies is done.\r\nDifference among the simulation codes predictions were observed, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1].

Its\r\nlocation experimentally will provide one of the most stringent tests of\r\nQCD calculations. In the BES program $T$ and  $\\mu_{B}$  are varied by\r\nchanging the center of mass energy ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) from 200 to 7.7 GeV.\r\nThe observables chosen for CP search are the product of moments of\r\nconserved(like net-charge) multiplicity distributions or their proxies\r\n(such as net-kaon for net-strangeness and net-proton for net-baryons)\r\nmeasured in the experiments. The various moments (mean ($M$), standard\r\ndeviation ($\\sigma$), skewness ($S$) and kurtosis ($\\kappa$)) are related\r\nto correlation length ($\\xi$) of the system (variance: $\\sigma^{2}$ $\\sim$\r\n$\\xi^{2}$; skewness: $S$ $\\sim$ $\\xi^{4.5}$ and kurtosis: $\\kappa$ $\\sim$\r\n$\\xi^{7}$) [1] and are expected to show a non-monotonic variation with\r\nbeam energy in the presence of CP.\r\n\r\nWe report new measurements of product of moments: $\\sigma^{2}/M$,\r\n$S\\sigma$ and $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ of net-kaon distributions ($\\Delta N_{K}$\r\n= $N_K^+$ - $N_K^-$) obtained by the STAR detector at midrapidity\r\nfor various centrality in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5,\r\n19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV.

      "Abstract": "Models for the heavy flavor production in ultrarelativistic heavy ion \r\ncollisions suffer from a lack of elliptical flow as compared to the experimental data if they reproduce $R_{\\rm AA}$, often referred to by experimentalists as a \"tension between  $R_{\\rm AA}$  and  $v_2$\". One possible reason for this discrepancy may be the disregard of  D-meson rescattering in hadronic matter  in the latest stage of the evolution. To study this is the core of our contribution. \r\n\r\nThe drag and diffusion coefficients of D-mesons propagating in a hot and dense hadronic matter are calculated. The hadronic medium consists of pions, kaons, etas, rho-mesons and nucleons. We find that the transport coefficients increase with the temperature of the medium. The dominant contributions to the drag and diffusion coefficients come from pions, but at higher temperatures the contributions from other (heavier) hadrons become important as well. In addition, we evaluate the thermal relaxation rate of D-mesons, which is in agreement with the model estimate of He, Fries and Rapp. The relaxation rate reaches approx. 0.1/fm in the vicinity of the critical temperature; this is comparable to non-perturbative T-matrix calculations of charm-quark relaxation in QGP. The size of the transport coefficients in hadronic matter shows that the hadronic contributions should be included when evaluating the nuclear suppression factor and the elliptic flow for single leptons originating from the decays of D-mesons or for D-mesons during the expansion of the matter created in heavy ion reactions at mid-rapidity. \r\n   \r\n Finally, we study the consequence for the $R_{\\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy mesons by using a hydrodynamical model for the expansion of QGP and the hadron gas in which the chemical freeze-out is modelled by the effective chemical potential. We present the modification of the $R_{\\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of D-mesons due to the hadronic rescattering, for both, RHIC and LHC energies.",

      "Abstract": "The PHENIX Collaboration has argued that azimuthal angle dependent pi0 suppression in Au+Au at RHIC poses a challenge for perturbative QCD energy loss models. Recent work by Betz and Gyulassy on the other hand claims simultaneous reproduction of this set of observables with simple pQCD-motivated energy loss formulas, in contrast with our earlier finding that realistic transverse expansion strongly suppresses elliptic flow. We resolve the apparent contradiction via a study that contrasts different bulk medium evolution models (based on hydrodynamics and covariant transport) combined with different implementations of Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev radiative energy loss for light partons and heavy quarks. A key new ingredient relative to earlier dE/dL and (D)GLV studies is that we pay special attention to formulate energy loss in a way that results do not depend on the calculational frame. We find that covariant formulation accentuates the interplay between bulk medium evolution and parton energy loss, and show how this affects light hadron and heavy flavor anisotropic flow.",

They validate the characteristic signature expected for the system size dependence of viscous damping at each collision energy studied. The extracted viscous coefficients, that encode the magnitude of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density $\\eta/s$, are observed to decrease to an apparent minimum as the collision energy is increased from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7$ to approximately 62.4~GeV; thereafter, they show a slow \r\nincrease with $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ up to 2.76 TeV. This pattern of viscous damping provides the first experimental constraint for $\\eta/s$ in the temperature-baryon chemical potential ($T, \\mu_B$) plane, and could be an initial indication for decay trajectories which lie close to the critical end point in the phase diagram for nuclear matter.",

      "Speaker": "Pol Gossiaux",
      "Institute": "Subatech",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "It is generally admitted that heavy quarks (c and b) created in the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions through hard processes are among the best probes of the later QGP stage. Perturbative QCD allows for the calculation of the production cross sections (in contradistinction to light quarks) and these cross sections have also been measured. Also the details of the chiral/confinement phase transition are less important than for light quarks because, due to its mass, the momentum of the heavy quark determines the momentum of the open charm hadrons. In addition, the momentum distribution at production and at the transition is very different from that expected if the heavy quarks are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma of light quarks and gluons. Therefore the modification of the initial momentum distribution by the interaction of the heavy quarks with the plasma carries information on the plasma properties.\r\n\r\nThe interaction of the heavy quark with the plasma has two parts, elastic collisions and radiative collisions. For the first a model was developed [1] in which the cross section of the elementary interactions are calculated by \r\nperturbative QCD with a running coupling constant and an infrared behavior adjusted so as to match hard thermal loop calculations. Embedding these cross sections in the hydrodynamical description of the expanding plasma of Heinz and Kolb it was shown that the collisional energy loss underpredicts the measured energy loss of heavy mesons at large momenta as well as their elliptic flow by roughly a factor of two.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the present work to extend our pQCD calculation toward the calculation of the radiative energy loss for heavy quarks at intermediate energies. To this end we compute the gluon emission cross section of a heavy quark colliding a light parton from the plasma in pQCD at leading order [2]. We first derive the high-energy approximation that naturally extends results obtained by Gunion and Bertsch for the light quark sector to heavy quarks. We next show that it is possible to compute the complete energy dependence of the result. This allows us to assess the range of applicability in energy of the high-energy approximation. We then extend the calculation to the case of intermediate energy, for which the invariant mass $s$ in the collision does not exceed the squared heavy quark mass $m_Q^2$ in large amounts. We discuss in particular the relevance of the dead cone effect as well as the consequences of a finite heavy quark energy, which is often neglected in the literature. For this purpose, we address quantities such as the average energy loss in a bath at finite temperature as well as the nuclear modification factor as a function of the transverse momentum.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n==========\r\n[1] P.B.

      "Abstract": "The aim of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is the study of nuclear matter at high temperature and pressure where quantum chromodynamics predicts the existence of a deconfined state of nuclear matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are expected to be produced in the initial partonic scatterings and interact with the deconfined medium making them ideal probes of the QGP. According to the color-screening model, quarkonium states are suppressed in the medium with different dissociation probabilities for the various states. Recent results from the ALICE collaboration on the measurement of the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of inclusive J/$\\psi$ indicate that a significant fraction of the observed J/$\\psi$ is produced via the recombination of charm quarks from the QGP phase. Quarkonium detection at forward rapidity is performed with the ALICE muon spectrometer in the range -4 $< \\eta <$ -2.5 down to $p_{\\rm T}$ = 0. We report on the first measurement of a low-$p_{\\rm T}$  J/$\\psi$ yield excess ($p_{\\rm T} <$ 300 MeV/$c$) in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, in the centrality bins 50-70$\\%$ and 70-90$\\%$. Photoproduction of J/$\\psi$ (occuring at $b < 2R$) is proposed as the underlying physics mechanism. Such a mechanism may represent a promising signature to probe the charmonium color-screening dissociation in the QGP at LHC energies.

      "Abstract": "Quantitative knowledge of heavy quark momentum distributions in the hot nuclear medium created by ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is of high value in quantitatively understanding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase of nuclear matter. In particular, the modification of heavy-quark momentum distributions from nuclear collisions as compared to smaller collision environments (such as p+p) provides important clues about the density of color charges and their coupling strength, which is of fundamental importance in QCD. This poster describes a procedure for statistical inference of D and B meson $p_{T}$ yields from nonphotonic electrons (NPEs). The relative yield of D and B mesons is sensitive to the electron $p_{T}$ and displaced-vertex distributions because of their mass and lifetime difference. The dataset is composed of an invariant NPE yield vs. $p_{T}$ as well as the electron displaced-vertex information, both measured near midrapidity. The yield of $D,B$ and subsequent decay ($D\\to e$ and $B\\to e$) is modeled using a monte carlo event generator (e.g. PYTHIA). Using real data and the generative model as inputs, the yield of parent mesons is inferred in a rigorous Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. The result is a full posterior distribution of D and B meson yields over a large $p_{T}$ range.",

The soft part of the model represents a thermal hadron production at the freeze-out hypersurface in accordance with hydrodynamical calculations. The possible triangular shape fluctuation of the initial overlap density of the colliding nuclei was implemented in HYDJET++ by the modulation of the final freeze-out hypersurface with the appropriate triangular coefficient, which results in triangular flow $v_3$. Along with elliptic flow $v_2$, it generates higher order flow coefficients, as well as a specific structure of  dihadron angular correlations on relative azimuthal angle in a broad range of relative pseudoraidities ($\\Delta\\varphi \\Delta\\eta$). The comparison of model results with the LHC data on short- and long-range angular correlations is presented for different collisions centralities and transverse momenta intervals.",

The slope parameter $r$ of the linear dependence of $\\Delta v_{2}=v_{2}(\\pi^{-})-v_{2}(\\pi^{+})$ on $A_{ch}=(N^{+}-N^{-})/(N^{+}+N^{-})$ is yielded by the conversion from an initial electric charge quadrupole distribution to a charge-dependent elliptic flow via a strong parton cascade process. The slope parameter $r$ is increased by the hadronization of coalescence, and then decreased by final resonance decays.  Because the slope parameter $r$ is very sensitive to both initial electric charge quadrupole percentage and centrality, a helpful constraint of the effect from chiral magnetic wave is extracted out in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nGuo-Liang Ma, arXiv:1401.6502.",

      "Abstract": "Two dimensional low-pT dihadron correlations in azimuthal angle ϕ and pseudo-rapidity η in high-energy heavy-ion collisions are investigated within both the HIJING Monte Carlo model and an event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic model. Without final-state interaction and collective expansion, dihadron correlations from HIJING simulations have a typical structure from minijets that contains a near-side two-dimensional peak and an away-side ridge along the η-direction. In contrast, event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic simulations with fluctuating initial conditions from the HIJING+AMPT model produce a strong dihadron correlation that has an away-side as well as a near-side ridge. Relics of intrinsic dihadron correlation from minijets in the initial conditions still remain as superimposed on the two ridges. By varying initial conditions from HIJING+AMPT, we study effects of minijets, non-vanishing initial flow and longitudinal fluctuation on the final state dihadron correlations. With a large rapidity gap, one can exclude near-side correlations from minijet relics and dihadron correlations can be described by the superposition of harmonic flows up to the 6th order. When long-range correlations with a large rapidity gap are subtracted from short-range correlations with a small rapidity gap, the remaining near-side dihadron correlations result solely from relics of minijets. Low transverse momentum hadron yields per trigger (ptrig_T<4 GeV/c, passo_T<2 GeV/c) in central heavy-ion collisions are significantly enhanced over that in p+p collisions while widths in azimuthal angle remain the same, in qualitative agreement with experimental data.",

However, it is not clear whether the properties of the medium such as the jet transport parameter as probed by a propagating jet is unique and intrinsic to the medium, independent of the hard processes that produce the energetic jets. This is a problem of factorization of multiple scattering in QCD and so far has eluded many theoretical efforts. In this talk, we show you the first complete NLO calculation of transverse momentum broadening in SIDIS e+A and DY p+A collisions. We demonstrate for the first time how QCD factorization holds for multiple parton scattering and the universality of the associated quark-gluon correlation function or properties of nuclear matter contained  therein as probed by a propagating parton,  independent of the hard processes that create the fast partons. Our calculation also identifies the QCD evolution equation for this quark-gluon correlation function, which determines the QCD scale and jet energy dependence  of the jet transport parameter. We further solve the QCD evolution equation of qhat numerically and determine the scale and energy dependence of the jet transport parameter  in cold and hot dense medium.",

At fixed multiplicity, the correlations in these two colliding systems are strikingly similar, although though the system size in p + A is smaller. Based on an independent cluster model and a simple conformal scaling argument, where the ratio of the mean free path to the system size stays constant at fixed multiplicity, I argue that flow in p + A emerges as a collective response to the fluctuations in the position of the clusters, just like in A + A collisions. By examining the recent LHC data carefully, I show that this simple model captures the essential physics of elliptic and triangular flow in p + A collisions. I also explore the implications of the model for jet energy loss in p + A collisions.",

The jet-energy loss models are coupled to state of the art viscous hydrodynamic fields. RHIC data are found to be surprisingly consistent with most dE/dx+Hydro models, but extrapolations to LHC energies favor running coupling QCD-based energy-loss models, while conformal holography models are inconsistent with the data.

The off-shell properties of quasi-particles- masses and widths - are described within the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) and strongly depend on the temperature.\r\n\r\nWe calculate the different cross sections for perturbative partons (massless on-shell particles in the vacuum) and for dynamical quasi-particles (off-shell particles in the QGP medium as described by the DQPM) using the leading order Born diagrams [2]. We find that the finite width of the quasi-particles in the DQPM-which encodes the multiple partonic scattering - has little influence on the cross section for qQ ->qQ as well as gQ ->gQ scattering except close to thresholds. Thus when studying the dynamics of energetic heavy quarks in a QGP medium the spectral width of the charm quarks may be discarded.\r\n\r\nUsing the obtained on- and off-shell cross sections we have calculated the transport properties of the charm quarks in an equilibrated QGP such as the relaxation time [3], dynamical collisional energy loss, drag and diffusion coefficients, longitudinal and transverse momentum fluctuations, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally we incorporate the charm scattering processes in the PHSD transport approach and study the dynamics of heavy quarks in realistic heavy-ion collisions addressing observables such as the elliptic flow v_2 and R_AA.\r\n\r\n[1] W.

      "Abstract": "Hard-scattered partons provide an ideal probe for the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma because they are produced prior to the formation of the QCD medium in heavy-ion collisions. Early measurements conducted at RHIC experiments have provided compelling evidence of jet quenching. In more recent years LHC experiments have confirmed these observations at a higher collisional energy, which allows full jet reconstruction over a much wider kinematic range. Jets are reconstructed in ALICE utilizing both the central tracking system for the charged constituents and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the neutral constituents. One of the most important challenges of jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is the large fluctuating background energy density coming from the underlying event. A data-driven method has been used to correct for it which, combined with the unfolding of the detector effects, makes it possible to compare with other experimental results and theoretical predictions. Jet spectra will be reported for Pb-Pb and for pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 ATeV. The pp measurement serves also as the baseline for the determination of the nuclear modification factor, which shows a strong suppression of jet production in central Pb-Pb collisions. Differential measurements relative to the event plane and centrality class, which make use of data triggered by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter, will aid further investigation of details of this suppression, e.g. regarding the path length dependence of parton energy loss.",

The framework can be readily used along with a correction framework for systematic biases in anisotropic flow analyses due to various detector inefficiencies. A new recursive algorithm has been developed for higher order correlators for the cases where their direct implementation is not feasible. We propose and discuss new azimuthal observables for anisotropic flow analyses which can be measured for the first time with our new framework. Effects of finite detector granularity on multi-particle correlations are quantified and discussed in detail. We point out the existence of a systematic bias in traditional differential flow analyses which stems solely from the applied selection criteria on particles used in the analyses, and is also present in the ideal case when only flow correlations are present. Finally, we extend the applicability of our generic framework to the case of differential multi-particle correlations.",

      "Abstract": "A major objective in the field of heavy ion collisions is to quantify and characterize the properties of QGP by studying heavy flavor production. The $J/\\psi$ meson can be produced in one of three ways: 1) directly in the collision, 2) indirectly via feeddown from heavier charmonium states, or 3) from the decay of B mesons. If the $J/\\psi$ is produced through either of the first two methods, it is called a prompt $J/\\psi$, while the third method produces a non-prompt $J/\\psi$. With the newly commissioned forward silicon vertex detector (FVTX) in 2012, it is possible for the first time at the PHENIX experiment to extract non-prompt $J/\\psi$'s from the inclusive $J/\\psi$ signal by measuring a displaced vertex. In this poster, we will present the current status of the data analysis for $J/\\psi$'s that come from B decays in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=510$ GeV with the PHENIX experiment at RHIC.

We employ this framework to study deformed U+U collisions, asymmetric Cu+Au collisions and the effect of deformation in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. A combined study of these heavy ion systems with varying initial geometries can provide a unique opportunity to determine the origin of different sources of fluctuations that affect global observables like multiplicity and flow. We study the sensitivity of multiplicity, eccentricity and their event-by-event distributions to the details of initial state geometry. Results are compared to a two component MC-Glauber model implementation that includes Negative-Binomial multiplicity fluctuations.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Based on the quasiparticle model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a color quantum path-integral Monte-Carlo (PIMC) method for calculation of thermodynamic properties and -- closely related to the latter -- a Wigner dynamics method for calculation of transport properties of the QGP are formulated. The QGP partition function is presented in the form of a color path integral with a new relativistic measure instead of the Gaussian one traditionally used in the Feynman-Wiener path integrals. A procedure of sampling color variables according to the SU(3) group Haar measure is developed for integration over the color variable. It is shown that the PIMC method is able to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state at zero baryon chemical potential at realistic model parameters (i.e. quasiparticle masses and coupling constant) and also yields valuable insight into the internal structure of the QGP. Our results indicate that the QGP reveals quantum liquid-like rather than gas-like properties up to the highest considered temperature of 525 MeV. The pair distribution functions clearly reflect the existence of gluon-gluon bound states, i.e. glueballs, at temperatures just above the phase transition, while meson-like bound states are not found. The calculated self-diffusion coefficient agrees well with some estimates of the heavy-quark diffusion constant available from recent lattice data and also with an analysis of heavy-quark quenching in experiments on ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, however, appreciably exceeds other estimates. The lattice and heavy-quark-quenching results on the heavy-quark diffusion  are still rather diverse. The obtained results for the shear viscosity are in the range of those deduced from an analysis of the experimental elliptic flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ions collisions, i.e. in terms the viscosity-to-entropy ratio.",

      "Abstract": "To understand the evolution of a dense system of gluons, such as those produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, is an important and challenging problem. We describe the approach to thermal equilibrium using the small angle approximation for gluon scattering in a Boltzmann equation that includes the effects of Bose statistics. The role of Bose statistical factors in amplifying the rapid growth of the population of the soft modes is essential. With these factors properly taken into account, one finds that elastic scattering alone provides an efficient mechanism for populating soft modes, and in fact leads to rapid infrared local thermalization. \r\n\r\nFurthermore recent developments suggest that high initial overpopulation plays a key role and may lead to dynamical Bose-Einstein Condensation. The kinetics of condensation is an interesting problem in itself. By solving the transport equation for initial conditions with a large enough initial phase-space density the equilibrium state contains a Bose condensate, and we present numerical evidence that such over-populated systems reach the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in a finite time. It is also found that the approach to condensation is characterized by a scaling behavior. Finally we discuss a number of extensions of the present study.  \r\n\r\nReference: Blaizot, Liao, McLerran, Nucl. Phys. A920(2013)58.",

      "Abstract": "The conserved charge fluctuations, as quantified by the corresponding susceptibilities, provide important information about the charge-carriers and their dynamical correlations in strongly interacting matter such as the quark-gluon plasma. Using the gauge-gravity correspondence approach, we study the patterns of conserved charge fluctuations in two types of holographic models for QCD, the D4/D8 and the D3/D7 models. We compute and compare the quark number susceptibilities in both models and find an interesting common feature of the two: at very strong coupling higher order susceptibilities are suppressed and the conserved charge fluctuations become purely Gaussian. In light of the state-of-the-art lattice QCD results we also discuss what we can learn from these susceptibilities about the underlying degrees of freedom in the $1\\sim 2 T_c$ quark-gluon plasma and examine the viability of different ideas such as holography, quasi-particles, as well as bound states. From analysis of second order cross-flavor susceptibilities we conclude that the bound states exist and are important in the $1\\sim 2 T_c$ region. Based on that we have further constructed model with  predictions for several ratios of fourth-order susceptibilities that are in good agreement with lattice QCD results.\r\n\r\nReference: Shuzhe Shi and Jinfeng Liao, JHEP06(2013)104[arXiv:1304.7752].",

      "Abstract": "Higher order cumulants of fluctuations of conserved charges are an important diagnostic tool for the thermodynamic properties of strong interacting matter close to freeze out [1] at LHC energies as well as in the entire energy range covered with the beam energy scan (BES) at RHIC. We present recent progress on the calculation of conserved charge fluctuations with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ action). In particular we will focus on higher order cumulants up to 6th order of net baryon number, net electric charge and net strangeness fluctuations. We will discuss how these quantities approach the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures, the perturbative limit at high-T [2] and analyze to what extent they show sensitivity to universal scaling behavior, *i.e.* we estimate the relative strength of contributions from the regular and singular part of the free energy. Based on this analysis we discuss consequences for the QCD phase diagram and the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the QCD partition function. The latter can be used to locate the QCD critical point. Furthermore, we comment on the signature of the QCD critical point in various ratios of conserved charge fluctuations that are measured in the BES at RHIC.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n 1. A.

      "Abstract": "With increasing beam energies the angular momentum of the fireball in peripheral heavy ion collisions is increasing.  The earlier predicted rotation effect and Kelvin Helmholtz Instability, leads to space-time momentum correlations among the emitted particles. For these reactions two particle correlations are studied. A specific combination of two particle correlation measurements is proposed, the Differential Hanbury Brown and Twiss method, which can sensitively detect the rotation of the emitting system. In case of azimuthally symmetric systems without rotation the new method gives zero signal, while it is sensitive to the rotation in the system.

      "Abstract": "Due to the low viscosity and strongly interacting QGP at high LHC energies flow fluctuations were observed up to the 8th flow harmonics. Similarly rotation, turbulence and even Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability were predicted and these may be observable by different methods. Apart of the usual flow harmonics analysis, other methods like two particle correlations, or particle polarizations may arise as a consequence of these processes.  The appearance of turbulent phenomena in these experiments would be additional direct proof of the low viscosity.\r\n\r\nIn particular we observed in 3+1D fluid dynamical calculations at LHC and RHIC energies that Lambda polarization arising from thermal and mechanical equilibrium, can provide measurable signal in given azimuthal directions. The signal is predicted to be somewhat stronger at RHIC energies because the higher temperature at LHC decreases thermal vorticity (polarization) even if the angular momentum is larger at LHC. This mechanism is considerably stronger than the polarization arising from the direct electro-magnetic effect of the strong and rapidly changing fields during the collision.\r\n\r\nThe talk is based on recent results and the following publications:\r\nL.P.

      "Abstract": "Currently, most fluid-dynamical simulations of relativistic heavy ion collisions take into account only dissipative effects originating from shear viscosity. However, there is no a priori reason to neglect bulk viscosity since the actual order of magnitude and temperature dependence of this transport coefficient is unknown, and could be significant. In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of a nonzero bulk viscosity coefficient on transverse momentum spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy. We then extract the optimal values of the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients that are able to describe these observables. For ultracentral heavy ion collisions, measured by ATLAS and CMS, we perform this analysis using several initial condition models. For other centrality classes, we determine these coefficients using the IP-Glasma initial condition model. Our fluid-dynamical description is the most complete available and includes all possible second order terms that appear in Israel-Stewart theory, including those that couple bulk viscous pressure to shear stress. The transport coefficients of all terms are computed using kinetic theory. We find that the optimum values of shear viscosity extracted from data can be modified up to 50% when bulk viscosity is included.\r\n\r\nWe further discuss the effects of baryon chemical potential on the shear viscosity of bulk nuclear matter. We show that a hadron resonance gas with large baryon number density is closer to the ideal fluid limit than the corresponding gas with zero baryon number.",

Previous predictions from a tomographic model based on only the leading order AdS/CFT contribution to energy loss and constrained by RHIC data disagreed with LHC D meson measurements.  In this work we include for the first time a correct treatment of the momentum fluctuations induced in the heavy quark motion from the strongly-coupled thermal medium: we resolve the ambiguity in the evaluation of the stochastic Langevin equations using the Wong-Zakai theorem and properly take into account the fluctuations' deviations from the Einstein relations.  The addition of the fluctuations leads to corrections to the suppression predictions, which are significant for charm quarks and their decay products.  We demonstrate how further experimental measurements can provide insight into the dominant energy loss mechanisms in, and hence the physical properties of, the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.",

Suppression of the $J/\\psi$ production due to color screening of the $c\\overline{c}$ binding potential in the deconfined medium has been proposed as a signature of the QGP formation. High-$p_T$ $J/\\psi$ measurements in $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC published recently by the STAR collaboration show significant suppression in the most central collisions. Since secondary production via $c\\overline{c}$ recombination and so called cold nuclear matter effects are small at high $p_T$, these results point to the color screening features. The energy density is expected to be on average about 20% higher in $U+U$ collisions than in $Au+Au$ collisions, therefore the $J/\\psi$ measurement in $U+U$ collisions at high $p_T$ can provide new insight in the study of color screening features for charmonium.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will report the status of the analysis of mid-rapidity $(|y|<1)$ $J/\\psi\\rightarrow$$e^{+}e^{-}$ production in $U+U$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $193 GeV at STAR using RHIC year 2012 data triggered with the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter.",

      "Abstract": "Recent results in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide evidence for collective expansion and flow of the created medium. We propose a control set of experiments to directly compare particle emission patterns from p+Au, d+Au, and He3+Au or t+Au collisions at the same sqrt(sNN). Using Monte Carlo Glauber we find that a He3 or triton projectile, with a realistic wavefunction description, induces a significant intrinsic triangular shape to the initial medium and that, even with viscous damping, this survives into a significant third order flow moment v3. By comparing systems with one, two, and three initial hot spots, one can disentangle the effects from the initial spatial distribution of the deposited energy and viscous damping. These are key tools to answering the question of how small a droplet of matter is necessary to form a quark-gluon plasma described by nearly inviscid hydrodynamics. We describe our results from (arXiv:1312.4565) as well as new calculations including coupling to a hadronic cascade afterburner and full particle identified flow patterns.",

More specifically, the EIC will probe the low Bjorken-x domain where  gluons and sea quarks dominate with unprecedented precision, for both nucleon and nuclei. A possible realization of the accelerator facility based on the (currently operating) Relativistic Heavy Ion Collier (RHIC), called eRHIC, is proposed. The STAR detector, as one of the two major experiments at RHIC, has planned to evolve itself to eSTAR with a suite of upgrades optimized for EIC physics programs. The major components of the baseline upgrades will be introduced. The eSTAR detector performance and a broad range of deliverable measurements, which have been identified as the flagship science cases in an EIC, are demonstrated through simulation. An eSTAR has been found to be well suitable for an initial stage of eRHIC. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n1.

      "Abstract": "The observation of long-range correlations on the near- and away-side (also known as the double-ridge) in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and its similarity to Pb-Pb collisions remains one of the open questions from the p-Pb run at the Large Hadron Collider. It has been attributed to mechanisms that involve initial-state effects, such as gluon saturation and colour connections forming along the longitudinal direction, and final-state effects, such as parton-induced interactions and collective effects developing in a high-density system possibly formed in these collisions. In order to understand the nature of this double-ridge structure the two-particle correlation analysis has been extended to identified particles. The observed mass dependence in p-Pb resembles qualitative expectations from hydrodynamics, and is also observed in Pb-Pb collisions. A study of correlations at forward rapidity probes the low-x regime of the nucleus, where saturation effects are expected to become stronger. The possibility of accessing this regime using the ALICE forward muon detector is explored. In addition, a possible ridge signal within the ALICE acceptance in pp collisions $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV is also investigated.",

      "Abstract": "Two-particle angular correlations between unidentified charged trigger and associated particles are measured by the ALICE detector in pp collisions at a centre of mass energy of $0.9$, $2.76$, $7$ TeV and in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy of $5.02$ TeV. The particle correlations are expressed as an associated yield per trigger particle in the transverse-momentum range $0.7 < p_{\\rm T}, assoc < p_{\\rm T}, trig < 5.0$ GeV/$c$, to include jets down to the lowest energy (minijets). In p-Pb collisions, long-range near-side correlations, projected onto the azimuthal angle difference, are subtracted from both near- and away-side short-range correlations in order to remove the non-jet-related components, namely the double-ridge. Near- and away-side per trigger yields are studied as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity. \r\n\r\nThe extracted yields provide information about parton fragmentation at low transverse momenta, as well as about the contribution of multiple parton\r\ninteractions (MPIs) to particle production. We find that in pp collisions the uncorrelated seeds stagnate at high multiplicity, showing a limit in the number of MPIs. On the contrary, in p-Pb they increase linearly with multiplicity. Further, moving from multiplicity to geometry parameters, we observe the expected scaling of MPIs with Glauber $\\rm N_{coll}$ only in the intermediate Glauber $\\rm N_{coll}$ region, revealing a bias in the number of hard scatterings when estimated from the Glauber model.",

The code evaluates jet path integral involving running coupling DGLV induced radiated gluon energy loss rates as well as elastic energy loss for jets propagating though viscous hydrodynamics VISH 2+1D expanding thermal fields $T(x,y,t)$ constrained by fits to bulk low $p_T$ observables.  We compare numerical results as a function of our main control parameter, $\\alpha_{max}$, an assumed upper bound on the vacuum running coupling in the infrared. A $\\chi^2/d.o.f.$ analysis shows that $R^\\pi_{AA}$ data from RHIC and LHC are consistent with CUJET2.0 at the $\\chi^2/d.o.f.< 2$ level for $\\alpha_{max}=0.22-0.27$. The corresponding $\\hat{q}(E_{jet}, T)/T^3$ effective jet transport coefficient field of this model is evaluated and compared to other (HT-BW, HT-M, MARTINI, McGill-AMY) JET collaboration models [2]. We focus here on the main current jet quenching puzzle (not discussed in [2]) the underestimation of jet elliptic asymmetry, $v_2(p_T)$ at both RHIC and LHC by CUJET and most other pQCD based tomographic models. We show that relaxing the assumption that $\\alpha_{max}$ is independent of the local T field can reduce the $v_2$ discrepancy between CUJET and data to the $\\chi^2_{v_2}/d.o.f.< 2$ level by allowing as small as $10\\%$ variations of the path averaged $\\alpha_{max}(T(z))$ along in and out paths.

      "Abstract": "Recent observations of two solar-mass neutron stars\r\nbring a serious conflict between the stiff equation of state (EOS)\r\nrequired from the observations and the soft EOS\r\nwith hyperons required from theory.\r\nWe call this problem the \"Hyperon Crisis\".\r\n\r\nWe propose a possible resolution of this problem\r\nfrom the point of view of the smooth crossover\r\nbetween the hadronic matter with hyperons and\r\nthe strongly interacting (2+1)-flavor quark matter\r\nat around 3 times the normal nuclear matter density.\r\nThe sound velocity is found to increase in the crossover region, which\r\nleads to a stiff EOS and hence to two solar-mass neutron stars\r\nwith reasonable radius of about 11-12 km [1,2].\r\nOur idea is in sharp contrast to the conventional approach\r\nof the first-order hadron-quark transition where\r\nthe EOS always becomes soft.\r\n\r\nThe above conclusion is robust in the sense that\r\nthe qualitative results do not depend on the different choices of\r\nhadronic EOS nor the different ways of interpolation\r\nbetween the hadronic EOS and quark EOS.\r\nAlso, we found that the three-body\r\nforces acting among nucleons and hyperons play\r\nessential role for the onset density of strangeness\r\nmixing and the cooling of neutron stars, while\r\nthe effect of the color superconductivity does\r\nnot affect the above conclusion.\r\n\r\nOur analyses strongly indicate the necessity of\r\nstrongly interacting quark matter inside\r\nmassive neutron stars.\r\n\r\n[1] K.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, primarily produced in initial hard scattering processes at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), are important tools for understanding the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The heavy quark interaction with the QGP can be studied through non-photonic electrons (NPE), which are produced from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons. In $p+p$ collisions measurements of heavy flavor production serve as a test of the pQCD framework and are used as a baseline for comparison to measurements from heavy ion collisions. In $Au+Au$ and $d+Au$ the hot and cold nuclear matter effects can be quantified through the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$, $R_{dA}$).\r\n\r\nModels with different assumptions describe relatively well the suppression and elliptic flow of NPE at the top RHIC energy. New observables are required to discriminate between models. An energy dependence of $R_{AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ and correlations of non-photonic electrons to hadrons can be used to further probe the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present a new measurement of NPE production in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV in a broad transverse momentum range (0.4< $p_{T}$ < 12 GeV/c). We will discuss the energy dependence of NPE production and azimuthal anisotropy measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =39, 62.4 and 200 GeV.  Nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ in Au+Au collisions and $R_{dA}$ in d+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV will be presented too. Finally we will show NPE-hadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at midrapidity.",

As most of the newly created hadrons are produced below or slightly above their free NN-thresholds, data are usually interpreted with the help of phenomenological models, rather than comparing to elementary reference measurements. Driven by advance in detector technology, more and more rare and penetrating probes have become accessible, and still keep challenging our knowledge about the properties of the created system and its dynamical evolution.\r\nThe recently collected HADES data from Au+Au collisions at 1.23 A GeV represents in this energy regime the most advanced sample of heavy ion collisions in terms of precision and statistics (7*10$^{9}$ collected events). Using the yields and spectra of reconstructed hadrons ($\\pi^{+-}, K^{+-},K^{0}_{s}, \\Lambda$) provides therefore the optimal bases to test state of the art models and to question the extent of our present understanding of hadron production. \r\nThis work has been supported by BMBF (05P12RFGHJ), Helmholtz Alliance EMMI,  HIC for FAIR, HGS-HIRe.",

      "Abstract": "For many years it has been expected that the suppression of J/$\\psi$ production in heavy ion collisions can provide some insight into conditions inside the deconfined Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).  A measurement of J/$\\psi$ di-electron decays at midrapidity is particularly desirable for providing insight on quarkonium formation in the plasma since cold nuclear matter effects are smaller there than at forward and backward rapidity.  The 2010 RHIC run has five times the luminosity of the last the data set used for a dielectron measurement at midrapidity. The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was added to PHENIX for operation in 2010 to study low mass dielectron pairs, with the goal of improving electron identification by eliminating conversion electrons from the beam pipe, and hadrons misidentified in the Ring Imaging Cherenkov and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The presence of the HBD can also be beneficial for the higher mass region and for the J/$\\psi$ analysis in particular. The main challenge of  the pair analysis at these higher masses is to improve the signal to background ratio while losing as little J/$\\psi$ signal as possible, so as to keep the advantage of the higher recorded luminosity. Progress in attacking this problem will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Jet modification measurements to date are carried out by comparing a surviving jet, exiting a dense medium, with a vacuum (unmodified) jet at the same energy. We propose an extension to classify jet modification in heavy-ion collisions by also including the jet mass. The mass of a jet, as measured by jet reconstruction algorithms, is intimately connected to the jet's virtuality (or scale), which in turn has a considerable effect on such observables as the fragmentation function and jet shape observables. The leading hard parton, propagating through a dense medium tends to experience substantial virtuality (or mass) depletion along with energy loss, and thus accurate comparisons between surviving jets and jets produced in p-p collisions should take these effects into account. Using the event generator PYTHIA, we show the close relationship between the actual jet mass and that after applying a jet reconstruction algorithm. Using the in-medium event generator MATTER++, we demonstrate the clear difference between the mass of a surviving parton exiting a dense medium and a parton with a similar energy formed in a hard p-p event. Effects of this difference in jet mass on the ratio of fragmentation functions and jet shapes are also calculated.",

Though RHIC has not demonstrated   sufficient luminosity to access collisions below 7.7 GeV in collider   mode, collisions between beam nuclei and a gold target will allow   STAR to study Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies of 3.0, 3.5,   4.0, and 4.5 GeV during the BES phase II.  A proof-of-principle study,   using collisions between beam halo nuclei and the aluminum beam pipe   (runs in 2011 and 2012), has been investigated to demonstrate the   feasibility of extracting physics from fixed-target collisions at   center-of-mass energies below 7.7 GeV.  Performance results from this   proof-of-principle study  will be presented. The gold target was  installed for trigger tests in   run 14.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks produced in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions would traverse the quark gluon plasma. While traversing the quark gluon plasma, they will loose energy by colliding with quarks and gluons and also by radiating gluons. After their production, they may get fragmented into heavy mesons by picking up light quarks/antiquarks and in turn may decay through leptonic channels. These leptons would carry information of the initial stage of heavy ion collisions and also the evolution of the plasma.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we have made a detailed study for the nuclear modiﬁcation factor, RAA and elliptic flow, v2 of muons from heavy flavours decay at forward rapidities in Pb+Pb collision @ 2.76 ATeV at LHC. The pT distribution of heavy quarks produced from the initial fusion of partons, is obtained from  FONLL ( Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Logarithms) approach [3, 4]. We consider both the radiative and collision energy loss along with a boost-invariant expansion of the plasma for the prediction of RAA as well as v2. The fragmentation of heavy quarks into D-mesons is governed by Peterson fragmentation function [5].\r\n\r\nWe compare our result of muon RAA from heavy flavour in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE data and found that our result can satisfactorily explain the experimental data. The nuclear modification factor of muons at 0-10% centrality calculated by the present formalism [2] has shown very good agreement with the ALICE data [6]. However the calculation shows more suppression while we take account the collisional energy loss. \r\nWe also compare our result of muon v2 from heavy flavour at 20-40% centrality for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE Preliminary data [7]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1.

We show that taking into account the quark backreaction on the gauge-field dynamics as well as quantum and thermal fluctuations of quarks and mesons is crucial in such models to achieve results for order parameters and thermodynamics that are in line with lattice calculations at vanishing chemical potential. Achieving a good agreement with non-perturbative calculations at zero density, we extend the investigations to nonzero quark density and isospin. We present the impact of unquenching effects in the Polyakov-loop potential on the phase structure at non-vanishing quark densities and show predictions for thermodynamics at nonzero isospin. We test the reliability of those models by confronting its results with lattice data on the isospin dependence of the transition temperature. Furthermore, we investigate the phase structure of the three-dimensional temperature - isospin - quark density phase diagram and calculate the surface tension for the phase transition at small temperatures and large densities.",

Identified hadrons are an important probe of both hot and cold nuclear matter. The intermediate $p_T$ region, 2--5~GeV/c, is of particular interest. In Au+Au collisions, the production of mesons is suppressed in this $p_T$ region relative to that in p+p collisions, while the production of baryons is nearly unmodified.

In particular, we see that depending on the angular and\r\ntemperature dependence of the scattering matrix the $v_2$ can be\r\nquite different. In particular, once one reproduces the $R_{AA}$ with both a Boltzmann\r\nand/or a Langevin approach the $v_2(p_T)$ that is build-up can be as different as a 50-80%.\r\nThis together with a coalescence hadronization mechanism strongly quenches the puzzling\r\n$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ observation.\r\nDifferences between Boltzmann and Langevin dynamics can be traced back to the fact that\r\nespecially for large screening mass (nearly isotropic scatterings)  the transferred momentum\r\nis not small but comparable with the charm mass as well as to the average momentum of the bulk.\r\nOn the other hand such differences disappear for bottom quarks which are predicted to be free\r\nof the ambiguities coming from the difference between a Boltzmann or a Langevin approach,\r\nand should more properly considered as heavy quarks as regards their transport in the QGP.\r\nOur study allows also to shed lights on the different predictions of several models\r\ncurrently compared with the first data at LHC on D mesons.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n1) S.

Based on our earlier results for the propagators [2] which match data from lattice Monte-Carlo simulations, we obtain kinematically complete results for the three gluon vertex that are in very good agreement with available lattice data likewise. Feeding these results back into the propagator DSEs allows us to assess previously used model input and approximations. The full iterative solution to the coupled DSEs of pure Landau gauge QCD without quarks, which now for the first time dynamically includes the complete set of three-point  vertex functions, then provides encouraging evidence of the convergence of this type of vertex expansion for QCD.\r\n\r\n[1] Blum, Huber, Mitter, von Smekal, arXiv:1401.0713 [hep-ph]\r\n\r\n[2] Huber, von Smekal, JHEP 1304 (2013) 149",

The study will focus on high precision measurements of rare probes over a wide range of momenta, which would require high statistics and are not satisfactory or even possible with the present experimental set up. To improve its physics capabilities, ALICE has formulated an upgrade strategy of several detectors to be installed during LS2 under the assumption that the LHC will progressively increase its luminosity with Pb beams eventually reaching an interaction rate of about 50 kHz. Within this upgrade strategy, the Inner Tracking System (ITS) upgrade forms an important cornerstone, providing precise measurements for heavy-flavour interactions with the QGP medium and for the production of thermal photons and low-mass dileptons by highly improved tracking and vertexing capabilities. These new measurements would provide an insight to the study of, in particular, the thermalization of heavy quarks in the QGP and the in-medium energy loss, and to assess the initial temperature and degrees of freedom of the system, respectively. The new ITS has a barrel geometry consisting of seven layers of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) with high granularity, which would fulfil the material budget, readout and radiation hardness requirements for the upgrade. The layout and the properties of the new ITS  are optimized for high tracking efficiency, both standalone and in combination with the outer Time Projection Chamber (TPC). In this contribution, the performance of the new ITS will be presented and compared to the current setup.  An overview of the technical developments for the detector elements and of the construction procedures will also be presented.",

The momentum of the secondary beam is up to 20 GeV/c. \r\nThe first experiment using the beam line is under preparation to study mass properties of vector mesons and partial chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear medium. The experiment will measure mass spectra of vector mesons in nucleus with 100 times larger statistics than the KEK-PS E325 experiment which shows significant mass modifications in nucleus. The new experiment aims to confirm results of the previous KEK experiment and have a large statistics to discuss more details. The new experiment uses new detector techniques, such as a GEM tracker and a Hadron Blind Detector, to achieve such a large statistics.",

      "Abstract": "In this talk we shall discuss how the energy-momentum deposited by partonic dijets in the quark-gluon plasma may affect the direct, elliptic and triangular flow of low (and intermediate) $p_T$ hadrons in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The dijets are modeled as external sources in the energy-momentum conservation equations, which are solved on an event-by-event basis within the ideal hydro approximation. Differential anisotropic flow coefficients in the range $p_T > 1$GeV are found to be significantly enhanced if each jet deposits, on average, more than 8 GeV in the medium. Moreover, because this jet-induced extra anisotropic flow is not related to the initial fluctuations of the geometry, the correlation between the integrated $v_2$ and $v_3$ coefficients and their corresponding eccentricities previously found to hold in jetless simulations is considerably weakened. The extra amount of direct flow induced by dijets may be quantified by comparing the azimuthal dependence of dihadron correlations in dijet events with the corresponding quantity computed in events without dijets. This information can be used to give a rough estimate of the magnitude of the effective coupling between the jets and the medium.",

      "Abstract": "In an attempt to solve the problem of spurious gauge copies in the path integral approach to gauge theories, V. N. Gribov proposed in 1978 a method to restrict the integration domain of the path integral to only one gauge field representative of each physical field configuration. As a result, the quadratic part of the gluon propagator is modified in the infrared, so that it acquires complex poles, i.e., complex \"masses\". This implies the absence of gluons in the physical spectrum, which is a necessary condition for confinement. An analogous reasoning\r\nmay be applied to quark fields coupled to the gauge fields. As a consequence, the quark propagator also gets modified in the infrared, giving rise to unphysical propagators (i.e., with complex poles) at small momenta. Such a property is understood as a sign of both quark confinement and of the breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of this model by exactly calculating the partition function using standard methods of finite-temperature quantum field theory. We find that the infrared behavior of the\r\nquark propagator leads to a highly nontrivial pressure as a function of the temperature, which is qualitatively close to the results from lattice QCD at finite temperature.",

      "Abstract": "Hybrid approaches are very successful in describing the dynamics of heavy ions collisions. The hot and dense medium is described well by fluid dynamic calculations whereas hadron transport accounts for particle rescatterings in the late stages of the reaction. The application of fluid dynamics requires rapid thermalization of the system. How and whether it is reached remains debatable. In this contribution we use the UrQMD hadron transport to study the early time dynamics of heavy ion collisions at $\\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 3-20$ GeV. We consider the energy-momentum tensor of coarse-grained UrQMD events as a function of space and time to explore the degree of local equilibration of the system. In addition, to find out how well fluid dynamics can describe the system at these energies, we initialize UrQMD and viscous hydrodynamics in the same way and compare their $T^{\\mu \\nu}$ during the space-time evolution.\r\n    At the end of the fluid-dynamical evolution particles are generated on the transition hypersurface according to the Cooper-Frye formula. This description suffers from so-called negative contributions – particles flying from outside back to the fluid-dynamical region. We compare negative contributions obtained in the Cooper-Frye description to the actual particle trajectories across the hypersurface, again in a coarse-grained UrQMD evolution, where all the microscopic information is available. We show that results of these two calculations may significantly differ and the discrepancy becomes especially large, when the transition surface is not smooth, which may be the case in event-by-event calculations.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The quark gluon plasma (QGP), which consists of deconfined quarks and gluons, is expected to have filled the early Universe, and is also produced experimentally through the relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in BNL and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. There has been much effort to extract detailed properties of the QGP by constraining transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and charge diffusion constants.\r\n\r\nWe here propose a new way of estimating the electric conductivity of the QGP via asymmetric nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultrarelativistic energies [1]. Theoretically, lattice QCD simulations and perturbative QCD calculations have been utilized to estimate electric conductivity of the QGP. So far, the estimated values of have differed significantly from each other and experimental information is very much awaited. Very recently, asymmetric collisions between copper and gold nuclei have been performed at RHIC. We point out that Cu+Au collisions can be useful for extracting the electric conductivity of the QGP. We show that, in off-central Cu+Au collisions, a substantial magnitude of electric field directed from a colliding Au nucleus to Cu nucleus is generated in the overlapping region, by performing event-by-event calculations of produced electromagnetic fields. This happens only when colliding two nuclei carry the different number of electric charge. The electric field would induce a current in the matter created after the collision, resulting in a dipole deformation of the charge distribution in the medium. We show that the charge-dependent directed flow parameters $v_1^{\\pm}$ of the observed hadrons are sensitive to the electric conductivity of the QGP.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] Yuji Hirono, Masaru Hongo, Tetsufumi Hirano, arXiv:1211.1114.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The balance function, which measures the correlations between opposite sign charge pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges. The study of the balance function can provide information about charge creation times as well as the subsequent collective behavior of particles.  We present charge balance functions in terms of relative pseudorapidity  ($\\Delta \\eta$) from Au+Au collisions at incident energies ranging from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV and compare these results with recent results for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV from the ALICE Collaboration [1]. We find that the charge balance function narrows as the collisions become more central and as the incident energy increases.  This behavior is consistent with the concept of delayed hadronization of a deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We also present balance functions in terms of relative rapidity ($\\Delta y$) for identified $\\pi^{+}/\\pi^{-}$ pairs, $K^{+}/K^{-}$ pairs, and $p/\\bar{p}$ pairs from central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  We compare to a model [2] that relates these balance functions to the correlations of deconfined up, down, and strange quarks in the QGP that is created in central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  We find our results are consistent with two waves of quark creation in time, one early in the collision ($\\sim 1$ fm/$c$) and a second occurring at hadronization ($\\sim 5-10$ fm/$c$).  We find that the densities of up, down, and strange quarks in the QGP extracted from the model comparison are consistent with current lattice gauge calculations.\r\n\r\n[1] ALICE Collaboration, Phys.

      "Abstract": "We propose a systematic approach for constraining models of initial conditions using a combined analysis of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ flow data with viscous hydrodynamic calculations. For $v_2$ and $v_3$ harmonics the hydrodynamic response to the initial state is dominated by linear response, which means $v_2$ is proportional to the ellipticity $\\varepsilon_2$ and $v_3$ is proportional to the triangularity $\\varepsilon_3$, i.e. $v_n = C_n\\varepsilon_n$, where $C_n$ is the linear response coefficient. Experimental data on elliptic and triangular flow, combined with the calculation of $C_n$ in relativistic hydrodynamics, provide us with rms values of initial anisotropies $\\varepsilon_2$ and $\\varepsilon_3$. By varying free parameters in hydrodynamic calculations, we get an allowed region in the (rms $\\varepsilon_2$, rms $\\varepsilon_3$) plane. Thus we are able to compare Monte Carlo models of the initial state with the allowed region and exclude several of these models. We provide a simple test that can be performed on any candidate model to determine its compatibility with data. We also illustrate that the effect of changing the granularity of the initial state is similar to changing the medium properties, making these effects difficult to disentangle using only these data.\r\n\r\n[Reference: E.

The basis of this phenomenological approach is to treat physics processes at different energy scales differently. The high-$Q^2$ processes associated with the QCD evolution of the jet from the hard production up to hadronization are treated perturbatively, following DGLAP evolution, to which we ascribe a space-time structure. The interactions of the shower partons with the deconfined matter leads to energy loss, which is dominated by soft processes and therefore, strong coupling effects are important. These interactions are modeled as inferred from studying energy loss of energetic probes via the gauge/gravity duality. We embed this hybrid model into  a model for the production and expansion of hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and confront it to high energy jet data at the LHC.

There are evidences for the creation of very strong and short-living magnetic fields in the early stages of noncentral heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Depending on the collision energies and impact parameters, they are estimated to be of order $eB\\sim 1.5 m_{\\pi}^{2}$ at RHIC and $eB\\sim 15 m_{\\pi}^{2}$ at LHC.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will focus on the effect of constant magnetic fields on the properties of neutral mesons in a hot and dense quark matter. In particular, we will explore the temperature (T) dependence of neutral pion masses as well as their refraction indices for various fixed magnetic fields (eB). Moreover, using the generalized PCAC relations for hot and magnetized pions, we will derive the low energy Goldberger-Treiman (GT) and Gell--Mann-Oakes-Renner (GOR) theorems for neutral pions at finite T and eB.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we will mainly use the energy dispersion relation of neutral pions, including nontrivial form factors. It will be derived from the effective action of a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in a derivative expansion up to second order.\r\n\r\nWe will show that the refraction index of neutral pions exhibits certain anisotropy in the transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the direction of the external magnetic field. Moreover, as it turns out, the transverse refraction indices are, in contrast to their longitudinal refraction indices, larger than unity.

The derivation adapts the finite temperature, many-body technology of the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism to scattering problems in perturbative QCD in T = 0 empty space.  Applications of our calculation include the creation of a hybrid early-time pQCD/late-time AdS/CFT energy loss model; novel predictions for particle production in high-energy QCD scattering; and new tests of the distribution of matter, energy, and momentum in jets in pp collisions and the redistribution of matter in jets in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Experimental data on inclusive charged particle spectra in p+A collisions are analyzed in the framework of z-scaling. The data on cross sections were taken by groups of G.Leksin at FNAL (Batavia), L.Zolin and V.Gapienko at IHEP (Protvino) with nuclear targets from beryllium up to tungsten. Spectra cover a special kinematics known as a cumulative region. Cumulative particles can be only produced in nuclear collisions. Their production is assumed to be sensitive to the state of the nuclear matter formed at the extreme conditions. Theory of z-scaling is developed for analysis of the cumulative processes and search for phase transition effects. The concept of z-scaling is based on principles of self-similarity, locality and fractality of constituent interactions at small scales. The momentum spectrum of the inclusive particle is recalculated to scaling function Ψ(z) which depends on self-similarly parameter z. A microscopic scenario of pA interactions in terms of momentum fractions x1, x2 is discussed. Results of the analysis are compared with the noncumulative data on high-pT hadron production in pA collisions obtained by J.Cronin, R.Sulyaev and D.Jaffe groups. Universality of the shape of function Ψ(z) is used to predict inclusive cross sections of particles produced in the deep-cumulative region.",

      "Abstract": "The quest for experimental signatures of small-x gluon saturation has been one of the major goals in p+A (d+A) programs at RHIC and LHC. Experimental measurements of single particle and two-particle correlations in the forward direction have revealed novel nuclear suppression patterns, which might help pinpoint the small-x gluon dynamics. At the moment there are two formalisms which can both describe reasonably well the nuclear suppression observed in these experiments. One is the so-called higher-twist factorization approach, which describes the parton multiple scattering in terms of the power corrections to the differential cross section [1,2].  The other one is the so-called small-x color glass condensate (CGC) approach [3]. So far the precise connection between these two approaches has not been established. In this talk, we demonstrate how the multiple parton scattering picture and the small-x gluon saturation picture are related and show how the transition from a dilute parton system to a dense gluon saturation region occurs.  Our work unifies the two approaches in studying the nonlinear small-x parton dynamics. On the example of forward rapidity photon production in p+A collisions, we demonstrate that in the broad transition region between a dilute parton system and a deeply saturated regime the two approaches give identical results. This work also helps understand the constraints on the small-x phenomenological studies. \r\n\r\n[1] J. Qiu and I. Vitev, Phys. Lett. B632, 507 (2006)\r\n[2] Z. B. Kang, I. Vitev and H. Xing, Phys.

In this talk we investigate the noncongruence of the deconfinement PT and compare it with the nuclear liquid-gas PT at subsaturation densities. The used equation of state is calculated from the chiral SU(3) model, which is one of the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons in arbitrary proportions (i.e., a “solution”) and gives a continuous transition from pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows the universality of the applied concept of noncongruence for the two PTs and illustrates the different typical scales involved. In addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid- gas and the deconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase coexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the pressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the noncongruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around the critical point.",

Because G2 QCD has also fermionic baryons, it is possible to search for hadronic Fermi surface effects, which are conjectured to be important for neutron stars. Also, G2 gauge theories have a trivial center, and it is therefore possible to asses the importance of the center structure to QCD.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the basic outline of these theories will be given, and it will be shown how similar they are to ordinary QCD.

Therefore, they are valuable probes to study \r\nthe mechanisms of energy loss and hadronisation in the hot and dense \r\nstate of matter, that is expected to be formed in the collision. In order \r\nto investigate these medium effects proton-proton (pp) and proton-nucleus (p-A) \r\ncollisions are measured as reference. While the first collision system \r\nallows one to test pQCD calculations and to establish the reference for Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions,\r\nthe latter gives access to cold nuclear matter effects, e. g. parton scattering \r\nin the initial state and modifications of the parton densities in the nucleus.\r\n\r\nHeavy-flavour production can be measured in hadronic and semi-leptonic \r\ndecay channels with ALICE at the LHC. However heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are \r\nrare probes, which makes differential and detailed studies difficult. \r\nAt mid-rapidity, the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) can be used to select events \r\nwith electrons at trigger level, to significantly enrich samples of electrons \r\noriginating from open heavy-flavour and quarkonia decays.

      "Abstract": "In recent years, the problem of thermalization in Heavy Ion Collision has received much attention, but has yet to be solved.\r\n\r\n The issue is the following: on one hand, viscous hydrodynamics simulations suggest that the matter produced in such collisions (called the Quark Gluon Plasma, or QGP) behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, and does so very shortly after the collision (around 1 fm/c). Since hydrodynamics has local thermal equilibrium in its prerequisites, this tends to show that the QGP has thermalized during the very early stages of the collision. On the other hand, theoretical models (based on microscopic theories like the Color Glass Condensate, or CGC) predict that the QGP is very far from local thermal equilibrium at the initial time (among other non-thermal features, its energy-momentum tensor is very anisotropic).\r\n\r\n One of the approaches developed to study this non-perturbative problem in QCD is a resummation scheme that amounts to averaging over classical fields, with random initial conditions given by a one loop calculation in the CGC framework.\r\n\r\nWe present here the results that we obtained by following this approach – the so-called classical statistical approximation or CSA, showing an early isotropization of the system compatible with viscous hydrodynamics. As a final remark, some recently found theoretical limitations of the CSA will be briefly mentioned.",

In April and May 2012, 7.3 billion Au(1.23 GeV per nucleon)+Au collisions have been recorded by HADES. In this contribution preliminary particle spectra of charged kaons will be presented. The results will be discussed with respect to the production mechanism.",

      "Abstract": "Short lived resonances are good probes to study the properties of strongly interacting matter produced in high energy heavy ion collisions. In particular, the resonance ${\\rm K^{\\ast 0}}$ is important because of its very short lifetime which is comparable to that of the fireball. The decay daughters are expected to undergo re-scattering and re-generation processes, which could modify the characteristic properties of ${\\rm K^{\\ast 0}}$ such as its mass, width and yield at low transverse momentum ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$). In addition, the yield of ${\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}$ at high ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) may be suppressed in Pb-Pb relative to pp collisions due to the effect of the hot and dense medium formation. We report the measurement of the ${\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}$ resonance in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV via its hadronic decay channel $({\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}) (\\overline{\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}) \\rightarrow {\\rm K}^{\\pm}({\\rm K}^{-}\\pi^{+}) )$ with the ALICE detector. The centrality dependence of the mass, width, and yield of ${\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}$ in Pb-Pb collisions is compared to pp results to investigate the role of re-scattering and re-generation. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm CP}$ and $R_{\\rm AA}$) will be presented to study the effect of parton energy loss on ${\\rm K}^{\\ast 0}$ production and compared with other hadrons to understand the effect of baryon-meson separation.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectrum and its anisotropy coefficients, $v_n$, are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1,2]. In this talk, we will present state-of-the-art calculations of event-by-event photon emission from nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies including both shear and bulk viscous corrections. Momentum spectra of thermal photons and their $p_T$-differential anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ ($n$ up to 5) are computed, both with and without accounting for viscous corrections to the standard thermal emission rates. Viscous corrections to the rates are found to have a larger effect on the $v_n$ coefficients than the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic flow anisotropies. Effects from non-zero initial flow and viscous pressure tensor to photon spectra and their anisotropies are also investigated by evolving fluctuating initial density profiles with free-streaming on the event-by-event basis before matching to hydrodynamics. Complementary to the majority of hadronic observables, thermal photons provide us with additional constraints on the evolution of the viscous pressure tensor as well as the early dynamics of heavy-ion collisions. Their anisotropic flows, especially higher order $v_n$, can be used as a sensitive viscometer for the quark-gluon plasma.\r\n\r\n[1] C. Shen, U. Heinz, J.-F. Paquet and C.

In this work two-pion interferometry measurements in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV are performed  to extract and compare the Gaussian source radii Rout, Rside and Rlong, which characterize the space-time extent of the emission sources. The comparisons which  are carried out  as a function of collision centrality and the mean transverse momentum for pion pairs, indicate strikingly similar patterns for the d+Au and Au+Au systems. They also indicate  linear dependence of Rside on the initial traverse geometric size, as well\r\nas a smaller freeze-out size for the d+Au system. These patterns point to\r\nthe important role of final-state re-scattering effects in the reaction\r\ndynamics of d+Au collisions.",

Multi-strange baryons were reconstructed via the detection of their weak decay products, which were identified through their measured energy loss and momenta in the ALICE Time Projection Chamber. For p-Pb and Pb-Pb, the $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$ spectra were analysed as a function of charged particle multiplicities, which range over several orders of magnitude. In the p-Pb system in particular, it is possible to investigate a multiplicity region in which relative strangeness production changes significantly, as seen when comparing peripheral Pb-Pb to pp collisions. In order to investigate the phenomenon of strangeness enhancement, we study how the singly-strange and multi-strange baryon production relative to non-strange particles evolves with multiplicity.

      "Abstract": "One of the major goals of the heavy-ion experiments is to study the properties of hot and dense matter\r\ncreated in the collision of two heavy\r\nnuclei. Elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $\\phi$ meson in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV has provided a clear evidence for partonic collectivity[1]. This was possible because of the small hadronic interaction cross section and early freeze-out for $\\phi$ mesons[2].  On the other hand hadrons like protons (with similar mass as $\\phi$ meson) have significantly large hadronic interaction cross section and freeze-out late. Therefore, comparison between $v_{2}$ of $\\phi$ meson and proton \r\nwill be useful to understand the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense media created in such collisions.\r\n\r\nIn order to study the QCD phase structure, RHIC has conducted the beam energy scan program since 2010. In this talk, we report the measurement of $p_{T}$ integrated $v_{2}$ of $\\phi$\r\nmesons as a function of center of mass energy from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV\r\nto demonstrate the decrease in partonic contribution to collectivity\r\nwith the decrease in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We compare the $\\phi$-meson\r\n$v_{2}$  to the corresponding values for protons. At high collision\r\nenergies, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $>$ 27 GeV for example, we observe similar\r\nvalues for the  integrated $v_{2}$ for both protons and $\\phi$ meson. At lower energies, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$  $<$ 19.6 GeV, however, $\\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ become much smaller, indicating that hadronic interactions become dominant in the energy region.\r\n Further we compare to\r\ntransport model calculations with and without partonic interactions to emphasize our\r\nconclusions.  In addition, the effect of hadronic re-scattering on $v_{2}(p_{T})$ will be shown by\r\ncomparing  $v_{2}(p_{T})$ of $\\phi$ and proton. The study of re-scattering\r\neffect on $v_{2}$ will be further corroborated by  using various\r\nmodels like those based on Hydro+Cascade and Transport approach.\r\n\r\nReferences \r\n\r\n[1] B. I.

Here we present simulations of Bottomonium real-time evolution [1] in an idealized, i.e. static, QGP at high temperature, based on the open-quantum systems concept of stochastic potential [2]. \r\n\r\nIf a heavy Quarkonium bound state is submerged in the QGP, it is subject to screening and scattering from the surrounding light partons. Effective field theory tells us that under such circumstances its correlation function obeys a Schrödinger equation with a complex potential V(r).\r\n\r\nWe interpret the resulting loss of correlations with the initial state, i.e. the presence of Im[V], as decoherence, which is induced by the thermal fluctuations of the medium. To incorporate this phenomenon into the non-relativistic description, we use a purely real potential, whose values are stochastically varied at each time step by purely real noise.  It is the spatial noise correlations that are then intimately related to Im[V].\r\n\r\nBased on this setup, we discuss the intricate interplay between state mixing and thermal (de-)excitations, which governs the real-time evolution of Bottomonium vacuum initial states, as they propagate in the QGP.\r\n\r\n[1] A.R. arXiv:1312.3246 submitted to JHEP<br>\r\n[2] Y.Akamatsu and A.R.

Due to their large mass and the temperature scale of the collision,\r\nit was anticipated that the charm and bottom quarks would interact weakly with the produced medium. It therefore came as a surprise when experimental results for D mesons indicated \r\ncharm quarks with small $R_{AA}$ and large elliptic flow $v_n$. This suggests that heavy-flavour probes are sensitive to the collective dynamics of the QGP medium which are now \r\nwell described by viscous hydrodynamics.\r\n\r\nWhat is, however, not so well understood is the value of the coupling of the heavy quarks to the QGP medium. In this study, we couple the evolution of open charm quarks to \r\nviscous hydrodynamics using a linearized Boltzmann equation [1] with pQCD based matrix elements for the heavy-quarks interacting with the QGP medium.\r\n\r\nWe compare the elastic energy loss transport coefficients $\\hat{e}$ and $\\hat{q}$ in this scheme for an infinite medium at finite temperature against those extracted using a Langevin equation \r\nwhich describes the kinematics of the Boltzmann equation in the limit of small momentum transfer.

      "Abstract": "The intention of this study is the search for signatures of the chiral phase transition and the impact of non-equilibrium effects. \r\nTo investiage the impact of fluctuations, e.g. on the baryon density, near the chritical point or the chiral phase transition of QCD, we developed a 3+1D numerical, non-equilibrium simulation of an effective linear sigma model. Chiral fields are approximated as classical fields, quarks are described by quasi-particles via a Vlasov equation. For additional dynamics, kinetic quark-quark and chemical quark-sigma interactions have been implemented. The challenge is the consistent description of hard interactions between particles and classical fields. Therefore a new Monte-Carlo-Langevin-like formalism has been developed and is discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will be a dedicated heavy-ion experiment at the future FAIR facility. In order to identify electrons, a RICH detector and several layers of TRDs will be employed. The RICH detector will be operated with CO2 as a radiator gas, a spherical glass mirror plane, and MAPMTs as photon detectors.  The mirror system consists of about 70 square mirror tiles of an area of about 40x40 cm2 each. To verify the developed RICH concept a laterally scaled prototype has been constructed, in which all modules of the main components have approximately the same dimensions and properties as foreseen for the full detector. The mirror system of the prototype consists of four tiles, which enables studies of mirror-boarder effects on Cherenkov rings and their reconstruction and fit quality. The prototype has been implemented in the CBM software framework with realistic properties of the detector components. Its performance has been simulated and measured during beam times at the CERN-PS facility with electron-pion beams of momenta between 2 and 10 GeV/c.\r\n\r\nBesides many important aspects that guaranty successful operation of the detector, the determination of upper limits of gas impurity and mirror displacements have systematically been simulated and measured. The results will be presented in this contribution.",

The larger fireball should be characterized by a long time over which it collectively evolves from its non-trivial initial shape to its final one. The final-state anisotropy of zero-spectator collisions in *momentum* space ($v_n$) is under active study.

      "Abstract": "Accurate theoretical predictions of jet suppression are necessary for studying the properties of QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. However, testing the prediction accuracy - and extracting useful qualitative knowledge - is often limited by constraining the predictions to only few experimental probes at a time, and by using free parameters. To address this issue, we will present comprehensive suppression predictions, which run across all available probes and different centrality regions at RHIC and LHC. To generate these predictions, we use the finite size dynamical QCD formalism that we previously developed, together with its recent extensions to finite magnetic mass [1] and running coupling [2]; this formalism is integrated into a numerical procedure that uses no free parameters in model testing. We obtain a very good agreement with the experimental results across all particle species [2,3], for different centrality regions [4], and for both RHIC and LHC. We will also discuss improved qualitative understanding of the relevant experimental data, which follows from such comprehensive comparison.\r\n\r\n 1. M. Djordjevic and M.

      "Abstract": "Theoretical studies [1] indicate that in relativistic heavy collisions a chiral magnetic wave at finite baryon density could induce an electric quadrupole moment, which will lead to a difference in elliptic flow of hadrons with opposite charge. The magnitude of this difference is predicted to be proportional to the charge asymmetry $A_\\mathrm{ch}$, defined as $A_\\mathrm{ch} \\equiv \\langle \\left (N_{+} -N_{-} \\right )/\\left ( N_{+} +N_{-}  \\right ) \\rangle$. Charge-asymmetry dependency of the pion elliptic flow has been observed in Au+Au collisions at the STAR experiment. On the other hand, it is argued that the local charge conservation at freeze-out, together with the characteristic shape of $v_{2}(\\eta)$ and $v_{2}(p_\\mathrm{T})$, may also contribute to elliptic flow splitting as a function of $A_\\mathrm{ch}$. This can be manifested by implementing the corresponding measurement for higher flow harmonics $v_{3}$ [2].\r\n\r\nHere, we present STAR's measurements of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for charged pions and kaons at low transverse momentum range (0.15 $< p_\\mathrm{T} <$ 0.5 GeV/c), as a function of event charge asymmetry ($A_\\mathrm{ch}$) in both U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 193 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

Golubeva, 2013), BNL 2012 RHIC&AGS Annual Users’ Meeting ”eRHIC – understanding the initial condition of the heavy ion”. \r\nIn the present work investigation of initial conditions for interactions of light – (C, O, Ne), medium - (Si, S) and heavy – (Au, Pb) nuclei with heavy – (Ag/Br) and light – (C/N/O) nuclei have been analyzed on the data of JINR-AGS-SPS target emulsion experiments with limited statistics. The analysis example for interaction Si (14.7) and S (200) A GeV with (C/N/O) nuclei is presented on fig. Detection of both shower particles and fast fragment-spectators with identical possibilities in this method open the way to the useful study of this problem. The analysis has shown, that nonlinearity in the multiple and fragmentation processes to become stronger with the impact parameter increasing.  Physical explanation of the fluctuation growing consists in new effect creation – nonregularity in the production of heavy fragment-spectators with intermittent mass distribution (Fig c, d, top). Fluctuations in this case correspond to the Levy flights, but not small Gaussian variations in a data series around the mean. Integrally the patterns of heavy and light fragmentation are totally different. In the proton fragmentation mass distributions have the most smoothly – Gaussian-like – behavior both in central and peripheral interactions (Fig d, c, d, below). New process, - the strong intermittent behavior in the heavy mass fragment distributions with high probability occur in colliding of light nuclei. \r\nConclusions can be useful in the understanding processes of heavy ion physics and new experiments designing.",

Indeed, due to their large mass, charm and beauty quarks are produced in initial hard scattering processes among partons of the colliding nuclei, before the formation of the QGP, and they traverse the medium and interact with its constituents.\r\nThe ALICE Collaboration measured the production of open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV respectively.\r\nA strong suppression of the open charm hadron yields at high $p_{\\rm T}$ was observed in Pb-Pb collisions relative to pp interactions: this effect is attributed to a substantial in-medium energy loss of the charm quarks.\r\nFurther insight into the effects of the medium on charm and beauty quarks can be obtained by measuring the angular correlations between open heavy-flavour hadrons and charged hadrons.\r\nThe comparison of the correlation function in pp and Pb-Pb collisions can provide deeper information on the way heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and can spot possible modifications to the charm parton shower and hadronisation in the presence of the medium. Furthermore, by studying the correlations of electrons from heavy-flavour decays and the charged hadrons in pp, it is possible to statistically separate the charm and beauty contributions to the yield of heavy-flavour decay electrons, making this analysis an excellent tool to test pQCD calculations.\r\nThe observation of double-ridge long range correlations in p-Pb collisions for light-flavour hadrons could originate from a collective behaviour of the system, as well as from gluon saturation in the initial state (color glass condensate). The same effect can be studied for heavier quarks via the correlation between heavy-flavour hadrons (or their decay electrons) and charged particles.\r\nResults from the correlation analyses, performed using the data collected with ALICE in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, Pb-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented in this contribution.",

Additionally, low-mass dielectrons are produced by internal conversion of virtual direct photons that are emitted during the evolution of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. They are excellent direct probes to study all collision stages, since they pass through the hot and dense medium almost unscathed. \r\nIn particular, the extraction of virtual photons in the low-mass region provides a complementary measurement of the real photon yield, which gives access to the temperature of the created matter and can be compared to results from other approaches and existing theoretical calculations. \r\n\r\nIn the ALICE apparatus at the LHC, electrons at mid-rapidity are identified by their specific energy loss in the Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), combined with time-of-flight information from the TOF detector. \r\nWe will present the electron identification performance of these detector systems and the measurement of the low-mass dielectron continuum in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. \r\nThe invariant mass distribution of dielectrons, in slices of pair transverse momentum, will be compared to that of a cocktail of the expected hadronic contributions, with the aim of extracting the virtual direct photon yield.",

      "Abstract": "The primary role of the ALICE experiment at the LHC is to investigate the properties of the deconfined state of matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), created in  relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Electron-positron pairs (dielectrons) are excellent probes for studying the properties of the medium. They are produced during the entire evolution of the system and carry the information of the medium since they are not affected by the strong interaction. Correlated electron-positron pairs from semi-leptonic decays of heavy quarks are the dominant source of dielectrons in the intermediate and high mass region above 1 GeV/$c^2$. Heavy quarks are mainly produced in the initial hard scatterings and are sensitive to the transport properties of the medium.\r\nA correct understanding of heavy-ion results requires, in addition,\r\nan evaluation of initial state nuclear effects, through the study of \r\np-Pb collisions.\r\nIn the ALICE experiment, the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is used for the electron identification above $p > 1$ GeV/$c$ momentum. The TRD also provides an electron trigger to enrich the data samples for the study of charmonium and open heavy flavor production. \r\nIn 2012, ALICE has successfully collected p-Pb collisions with TRD trigger ($L_{\\rm int}$ = 1.4 nb$^{-1}$) , allowing us to extend the invariant mass spectrum of dielectrons to higher pair $p_{\\rm T}$ and mass. \r\nIn this poster, the current status of the dielectron analysis with the TRD triggered data in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented.",

Furthermore, we improve the treatment of momentum degradation. Since we aim to confront the $p_T$ spectra at mid-rapidity of all observed hadrons, $\\pi$, K, p, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$, the system is highly contained. There are thousands of soft hadrons and hard jets produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. Minijets can fragment into soft patrons with multiplicities so high that their effects on the patrons created in the soft interaction of the bulk can't be ignored. So the primary feature of our work is to quantify the effect of hard and semihard jets on the soft sector. What we find is that the soft patrons generated by the hard patrons are so overwhelming at LHC, compared to the situation at RHIC.

Recent calculations in effective models and in\r\nQCD using Dyson Schwinger equation suggest that the transition in QCD\r\nremains a crossover up to baryon chemical potentials of about 800MeV [1]. \r\nIf so, the equation of state relevant for hydrodynamic models can be\r\ncalculated on the lattice using Taylor expansion. However, except for\r\nthe coefficients of the lowest order, there are large cutoff effects\r\nin present lattice calculations for non-zero chemical potentials.\r\n\r\nTo extend our previous parametrization of the equation of state [2] to\r\nfinite baryon density, we employ the continuum extrapolated lattice\r\nQCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients in order two [3], and\r\ncomplement them with coefficients in order four and six evaluated\r\nusing p4 action [4]. To avoid large cutoff efects these coefficients\r\nare smoothly matched to those of hadron resonance gas at low\r\ntemperature. Some preliminary results were reported in [5].

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "Motivated by the observation that non-central heavy-ion collisions in RHIC and LHC are accompanied by extremely strong magnetic fields, much attention has been paid to the QCD dynamics in strong electromagnetic fields. In particular, the change of vacuum properties such as quark condensates has been investigated in terms of both effective models and lattice simulations. While both of these approaches predict, at zero temperature, an enhancement of quark condensates in the presence of magnetic fields (called \"magnetic catalysis\"), their results do not coincide with each other at finite temperatures. Namely, at finite temperatures, lattice QCD simulations at physical point predict \"inverse\" magnetic catalysis which is never reproduced by effective models. In order to bridge the gap between effective models and lattice QCD, an analytic study of QCD in the presence of strong magnetic fields should be necessary.\r\n\r\nAs a first step towards understanding the effects of magnetic fields on QCD vacuum properties, we analytically investigate the QCD effective potential within one loops of gluon and quark including all order interactions with chromo-electromagnetic fields and $U(1)_{em}$ electromagnetic fields at zero and finite temperatures. First, we will show the results of QCD effective potential with strong magnetic fields at zero temperature [1]. The resulting effective potential is renormalization-group invariant. We found that the chromo-magnetic field prefers to be parallel to the external magnetic field, and thus the QCD vacuum with strong magnetic fields is spatially anisotropic. This result is consistent with recent lattice data [2,3]. Furthermore, the chromo-magnetic condensate increases with an increasing magnetic field, which supports the \"gluonic magnetic catalysis\" as observed in current lattice data [2]. \r\n\r\nNext, we will discuss the effective potential with strong electromagnetic fields at finite temperatures [4]. In particular, we focus on the influence of electromagnetic fields on the center symmetry in QCD. The pure Yang-Mills theory has the center symmetry (being spontaneously broken at high temperature), but dynamical quarks explicitly break it. We will show how the electric and magnetic fields affect the explicit symmetry breaking, by using the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. We will also discuss a relation between the property of the Polyakov loop in the presence of magnetic fields and the inverse magnetic catalysis, whose importance is pointed out from the recent lattice study [5].\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] S.

The properties of these fields can be calculated numerically using the CGC description of the small x degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei. The spatial Wilson loop provides a gauge invariant observable to probe the dynamics of the longitudinal chromomagnetic field. This talk describes the results from a recent real time lattice calculation (arXiv:1401.4124) of the area-dependence of the expectation value of the spatial Wilson loop.\r\n\r\nWe consider ensembles of gauge field configurations generated from the MV-model classical Gaussian effective action as well as solutions of the JIMWLK high-energy renormalization group equation with fixed and running coupling. The initial fields exhibit domain-like structure over distance scales of the order of the saturation scale. At later times universal scaling emerges at large distances for all ensembles, with a nontrivial critical exponent. A similar behavior has earlier been seen in calculations of the gluon transverse momentum spectrum, which becomes independent of the initial spectrum of gauge fields (i.e. the initial unintegrated gluon distribution) for momenta less than the saturation scale. Finally, we compare the results for the Wilson loop to the two-point correlator of magnetic fields.",

The number of reconstructed photons shows that there was no caesium iodide quantum efficiency loss (ageing), which is consistent with the measured integrated charge dose of $0.0133$ mCcm$^{-2}$. A Monte Carlo procedure is ongoing to extract the quantum efficiencies, from the first results we found that no significant difference between the extracted quantum efficiencies and the measured ones at the production time of the photo-cathodes (2003).\r\n\r\nThe performance of statistical and track-by-track particle identification have also been investigated.

      "Abstract": "Anomaly-induced transport effects, like the chiral magnetic effect or the chiral separation effect, have recently attracted much attention. These effects represent the existence of dissipationless vector and axial currents along the magnetic field and are expected to occur in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It has been pointed out that the coupling between the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral separation effect provokes a novel type of gapless collective excitation in the plasma, called chiral magnetic wave (CMW). \r\n\r\nThe experimental search for anomaly-induced transports in heavy-ion collisions is now ongoing. Since the CMW leads to an electric charge quadrupole deformation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions, the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ would be charge-dependent, which can be considered as a signal of anomalous transports [1]. The STAR Collaboration observed such a charge dependent elliptic flow for pions $\\Delta v_2 (\\pi^\\pm)$ [2]. This result seems to be consistent with the prediction from a simple model [1], in which propagation of non-interacting waves under spatially and temporally uniform temperature and homogeneous magnetic field is considered. However, since the QGP created in heavy-ion collisions is drastically expanding, it is necessary to describe the space-time evolution of the QGP together with that of electromagnetic fields in order to assess the contribution from anomalous transports.\r\n\r\nIn this study, we numerically solve anomalous hydrodynamic equations and apply it to the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions [3]. We develop a numerical code which is applicable to the description of the QGP under arbitrary external electromagnetic fields. We describe the propagation of the CMW in the expanding QGP under spatially and temporally inhomogeneous external electromagnetic fields. We analyze the charge-dependent elliptic flow $v_2^\\pm$ and discuss possible implications for experimental observations of anomalous transport effects.\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n[1] Y.

The dilepton emission rate is found to be enhanced in comparison to the earlier result of only temperature dependent value of quark mass and in comparison to  other theoretical calculations. The study finds that the emission rate of dilepton through  the chemical potential is increasing function depending on increasing value of chemical potential ranging\r\nfrom $\\mu = 100 -450~$ MeV.

      "Speaker": "Sener Ozonder",
      "Institute": "Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington",

      "Abstract": "The azimuthal angular correlations (\"ridge\") were well-known from the A+A collisions where the collimation of the hadrons in the azimuthal angle was ascribed to the collective flow of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The di-hadron correlations in the high multiplicity p+p and p+Pb collision events from the CMS experiment revealed a ridge structure that was very much like the ones from the A+A collisions. These results, which were not predicted by Monte Carlo based QCD simulations, attracted great interest since the formation of QGP and consequently a collective flow were not anticipated in p+p and p+Pb collisions. \r\n\r\nSoon after the report of the CMS collaboration, it was shown that this ridge can be explained by the multiladder QCD diagrams (\"glasma diagrams\") that were enhanced at the saturation scale at small-x. By means of these diagrams, the two particle gluon production rate can be written in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGD) of the colliding hadrons (or hadron and nucleus). Then, the UGD that is extracted from the running coupling BK equation (rcBK) is substituted in this formula. Later these correlated two gluons can be related to the observed di-hadrons via fragmentation functions. The strength of azimuthal correlations depends on the momenta and relative azimuthal angle of the di-hadrons as well as the saturation scale. It should be emphasized that this framework does not demand any collective flow to explain the data. Despite the excellent agreement between the data and the results of the glasma diagrams, however, the analyses employing the collective flow and the application of hydrodynamics to p+p and p+Pb collisions are also successful. Hence, this puzzle demands a study of tri-hadron correlations that may possibly settle the origin of the ridge in p+p and p+Pb events. Tri-hadron correlations will also put the Color Glass Condensate and saturation physics to more stringent test. \r\n\r\nWe calculate tri-hadron correlations from the glasma diagrams by using the rcBK UGDs for p+p ($\\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV) and p+Pb ($\\sqrt{s}=$5.02 TeV) collisions for several values of the momenta and relative azimuthal angle of the trigger and two associated hadrons. We repeat these calculations for different values of the saturation scale to predict the systematics of the track multiplicity of the actual measurements. Our tri-hadron azimuthal correlation results show that the glasma diagrams give rise to structures similar to the conical emission or Mach cone that have been discussed previously in the context of A+A collisions. However, we see these structures not only on the away side but also on the near side as distinguished from the Mach cone in A+A collisions which occur only on the away side. The azimuthal correlations due to the multiladder gluon production (glasma) are also clearly distinguished from the correlation structures that might be caused by other medium effects such as energy loss and jet deflection. We make quantitative predictions for the high multiplicity tri-hadron azimuthal correlations for p+p and p+Pb collisions at LHC. These tri-hadron correlations have not been measured yet by the experimental collaborations.",

      "Speaker": "Yasuki Tachibana",
      "Institute": "The University of Tokyo",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We develop a fully (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model with source terms to analyze large angle emission of low-$p_{T}$ particles in asymmetric di-jet events. In Pb-Pb collision experiments at LHC, a large number of low-$p_{T}$ hadrons at large angles from a sub-leading jet is observed in asymmetric di-jet  events by the CMS Collaboration [1]. The total transverse momentum of the leading-jet balances that of the sub-leading jet together with the low-$p_{T}$ particles spread over wide angles from sub-leading jet axis.Motivated by the experimental fact, we analyze asymmetric di-jet events to understand the transport dynamics of the transverse momentum balance in the three-dimensionally expanding QGP. \r\n\r\n The space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) realized experimentally in heavy ion collisions at collider energies is well described by relativistic\r\nhydrodynamics. High energy partons are also produced through initial hard scatterings and have to traverse the QGP fluid. The energy and momentum of these traversing partons are lost in the medium through strong interaction between them. Thus jet quenching phenomena provide an important clue to extract one of the substantial properties of the QGP, namely stopping power against energetic partons. The question then arises, ``Where and how do these lost energies and momenta diffuse inside the medium?\" Suppose deposited energy and momentum are quickly equilibrated, the traversing jet particles induce the collective flow in the QGP fluid. On the other hand, the background QGP fluid is by no means static, but expands itself at relativistic velocity. As a consequence, the collective flow results from the interplay of expansion of background QGP fluid and wake induced by jets.\r\n\r\n This is the first attempt to numerically solve relativistic hydrodynamic equations with source terms without linearization in fully (3 + 1)-dimensional  Milne coordinates. In the hydrodynamical equations, the source terms are introduced to account for the energy-momentum deposition from the energetic partons. It is shown that Mach cone-like structures are formed in the medium and distorted strongly by radial flow of the expanding background QGP fluid. As a result, we find that the low-$p_{T}$ enhancement at large angles from the quenched jet compensates exactly the di-jet $p_{T}$-imbalance, similar to that observed by the CMS. Therefore these low-$p_{T}$ particles spread over wide angle are originated from deposited energy and momentum transported by the collective expansion of the QGP. \r\n\r\n[1] S.

One of the key diagnostic probes of strongly-interacting matter at extreme conditions are dileptons. Dilepton measurements performed so far in heavy-ion collisions at various energies have found that the major challenge is to subtract the combinatorial background which overwhelms the interesting signals such as the rho spectral distribution, direct radiation from the fireball at intermediate invariant masses, and charmonia.  This background is of different physical origin for dielectron and dimuons, and differs as function of invariant mass. Therefore, the systematic and statistical errors of the extracted signals will be substantially minimized by measuring both electron and muon pairs. The CBM detector is designed as a multi-purpose device which will be able to measure hadrons, electrons and muons in heavy-ion collisions.  Electrons will be measured using a Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector in combination with a Transition Radiation Detector.  For muon measurements, the RICH detector will be replaced by a large area Muon detection system consisting of alternating layers of hadron absorbers and tracking chambers.

      "Abstract": "$J/\\psi$ suppression in heavy-ion collisions due to color screening of quark and antiquark potential in the deconfined medium has been proposed as a signature of the QGP formation. Other mechanisms, such as the cold nuclear matter effect and charm quark recombination, are likely to contribute to the observed modification of $J/\\psi$ production in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements of $J/\\psi$ invariant yields in different collision energies, collision systems, and centralities can shed new light on the interplay of these mechanisms for $J/\\psi$ production and medium properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we report on new measurements of $J/\\psi$ production at midrapidity ($|y|  < 1.0$) from the Beam Energy Scan program (Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 39 GeV and 62.4 GeV) and U$+$U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV at STAR. Centrality and transverse momentum dependence of $J/\\psi$ invariant yields and the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) will be presented and compared to those for Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and to model calculations. The energy dependence of $J/\\psi$ suppression will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "A strongly interacting medium, namely Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP), is formed in high energy heavy ion collisions at RHIC. Elliptic flow $(v_{2})$, the second order Fourier coefficient of azimuthal distribution of the produced particles with respect to reaction plane, is used to investigate the properties of QGP. Light nuclei ($d$, $\\bar{d}$, $t$, $^{\\small{3}}He$), produced in such collisions, are believed to be formed by coalescence of nucleons. By comparing $v_{2}$ of light nuclei with their constituents, we can understand the production mechanism of  nuclei in heavy ion collisions. At top RHIC energies, identified hadron $v_{2}$ revealed many features like the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling and mass ordering. With the combined statistics, we can test the scaling behaviors for rare multi-strange particles ($\\phi$, $\\Xi $ and $\\Omega$). An energy dependent difference in $v_{2}$ ($\\Delta v_{2}$) between particles and anti-particles was also observed in beam energy scan data at STAR. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we show the $p_{T}$ and centrality dependence of $v_{2}$ of light nuclei ($d$, $\\bar{d}$, $t$, $^{3}He$), and identified hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $K_{s}^{0}$, $p$, $\\bar{p}$, $\\phi$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi^{\\pm}$, $\\Omega^{\\pm}$) at mid-rapidity for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ =\\ 7.7,\\ 11.5,\\ 19.6,\\ 27,\\ 39,\\ 62.4$ and $200$ GeV from STAR. Light nuclei and hadrons are identified using the time projection chamber and time-of-flight detector systems of STAR. The mass number and constituent quark scaling of nuclei $v_{2}$ will be presented. Light nuclei $v_{2}$ will be compared to those from $p$($\\bar{p}$) and to a coalescence model calculation using the phase space distributions of produced nucleons in a transport model. The centrality dependence of $\\Delta v_{2}$ for identified hadron will be shown and compared to model calculations.\r\nWe further discuss NCQ scaling and mass ordering of multi-strange hadron $v_{2}$ at the top energy Au+Au collisions at RHIC.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions at relativistic\r\nenergies, which are accessible at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\r\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are often\r\nreferred to as little bangs. \r\nExperiments at these energies probe the conditions which \r\nprevail at freeze-out, and often it is not possible to \r\ndefine the correct equation-of-state (EoS) and the conditions \r\nat the initial stages of the collision.\r\nBy employing hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball [1] created in the\r\ncollisions, we have\r\ngenerated maps of the energy density ($\\epsilon$) and temperature\r\n($T$) of the system \r\nthroughout its evolution. With the help of the maps, we obtain \r\ntime evolution of the fluctuations in  $\\epsilon$ and $T$.\r\nWe have shown for the first time that\r\nthe method of interpolation of fluctuations obtained from the maps\r\ncan provide a powerful technique in looking back at the initial stages of\r\nthe heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn case of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), \r\ntemperature maps of the sky [2],\r\nmade by scanning in $\\theta$-$\\phi$ bins, provide vital information\r\nregarding the age and composition of the Universe, galaxy formation, \r\nexpansion rate, etc. This is possible by analyzing the map to\r\nextract temperature fluctuations and making power spectrum. \r\n\r\nFor heavy-ion collisions, we \r\npropose to make temperature maps in \r\nrapidity and azimuthal angle ($y$-$\\phi$).

One of the many probes at its disposal is the production of heavy quarks, namely charm and beauty, since due to their large masses they are produced in the earliest stages of the collision and experience the full evolution of the system. As well as studying the production of leptons from heavy-flavour decays, ALICE's excellent tracking and vertexing capabilities also allow us to fully reconstruct the hadronic decays of the open-charmed D mesons.\r\n\r\nIn order to disentangle experimental outcomes arising in the hot and dense medium from those occurring due to cold nuclear matter effects, it is also necessary to make measurements in p-Pb collisions.  One measurement that can be made in this system is the yield of certain particle species as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collisions. Such measurements allow us to investigate the role of multi-parton interactions in proton-nucleus collisions at LHC energies, in particular when compared to similar results in pp collisions.\r\n\r\nPrevious ALICE studies in the charm sector have already found that the production of J/$\\psi$ mesons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV exhibits an increasing yield per event with increasing multiplicity. Similar measurements have also been made for D-meson production in pp collisions.

      "Abstract": "Transverse energy is an important characteristic of relativistic heavy ion collisions aiming at creating conditions similar to those existed in the early Universe. The hot and dense matter produced immediately after the collision of a nucleus going in the longitudinal direction and the other in the opposite direction can be considered as being composed of transverse fluid slices undergoing longitudinal expansion following the two receding nuclei. In the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame, a slice that is closer to a nucleus has a bigger longitudinal speed. Transverse energy is longitudinally boost invariant and therefore directly reflects the condition of the local rest frame (slice) irrespective of its longitudinal flow speed. It is sensitive to the longitudinal work between adjacent slices and thus carries information about the evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in heavy ion collisions. We show that the work distribution of an expanding extreme relativistic gas is a gamma distribution with a different shape parameter as compared with its non-relativistic counterpart. This implies that the shape of the transverse energy distribution in\r\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions depends on the particle contents during the evolution of the hot and dense matter. Therefore, transverse energy fluctuations provide additional insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in these collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a high-density state of strongly-interacting matter in which partons are deconfined.  This state of matter can be studied experimentally via heavy-ion collisions where the critical temperature and density for the phase transition to the QGP can be attained. Measurements of heavy-flavour (charm and beauty) production in these collisions are of particular interest. Heavy quarks are indeed produced in the early stages of the collision and experience therefore the whole evolution of the system. The ALICE collaboration has measured electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at mid-rapidity. A strong suppression of the yield of heavy-flavour decay electrons at high $p_{\\rm T}$ is observed in $0-10\\%$ most central collisions. Measurements of heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions are crucial to understand cold nuclear matter effects on the production in heavy-ion collisions. The production of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays has been measured with ALICE in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Electrons have been identified with the Time Projection Chamber and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). In addition, the EMCal provided a trigger during the p-Pb run of the LHC.   The trigger enhances the recorded sample of rare probes, such as high $p_{\\rm{T}}$ photons and electrons. The trigger will allow us to extend the $p_{\\rm{T}}$ reach for heavy-flavour decay electron measurements. We will show results from the heavy-flavour decay electron measurement using the EMCal.",

CMS has an extensive program studying azimuthal harmonic coefficients for both PbPb and pPb collisions using various methods. The current pPb results will be presented in this context. The data were collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC using both minimum bias and high-multiplicity collision triggers over a wide range in pseudorapidity. The results are compared to 2.76 TeV semi-peripheral PbPb collision data collected in 2011 covering a similar range of particle multiplicities. The second-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonic ($v_{2}$) is shown for the different methods. A comparison of the six- and greater particle correlations to the previously published two- and four-particle correlation results sheds light on the multiparticle nature of the azimuthal anisotropy. The results are also discussed in terms of recent calculations that explore the role of participant fluctuations on measurements of higher-order particle correlations in pPb collisions.",

The data were collected during the 2013 LHC pPb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment, with a wide eta coverage of -2.4<$\\eta$<2.4. The near-side $\\Delta$$\\eta$ correlations are decomposed into short-range (jet) and long-range components. The away-side long-range correlations in central collisions are also studied by subtracting back-to-back jet contributions, modeled by the away-side correlations from peripheral collisions after accounting for the biases introduced by the multiplicity classification. The long-range correlations are found to be dependent on pseudorapidity. The observed pseudo-rapidity dependence may potentially discriminate theoretical models for long-range two-particle correlations observed in pPb collisions.",

The inherent hierarchy of scales governing the jet evolution allows to distinguish a leading jet structure, which interacts coherently with the medium as a single color charge, from softer sub-structures that will be sensitive to effects of color decoherence. We argue how this separation comes about and show that this picture is consistent with experimental data on reconstructed jets at the LHC, providing a quantitative description simultaneously of the jet nuclear modification factor, the missing energy in di-jet events and the modification of the fragmentation functions. In particular, we demonstrate that effects due to color decoherence are manifest in the excess of soft particles measured in fragmentation functions in Pb-Pb compared to proton-proton collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Observation of a long-range near-side two-particle correlation (known as the \"Ridge\") in high-multiplicity pp and pPb collisions opened up new opportunities of exploring novel QCD dynamics in small collision systems. To further investigate the origin of this phenomenon, new measurements of two-particle correlations with identified $\\pi^0$, $K^0_s$ and Lambda trigger particles in 5.02 TeV pPb and 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions are presented. One unique feature of this analysis is the implementation of a high-multiplicity trigger during the 2013 LHC pPb run, which enables the correlation studies to be performed up to a multiplicity range that is comparable to mid-central PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV. The $K^0_s$ and Lambdas are cleanly reconstructed via their secondary decay vertices over a wide pseudorapidity and transverse momentum range 0.2 $< p_T <$ 6 GeV/c. Neutral pions are reconstructed through the decay channel of two photons in the $p_T$ range of 0.7-5.0 GeV/c. The second-order ($v_2$) and third-order ($v_3$) anisotropy harmonics of $\\pi^0$, $K^0_s$ and Lambda are extracted from long-range correlations as a function of particle multiplicity and $p_T$. The wide $p_T$ coverage and rich sample of high multiplicity pPb events allow: (1) a precise examination of the mass ordering effect of $v_n$ at low $p_T$ as predicted by hydrodynamics for a collectively expanding medium; (2) exploration of possible constituent quark number scaling of $v_2$ and $v_3$ between mesons and baryons as was observed in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.",

      "Abstract": "High energy jets, penetrating the hot QCD matter created in heavy ion collisions,   provide unique probe of the medium property. Recently there has been a lot of interests in extracting the possibly nontrivial temperature dependence of the jet-medium coupling. Particularly sensitive to such T-dependence are two sets of observables: the anisotropy of jet energy loss via the azimuthal angle dependence of suppression $R_{aa}(\\phi)$ (or equivalently the various harmonic coefficients $v_n$ at high $p_t$), as well as the evolution of the overall suppression with beam energy, $R_{aa}(\\sqrt{s})$. We report our systematic study of these observables using event-by-event simulations, and compare with available data from RHIC and LHC. The results strongly suggest a nontrivial temperature dependence of the jet-medium coupling and in particular its enhancement near the parton/hadron phase boundary. Recently emerging evidences for such a possibility from various other jet modelings, as well as efforts to understand such peculiar medium property from microscopic theories will also be discussed. Finally we also briefly discuss potentially final state jet attenuation effect in (possibly created) hot medium in the \"mini-bang\" (pPb and dAu collisions) and demonstrate that jet quenching anisotropy could provide a clean probe to tell whether there is substantial final state interaction in those collisions.    \r\nReferences: Zhang & Liao, arXiv:1311.5463; PRC89(2014)014907; PRC87(2013)044910; PLB713(2012)35.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of heavy flavor $R_{AA}$ have shown a large suppression in central heavy ion collisions, indicating the importance of both gluon radiation and collisional energy loss in models of heavy quark propagation. There is still considerable uncertainty around the energy loss mechanisms of heavy quarks in QGP: the relative contribution of radiative and collisional interactions to the energy loss of heavy quarks as well as the response of the medium to heavy quark propagation are both open questions. Two particle correlations from heavy flavor jets are a unique tool to investigate interactions with QGP, as away side correlations in central events should show modifications as compared to measurements in peripheral bins and $p+p$ collisions. High $p_{T}$ non-photonic electrons serve as a proxy for heavy flavor mesons coming from heavy ion collisions and allow us to tag heavy flavor jets. These electrons' correlations to associated hadrons could give insight into the interactions between charm and bottom quarks and the medium. The away side will contain information both from the decay of any associated away side meson as well as interaction of the away side jet with the bulk. \r\n\r\nThe high statistics from STAR Run 11 allow us to construct correlations across a range of centralities and particle $p_{T}$. We present measurements of correlations of non-photonic electrons to hadrons in high tower triggered $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV $Au+Au$ data from STAR, and will show comparisons to theoretical models for heavy quark correlations in QGP.",

Our recently developed model, which couples a Monte-Carlo Boltzmann-propagation of heavy quarks to the 3+1d fluid dynamical evolution from fluctuating EPOS initial conditions reproduces well the experimental data for the traditional observables like the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will discuss correlations and higher-order flow harmonics as new heavy-quark observables and demonstrate their potential to reveal properties of the QGP. Our studies show that correlations of heavy-flavor particles are sensitive to the energy loss mechanism. Experimentally feasible correlation observables can thus discriminate between elastic and radiative processes and provide valuable information about the transport coefficients. Higher-order flow harmonics, $v_n$, quantify the degree of thermalization of heavy quarks beyond our current understanding of the built-up of elliptic flow. By selecting special classes of bulk events from the probability distribution of $v_n$ of light-flavor hadrons we discuss systematically how relating the light- and the heavy-flavor sector help us understand the interaction mechanisms and thermalization in the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "The  femtoscopic scales for  identical pions and kaons are presented at different centralities for the top energy RHIC and LHC A+A collisions in comparison with ones for p+p collisions. The later results are obtained in hydrokinetic model (HKM) in view of the quantum uncertainty principle. The three-dimensional pion and kaon emission source functions are extracted from the HKM model simulations for A+A collisions. The model describes well the experimental data, previously obtained by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations using the imaging technique. In particular, the HKM reproduces the non-Gaussian heavy tails of the source function in the pair transverse momentum (out ) and beam (long) directions, observed in the pion case and practically absent for kaons. The role of the rescatterings and long-lived resonances decays in forming of the long range tails is investigated. The prediction is made for the source functions in the LHC Pb+Pb collisions at √s= 2.76 TeV.  \r\n         As for the baryon-baryon correlations, the  source functions of   pp, pΛ and p ̅Λ pairs are found in Au+Au collisions and used by means of FSI correlation technique for an extraction of the  scattering lengths in two-baryon  systems. The role of residual correlations in formation of the total baryon-baryon correlation function is analyzed.\r\n\r\nThe talk is based on the results of the following works:\r\n\r\n1.  Iu.A.

      "Abstract": "In heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC, direct photons are produced in excess of their respective $T_{AA}$-scaled p+p spectra at low $p_T$ from 1-4 GeV/c.  These results suggest early-stage thermal partonic emission from the hot dense medium.  Additionally, these soft photons are produced with a large azimuthal anisotropy, an elliptic flow ($v_2$) as large as that of pions.  Hydrodynamic models struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large soft photon $v_2$ because the pressure gradients that generate these anisotropies need time to develop, suggesting later-stage hadronic emission.  The similarly-sized pion $v_2$ in this $p_T$ range is understood as resulting from the recombination of quarks near the phase transition as evidenced by quark number ($n_q$) scaling.  In this poster, I present a coalescence-like model to describe the soft photon flow as the result of increased photon production from $q-\\bar{q}$ interactions as the system approaches confinement.  The published PHENIX soft photon and identified particle measurements are used to test this approach with both a $\\chi^2$ analysis and comparison to model curves.",

Recently, net-electric charge and net-proton fluctuations measured in the beam energy scan program at RHIC were reported by the STAR collaboration. In this talk, we present a new freeze-out curve, which is determined from a combined fit to these fluctuation observables within a phenomenological approach based on the hadron resonance gas model. We also point out that net-strangeness fluctuations may indicate a separate freeze-out behavior of strange hadrons. For a realistic description, we apply the relevant kinematic cuts and systematically include final state effects such as resonance decays and regenerations. The inclusion of the successive regeneration and decay of resonances turns out to be crucial for reconciling calculations of net-proton fluctuations with those of net-baryon number fluctuations and for obtaining reasonable freeze-out conditions.",

Furthermore, the introduction of a new Muon Forward Tracker significantly reduces the space envelope available for the upgraded Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector on the C-side. At the same time, FIT is expected to match and even exceed the functionality and performance currently secured by three ALICE sub-detectors: the time zero detector (T0), the VZERO system, and the Forward Multiplicity Detector (FMD). The harsh conditions of Run 3 would accelerate the aeging and radiation damage (detectable already during Run 1) of the FIT detector if we were to use standard PMTs. The solution came thanks to the latest developments in MCP-PMT technology providing compact photo sensors with excellent characteristics and stability. The key design features of FIT will be presented together with the latest simulation results and benchmark tests of the prototype.",

We show that especially the predictions with the most recent FFs clearly overshoot the high-$p_T$, high-$\\sqrt{s}$ data even when the scale variations, and uncertainties in the PDFs and FFs are accounted for. We conclude that this behavior is due to the too hard gluon-to-hadron FFs, which calls for a complete re-analysis of the FFs using the high-$\\sqrt{s}$ data at $p_T > 10\\,\\rm{GeV}$ where the theoretical uncertainties are only modest.

In this talk we show how one can first make the observable\r\nrobust (efficiency independent) and then make it suitable for many\r\ndifferential studies, not possible before. We use this observable, a\r\nthree-particle correlator, in our model calculations to show the\r\nsensitivity of the signal to several background effects, such as local\r\ncharge conservation, and propose experimental tests for further\r\nidentification of the effects responsible for the observed signal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] G.~Wang [STAR Collaboration], ``Search for Chiral Magnetic Effects\r\nin High-Energy Nuclear Collisions,'' Nucl.\\ Phys.\\ A904-905 {\\bf\r\n  2013}, 248c (2013).\r\n\r\n \r\n[2] Y.~Burnier, D.~E.~Kharzeev, J.~Liao and H.~-U.~Yee, ``Chiral\r\nmagnetic wave at finite baryon density and the electric quadrupole\r\nmoment of quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions,''\r\nPhys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ {\\bf 107}, 052303 (2011).",

We focus on the question of initial state dynamics, i.e. if the initial state might be approximated by a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions or should be considered as a coherent gluon field as predicted within the color glass condensate (CGC) framework. We find that the PHSD approach provides correlations between the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity and the number of participant nucleons very close to results from the CGC and differs substantially from results calculated with Glauber initial conditions. However, a difference is found between the PHSD approach and CGC models with respect to the rapidity dependence of the average transverse momentum.

      "Abstract": "Currently the IP-Glasma initial state, coupled with a viscous hydrodynamic evolution, provides the best description of hadronic flow coefficients and their fluctuations in heavy ion collisions [1]. In this work we perform the first calculation of electromagnetic radiation using IP-Glasma initial conditions.  We include the contributions from pQCD photons arising from the initial hard scatterings at the early stages of the collision, and we go beyond the usual popular formulations of the fluid evolution by using a Israel-Stewart viscous hydrodynamical description that takes into account all second order terms, including those related to bulk viscous pressure. We also highlight the effect of initial flow, which appears naturally in the IP-Glasma profile. We investigate how such additional theoretical ingredients affect the electromagnetic spectra, as well as the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients. More specifically, we check how these features help in explaining the large values of photon elliptic and triangular flow observed by the PHENIX and ALICE collaborations. We further investigate how a simultaneous fit of hadronic and electromagnetic observables can enhance agreement with data of the latter without compromising the interpretation of hadron data. \r\n\r\n[1] C.

      "Abstract": "The phase structure of QCD is currently a much discussed topic in particle physics. In the context of this discussion we need precise knowledge about the nature of the chiral phase transition. A powerful tool to investigate it are lattice simulations. They are, however, still restricted to relatively large quark masses, far from the chiral limit, and to small volumes, which could affect the critical behavior. These two facts complicate the scaling analysis of lattice QCD results.\r\nIn the chiral limit, a continuous phase transition is expected in two-flavor QCD. Since continuous phase transitions are controlled by the long range fluctuations, only the dimensionality and symmetries dictate the universal behavior near the critical point. Therefore, more simple systems from the same universality class can be investigated in order to describe scaling behavior which is expected at the chiral phase transition in lattice QCD.\r\nBecause the long range fluctuations play such a prominent role at continuous phase transitions, it is self-evident that it is useful  to investigate precisely the behavior of higher-order critical fluctuations close to the transition point. For this purpose the so-called Binder cumulants seem to be very well suited. \r\nWe analyze the fourth-order Binder cumulant in 3-dimensional O(2)- and O(4)-models in finite volumes using non-perturbative Renormalization Group methods. This approach allows us to gain explicit insight into the behavior of the critical fluctuations and provides a tool which assists in analysis of lattice QCD data.",

We discuss in detail for all flavors the influence of elastic and radiative energy loss with a running coupling. Radiative processes, in particular, are implemented through an improved version of the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element, which is derived from comparisons to the exact result. In this calculation the finite heavy quark masses are explicitly taken into account, leading to the dead cone effect. Consequently, we present results of this updated version of BAMPS and compare them to experimental data at RHIC and LHC. In detail, the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of charged hadrons, heavy flavor electrons as well as muons, D mesons, and non-prompt J/psi are discussed. The latter two are especially sensitive to the mass difference of charm and bottom quarks. Furthermore, we make predictions where no data is available yet.",

This result is shown to follow exactly that obtained from the solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a charm and anticharm quark pair with temperature independent quark mass using the free energy from lattice calculations as the potential and is in sharp contrast to that using the deeper potential associated with the internal energy, which shows an enhanced strength of the $J/\\psi$ wave function at origin.

      "Abstract": "The midrapidity slope d$v_1$/d$y$ of the directed flow $v_1$ has been predicted to be sensitive to the possible first-order phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon\r\nplasma. The recent STAR data from the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) show that the net-proton d$v_1$/d$y$ changes sign twice within the collision energy range 7.7 - 39 GeV. To further investigate this phenomenon, we study the collision energy dependence of $v_1$ utilizing a Boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid model. Such a hybrid approach provides a natural framework for the transition from high collision energies, where the hydrodynamical description is essential, to smaller energies, where the hadron transport dominates. Calculation with dynamically evolved initial and final state shows no qualitative difference between an equation of state with cross-over and one with first-order phase transition [1], in contrast to the earlier pure fluid predictions.\r\n\r\nWe have also investigated the energy evolution of the elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ [2]. The $v_2$ analysis shows that pre-equilibrium transport dynamics are partially compensating for the diminished elliptic flow production in the hydrodynamical phase at lower energies, resulting to relatively weak collision energy dependence which is in qualitative agreement with STAR BES results. The medium described by transport is, however, too viscous to build up triangular flow, making $v_3$ the clearer signal for the formation of (near-)ideal fluid in relativistic heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\n \r\nReferences:\r\n[1] J.

      "Abstract": "Much work has been devoted to the determination of an effective value of the shear viscosity coefficient from analyses of the hadronic final states in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Electromagnetic radiation, however, constitutes a class of complementary and penetrating probes that are sensitive to the entire space-time history of nuclear collisions including its very early stages. We show that thermal dileptons (and photons) are affected by the transport properties of the fluid and by the non-equilibrium aspects of the initial state that are usually inaccessible to hadronic probes. For the first time, we explicitly demonstrate that electromagnetic spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy can be used not only to investigate the magnitude of the shear relaxation time and to differentiate between possible initial shear-stress tensors, but also to reveal the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient. We further show that the dependence of electromagnetic probes on these quantities comes mostly from processes occurring in the QGP phase. Our approach utilizes event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic simulations (MUSIC) [1], and the dilepton emission sources include contributions from charm decay and hadronic rates extracted from in-medium spectral functions [2]. \r\n\r\n[1] Bjoern Schenke, Sangyong Jeon, Charles Gale, Phys.Rev.

      "Abstract": "In this talk, I would like to report the results of our recent work on the thermalization of gluons and $N_f$ flavors of massless quarks and antiquarks in a spatially homogeneous \r\nsystem. First, we give two coupled transport equations for gluons and quarks (and antiquarks), which are derived within the diffusion approximation of \r\nthe Boltzmann equation with only $2\\leftrightarrow 2$ processes included in the collision term. These transport equations are solved \r\nnumerically in order to study the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. Next, we discuss three different patterns of the thermalization of the quark-gluon system. At initial time, we assume that no quarks or antiquarks are present \r\nand we choose the gluon distribution in the form $f = f_0~\\theta\\left(1-\\frac{p}{Q_s} \\right) $ with $Q_s$ the saturation momentum and \r\n$f_0$ a constant. The subsequent evolution of systems\r\nmay, or may not, lead to the formation of a (transient) Bose condensate, depending on the value of $f_0$. The three patterns of thermalization are as follows: (a) thermalization \r\nwithout gluon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) for $f_0\\leq f_{0t}$, \r\n(b) thermalization with transient BEC for $f_{0t} < f_0 \\leq f_{0c}$ and (c) thermalization with BEC for $f_{0c} < f_0 $. Here, the values of $f_{0t} $ and $f_{0c} $ depend on $N_f$. When $f_0 \\geq 1 > f_{0c}$, the formation of BEC starts at a finite time $t_c\\sim\\frac{1}{(\\alpha_s f_0)^2}\\frac{1}{Q_s}$. We also find that the equilibration time \r\nfor $N_f = 3$ is typically about 5 to 6 times longer than that for $N_f = 0$ at the same $Q_s$.",

In particular, they provide information on particle-formation mechanisms, the properties of the medium at freeze-out, and they contribute to the systematic study of energy loss and recombination. The study of resonance production in other collision systems such as pp and p-Pb form a necessary baseline to disentangle initial-state effects from genuine medium-induced effects. \r\nThe ALICE experiment has measured the production of the K(892)$^{0}$ and $\\phi$(1020) resonances at mid-rapidity in different collision systems at LHC energies. Resonances are reconstructed via their hadronic decay in a wide momentum range, by exploiting the excellent particle-identification capabilities of the Time-Projection Chamber and the Time-of-Flight system. The first results on K(892)$^{0}$ and $\\phi$(1020) production in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at the LHC will be presented. The resonance mass and width, transverse momentum spectra and yields are measured and reported as a function of the multiplicity of the p-Pb collision. Ratios of resonance to long-lived hadron production in Pb-Pb are compared with the same quantities measured in pp and p-Pb collisions, in order to investigate re-scattering effects. The nuclear modification factors ($R_{\\rm AA}$, $R_{\\rm pPb}$), recently measured up to high $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ for resonances, are compared to the same measurement for long lived hadrons. The results are discussed in comparison with measurements at lower energies and theoretical predictions.",

      "Abstract": "We discuss multiplicity fluctuation\r\ncaused by noises during hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon fluid\r\ncreated in high-energy nuclear collisions. \r\nIn this talk, we claim the following non-trivial consequences within a framework of relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics [1]:\r\n\r\n - Multiplicity (being approximately proportional to entropy) fluctuates\r\nfrom event to event \r\ndue to hydrodynamic fluctuation of dissipative currents such as shear stress tensor and bulk pressure\r\neven if the initial state is the same in a macroscopic sense.\r\n - *Event-averaged* entropy has to increase with time\r\nso that the system obeys the second law of thermodynamics as it should be. \r\nEntropy in a certain event can, however, *decrease* with time temporarily and locally due to the hydrodynamic fluctuations. \r\n - The probability of decreasing entropy during hydrodynamic evolution\r\nis, of course, very small in general. Interestingly, the probability is quantified by the *fluctuation theorem* [2]\r\nas known in the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\r\n\r\nWe first discuss the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [2].\r\nThe fluctuation theorem has been a milestone in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics\r\nsince the linear response theory was established. Since the fluctuation theorem contains the Green-Kubo formula\r\nat long-time limit, it is believed to capture some important properties of non-equilibrium processes\r\naway from equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWe next solve the stochastic equation for dissipative currents\r\ntogether with the temporal evolution equation for the energy density\r\nin one-dimensionally expanding coordinate [3]\r\nto demonstrate that the final entropy fluctuates from event to event for a given initial condition.\r\nDuring the time evolution of the total entropy in a certain event,\r\nreduction of the entropy occurs due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of\r\ndissipative currents.  \r\nWe show that the probability of decreasing entropy just obeys the above-mentioned fluctuation theorem.\r\n\r\nWe finally discuss the physics consequences of hydrodynamic fluctuations on final observables.\r\nFluctuation of the final entropy is taken over by the one of multiplicity.\r\nThus we discuss multiplicity distribution functions from a hydrodynamic fluctuation point of view. \r\nWe also discuss observables in small system\r\nsuch as p+p or p/d+A collisions since the effect of fluctuations\r\nare of particular importance in such smaller systems. \r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n[1] K.

      "Abstract": "In collisions of lead nuclei at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a state of matter called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is predicted to be formed, where quarks and gluons are no longer confined into hadrons. Heavy-flavour quarks, i.e., charm and beauty, are effective probes for studying the QGP, as their relatively large mass limits their production predominantly, if not exclusively, to hard scattering processes in the very first moments of the collisions, before the QGP formation. As the quarks propagate through the hot and dense medium created in the Pb-Pb collisions they interact with the medium and lose energy via elastic collisions and gluon radiation.\r\n\r\nThe study of the modification of the angular correlation between D mesons and charged hadrons, as well as the correlation between D mesons and electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp and p-Pb collisions can provide relevant information on the energy-loss mechanism. This applies in particular to the dependence of the correlation on the path length traversed by the charm quark in the medium, and to possible medium modifications of charm-quark fragmentation and hadronisation. In pp collisions, these measurements can be sensitive to the different production processes of heavy-flavour quarks, e.g., pair production vs. gluon splitting. In this poster, the results of the analysis of azimuthal correlations between D mesons and charged hadrons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. In addition, the prospects for measuring correlations of D mesons and electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays will be discussed. The performance expected after the upgrade of the ALICE detector during the long shutdown in 2018 will also be shown.",

      "Abstract": "The QCD matter produced initially in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions is expected to represent a high temperature plasma, which should be evidenced in its electromagnetic radiation. We analyze the production of real and virtual photons from the strongly-coupled QGP in the initial stages of the collisions as well as the ('corona') radiation from the interacting mesons and baryons after hadronization using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport model. The description of the bulk evolution in the microscopic PHSD approach is independently controlled by abundances, spectra and flow of final particles, which is found to be in agreement with experimental observation. In this contribution, we will provide a brief description of the relevant physics assumptions within the PHSD approach and give details on the implementation of the photon radiation in partonic and hadronic interactions and decays. Our calculations successfully describe the production of photons and dileptons in proton-proton as well as nucleus-nucleus collisions from SPS to RHIC and LHC energies. In particular, we find that the  observed strong elliptic flow v_2 of direct photons can be understood theoretically only by a consistent modeling of both the 'early' partonic sources (q+q->g+gamma, q+g->q+gamma) and the 'late' hadronic interactions (mesons-meson and meson-baryon bremsstrahlung m+m->m+m+gamma, m+B->m+B+gamma) within the same approach.",

      "Abstract": "The complexity of the proton-proton interactions requires many theoretical models to describe the different features of the data. Typically, they are incorporated in MC event generators and their parameters are tuned to describe the average behaviour of specific quantities. However, this approach does not allow to understand in detail the impact of the different components  in the measurable observables. This task is particularly important to really understand the physics of the hadronic interactions which so far have been taken as the baseline to learn about the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this work a new method to extract meaningful information from the pp data is proposed, the aim is to use observables sensitive to e.g.  partonic stages where collective effects are possible. The approach is based on the use of the event structure variables (sphericity and spherocity). This was developed in the framework of Pythia 8.180 since its pQCD content seems very well adapted for this goal. For minimum bias pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$ and 7 TeV a discussion of the interconnection among event shapes, multi-parton interactions, abundances of final semi-hard quarks/gluons and color reconnection, is done. A study of the identified particle transverse momentum, $p_{\\rm T}$, spectra and their ratios will be presented for isotropic (soft) and jetty-like (hard) events; and as a function of multiplicity. The results indicate that the baryon-to-meson ratio for soft events is larger than for the jetty-like ones, the latter case gives particle ratios compatible with NLO. The observations are explained in terms of the competition between gluons and quarks for the particle production at intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$. The results are compared to LHC data and the similarities between the observed effects and those measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions are discussed.",

In 2012, making use of the unique capabilities of RHIC to collide different nuclei, the PHENIX experiment collected a large dataset of Cu+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Studying reconstructed jets in collisions of asymmetric heavy ions is crucial in understanding the interplay between collision geometry and initial and final state effects. In central Cu+Au collisions, the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au nucleus. The study of Cu+Au collisions as a function of centrality can help disentangle the 'core' of the collision region, characterized by a large energy density, and the outer 'corona' region. \r\n\r\nWe will present the status of jet reconstruction in Cu+Au and a reference sample of p+p collisions at 200 GeV using the anti-kT algorithm.",

      "Speaker": "Gianluca Usai",
      "Institute": "Universita e INFN (IT)",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The structure of the QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate temperature and high baryon density is still almost unexplored. In this regime,  the QGP and hadronic phases should be separated by a first order transition region. On the other hand, for sufficiently low baryonic chemical potential a simple cross-over is expected. The end point of the first order transition region is the so called critical point.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of the ratio $K^+/\\pi^+$ vs energy performed at the CERN SPS by the NA49 collaboration showed that the early stage produced in central Pb-Pb collisions at $E_{lab}$=30-40 AGeV may have reached the transition line - marking the onset of deconfinement.  However, this interpretation is still controversial. Dilepton measurements with a rich set of independent observables offer a completely  independent way to shed light on the onset of deconfinement and at the same time on the issue of  chiral restoration. The CERN SPS is unique for systematic investigations along these lines, due to its  wide beam energy range from 20-160 AGeV coupled to very high luminosities over the full range. \r\n\r\nThe objective of this talk is to present a new proposal for measuring dimuon production in a comprehensive energy scan at the SPS - specifically both below and above the maximum of the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio. To advance the field with  measurements which could provide quantitative insight,  a further significant increase in  the precision and in the collected statistics  with respect to the past reference experiment NA60 is needed. To this end, we propose a novel NA60-like apparatus, with improved performance, based on the coupling of a muon spectrometer  to a a silicon pixel spectrometer in the vertex region before the absorber. \r\n\r\nThe first key element is a high-precision measurement of the temperature $T$ of the thermal dimuon continuum in the mass range $1.1\\lt M\\lt2.5$ GeV (IMR) vs. beam energy. The temperature is accessible through the spectral shape of the mass spectra, and since mass is a Lorentz-invariant, $T$ is immune to  any motion of the emitting sources and thus purely  thermal,  in contrast to the slope parameters of dilepton $m_T$ spectra or photon $p_T$ spectra. At top SPS  energies, values of about 200 MeV were found, indicating dominantly partonic emission sources. For decreasing beam energies one should expect that the partonic contribution will also decrease, becoming negligible at the onset of deconfinement. Thus the onset of deconfinement might be tagged by a precision measurement of $T$ in the IMR. \r\n\r\nThe second  element is related to the transverse momentum spectra, which encode - besides temperature - also radial flow, another key property of the fireball. At topmost SPS energies the \r\neffective temperature extracted from the $m_T$ spectra vs mass shows an increase up to $M\\sim1$ GeV corresponding to $\\rho$ production which is maximally coupled to radial  flow through pions. At 1 GeV a sudden drop occurs and the temperature is constant at 180-200 MeV - a sign of production of thermal dimuons from the partonic medium without  any flow (at the SPS). The evolution of the pattern of $T_{eff}$ vs. $M$ towards lower energies,  in  particular  the possible decrease or disappearence of the  drop, will  be most revealing: thermal radiation from multi-pion processes should exhibit a monotonic increase of $T_{eff}$ vs $M$ so that around the onset of deconfinement the drop should vanish.\r\n\r\nThe new experiment should reach a sensitivity at the MeV level  in the measurements of $T$ and $T_{eff}$ vs $M$. This will be possible  integrating luminosities at least an order of magnitude larger than in case of NA60 or so while retaining a good signal to background ratio -  well above than 1/100 in the IMR even in Pb-Pb central collisions.\r\n\r\nFor masses below 1 GeV (LMR), at high energies, hadronic many body models describe $\\rho$  production and the notion that the total baryon density drives the broadening is now well accepted. At lower energies, the baryon density gets maximal, thus the effects of $\\rho$ broadening can be measured with utmost precision. \r\nIn this measurement the mass resolution is a key factor and we propose to improve it over NA60 by a factor 2-3, reaching $\\sim$10 MeV at the $\\omega$ mass.\r\n\r\nThe experimental apparatus must have also a good $p_T$-$y$ coverage down to the lowest beam energies. In the talk  the detector perfomance in terms of acceptances at different energies and mass resolution  will be discussed in detail.   The physics performance will be presented on the basis of simulations of Pb-Pb collisions at 20 and 40 AGeV including a background estimate and a modeling of the involved physics processes - in medium $\\rho$ in the LMR, multi-pion processes and partonic radiation in the IMR. An overview of the possible detector technologies together with a cost estimate will be also presented. Finally, an experimental program consisting of measurements at different energies and/or different collision systems will be discussed in terms of  beam time needed to collect the required event statistics.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, we proposed a C# code, namely Chaos Many-Body Engine [1,2], for chaos analysis of relativistic many-body systems with reactions. Preliminary tests using a simplified relativistic nuclear collisions model resulted in some encouraging results for describing global physical quantities obtained in C-C collisions at 4.5 A GeV/c in experiments performed at JINR Synchrophasotron (SKM 200 Collaboration) [3]. The code allows introduction of some additional interactions among particles in the participant region, thus improving the description of the particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The code permits, also, the investigation of time evolution of the collisions, from the initial moment up to the freeze-out. The time evolution step can be below 0,1 Fm/c. Using the possibilities for code development, we try to improve the agreement between our code and existing experimental results. Two collisions will be discussed, namely Cu-Cu at maximum BNL energy, and d-Au at the same energy. The code predictions and experimental results improve the agreement when we include more collisions and particle production mechanisms in the participant region. The time evolution of the fireball is well reflected by our code (Fig.1), for an evolution time between 0,1 and 200 Fm/c.\r\nFor the time evolution, code hypotheses do not cover all aspects and some behaviors of the experimental results are not completely described.

      "Abstract": "The characterisation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), the deconfined state of strongly-interacting matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, is the main purpose of ALICE at the LHC. Because of their large masses, charm and beauty quarks are mostly produced in initial hard partonic interactions and thus can be used to probe the medium created in such collisions. The $p_{\\rm T}$ differential heavy-flavour yield is an observable sensitive to the energy loss of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium. In addition to the QGP, the presence of cold nuclear matter in the initial state may affect the production of heavy-flavour hadrons. To quantify these effects and confirm the role of final-state effects in Pb-Pb collisions, a reference measurement in p-Pb collisions is necessary. Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons can be used to measure charm and beauty quark production. The measurement of heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE will be presented.

      "Abstract": "For two-particle systems with a well known interaction, ranging from pion-pion to proton-lambda, femtoscopy is used to measure the space-time characteristics of the fireball created in heavy-ion collisions at kinetic freeze-out. For less known systems, femtoscopy can be used to extract nuclear scattering information for the particles being studied. In particular, the scattering length and effective range of interaction can be extracted from fits of femtoscopic correlation functions. This technique has applications in the study of hyperon-hyperon interactions, where precise scattering measurements are still needed. However, there are non-trivial complications due to the possible residual correlations introduced by feed-down from other hyperons when studying lambda particles.\r\n\r\nWe present measurements of baryon-baryon, antibaryon-antibaryon, and baryon-antibaryon correlation functions involving lambda particles in Pb-Pb $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV collisions with ALICE. The results are compared to femtoscopic measurements from other analyses, as well as to model predictions. We also present our methodology for quantifying the correlations from feed-down.",

In particular, such a situation may arise, when the system passes through the \"mixed phase\" and -- due to the appearance of free quarks and gluons in the process of deconfinement of hadronic matter -- the number of two-particle sources strongly increases .",

The model further contains a scalar dilaton for asymptotic freedom and confinement, a scalar tachyon for chiral symmetry breaking and a charge density for chemical potential. Solving the classical gravity equations numerically leads to an identification of a chirally symmetric and chirally broken phase with a phase transition in between. The phase transition line on the $T,\\mu$ plane can have both 2nd and 1st order segments. The computation can be extended down to the quantum phase transition at $T=0$. The dilaton and tachyon potentials are only constrained by physical properties, not uniquely determined.

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor hadrons serve as valuable probes of the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We introduce a comprehensive framework that describes their full-time evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadronic phase. The heavy quark energy loss in a de-confined QCD medium is modeled with our improved Langevin approach [1] that simultaneously incorporates quasi-elastic scattering [2,3] and medium-induced gluon radiation [4]. The subsequent transport of heavy mesons in the hadron gas phase is described within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model [5]. The intermediate hadronization process from heavy quarks to their respective mesonic bound states is calculated with our hybrid fragmentation plus coalescence model [1].\r\n\r\nWe investigate the relative contribution of each of these ingredients to the final-state spectra of heavy mesons and demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate transverse momenta; and the subsequent hadronic interactions is equally crucial as the free quark evolution inside QGP for the development of heavy flavor suppression and collective flow behaviors that one observes. Within this newly developed framework, we provide a good description of D meson suppression and flow measured at both RHIC and LHC, as well as predictions for the future measurements of B mesons.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new set of observables – heavy-flavor-tagged angular correlation functions – are explored and found to be potential candidates for distinguishing different energy loss mechanisms of heavy quarks inside a QGP medium [6]. We calculate correlation functions for D-D, D-e, D-hadron, e-hadron, etc., some of which can be compared to the existing preliminary data from LHC experiments.\r\n\r\n 1. S. Cao, G.-Y. Qin, and S. A.

In the simulation studies we investigate the feasibility to effectively reduce the combinatorial background with the currently foreseen experimental setup, which does not provide electron identification in front of the magnetic field.

      "Abstract": "A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), notably its\r\ntransport coefficients, such as the specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$.  Since these properties are not directly measurable, one relies on a\r\ncomparison of the data to computational models of the time-evolution of the collision to connect measured observables to the properties of\r\nthe transient QGP state.  The computational model parameters are tuned such that simulated observables optimally match experimental data.\r\n\r\nMost studies to date are severely limited by computation time:  they typically rely on averaged quantities such as the average elliptic flow\r\ncoefficient $\\langle v_2 \\rangle$ for a given centrality bin -- disregarding the effects of event-by-event fluctuations -- and use ad hoc\r\nmethods for optimizing model parameters.  Often, each parameter is varied independently, while best-fit values are chosen via qualitative\r\ncomparisons to single observables.  This neglects correlations among parameters and leads to nebulous results lacking quantitative\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nWe propose a systematic model-to-data comparison method for extracting QGP properties.  First, a set of salient model parameters is chosen\r\nfor calibration -- physical properties such as transport coefficients are of primary interest.  An event-by-event model is then evaluated at\r\nmany points in parameter space; this is made possible by recent advances in high-throughput computing.  Finally, a statistical surrogate\r\nalgorithm is used to interpolate the parameter space and determine the values which optimally reproduce experimental data.  This provides\r\nrigorous constraints including quantitative uncertainty and sheds light on the relative importance of each parameter.  \r\n\r\nThe methodology is applied to a modern hybrid model with MC-Glauber and MC-KLN initial conditions, viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics, and the\r\nhadron cascade UrQMD.  By leveraging the power of the Open Science Grid, we have run event-by-event simulations over wide ranges of several\r\ncrucial parameters, e.g. the shear viscosity and hydrodynamic thermalization time.  We calibrate the model to experimental event-by-event\r\nflow distributions measured by the ATLAS experiment; these distributions are sensitive to initial-state fluctuations and therefore\r\nconstitute a more comprehensive probe of the QGP than event-averaged flow.\r\n\r\nThis massive-scale model-to-comparison yields new constraints on fundamental QGP properties and clarifies the essential features of a\r\nphysically accurate model.  The method is general and easily extensible to future studies.",

      "Abstract": "We model the initial confinement deconfinement transition in relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a rapid quench in view of expected rapid thermalization to a quark-gluon plasma state. The transition is studied using the Polyakov\r\nloop model, with the initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small neighborhood of the confining vacuum l= 0, as appropriate for\r\nT < Tc. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration\r\nwith the effective potential at a temperature T >Tc. We study the formation of Z(3) domain structure and its evolution during the transition as l rolls down in different directions from the top of the central hill in the effective\r\npotential of l. When explicit Z(3) symmetry-breaking effects (arising from dynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains, which coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of l shows\r\nvacuum bubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first-order transition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum separated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used.\r\nWhen the initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same direction (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not find such bubble like configurations. However, in this case\r\nwe find huge oscillations of l with large length scales. We show that such large oscillations can lead to large fluctuations in the evolution of flow anisotropies compared to the equilibrium transition case.",

      "Abstract": "The collective expansion in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is initially highly anisotropic. Due to viscosity, this leads to strongly deformed local momentum distributions which invalidates the standard viscous hydrodynamic expansion around a local equilibrium distribution, causing a breakdown of viscous fluid dynamics à la Israel and Stewart at early times. We have developed an improved formulation of viscous hydrodynamics [1] that is based on an expansion around a spheroidally deformed local momentum distribution. A spheroidal local momentum distribution leads to the \"anisotropic hydrodynamics\" developed earlier by Martinez and Strickland, which accounts non-perturbatively for the resulting large early-time anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse pressures. By allowing in our new treatment for additional small deviations of the local momentum distribution from spheroidal symmetry, we arrive at a complete formulation of second-order viscous hydrodynamics in which the large longitudinal-transverse momentum anisotropy is treated non-perturbatively à la Martinez and Strickland while the smaller remaining viscous stress components are treated perturbatively à la Israel and Stewart. We perform a test of the approach for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion without transverse expansion which maximizes the longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy. For this system the Boltzmann equation can be solved exactly in the relaxation-time approximation, allowing for a quantitative test of effective macroscopic hydrodynamic theories. We find that the viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic framework (\"vaHydro\") significantly outperforms all other available hydrodynamic descriptions, for both small and large values of the shear viscosity $\\eta/s$. We expect vaHydro to provide a superior description also after including transverse expansion and to allow for an earlier matching of pre-equilibrium dynamics to hydrodynamics, due to the superior ability of vaHydro to handle the large differences in longitudinal and transverse expansion rates at early times. \r\n\r\n[1] D.

This provides a physical way to introduce fluctuations in Glauber Model calculations of p+p collisions, since the spatial distribution of each of the three constituent quarks in a nucleon is generated according to the measured charge distribution of the proton.  It had been noted previously that $dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV as a function of centrality is not simply proportional to the number of nucleon participants, $N_{\\rm part}$,  (the Wounded Nucleon Model, WNM)  \r\nbut is linearly proportional to the number of constituent-quark participants, $N_{\\rm qp}$, (the NQP model).\r\nFor symmetric systems, the NQP model is identical to the Additive Quark Model (AQM) \r\nused in the 1980's, to explain a similar disagreement of $dE_T/d\\eta$ distributions with the Wounded Nucleon Model in $\\alpha+\\alpha$ relative to p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=31$ GeV at the CERN-ISR. However, the AQM and NQP models differ for the case of asymmetric systems such as d+Au, where the AQM, which is a color-string model, is effectively proportional only to the number quark-participants in the projectile. The present d+Au data clearly reject the AQM model in favor of the NQP, which is also in excellent agreement with the Au+Au data. The NQP model also explains why the additional contribution proportional the number of binary-collisions, $N_{\\rm coll}$, added to $N_{\\rm part}$ to parametrize the centrality-dependence of A+A collisions works, but does not imply a hard-scattering component in $E_T$  distributions and thus is no longer in disagreement with lessons learned from measurements of $E_T$  distributions in p+p(${\\bar{\\rm p}}$) collisions at the CERN SpS, ISR and SpS-Collider.",

We find that the\r\nmomentum dependence of the corrections in all systems investigated is best\r\nfit by a power close to $\\frac{3}{2}$ rather than the typically used quadratic\r\nansatz. The effects on flow coefficients are also calculated and found to be substantial for elliptic flow, thus the form of these corrections should be taken\r\ninto account when extracting medium properties from experimental data.",

      "Abstract": "There have been theoretically and experimentally explored the QCD phase diagram in the density ($\\mu$)-temperature ($T$) plane.\r\n Usually the phase structure is studied by assuming the spatially and temporally constant order parameter.\r\n Recently the possibility of inhomogeneous chiral phase has attracted much interest [1,2] in the light of progress in heavy-ion collisions or observation of compact stars. Theoretically discovering of the Hartree-Fock solutions in 1+1 dimension has also stimulated the studies.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the external magnetic field on the chiral transition or deconfinement has been also studied by the lattice QCD simulation for $\\mu=0$ [3].\r\n It should be important, because quark matter is exposed in the strong magnetic field in compact stars or heavy-ion collisions. Theoretically the magnetic field leads to various\r\nphenomena in QCD such as chiral magnetic effect, magnetic catalysis or magnetic\r\ninhibition of the spontaneous symmetry breaking effect.\r\n\r\nWe study the chiral transition in the presence of the magnetic field by using the\r\nNJL model. We focus here on the inhomogeneous chiral phase. For the analysis, the complex order parameter $\\Delta := -2G\\left[ \\left<\\overline \\psi \\psi \\right> +i\\left<\\overline \\psi i\\gamma^5\\tau^3\\psi \\right>\\right]$ is used; dual chiral\r\ndensity wave (DCDW)  $\\left[ \\Delta(x) =me^{iqz} \\right]$ and real kink crystal (RKC) $\\left[ \\Delta(x) =\\frac{2m\\nu}{1+\\sqrt{\\nu}}{\\rm sn}\\left( \\frac{2mz}{1+\\sqrt{\\nu}}, \\nu\\right) \\right]$ have been commonly used\r\nas typical configurations. The properties of DCDW has been studied by Frolov et al.\r\nin the presence of the magnetic field [4]. They found that DCDW phase develops in a wide\r\ndensity region at $T=0$. They also found some peculiar behavior of the amplitude\r\nand the wavevector. However, they did not take into account the possibility of RKC,\r\nwhile RKC has been suggested to be favored in the absence of the magnetic field.\r\nHere we introduce the hybrid configuration $\r\n\\left[ \\Delta(x) = \\frac{2m\\nu}{1+\\sqrt{\\nu}}{\\rm sn}\\left( \\frac{2mz}{1+\\sqrt{\\nu}},\\nu \\right)e^{iqz} \\right]\r\n$, which smoothly connects both DCDW\r\nand RKC, and demonstrate that the magnetic field favors the phase modulation: it is\r\nfound through the analysis of the thermodynamic potential that the wavevector $q$\r\ntakes a nonzero value in the presence of the magnetic field and  DCDW and RKC\r\ncoexist in the weak magnetic field at moderate densities. In the high magnetic field\r\npure DCDW appears over all density region. It is also shown that there is a first order phase transition between inhomogeneous phases in the presence of magnetic field.\r\n Such hybrid phase may appear in compact stars.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] E.Nakano, T.Tatsumi, Phys.Rev.D 71 (2005) 114006\r\n\r\n[2] D.Nickel, Phys.Rev.D 80 (2009) 074025; D.Nickel, Phys.Rev.Lett.103 (2009) 072301\r\n\r\n[3] GH.S.Bali, F.Bruckmann, G.Endrodi, Z.Fodor, S.D.Katz, A.Schafer, Phys.

It has been determined that jets of hadrons, created from the fragmentation of hard-scattered partons, are suppressed relative to measurements from proton-proton collisions.  This jet quenching effect in both strong and weak coupling calculations explicitly depends on the path-length of the parton through the medium. Jets can be reconstructed in the ALICE detector from the tracking systems alone, creating charged jets, or from the combination of the tracking systems and the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal). The EMCal was used to trigger on events with a jet within its acceptance, which allows for a measurement of the jet spectra versus centrality and event plane by increasing the available statistics.  The centrality and event plane of these events are reconstructed with the VZERO detectors to avoid autocorrelations with the triggered jets.   Triggers introduce biases to both the fragmentation of the jets, and to the background.  Centrality and event plane dependence of the measured spectra and the background using the EMCal trigger will be shown as well as the reconstruction and correction procedures with the trigger biases.",

The distribution of fluctuation-driven anisotropies, such as the initial triangularity $\\varepsilon_3$, is described by a one-parameter power distribution. When a mean anisotropy in the reaction plane is also present, as in the case of the the initial eccentricity $\\varepsilon_2$ in nucleus-nucleus collision, a new parameter must be added: the power distribution is replaced by a new, elliptic power distribution. Our results are in excellent agreement with all  Monte-Carlo models of the initial state (Glauber, KLN, IP-Glasma) for all collision systems and all centralities.\r\n\r\nWe then apply our results to the interpretation of the event-by-event distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Assuming that anisotropic flow is proportional to the initial anisotropy, $v_n=C_n\\varepsilon_n$,\r\nwe obtain excellent fits to these data. This procedure gives us direct information on the initial state from data. Our results are compared to several initial-state models.

These data may confirm  binary scaling in the p-Pb system and help clarify the present ambiguity of centrality classifications in proton+nucleus collisions.  Further, the momentum and rapidity differential yields of Z bosons allow the detection of  any modification of the initial state present in such collisions.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Due to color screening, the production of quarkonia in high energy heavy ion collisions is expected to be sensitive to the energy density of the medium. Sequential suppression of different quarkonium states may therefore serve as a thermometer of the medium. Although the suppression of charmonia was anticipated as a key signature of the QGP, the observed energy dependence of $J/\\psi$ suppression is rather weak. This phenomenon is explained by the recombination (coalescence) of $c\\bar{c}$ pairs. Bottomonia, on the other hand, are less affected by recombination and can provide a cleaner probe of the strongly interacting medium. Recent STAR results show that in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV central Au+Au collisions the Upsilon 1S state is suppressed more than if only cold nuclear matter effects were present, and the excited state yields are consistent with a complete suppression. \r\n\r\nThe energy density in U+U $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV central collisions is estimated to be about 20% higher than that of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV central Au+Au. Therefore U+U collisions provide a further test of the sequential suppression hypothesis. The STAR detector collected a total of 17.2 million high-tower triggered events in $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV U+U collisions in the year 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 263.4 $\\mu b^{-1}$. Upsilon yields at mid-rapidity, measured in central and mid-central collisions through the dielectron channel, as well as the nuclear modification factor with respect to the number of participants, will be reported in this presentation.",

      "Abstract": "Unlike heavy quarks, light quark energy loss in AdS/CFT is surprisingly dependent on both the string initial conditions and the very definition of the jet itself in the gravity theory. In order to more accurately model QCD jet energy loss in AdS/CFT, we more closely match the string initial conditions to those expected from pQCD and simultaneously propose a novel jet prescription in the dual theory. With the new jet prescription, light quark jet energy loss regains the “explosive,” late-time Bragg peak in both static and expanding plasmas. We incorporate the improved AdS/CFT results into a phenomenological energy loss model and compare our predictions to light meson suppression at RHIC and LHC.",

For example, time-dependent and/or inhomogeneous classical background fields allow rapid particle production, such as 1 to 2 process on the basis of the 2PI formalism.\r\n\r\nWe calculate the time evolution of the statistical function which contains some important features of particle distribution under the homogeneous, but time dependent color electromagnetic fields in the lowest order of perturbation theory. Our results suggest that parametric resonance causes exponential growth of the statisical function in low momentum regions.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss the role of background color magnetic fields in the instability of the statistical function and Nielsen-Olesen instability as an underlying mechanism.",

The prolate shape of uranium nuclei provides the possibility to study how the initial geometry of the nuclei affects the azimuthal distributions. It also provides a unique opportunity to understand the initial conditions for particle production at mid-rapidity in heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the two- and four- particle cumulant, $v_2$($v_2{2}$ and $v_2{4}$), from U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 193 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV for inclusive charged hadrons will be presented. The STAR Zero Degree Calorimeter is used to subdivide the 0-1% centrality bin into even finer centralities. Differences were observed between the multiplicity dependence of $v_2{2}$ for most central Au+Au and U+U collisions. Data was compared with a Monte Carlo Glauber model and it was seen that this model cannot explain the multiplicity dependence of $v_2{2}$ in central collisions. It has also been demonstrated that ZDC and multiplicity in combination provide a way to select body-body or tip-tip enhanced samples of central U+U collisions. We will also present preliminary $v_1$ and $v_2$ results for inclusive charged hadrons from Au+Au and U+U collisions, with the first-order event plane determining from spectator neutrons. This type of event plane represents the reaction plane instead of the participant plane as used in other methods, this analysis provides an alternative approach to examine the eccentricity-scaling to reveal the QGP properties.",

      "Country": "RS",
      "Abstract": "The technique of two-particle correlations has been widely used in studying flow via azimuthal anisotropy in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A key assumption imposed in this approach is the factorization of Fourier coefficients extracted from two-particle correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropies of trigger and associated particles. It was recently predicted by hydrodynamics that due to initial-state participant fluctuations, a transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence of the event-plane angle would be induced, leading to a breakdown of factorization, even if hydrodynamic flow is the only source of correlations. We present a systematic examination of the factorization assumption in 5.02 TeV pPb and 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions with the CMS experiment. Significant breakdown of factorization (up to 20%) is observed in a large sample of ultra-central (0--0.2%) triggered PbPb events, where initial-state fluctuations play a dominant role. Comparison of data and viscous hydrodynamics predictions, as a function of $p_T$ and centrality, allows new constraints on the modeling of initial condition and shear viscosity to entropy density ($\\eta/s$) ratio of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the measurement is also extended to high-multiplicity pPb collisions. As the initial-state geometry of a pPb collision is expected to be entirely a consequence of fluctuations, quantitative studies of factorization breakdown will help to investigate the nature of the observed long-range correlations in pPb collisions, particularly in the context of hydrodynamic models.",

      "Abstract": "Unlike hadrons, direct photons are produced in all stages of a \r\nnucleus-nucleus collision and therefore test our understanding of the\r\nspace-time evolution of the produced medium. Of particular interest\r\n are \r\nso-called thermal photons expected to be produced in a quark-gluon\r\n plasma and the subsequent hadron gas. \r\nThe transverse momentum spectrum \r\nof thermal photons carries information about the temperature of the\r\n\r\nemitting medium. The effect of Doppler blueshift on photons spectra\r\n from later and colder stages of a \r\ncollision, however, potentially \r\ncomplicates the extraction of the temperature. \r\nIn this presentation, \r\ndirect-photon spectra in the range $1 < p_T < 12$ GeV/c from Pb-Pb\r\ncollisions at \r\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV will be shown. The results\r\nwere obtained with two independent methods: \r\nby measuring photons with \r\nthe electromagnetic calorimeter PHOS and by measuring $e^+e^-$ pairs\r\n from \r\nexternal conversions of photons in the detector material. The\r\n measured direct-photon spectra will be \r\ncompared with predictions from\r\n state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. In addition, direct-photon \r\nproduction \r\nin p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be \r\ndiscussed. In the standard hydrodynamical \r\nmodeling of nucleus-nucleus \r\ncollisions, thermal photons mostly come from the early hot stage of the\r\n\r\ncollision. As collective hydrodynamic flow needs time to build up, the \r\nazimuthal anisotropy of \r\nthermal photons quantified with Fourier\r\n coefficient $v_2$ is expected to be smaller than the one for\r\n\r\nhadrons. However, the PHENIX experiment and ALICE experiment observed \r\n$v_2$ values of direct-photons \r\nsimilar in magnitude to the pion\r\n$v_2$. These unexpected observations constitute the so called\r\n\r\n\"direct-photon flow puzzle\" as they challenge the standard\r\n hydrodynamic picture of nucleus-nucleus \r\ncollisions and/or the standard \r\nphoton emissions rates in the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron\r\n gas. \r\nWe will present the inclusive photon $v_2$ and $v_3$ in Pb-Pb\r\n collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ \r\nTeV in the range $1 < p_T < 5$\r\n GeV/c and discuss implications for the $v_2$ and $v_3$ of \r\ndirect-photons.",

      "Abstract": "The hydrodynamic simulations of the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are very successful in describing these reactions, as it is confirmed by the latest RHIC and LHC data. Hydrodynamic simulation does not only mean a certain algorithm of solving the equations of    relativistic hydrodynamics; it is also based on a specific initial state, specific EoS, and specific freeze out realization. In our opinion, between these elements the least controlled is the initial state. Unfortunately at the moment there is no unambiguous model describing the formation of locally thermalized initial states of energetic heavy ion collisions, and thus, all initial states in use are either completely phenomenological or contain some phenomenological elements. We will argue that, from the very general principles like linear and angular momentum conservation, we can expect to form tilted and rotating initial state. The latter is particularly important for ultra-high LHC energies. The key question we address is what are the observable consequences of such a tilted and rotating initial state? For detailed calculations we use an initial states generated by the Effective String Rope model [1] for RHIC and LHC heavy ion reactions; which we also compare with results of the other models intending to calculate such initial states. \r\n\r\n[1] Magas, Csernai, Strottman, Phys.

      "Abstract": "Jet quenching in heavy ion collisions is considered to be one of the important tools to study the QGP properties at RHIC and LHC. However, at present there are several competing models to describe the jet energy loss processes in heavy ion collisions, and current heavy ion data cannot clearly discriminate between them, thus the interpretation of QGP data is very model dependent. High energy p+A collisions may provide control of various cold nuclear matter effects, and with the proper kinematics, provide a clear determination and calibration of various parton energy loss models, thereby helping to improve the calculations for A+A. Past efforts to extract the effects of parton energy loss in p+A resulted in a large uncertainty due to ambiguities from competing effects, such as parton shadowing.  \r\n\r\nE906/SeaQuest is a new fixed-target dimuon experiment using 120 GeV proton beams from the Fermilab main injector. E906 measures J/Psi and Drell-Yan production in the dimuon channel in p+p and p+A collisions over a wide range of xF, and employs fixed targets of D, C, Fe, and W. The kinematic coverage is ideal for parton energy loss studies for 20~60 GeV “incoming” quarks, and shadowing effects are expected to be minimal. E906 had its first engineering run in early 2012 and successfully observed the J/Psi mass peak in the dimuon channel. E906 is currently taking high statistics data since the beginning of this year. We expect the new data will help clarify the nature of parton energy loss in the nuclear medium. In this talk, we will briefly review the latest progress in parton energy loss study in p(d)+A collisions and present the current status and the prospects from the E906/SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab.",

For this purpose, it is crucial to understand the background - soft photons produced in elementary collisions. Low theorem states that soft photon production in hadron collisions is dominated by Bremsstrahlung off charged initial and final state hadrons. Surprisingly, almost every experiment observed an enhancement (by a factor of $2\\div 5$) above Low theorem's prediction. This is the longstanding puzzle of \"anomalous soft photon production.\" The phenomenon is not observed in processes with leptonic final states, which suggests that the mechanism is due to nonperturbative QCD evolution. We study this phenomenon using an exactly soluble, massless, Abelian model in $1+1$ dimensions which shares with QCD many important properties: confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, axial anomaly and $\\theta$-vacuum. We then apply this model to the soft photon production in the fragmentation of jets produced in $Z^0$ decays and find a qualitative agreement with the data.",

As holographic calculations cannot directly describe QCD, importantly neglecting any weak-coupling effects, it is an interesting question how well these studies fit experimental data. Here, we will focus on longitudinal dynamics, modeled by colliding shock waves in AdS.\r\n\r\nThese collisions give a surprisingly universal rapidity profile, where the shape at high collision energies is completely independent of the energy or longitudinal structure of the colliding shocks. It is somewhat complicated to compare this initial profile to the final measured rapidity profile, but we can compute the entropy and thereby make an estimate of the total multiplicity. The result indicates that our infinite coupling profile has somewhat more stopping than in real heavy-ion collisions, which is most likely because of neglecting weak-coupling effects.

      "Abstract": "In this report, we consider an energy dissipation model for multiparticle production in heavy-ion collisions. The model considers the energy of a collision to be transformed into the produced particles as effective energy of participants, which drives the particle-production process. Within this model, we describe the dependencies of the two key observables, namely the midrapidity charged-particle density and the midrapidity transverse energy, on the center-of-mass energy and on the number of participating nucleons. These dependencies are of great importance in understanding the dynamics of multiparticle production in heavy-ion collisions. The model combines the constituent quark picture of participants (quarks or nucleons) together with the Landau relativistic hydrodynamics [1] and is found to successfully relate the particle production in hadronic and in central nuclear interactions [2]. A good agreement with the available measurements up to the LHC energies is demonstrated clarifying the underlying dynamics of the particle production process in heavy-ion collisions. A detailed study of the bulk observables in the framework of the constituent quark energy dissipation model considered is presented. Predictions are made on the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy density for the collision energies where experimental data are not available.\r\nReferences:\r\n1. L.D. Landau, Izv.

      "Abstract": "Within a multiphase transport model, several experimental observables related to reconstructed jets, including the transverse momentum imbalance for photon-jet, transverse momentum asymmetry for dijet, jet fragmentation function, jet shape, and jet flow, are investigated in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. Because the imbalance ratio between photon and jet is sensitive to both production position and passing direction of photon, it could enable a detail tomographic study on the hot partonic medium by selecting different imbalance ratio ranges [1]. Dijet asymmetry evolution functions disclose that final dijet asymmetry is driven by both initial dijet asymmetry and partonic jet energy loss [2]. The measured jet fragmentation function in Pb+Pb collisions is decomposed into two parts from jet fragmentation and coalescence, which indicates a competition between the two jet hadronization mechanisms that dominate different $\\xi$=ln(1/$z$) ranges and different centrality bins [3]. The subleading jet shape displays a larger medium modification than the leading jet shape, especially in more central Pb+Pb collisions with a larger dijet asymmetry [4]. Azimuthal anisotropies (or flows) of jets ($v_2$ and $v_3$) are sensitive to the geometry asymmetry of initial partonic distribution, which is consistent with a path-length dependence of jet energy loss in the QGP [5]. All these results support that jets lose much energy owing to the strong interactions between jets and a hot partonic medium. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1]Guo-Liang Ma, Phys. Lett.

      "Abstract": "In the early stage of relativistic heavy ion collisions a strong coherent gluonic field could form. This phenomenon is usually described by the string model and it became the basis of successful Monte Carlo event generators. The usual string picture can be connected to an assumption of a static homogeneous gluonic field. On the other hand during the collision one expects large inhomogeneities of the gluonic field in space-time. With the help of the relativistic Wigner function formalism one can describe the phase-space evolution of pair production in such fields. Our model of fermion-pair production indicates that not only the time variation plays an important role and has strong influence on the transverse momentum spectra of the newly produced particles, but the space inhomogeneities could completely change the interpretation of the string picture. As a result we demonstrate that most of the new particles are not produced in the bulk, scaling with the volume, instead one finds a scaling with $\\propto V ^{\\frac{2}{3}}$, in accordance with the early prediction of Heisenberg.",

The technical challenges to meet are a high granularity matching the high track densities, a fast self-triggering read-out coping interaction rates up to 10 MHz, and a low mass to yield high momentum resolution. \r\nWe introduce the concept of the STS, being comprised of eight tracking stations employing double-sided silicon microstrip sensors on modular structures that keep the read-out electronics outside the physics aperture. The detector system acceptance covers polar angles between 2.5 and 25 degrees and will be operated in the 1 T field of a super conducting dipole magnet. The performance of the STS with respect to hit finding, track reconstruction and momentum resolution are shown based on simulation studies using a realistic geometry and detector response based on the evolving engineering and prototyping effort.",

      "Abstract": "As a consequence of the melting of quarkonia due to the color Debye screening in a hot medium, suppression of quarkonium yields is expected to be observed in the quark gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC. In fact, suppression of the $J/\\Psi$ yield has already been observed both at RHIC and LHC and thus theoretical understanding of charmonium properties at high temperature is important to explain experimental results. Moreover, recently, sequential $\\Upsilon$ suppression at LHC has been reported by the CMS collaboration [1], which inspires theoretical interest of in-medium bottomonium behavior. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we report our lattice QCD study on quarkonium properties at finite temperature, which extends our previous study [2] with a couple of lattice spacings toward the continuum limit. Similarly to a previous charmonium study [3], we perform numerical simulations on large and fine isotropic lattices by using quenched gauge field configurations. To investigate differences between charmonium and bottomonium states, we vary the quark masses in the range between the charm and bottom masses. Spatial and temporal meson correlation functions are computed at temperatures in a range from 0.8$T_c$ to 1.6$T_c$ at both vanishing and finite momenta. We will discuss the temperature and quark mass dependence of the screening masses and the change and dissociation of various quarkonium states in the QGP. The spectral properties obtained in this study also provide information on a transport coefficient, the heavy quark diffusion coefficient, and its temperature and mass dependence.\r\n\r\n[1]S.

In these collisions a large number of particles of different types is produced. Current understanding of such collisions suggest that the production of a QGP phase in relativistic heavy ion collisions could produce significant event-by-event correlations and fluctuations in transverse momentum, multiplicity, etc. Therefore it is important to analyze ﬂuctuations of multiplicities (net-protons, net-strangeness, total protons) for different energies and centralities and search for anomalous behaviour due to a phase transition. The multiplicity distributions of different types of particles produced in simulated Au+Au collisions using different theoretical models at energies ranging from 2 – 200 AGeV were analyzed and the moments of the distributions were calculated. Model results can be used to provide a baseline for the phase transition and QCD critical point search.

The main goal is a hadron collider with a centre-of-mass energy of the order of 100 TeV for pp collisions in a new 80-100 km tunnel in the Geneva area. The target start of operation would be 2035-40.\r\n\r\nOperating such machine with heavy ions is an option that is being considered in the accelerator design studies. It would provide, for example, Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=39$ and 63 TeV, respectively, with monthly integrated luminosities of the order of 5-10/nb.\r\n\r\nWe will present first ideas on the physics opportunities with heavy ions at the FCC. \r\n\r\nThe Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 39~TeV is expected to have initial temperature and energy density substantially larger than at LHC energy, a stronger flow field and freeze-out volume twice as large. The larger temperature could entail novel features, like changes in the quarkonium spectrum and abundant in-medium production of charm quarks. The latter could determine an increase in the number of degrees of freedom (from 3 to 4 quark flavours).\r\nThe larger energy and luminosities will make new, rarer, hard probes available (like top quarks and $Z+Jets$), which could give access to the time-evolution of the medium properties, e.g. of its opacity.\r\n\r\nIn the sector of small-$x$ and saturation physics, the increase in centre-of-mass energy of a factor seven with respect to the LHC will extend the kinematic coverage in $x$ and $Q^2$, providing, with pA and $\\gamma$A (ultra-peripheral collisions), access to the saturation region down to $x< 10^{-6}$ with perturbative probes like heavy quarks and quarkonia.\r\n\r\nHigh-density or collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and pA events could become more dramatic, with the increase of energy and high-multiplicity reach.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for electroweak physics studies in UPC gamma-gamma collisions, as well as the impact of heavy-ion data at the FCC for ultra-high energy cosmic-ray physics, will also be summarized.",

      "Abstract": "It has been known for a long time that neutral-pions dominantly decay into two photons, \r\nwhich was subsequently understood on a robust theoretical basis after the discovery of chiral anomaly. \r\nA theorem shown in a seminal paper by Adler and Bardeen [1] indicates \r\nthat a neutral pion is coupled to only two-photon states without couplings to other multi-photon states. \r\nWhen chiral anomaly is tied to extremely strong magnetic fields created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], \r\nwe find \r\nthat transition between a neutral pion and a photon becomes possible \r\nwith one of the two photons replaced by an external magnetic field. \r\nThe theorem allows us to obtain the transition amplitude governed by chiral anomaly without theoretical ambiguities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe discuss attainable signatures of the anomaly-induced transition \r\nbetween neutral pions and photons in RHIC and LHC experiments. \r\nAlthough the magnetic fields persist for $1\\, {\\rm fm}/{\\it c}$ or even shorter duration \r\nafter the heavy ion collisions, \r\nwe still find a photon source having much chance to interact with the magnetic field, \r\nthat is, the prompt photon emitted just at the impacts of the collisions. \r\nWhile the prompt real photons propagate in the magnetic field, \r\na part of the photons is converted into neutral pions, leaving an reduced amount of photons. \r\nThen, we show that the prompt photons to be measured in the experiments \r\nshould have a negative $v_2$ and particular polarizations [3], \r\nsince the transition amplitude is azimuthally anisotropic and depends on the photon polarizations \r\ndue to a preferred orientation prescribed by the external magnetic fields. \r\nWe propose that analyses on those observables should be performed in the future experiments, \r\nwhich makes the creation of the strong magnetic fields evident, \r\nwhile major attention has been conventionally paid to the total yield of prompt photons. \r\nWe take into account the time dependence of the magnetic fields, \r\nand show the beam energy and impact parameter dependences of \r\nthe photon's $v_2$ and polarizations. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis work will provide impacts on elucidating formation of the prompt-photon spectrum \r\nas a penetrating probe from the very early stage, \r\nand thus shed light on an aspect of the early-time dynamics in the heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\n 1.

The CMS experiment currently uses a combinatorial track-following method for both proton and heavy-ion collisions. In this poster we explore the possibility of using the Hough transform method in heavy ions. Such a method may improve the timing of the track reconstruction, particular for tracks with large impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex.",

Detected trough their leptonic decay\r\nchannels, they provide constraints on the nuclear parton distribution functions (PDF).  In\r\nparticular the W boson proves a unique constraint on the sea quark distributions.\r\nWe report on CMS measurements of weak boson production in pp, pPb and PbPb.  Particular emphasis\r\nis place on measurements of the 35 nb$^{-1}$ of pPb data collected at the beginning of 2013.  \r\nThis provides access to a Bjorken x region, $10^{-3}$ -- 1, which is lacking precision\r\nexperimental measurements needed by nuclear PDF parametrizations.\r\nThe Z boson nuclear modification factors as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity will\r\nbe shown, together with forward to backward ratios. The W boson yields, charge asymmetries, and\r\nforward to backward ratios in pPb collisions will also be reported.  With a production cross\r\nsection an order of magnitude larger than the Z, the W allows precise comparisons to theoretical\r\npredictions.  Comparisons to PDFs are made for both Z and W measurements",

      "Abstract": "Lepton pairs emerging from decays of virtual photons represent promising probes of matter under extreme conditions. In the energy domain of 1 - 2 GeV per nucleon, the HADES experiment at GSI Helmholtzzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt studies di-electrons and strangeness production in various reactions, i.e.\r\ncollisions of pions, protons, deuterons and heavy-ions with nuclei. An accurate determination of the medium radiation depends on a precise knowledge of the underlying hadronic cocktail composed of various sources contributing to the net spectra.\r\nTherefore, a measurement of the neutral meson yields together with the dileptons is crucial. In this contribution, the capability of HADES to detect $e^+e^-$ pairs from conversions of real photons will be demonstrated. We will present results from a two-photon analysis of Au+Au collisions at 1.23 GeV/u providing information on neutral $\\pi^{0}$ mesons.\r\nSupported by BMBF (06FY9100I and 06FY7114), HIC for FAIR, EMMI, GSI, HGS-Hire and H-QM",

      "Abstract": "A Muon detection system is under development for the CBM experiment at the upcoming FAIR facility at GSI. By measuring muon pairs from the decay of low-mass vector mesons and charmonium, the Muon Chamber system (MUCH) will substantially contribute to the exploration of the QCD phase diagram at large baryon chemical potentials. The research program includes the search for de-confinement and chiral phase transitions, and for new phases of strongly interacting matter.\r\n\r\nThe MUCH subsystem is based on a novel concept of segmented absorbers with varying thickness and detector layers sandwiched between them. Detailed simulations have been performed to optimize the material, the thickness and the position of the absorbers, and the granularity of the detectors. The design goal is to simultaneously identify both high and low momentum muons over the full phase space.\r\n\r\nA combination of large size GEM chambers and straw tubes will form the tracking detector system in MUCH. The detectors will be read out in a self-triggered mode to handle unprecedented high interaction rates of 10 MHz. Several prototype detectors have been built and tested successfully with X-rays and particle beams using a self-triggering readout electronics. Results of the feasibility studies and of the detector development will be presented.",
