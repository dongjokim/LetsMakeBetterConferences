      "Abstract": "We train a deep convolutional neural network to predict hydrodynamic results for flow coefficients, average $p_T$ and charged particle multiplicities in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions from the initial energy density profiles event-by-event [1]. We show that the network can be trained accurately enough so that it can reliably predict the hydrodynamic results for the flow coefficients and, remarkably, also their correlations like normalized symmetric cumulants, mixed harmonic cumulants and flow-$p_T$ correlations. At the same time the required computational time decreases by several orders of magnitude. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural network, we train it using 5k hydro events, and validate it using 90k events per collision energy. The events are computed from the pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics -based EKRT framework supplemented with a dynamical decoupling condition that improves the description of peripheral collisions [2]. We then generate 10M events using neural network and show that increasing the number of events from 90k to 10M can have significant effects on certain statistics-expensive flow correlations. Neural networks will therefore enable adding statistics-expensive flow correlations to the global Bayesian analysis with a fraction of computation time compared to the current state-of-the-art procedures [3].\r\n$ $\r\n[1] H.

      "Abstract": "The coherent description of nuclear matter properties at high baryon densities is of utmost importance. The limited number of experimental references in the region of the phase diagram corresponding to Neutron Stars (NS) and NS mergers poses major challenges for constructing a universal Equation of State. The matter created in heavy-ion collisions at the HADES experiment can be characterized by similar thermodynamic quantities as NS mergers, thus becoming an essential reference for the studies of these compact stellar objects [1]. Understanding the properties of the newly created matter , such as the strong interaction between hadrons or the presence of bound states, provides substantial insight for such investigation.\r\n\r\nOne of the methods applied in these studies is femtoscopic correlations (FC). It is a unique tool for the determination of the interactions between hadrons and searching for possible nuclear matter exotic states. Nonetheless, FC is found to be sensitive to variations of EoS, which makes it a valuable reference for its studies. \r\nThis poster will present the newest results on the proton-cluster (deuteron, triton, and He-3) FC at the HADES experiment showing the presence of unbound ground state Li-4 and excited states of He-4. The interactions between proton and clusters will be discussed as well. This research brings us closer to understanding the essential properties of nuclear matter at higher baryon densities. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] HADES Collaboration: Nature Physics volume 15, pages 1040–1045 (2019)",

      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "While the formation of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions has been confirmed by characteristic patterns of flow measurements, it remains unclear what is the smallest possible collision system that can generate a similar medium exhibiting partonic collectivity. In this talk, we will present the new preliminary results of anisotropic flow in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions that, for the first time, encompass all the data collected by ALICE. The highlights include the flow of charged and identified particles ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, K$^{\\pm}$, p ($\\overline{\\rm {p}}$), K$^0_S$, $\\Lambda$ ($\\overline \\Lambda$), $\\varphi$), correlations and fluctuations of flow vectors and correlations between the mean transverse momentum and flow coefficients, $\\rho(v_n^2,[p_\\mathrm{T}])$. Multiparticle cumulants with the subevent method, ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations with the template fit method, and a novel jet veto approach have been implemented to effectively suppress short-range non-flow contamination.  We compare our results to state-of-the-art theoretical models, which will allow us to study contributions from initial momentum anisotropies to final anisotropic flow, and to understand how anisotropic flow in small collision systems developed from the initial geometry through the dynamic evolution including the understanding of the role of mass and constituent-quark numbers.",

      "Abstract": "With the tremendous accomplishments of RHIC and the LHC experiments and the advent of the future electron-ion collider on the horizon, the quest for compelling evidence of the color glass condensate (CGC) has become one of the most aspiring goals in the high energy quantum chromodynamics research. Pursuing this question requires developing the precision test of the CGC formalism. By systematically implementing the threshold resummation, we significantly improve the stability of the next-to-leading-order calculation in CGC for forward rapidity hadron productions in pp and pA collisions, especially in the high pT region, and obtain reliable descriptions of all existing data measured at RHIC and the LHC across all pT regions. Consequently, this technique can pave the way for the precision studies of the CGC next-to-leading-order predictions by confronting them with a large amount of precise data.",

      "Institute": "CCNU",
      "Country": "China",
      "Abstract": "Diffusion wake accompanying jet-induced Mach-cone is a unique feature of jet-medium interaction in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The interaction between the jet and QGP fluid will also deflect partons  associated with the jet from their initial direction. Such deflection depends on the energy of the jet constitutes and the velocity of the flow, leading to an angular intra-jet asymmetry of particle distribution inside the jet. We also study the intra-jet asymmetry and its dependence on jet path length and fluid viscosity in both transverse and longitudinal directions. Our methods can be further used to localize the initial production position of the jet without specified requirements of the jet direction.",

      "Institute": "Department of Atomic Energy (IN)",
      "Country": "India",
      "Abstract": "Measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions, so-called small systems, besides serving as baseline for studying vacuum production and cold-nuclear matter effects, respectively, have recently shown intriguing features. In particular, measurements in high-multiplicity events have revealed striking similarities with heavy-ion collisions, where the formation of a quark-gluon plasma is expected. One of the possible scenarios proposed for describing these findings, which include among others collective effects, is the presence of multiple parton-parton interactions (MPIs). At LHC energies, MPIs affect both the soft component of the event, as well as the hard scales responsible for heavy-quark production. Quarkonium associated production, such as double J/$\\psi$ production in the same event, provides a direct way to study MPIs. Conversely, quarkonium measurements which correlate soft and hard components of the event, such as multiplicity dependent production or azimuthal correlations between quarkonia and hadrons produced in the same event, represent an indirect method to investigate MPIs. In addition, these studies can reveal any other potential underlying mechanisms taking place in the final state, such as possible dissociation effects for loosely bound excited quarkonia. In case of charmonia, the corresponding measurements for the non-prompt component, originating from beauty hadron decays, allows for extending such correlations studies to the open beauty hadron sector.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, new published measurements of double J/$\\psi$ production at forward rapidity, as well as new preliminary multiplicity dependent measurements of non-prompt J/$\\psi$ fractions at midrapidity, in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, will be shown. Recent multiplicity dependent measurements of $\\psi$(2S) and $\\Upsilon$($n$S) states ($n$ = 1,2,3), along with excited-to-ground state ratios,  carried out at forward rapidity in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, will be presented. Furthermore, recently published prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ production at midrapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 8.16, will be discussed. The status of ongoing analyses on J/$\\psi$ production as a function of multiplicity or spherocity at central and forward rapidity, in pp and p--Pb collisions, will also be shown. Results will be compared to available model calculations.",

      "Speaker": "Rishabh  Sharma",
      "Institute": "Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The formation of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions can be explained by two models: the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model proposes that light nuclei originate from a thermal source where they are in equilibrium with other particles in the fireball. However, due to their low binding energies, the formed nuclei are unlikely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. In contrast, the coalescence model suggests that light nuclei are formed later in time by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-stage coalescence of nucleons would lead to the mass number scaling, where the anisotropic flow of light nuclei scaled by their mass numbers follows closely the anisotropic flow of nucleons. Therefore, comparing the anisotropic flow of light nuclei with protons will help us experimentally test the coalescence model hypothesis. Moreover, compared to elliptic flow ($v_2$), triangular flow ($v_3$) of light nuclei has a better sensitivity to the fluctuating initial conditions as well as the properties of the created systems. This information will provide us with  tighter constraints on the theoretical models that describe the production mechanism of light nuclei.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present the transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of $d$, $t$, and $^3$He, as well as their corresponding antinuclei, in Au+Au collisions at energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ -- 54.4 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR. We will discuss the mass number scaling study of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of light nuclei in the BES-II energies. Additionally, we will compare the experimental results with model calculations that use specific initial conditions and/or nucleon coalescence.",

      "Speaker": "Neelima Agrawal",
      "Institute": "Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Hadronic resonances have typical lifetimes that are comparable to that of the hadron gas phase created in the late stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. Therefore, a significant fraction of resonances decays inside a high-density medium and their decay daughters may rescatter with other hadrons destroying their initial kinematic correlations. A competing effect is resonance regeneration via pseudo-elastic interactions of hadrons. The interplay between these effects, which may modify the measured yields and transverse-momentum spectra of hadronic resonances, can be studied by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived particle as a function of the hadronic lifetime, i.e. charged-particle multiplicity. In addition, measurements of the differential yields of resonances with different masses, quark content, and quantum numbers help in understanding particle production mechanisms, strangeness production, and parton energy loss.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, recent measurements of hadronic resonances in Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions as a function of multiplicity will be presented. Collisions between Xe nuclei provide the ultimate test for validating the picture of the smooth evolution of hadronic rescattering across different collision systems by filling the gap between p--Pb and Pb--Pb multiplicities. Furthermore, the measured resonance yields in Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb collisions are used as an experimental input in a partial chemical equilibrium-based thermal model to constrain the kinetic freeze-out temperature. This is a novel procedure that is independent of assumptions on the flow velocity profile and the freeze-out hypersurface.",

Taken together, these measurements constrain models of the collision-energy and centrality-dependence of charged particle production, and also shed light on the initial collision geometry and importance of event-by-event fluctuations. These data are compared to similar measurements at different energies, including PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ and xenon-xenon collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.44$~TeV.",

We present an analytical calculation of the medium-modified 2-point energy correlator of a heavy quark jet determining how the dead-cone is populated by medium-induced radiation. We identify two regimes: the near-massless limit where the deadcone is not affected by the QGP, and the large-mass limit where the in-medium radiation begins to fill the deadcone.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Extensive studies of dijet momentum balance, inclusive jet shapes, and photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions have revealed a significant contribution of low transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) particles to the energy momentum balance of dijet and photon-jets. Effects such as medium-induced radiation and medium response could contribute to the enhancement of low-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ particles. In this presentation, we utilize the Z boson reconstructed within the dimuon channel, which does not interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout the decay chain before interacting with the detector. Moreover, Z bosons are high precision probes, and their reconstruction does not introduce bias into the underlying event distribution near them, unlike the isolation requirement of photons. This feature enables the selection of a single quark-enriched high-$p_\\mathrm{T}$ parton and study the modification of the underlying events associated with this probe. We present the first measurement of the Z boson-tagged underlying event spectra over a large acceptance with respect to the Z boson, using lead-lead data recorded by the CMS detector at 5.02 TeV. This new result can provide an unambiguous signal of the medium-recoil effect, and it could be sensitive to the equation of state and the speed of sound of the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are valuable probes for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are mainly produced through hard-scattering processes prior to the formation of the QGP, and their number is conserved during the subsequent QGP evolution. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ of charm and beauty hadrons allow the characterisation of the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks while traversing the QGP. Information on their diffusion and degree of participation in the medium collective motion can be obtained by measuring the elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$ of heavy-flavour particles. Complementary insights into heavy-quark fragmentation and energy redistribution can be obtained by measuring angular correlations involving heavy-flavour particles.\r\nIn this contribution, the newly published results on the non-prompt $v_2$ coefficient of D$^0$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be shown and compared to measurements of prompt D-meson $v_2$ in the same system. These will be supplemented by recent results of the $v_2$ of heavy-flavour decay muons in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, providing new insights into possible collective effects in smaller systems.

New Pb-Pb results of angular correlations of heavy-flavour decay electrons with charged particles in the same collision system will also be discussed. In view of a better understanding of the in-medium heavy-quark dynamics, the reported ALICE measurements will be compared to predictions from models including different implementations of heavy-quark interaction and hadronisation with the QGP constituents.",

      "Abstract": "Charmonia have long been recognized as a valuable probe of the nuclear matter in extreme conditions, such as the strongly interacting medium created in heavy-ion collisions and known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). At LHC energies, the regeneration process due to the abundantly produced charm quarks, was found to considerably affect measured charmonium observables. Comprehensive production measurements of charmonia, including both ground and excited states, are crucial to discriminate among different regeneration scenarios assumed in theoretical calculations. Charmonia can also be sensitive to the initial state of the heavy-ion collision. In particular, their spin-alignment can be affected by the strong magnetic field generated in the early phase, as well as by the large angular momentum of the medium in non-central collisions. The determination of the component originating from beauty hadron decays, known as non-prompt charmonium, grants a direct insight into the nuclear modification factor of beauty hadrons, which is expected to be sensitive to the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. Furthermore, once it is subtracted from the inclusive charmonium production, it allows for a direct comparison with prompt charmonium models. \r\n\r\nIn this contribution, newly published results of inclusive J/$\\psi$ production, including yields, average transverse momentum and nuclear modification factors, obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, will be presented.

This enables a comprehensive prediction of fragmentation fractions of weakly decaying bottom hadrons for the first time and a satisfactory explanation of the existing measurements in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Utilizing the bottom hadro-chemistry thus obtained as the baseline, we then perform transport simulations of bottom quarks in the hot QCD matter created in PbPb collisions at the LHC energy and calculate the pertinent bottom-hadron observables. We highlight the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependent enhancement of the ratios (relative to their $pp$ counterparts) between different species of bottom hadrons ($\\bar{B}_s^0/B^-$, $\\Lambda_b^0/B^-$ and $\\Xi_b^{0-}/B^-$) as a result of bottom quark diffusion and hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).\r\n\r\nReference: Min He and Ralf Rapp, arXiv: 2209.13419",

      "Abstract": "Directed and elliptic flow ($v_{1}$, $v_{2}$) are sensitive to the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at the early stage of the system evolution and the equation of state (EoS) of the medium. The $v_1$ slope ($dv_1/dy$) at mid-rapidity of net-baryons is expected to be sensitive to the first-order phase transition. Also, triangular flow ($v_3$) provides valuable information on the initial geometry fluctuations and transport properties of the medium. Studying these flow harmonics for various identified particles at different energies provides insights into the medium going through QCD phase transition. In particular, (multi-) strange hadrons with small hadronic cross-sections are cleaner probes of the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive study of light and (multi-) strange hadrons provides valuable insights into the subsequent stages of the medium evolution.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the measurements of $v_1$, $v_2$,  and $v_3$ for both light and (multi-) strange hadrons at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, utilizing the enhanced capabilities of the STAR detectors and datasets with increased statistics from the second phase of the RHIC beam energy scan (BES-II) program, will be presented. The centrality dependence of anisotropic flow and the test of number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling will be shown. Also, the energy and centrality dependence of $v_1$ slope and $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ will be discussed. The data will be compared with different model calculations, and the inferences on the QCD phase structure and EoS of nuclear matter in the high baryon density region will be discussed.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) [1,2] is an essential link between measured event-by-event fluctuations and their grand canonical theoretical predictions such as lattice QCD. The method allows quantifying the global conservation law effects in fluctuations. In its basic formulation, SAM requires a sufficiently large system such as created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions and sufficient space-momentum correlations. Directly in the spinodal region of the First Order Phase Transition (FOPT) different approximations should be used that account for finite size effects. Thus, we present the generalization of SAM applicable in both the pure phases, metastable and unstable regions of the phase diagram [3]. Obtained analytic formulas indicate the enhancement of fluctuations due to crossing the spinodal region of FOPT and are tested using molecular dynamics simulations. A rather good agreement is observed. Using transport model calculations with interaction potential we show that the spinodal enhancement of fluctuations survives till the later stages of collision via the memory effect [4]. However, at low collision energies the space-momentum correlation is not strong enough for this signal to be transferred to second and third order cumulants measured in momentum subspace.  This result agrees well with recent HADES data on proton number fluctuations at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV which are found to be consistent with the binomial baseline of non-interacting hadrons [5].  It indicates that the large fluctuations observed in HADES data do not signal the presence of phase transition and their origin is yet to be identified. We suggest a crosscheck of this picture based on calculating the correlation between proton multiplicities in two non-overlapping rapidity intervals.\r\n\r\n[1] V.Vovchenko, O.Savchuk, R.P., M.I.Gorenstein, V.Koch, Phys.Lett.B 811 (2020) 024908.\r\n[2] R.P. et al., Phys.

Due to their prompt\r\ndecay via weak interactions, strange quarks and antiquarks are not present in\r\nnormal matter and can only be produced via strong interactions within the\r\nQGP. As the mass of strange quarks and antiquarks is close to the temperature\r\nat which protons, neutrons, and other hadrons dissolve into quarks, they serve\r\nas sensitive probes for studying the conditions, structure, and evolution of the\r\ndeconfined state of matter.\r\nThe current work will compare the properties of different strange particles,\r\nincluding Λ, Ξ, and Ω in heavy-ion collisions at varying centralities, using two\r\nmodels for simulating these collisions: the AMPT and UrQMD models, by com-\r\nparing the yield and the baryon-to- antibaryon ratio of these particles at different\r\ncentralities at √sN N = 14.6 GeV from the two models, we can better under-\r\nstand the properties of the QGP medium and gain insight into the differences\r\nand similarities between the two simulation models.

Recent studies have demonstrated that entanglement in the initial state could endure the evolution of a strongly coupled system.

      "Abstract": "We present the first results for dielectron anisotropic flow computed directly from hadronic transport in different systems, and explore the different calculation methods. Because leptons are insensitive to the strong interaction, they are mostly undisturbed by the hadronic medium created after a heavy-ion collision, and therefore serve as direct probes for it. In particular, the HADES experiment at GSI measures flow of dielectrons using the reaction plane method, which can lead to large systematic uncertainties. At the low beam energies of GSI, the evolution is mainly off-equilibrium, and hadronic transport provides an appropriate description and gives access to the full phase space, as well as knowledge on the dilepton origin, being a useful tool in studying the mechanisms behind flow generation from this off-equilibrium hadron resonance gas.",

The evolution of the QGP is described by hydrodynamic simulations in (2+1) dimensions with temperature-dependent shear viscosity taken into account [1,2]. The temperature and time evolution of the charm quark number obtained in the above-described scenario is further juxtaposed to the results acquired from ideal QGP obeying Bjorken flow. We observe a suppression of charm quark production in the absence of shear viscosity and transverse expansion [3].

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Multiple evidence reveals that the vast majority of the matter content of the universe is non baryonic and electrically neutral. This component is usually called Dark Matter (DM), for its lack of electromagnetic interactions, and is measured to constitute about 25% of the energy density of the Universe. The most common hypothesis is that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles, supposed to be cold thermal relics of the Big-Bang.\r\nThe indirect detection of DM is based on the search of the products of DM annihilation or decay. They should appear as distortions in the gamma ray spectra or in anomalies in the rare Cosmic Ray (CR) components. In particular, antimatter components, like antiprotons, antideuterons and positrons, promise to provide sensitivity to DM annihilation on top of the standard astrophysical production.\r\nThe interpretation of galactic CR data requires the correct modeling of their source terms and the turbulence spectrum of the galactic magnetic field, in addition to the knowledge of the cross sections that regulate the production of CR interacting with the interstellar medium. \r\nAfter PAMELA detector results, the antiprotons flux has been measured with an accuracy of a few percent by AMS-02 over an energy range from below 1 GeV up to a few hundreds of GeV. However, the only currently measured production cross section is the proton-proton one, while all the reactions involving helium have no laboratory data in the phase space covered by AMS-02 (only LHCb, but with incident proton energy of 6.5 TeV). This requires a scaling of the pp channel to pA interaction through approximation and modeling.\r\nThe AMBER fixed target experiment at the M2 beam line at CERN will contribute to this fundamental DM search, performing a unique and complementary measurement of the double differential antiprotons production cross-section with a proton beam ranging from 60 to 250 GeV/c impinging on a liquid He target.\r\nThe data taking for the experimental determination of the cross-section in p+4He scattering is scheduled for May-June 2023. This result from AMBER will directly pin down the production of anti-protons in the relevant kinematical region covered by AMS-02.",

      "Speaker": "Prabhakar Palni",
      "Institute": "IIT Mandi",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In this contribution, we extend the scope of the JETSCAPE framework  to cover the jet radius ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the Pb-Pb collisions at ${\\sqrt{\\rm s_{NN}}}$= 5.02 TeV for the most-central (0-10%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for inclusive jets to compare with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors in the jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$)  ranging from 100 GeV up to 1 TeV. The results predicted by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes within 10-20\\%. We also calculate the double ratio (${R^{\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\\mathrm{R=small}}_{\\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic multi-stage evolution of the parton shower. The calculations are then performed for low-virtuality-based evolution models like the MARTINI and the AdS/CFT, followed by a rigorous comparison between the former model's predictions and the CMS experiment's measurements.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are produced in hard partonic scatterings at the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions and they experience the whole evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium. Femtoscopic correlations, i.e. two-particle correlations at low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions as well as to the extent of the region from which the correlated particles are emitted. A study of such correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the medium.\r\n        \r\nIn this poster, we will present the first measurement of femtoscopic correlations between $D^0-{\\pi}$,  $D^0-K$, and $D^0-proton$ pairs at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using the data taken in the year 2014 and 2016 by the STAR experiment. $D^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the $K^{-}-{\\pi}^{+}$ decay channel using topological criteria enabled by the Heavy Flavor Tracker with excellent track pointing resolution. We will present the femtoscopic correlation function for $D^0$ transverse momentum above 1 GeV/c in the $0-80\\%$ centrality. We will also compare the experimental results with available theoretical models and discuss physical implications.",

      "Speaker": "Yuki Fujimoto",
      "Institute": "University of Washington",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Large-$N_c$ QCD implies a duality between confined baryons and deconfined quarks at high baryon densities; it is called Quarkyonic matter. We present a model of Quarkyonic matter that is explicitly dual between quarks and baryons. The duality means that the free energy of the matter is expressed in two ways: One is as a functional of the quark distribution function in the momentum space, $f_Q$, and the other as a functional of the baryon distribution function, $f_B$. We then posit the duality relation between $f_Q$ and $f_B$, which describes the binding of quarks into baryons.\r\nWe explicitly construct an analytic solution of this model and show that the theory has two distinct regimes: An ordinary nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at relatively high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, $f_B$ is underoccupied at low momentum and has an enhanced occupation at high momentum, which can be interpreted as that baryons sit on a shell in momentum space on top of a quark Fermi sea. Baryons and quarks do not interact except for the duality relation and the constraint that $f_Q$ and $f_B$ must satisfy $0 \\le f_Q \\le 1$ and $0 \\le f_B \\le 1$. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the sound velocity.",

      "Abstract": "The mass spectrum of hadrons in finite-density QCD matter is believed to reveal the effects of partial chiral symmetry restoration. However, despite the importance of understanding QCD at finite density, decisive evidence linking the mass spectrum and chiral symmetry is still lacking.\r\nThe J-PARC E16 experiment aims to fill this gap with high-statistics measurements of vector mesons ($\\rho$, $\\omega$, $\\phi$) in nuclei. The experiment will measure the momenta of electron-positron pairs from vector meson decays and reconstruct their invariant mass. \r\n\r\nTo obtain large statistics, \r\nwe use a new beamline at J-PARC that provides $30\\,\\rm{GeV}$-proton beams with an intensity of $1 \\times 10^{10}$ protons/spill. \r\nThe maximum hit rate reaches $15\\,\\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ and $5\\,\\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ at two innermost detectors, necessitating an innovative spectrometer for high-rate environments.\r\n\r\nSince the experiment commenced in 2020, three commissioning runs have been conducted\r\n  with a limited number of detectors. \r\nPartial results were reported at QM2022.\r\n  The next run, scheduled for June 2023, aims to improve beam microstructures\r\n  detected in the last run.\r\n  Eight modules of detectors will be operated, as proposed for the first physics run.\r\nIn the commissioning runs so far,  \r\nour detectors were successfully operated under the high-counting environment.\r\nTracking is performed using a layer of the Silicon Strip Detector and three layers of thin gas chambers with different sizes, all employing the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM).\r\nCalibration is ongoing, but the current tracking resolution is sufficient to observe changes in the mass spectrum of vector mesons.\r\nFor the $\\phi$ mesons, we anticipate a mass resolution of $5.8\\,\\rm{MeV/c^2}$, while a mass change of $35\\,\\rm{MeV/c^2}$ was observed in the preceding experiment, KEK-PS E325.\r\nElectron identification is carried out using the Hadron Blind Detector and the Lead Glass Calorimeter installed outside the trackers. \r\nWe achieved electron efficiency and pion rejection power consistent with the design values, at $57\\%$ and  $99.97\\%$ , respectively.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will report the result of the run in June, including the detector performance\r\n  and improvement of the beam microstructure, and discuss\r\n the anticipated outcomes for the physics run planned in 2024. \r\n In the physics run, we aim to collect 15000 phi mesons, representing six-fold\r\nimprovement compared to the KEK-PS E325 experiment.",

      "Abstract": "The sequential clustering of particles into jets offers an algorithmic connection of hadrons to the partons of the radiation shower. Jet substructure allows us to access the radiation history of a jet thereby providing a useful avenue to probe QCD through different energy scales. The N-point Energy Correlator (ENC) is a recently proposed observable that highlights this feature of jets as a multi-scale object. The evolution of jets from the perturbative (partonic) to non-perturbative (hadronic) regimes is imprinted in the slopes of the ENC. Experimentally, the ENC is defined as the energy-weighted cross-section of N particles in a jet as a function of their angular separation. This makes the ALICE detector suitable for these measurements due to its excellent momentum and track resolution. Theoretical calculations have shown excellent agreement with the recent measurement of the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in jets at ALICE $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in p-p as well as in jets at STAR $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in p-p.  Extending the EEC to the three-point correlator (EEEC) is the first step in extending the scaling information of the energy flow to a shape dependence. An intermediate step to achieving this goal is measuring the projected EEEC (E3C) which retains information about the largest angular scale of the correlation. The motivation to study the E3C is two-fold i) It has been shown theoretically that the projected E3C operators encode the same scaling information as the full E3C, a highly non-trivial property of this observable. ii) Taking ratios of the projected E3C with the EEC may enable us to better access perturbative QCD since it is known that the EECs are not immune to hadronization effects. Moreover, these ratios may offer precision tests of the coupling strength of the strong force, $\\alpha_S$. In this poster, we will show the progress towards the first preliminary measurements of the projected E3C with ALICE at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13 TeV in p-p. We will also present simulation studies that extend these measurements to heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we will show the sensitivity of ENCs in jets to the heavy-ion background to motivate further measurements in the quark-gluon plasma.",

      "Abstract": "Previous applications of machine learning to jet background subtraction have shown improvements over the traditional background subtraction methods, especially at low jet momentum. While machine learning applications generally lead to improvements, care must be taken to ensure they are not at the cost of interpretability and bias from models used for training. We present a novel application of symbolic regression to extract a functional representation of a deep neural network trained to subtract background for measurements of jets. With this functional representation we show that the relationship learned by a neural network is approximately the same as a new background subtraction method using the particle multiplicity in a jet. This multiplicity method uses measured features, rather than learned weights, to achieve most of the improvements demonstrated by the deep neural network. Additionally, we show the algorithmic complexity of the deep neural network can be decreased by reducing it to a shallower representation while still achieving similar performance. Our study demonstrates that interpretable machine learning methods can provide insights into underlying physical processes and achieve the performance of black-box machine learning without the opaqueness and model bias.",

The ratio,$\\eta/\\pi^{0}$ exhibits universal behavior regardless of collision system, energy, and centrality in high $p_{T}$ from the analysis of world data. However, associated measurements have been inconclusive in low $p_{T}$. Possible deviations from the universal behavior could be owing to the rapid radial hydrodynamic expansion of the $A+A$ collision system.

In this analysis, we compare angular distributions of in-cone radiation across various medium profiles with effective scaling laws. Our findings indicate that the out-of-cone loss of energy occurs through the radiative break-up of hard fragments, which is followed by an angular broadening of soft fragments. Although the broadening of the leading fragments is substantially impacted by the dilution of the medium caused by expansion, we find that in the low-x range, which is accountable for the majority of gluon multiplicity in the cascade, the angular distributions are almost identical when comparing different medium profiles. This similarity is primarily because multiple splittings play a dominant role in broadening within this range. Lastly, we examine how our findings influence the phenomenological explanation of jet quenching and out-of-cone radiation.",

Model calculations have also predicted that directed flow could be sensitive to the softening of EoS associated with a first order phase transition. Directed flow of protons and anti-protons are also of interest as they offer sensitivity to both the contributions from the transported quarks and the component generated by medium interactions at the later stage. Measurements of proton and net proton directed flow from BES-I have shown that there is a non-monotonous dependence on collision energy. \r\nIn this poster, We will present measurements of the directed flow of protons and antiprotons from 19.6, 14.5, 11.5, 9.2, and 7.7 GeV Au+Au collisions, using high statistics BES-II data from STAR. We will also present a decomposition of proton directed flow into a medium interaction generated component and a component (v1excess) attributed to transported protons. The v1excess component is found to show a simple scaling between collision energies of 200 GeV to ~10 GeV, but to break the scaling at energies below that. The new results have significantly reduced uncertainties and also allow differential measurements in centrality and transverse momentum. Results will be compared to different model calculations and implications to the understanding of the QCD phase structure and EoS of the medium will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "The AdS/CFT correspondence, which connects strongly coupled conformal field theories in $N$ dimensions to gravity in $N+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, has provided valuable insights into the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. Soft-wall AdS/QCD is a phenomenological model that uses a dilaton field to introduce confinement, while a scalar field is dual to the chiral condensate. The thermodynamics of the deconfined state are introduced using an asymptotically AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole, which includes both temperature and baryon chemical potential. Minimal models of this type yield a chiral phase transition that is not affected by the chemical potential, and thus lack a critical point.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we investigate the chiral phase transition in an AdS/QCD action that includes a coupling between the scalar and dilaton fields. Our results reveal that the scalar-dilaton coupling produces a rich phase structure, with the emergence of a critical point at finite temperature and density. The location and presence of the critical point is found to be highly sensitive to the strength of the scalar-dilaton coupling. We present results for both 3-flavor symmetric and 2+1 flavor cases. This work provides a foundation for future phenomenological applications, as well as dynamical models, which solve the scalar and dilaton fields using the gravitational equations of motion.",

Here we update our hadron resonance list to the PDG 2021 including all $*~–****~$ states and make direct comparisons to lattice QCD susceptibilities and partial pressures where an improvement is seen since recently-observed particles have been included in the strange baryonic sector.  Additionally, we reanalyze thermal models with this new list and extract the freeze-out temperatures.  A next crucial step is to reformat our list to be compatible with SMASH such that hydrodynamic simulations can use the latest PDG list as well [1]. Before this change, SMASH has approximately half of the resonances included in the PDG 2021 list.  To include these new states in SMASH we have rewritten the list that contains $1\\to3$ and $1\\to4$ body decays to include only $1\\to2$ body decays and study this change on the particle spectra and mean transverse momentum.

However, as the QGP hadronizes it will evolve through a hadronic phase with rapidly increasing shear viscosity. In order to fully characterize the QGP state, one has to separately determine the viscosity of the hadronic phase.  Although many approaches have been used to determine the shear viscosity coefficient and the associated shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\\frac{\\eta}{s}$) in the hadronic phase, much is unknown regarding the bulk viscosity to shear viscosity coefficient ($\\frac{\\zeta}{s})$ in the hadronic phase.  We present preliminary results of a calculation of the bulk viscosity $\\zeta$ and the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\frac{\\zeta}{s}$ for hot hadronic matter.  The Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is used to simulate the hadronic medium and periodic boundary conditions are used to simulate infinite hot equilibriated hadronic matter.  The Green-Kubo formalism is employed and a comparison is made with the results of the bulk viscosity calculation from the Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly Interacting Hadrons (SMASH) model from [1].\r\n[1] J.B Rose et al 2021 J.

      "Abstract": "In 2018, RHIC conducted isobar collisions of $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr nuclei in search for the chiral magnetic effect. As a byproduct, anisotropic flow data were taken, revealing differences between the two systems associated to the nuclear structure of the colliding nuclei. This observation offers an opportunity to bridge low-energy nuclear physics and high-energy collisions. Many recent works have concentrated on using the initial geometry to predict final flow data and see if nuclear shape differences would be visible. In this work, we build upon the results in [1]  and actually run hydrodynamics and study how each phase (free streaming, Landau matching, expansion, hadronic transport) are related to the initial nuclear shapes seen in data. The simulations were performed using the public available X-SCAPE framework, which allows for the integration of different stages of the collision dynamics. We consider five different nuclear configurations, where we continuously change the nuclear shape from the $^{96}_{44}$Ru to $^{96}_{40}$Zr. We also include an additional case to study triaxility effects.\r\n\r\n[1] W. M. Serenone, F. G. Gardim, A. V. Giannini, F. Grassi and K. P.

      "Abstract": "With the advent of the Electron Ion Collider, which will involve many diverse calorimeter systems, and the switch to SiPM readouts which has been occuring over the past ~decade, new techniques in calorimeter calibrations are needed.  These should address for example, gain tracing vs time, where siPM's can be more sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and also position dependencies in response, due to siPM light collection being less uniform than with traditional PMT's. We review several calibrations methods used for calibrating both hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters at RHIC, LHC, and elsewhere, and also explore some possibilities for use at the upcoming EIC Facility. This includes several novel techniques developed for use at RHIC by our group. We will discuss calorimeter systems being planned for the ePIC experiment and specifically how the various methods, including ours, can be used there.",

      "Abstract": "We present a relativistic density functional approach to color superconducting quark matter that mimics quark confinement by a fast growth of the quasiparticle self-energy in the confining region [1]. The approach is shown to be equivalent to a chiral model of quark matter with medium dependent couplings. The approach to the conformal limit at asymptotically high densities is provided by a medium dependence of the vector-isoscalar, vector-isovector and diquark couplings motivated by non-perturbative gluon exchange [2]. While the (pseudo)scalar, vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector sectors of the model are fitted to the mesonic mass spectrum and vacuum phenomenology of QCD, the strength of interaction in the diquark channel is varied in order to obtain the best agreement with the observational constraints from measurements of mass, radius and tidal deformability of neutron stars. These constraints favor an early onset of deconfinement and color superconductivity in neutron stars with masses below one solar mass. We also discuss a new two-zone interpolation scheme for the construction of the hadron-to-quark matter transition [3] that allows to test different structures of the QCD phase diagram with one, two or no critical endpoints in simulations of supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions. We argue that the formation of color-superconducting quark matter drives the trajectories of its evolution in supernovae and neutron star mergers towards the regimes reached in terrestrial experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] O.

      "Abstract": "The method of moments has been employed to derive relativistic fluid-dynamical theories from the Boltzmann equation for the past decades [1]. This approach consists in expanding the single-particle distribution function using a basis of irreducible momenta, where the expansion coefficients are the irreducible moments of the nonequilibrium distribution function [2]. Unlike the Chapman-Enskog method [3], it has the advantage of yielding formulations that might be causal and stable, provided the transport coefficients satisfy certain constraints [4]. However, so far, only the equations of motion for the hydrodynamic moments have been explicitly calculated, with the equations of motion for the moments of rank 3 and 4 being calculated recently, in Ref. [5]. In this contribution, we address this problem by systematically calculating the general equations of motion for all irreducible moments and show how they can be used to solve the Boltzmann equation itself. Since this method of solving the Boltzmann equation does not rely on resolving particle degrees of freedom, it can be used to provide a more consistent description of the freezeout process that does not require a particlization procedure. We investigate this prescription in a Bjorken flow scenario and investigate with detail the transition from a fluid description to a transport one.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] W. Israel and J.

      "Abstract": "Data obtained at RHIC can be reproduced with relativistic viscous hydrodynamic simulations by adjusting the viscosity and initial conditions but it is difficult to disentangle these quantities. It is therefore important to find orthogonal observables to constrain the initial conditions separately from the viscosity. New observables have been measured at the LHC and shown to be sensitive to initial conditions and less to medium properties, specifically factorization breaking ratios appears to be promising. Here we consider two initial condition models, NeXus and TRENTO. While both models yield similar results for the scaled flow harmonic distributions both at the LHC and RHIC, they lead to quantitatively much more different patterns for the factorization breaking ratios at RHIC than at LHC, due to the shorter lifetime. For the same reason, not only final state interactions but also initial free streaming matter in these predictions and differences between these are enhanced at RHIC compared to LHC. Therefore experimental factorization breaking ratios at RHIC top energy would be interesting to get.\r\n\r\nThis presentation is a follow up of arXiv:2105.12792",

Since the resonance lifetime is comparable to that of the hadron gas phase, their yields are affected by the competing rescattering and regeneration effects. These can be studied experimentally by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived hadron as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity, which is directly connected to the lifetime of the hadron gas phase. In this context, the $\\rho^{0}(770)$ resonance is particularly interesting due to its very short lifetime of about 1.3 fm/$c$. The measurement of the $\\rho^{0}(770)$ production yield in low-multiplicity collisions, corresponding to a very short duration of the hadron gas phase, serves as a fundamental reference for measurements in heavy-ion collisions.  \r\n\r\nIn this poster, recent ALICE measurements of the $\\rho^{0}(770)$ production in pp collisions as a function of multiplicity are presented.

      "Abstract": "We investigate how the event-by-event fluctuations of the final-state distribution function of nucleons physically affect the yield ratio of light nuclei based on the coalescence model.\r\n\r\nThe yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N_d^2$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively) [1,2], is one of the observables suggested for a possible signal of the critical point of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Based on the analyses with idealized setups, the yield ratio is known to be sensitive to the two-point neutron correlation and thus to the critical correlations. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions, such as anisotropic flows [3] and the event-by-event fluctuations coming from the initial state.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we establish a qualitative understanding of how event-by-event fluctuations affect the yield ratio [4]. We model the ``single-event'' distribution $f(x,p)$ by a superposition of $n$-Gaussian hot spots in phase space and randomize the positions and magnitudes of the hot spots from event to event. We obtain analytical formulae for the yields of light nuclei and related ratios under this setup. We investigate how each feature of the event-by-event distribution affects the yield ratio. We find that the event-by-event fluctuations increase the yield ratio, where the value takes maximum at a particular hot-spot number $n$ depending on the fireball size. We also discuss the scale separation between the critical correlations and short-range thermal fluctuations using two different sizes of hot spots. The scale of critical correlations is bounded by the finite spacetime size of the fireball. We find that the effect in the yield ratio becomes larger for larger separation of hot-spot sizes. These understandings of the yield ratio will be important in analyzing the results of future realistic analyses based on state-of-the-art dynamical models.\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n[1] K. J. Sun, L.

The latter resums an infinite series of ladder diagrams for heavy-light interactions appropriate for a strongly coupled QGP which are implemented via half-off-shell amplitudes accounting for recoil corrections and interference effects (related to the imaginary part of the Q-Qbar potential). In particular, the T-matrix approach accounts for non-trivial thermal-parton spectral functions in the QGP with an equation of state that agrees with lattice-QCD results, thus ensuring consistency between the heavy- and light-parton sectors.

Recently, $nMHC$ was shown to be useful in constraining theoretical models [3].  Meanwhile, we have shown that hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the longitudinal factorization ratio $r_n(\\eta_a,\\eta_b)$ [4] and can reproduce the experimental centrality dependence with initial longitudinal fluctuations [5].  However, it is non-trivial how the hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the constraints on the QGP properties through various flows and correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on $nMHC$ in $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. We combine the $\\mathtt{TRENTo}$ initial conditions and the $\\mathtt{UrQMD}$ afterburner used in Refs. [3,6] with relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics $\\mathtt{rfh}$ [6].  We first compare the results with and without hydrodynamic fluctuations and see the effect.  We next consider different temperature dependencies of viscosity. We find that the hydrodynamic fluctuations tend to decrease $nMHC$, which is because they de-correlate initial correlations. In particular, $nMHC(v_2^2,v_3^2)$ is sensitive to the hydrodynamic fluctuations but almost insensitive to the viscosity. We also discuss the effect of the rapidity gap. We argue that $nMHC$ is useful for identifying the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations and is a key to properly constraining the theoretical models.\r\n\r\n[1] Zuzana Moravcova, Kristjan Gulbrandsen, You Zhou, Phys.

Here we study the effects of quark chemical equilibration on the QGP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. In this model, we initialize the QGP in a completely gluon dominated state, as motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models. Local light and strange quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. This impacts the system through the equation of state, which we have constructed to depend on the quark flavor content throughout the QGP.\r\n\r\nUsing this model, implemented in the MUSIC hydrodynamic code and iS3D particlization code, we have simulated ensembles of Pb+Pb and Au+Au collision events with varying quark chemical equilibration times. We discuss the observed dependence of hadronic and electromagnetic observables on the equilibration time. We also examine the impact of quark chemical equilibration on the transport properties of the QGP, and show preliminary results for a Bayesian model-to-data comparison that will  simultaneously constrain the equilibration times and transport coefficients of the QGP.",

Hypernuclei measurements provide insights into the equation-of-state of hadronic matter at high net-baryon densities, as well as into hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-interactions. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt offers the perfect conditions to explore the production of hypernuclei. The excitation function of hypernucleus production exhibits its maximum in the FAIR energy range. In combination with the foreseen high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, an exceptionally high amount of hypernuclei such as e.g. $^{4}_{\\Lambda}$H and $^{5}_{\\Lambda}$He will be created, and even very rare double hypernuclei like ${}^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$He are expected with sizeable statistics. \r\nThe reconstruction of the hypernuclei-3-body-decay was implemented into the CBM reconstruction software and optimized with respect to important performance indicators. In addition, the reconstruction was performed with a neural network. Expected efficiencies and signal-to-background-ratios were calculated with both approaches for a reliable estimation of the number of reconstructable hypernuclei. Systematical uncertainties were estimated based on simulations with different transport models (e.g. PHQMD), taking into account the signal extrapolation to the full rapidity and transverse momentum range. The experimental sensitivity to properties of hypernuclei, such as their lifetime, was evaluated. Results for $^{3}_{\\Lambda}$H will be discussed in detail. Reconstructed mass spectra for $^{4}_{\\Lambda}$H,  $^{4}_{\\Lambda}$He and $^{5}_{\\Lambda}$He will be shown in addition. (Work supported by DFG-grant BL 982/3-1)",

While implicit Runge-Kutta methods have nice properties such as their stability, they are not used usually since they are generally considered to be computationally expensive. In the present study, we solve this problem by introducing a fixed-point solver for the implicit Runge-Kutta methods with several optimizations. The Kurganov-Tadmor scheme is employed for the space discretization. The accuracy and computational cost of our new method are compared with those of explicit ones with the same space scheme in the case of ideal hydrodynamics for the initial conditions of the Riemann problem and the Gubser flow, as well as the event-by-event initial conditions for heavy-ion collisions generated by TRENTo. We demonstrate that the solver converges with only one iteration in most cases, and as a result, contrary to the general expectation, the implicit method requires smaller computational cost than the explicit one at the same accuracy in these cases.",

Various experiments from SPS through RHIC to LHC measure Bose-Einstein quantum-statistical correlations. While early on the Gaussian assumption worked well when extracting source parameters, with precise data of today more advanced assumptions have to be used. This strongly affects our understanding of the collision energy dependence of source parameters, and relatedly the equation of state: a non-monotonic behavior in source widths may be overshadowed (or, to the contrary, caused) by the mixing of change in shape and in size. In this talk we review recent measurements, present several possible physical explanations (including critical behavior, anomalous diffusion and resonances) and their implications on various stages of evolution as well as the search for the critical endpoint of QCD.",

However, most of the hyperonic matter equations of state cannot support the observed massive neutron stars (hyperon puzzle). One of the proposed scenarios is that the $\\Lambda$NN three-body force generates enough repulsion to suppress $\\Lambda$s in the dense nuclear matter. From chiral effective field theory, a $\\Lambda$ potential that satisfies this scenario has been obtained (Gerstung et al. (2020)). However, the density dependence of this potential has not been verified using experimental data.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will report that the above $\\Lambda$ potential reproduces the experimental data of heavy-ion collisions and $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei. We have found that the repulsive $\\Lambda$ potential explains both data on the $\\Lambda$ directed flow of heavy-ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$−$20~{\\rm GeV}$ within a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics implemented in JAM2 (Nara et al.

However, their interpretation is often limited by the assumptions of specific quenching models, and it remains a challenge to establish model-independent statements about the universality of different jet quenching observables.\r\n  \r\nIn this work, we address this issue by proposing a treatment that is agnostic to the details of the jet-medium interactions and relies only on the universality of quark and gluon quenching in different jet observables. We use Bayesian inference to constrain the parameterisation of the energy loss of quark- and gluon-initiated jets in a data-driven manner. This constraint is primarily performed using the inclusive jet pT spectrum, for which the quark/gluon fraction varies across rapidity. We then predict the observed jet asymmetry in di-jet and boson-jet measurements, providing evidence for the universality of quenching effects.  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, we examine the extracted Casimir scaling of jet quenching and the role of resolution effects in constraining the early, perturbative jet evolution using these data-driven methods.

Furthermore, measurements of well-known states in CEP can provide a clean probe of the structure of matter. For example, the photoproduction of the J/𝜓 (via photon-pomeron exchange) can be used for probing the low-𝑥 gluon content of protons.\r\n\r\nIn ALICE, events of the CEP can be identified by its signature of double-gap in pseudorapidity. Relying on the tracking and particle identification capabilities in the central barrel of ALICE, various final state two particle systems can be measured including 𝜋+𝜋− and 𝐾+𝐾−. In addition, heavy vector mesons such as J/𝜓 can be studied via their decay into 𝑒+𝑒− pair.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we will present the performance of the ALICE Run 3 detector for measurements of double-gap events in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV. In addition, we will discuss physics prospects of central exclusive production in pp collisions with ALICE detector.",

      "Abstract": "On the gravitational wave emission in the magnetic field\r\nof a heavy-ion collision\r\n\r\nIn the classic 1961 paper of Gertsenshtein [1] he demonstrated that an electromagnetic wave can be transformed into a gravitational wave when propagating through an external, transverse magnetic field. Later in 1973, Zel’dovich calculated the fraction of energy of the electromagnetic wave transformed into the energy of the gravitational wave in such a process in astrophysical situations [2].\r\nIn the following, we investigate a possibility of a transition of an electromagnetic wave into a gravitational wave in the high magnetic field expected to be formed in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nElectromagnetic radiation, emitted in all stages of a heavy-ion collision, reflects the evolution of the latter and encodes the information on the properties of the created medium, such as fireball lifetime, temperature, acceleration, and polarization. This information can be decoded by studying di-lepton spectra by means of their invariant mass reconstruction. The slope of the di-lepton excess spectrum measured in the intermediate-mass region provides information on the temperature of the emitting medium.\r\n\r\nIn the poster, we discuss the modification of a slope value due to the excitation of a gravitational wave by light emitted from the medium in the magnetic field generated in a non-central heavy-ion collision. Based on several simplifications, we estimate the possible redshift and conclude the effect is not detectable with heavy-ion experiments planned in the foreseeable future. However, with this contribution, we also want to trigger a discussion on the emerging field of ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves physics and its possible relation to high-energy heavy-ion collision physics.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] M.

      "Abstract": "The study of strongly interacting matter under external conditions (such as high temperatures and/or baryon densities) provides unique insights into its fundamental theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A nonzero angular momentum imposed on a QCD system can bring rich and intriguing phenomena, with the proton spin structure being a perfect example. A much larger QCD system with substantial angular momentum, produced by non-central heavy ion collisions, has attracted a lot of interest recently. This angular momentum induces nontrivial vortical fluid patterns in the fireball formed by the collision and eventually leads to spin polarization of final state hadrons, as shown by experimental measurements from the STAR, ALICE and HADES Collaborations. A clear understanding of the angular momentum initial conditions for the fireball, such as the total amount and its rapidity distribution, is, however, still lacking. In this talk, we demonstrate how baryon stopping plays a key role for the deposition of angular momentum toward the mid-rapidity region. By calculating rapidity loss after multiple binary collisions for wounded nucleons, we quantify the angular momentum initial conditions for heavy ion collisions from GeV to TeV beam energies. This also allows us to explain the beam energy dependence of experimental data for spin polarization as well as to reveal a nontrivial correlation between net baryon number and initial angular momentum in the fireball. Finally we introduce the ratio of angular momentum to net baryon number as a measure for comparing “spinning-ness” and show that the most spinning baryonic matter, created in heavy ion collisions at energies of a few GeV, is about an order of magnitude higher than a proton in terms of this measure.",

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "When studying the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, it is necessary to classify the events based on the size and shape of the QGP. Typically, events are categorized by mapping the impact parameter, which cannot be measured directly, to a bulk observable that varies monotonically with it, such as soft particle production. In the mapping, fluctuations in the initial state nuclei and the nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken into account. Even a tight experimental centrality based solely on multiplicity includes events with quite different shapes due to these fluctuations. To select much more homogeneous sub-samples of events, adding a second, independent qualifier is helpful. A decade ago, event-shape engineering proposed the flow vector as a second qualifier, but it is influenced by final state interactions. Instead, we use spectator neutrons measured in the zero-degree calorimeter of PHENIX as the second dimension. This new approach provides a more precise way to categorize QGP events, which has important implications for understanding the underlying physics of heavy ion collisions. By using this novel 2D event characterization in Au$+$Au collisions at RHIC, we will demonstrate elliptic flow results with tighter constraints on the initial geometry. We will also discuss how this may be relevant in studying path-length dependent energy loss and possible multiple parton interactions (MPI).",

      "Institute": "Sophia University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics has been successful in describing space-time evolution of matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. It is conventionally supposed that the created matter starts to behave as fluids all at once at a certain initial time. It is, however, not at all trivial from which stage after the collision the fluid picture can be applied to the system. According to the hydrodynamization theory [1], any solutions of hydrodynamic equations converge to an attractor. Thus, hydrodynamic description might be justified anyway even starting from the system far away from local equilibrium. Do we really describe space-time evolution of the system using hydrodynamics even when the system is far away from local equilibrium? In this study, we address this issue from a point of view of causality. \r\nA recent study shows necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions to be causal in non-linear relativistic hydrodynamic equations [2]. When they are applied to numerical hydrodynamic simulations, it turns out that causality tends to be violated at the early time and/or in peripheral regions [3]. This indicates that violation of causality has something to do with how far the system is away from local equilibrium. Motivated by these observations, we scrutinize a one-dimensionally expanding conformal system from a view point of causality and constrain the initial conditions whose solutions by no means violate the causality. We first define the degree of non-equilibrium and then describe its time evolution solving the Muller-Israel-Stewart type constitutive equation in one-dimensionally expanding system. We find that it is acausal in fact when the system is far away from local equilibrium. Using these solutions, we quantify a range of the inverse Reynolds number in which hydrodynamic description is justified from a view point of causality. This sheds light on the understanding of initial stages in high-energy nuclear collisions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] M.P. Heller and M. Spalinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. **115**, 072501 (2015).\r\n[2] F.S.

Among those, a few things are well understood about high-density matter, both theoretically and experimentally, and these are currently being actively studied.\r\n \r\nJ-PARC Heavy Ion Project (J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project to generate and study ultra-high-density matter using 1-12A GeV heavy ion beams. Although the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, it has successfully supplied a high-intensity beam of about 60kW even in slow extraction. Therefore, the J-PARC-HI case will expect high-flux beams with excellent performance. In other words, only the injector must be newly constructed, and the acceleration afterwards will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme is being studied in detail by the J-PARC accelerator group.\r\n \r\nWe have the staging plan of the project into two stages. In the first stage, a booster ring will reuse the KEK-PS. Even in this stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of $10^{8}$Hz. In the second stage, a new booster ring will be constructed where the highest intensity heavy ion beam of $10^{11}$Hz is expected. We consider the primary goal of the first stage as the confirmation of non-confined phases in high-density regions. The purpose of the second stage is to be precise measurements of the high-density matter. Applications such as producing various hyper-nuclei and studying the internal structure of hadrons are also conceivable. In this talk, we would like to discuss these rich physics opportunities and the concept of detector design.",

A part of the orbital angular momentum can polarize the quarks and anti-quarks, hence the vector mesons, inside the medium. Recently, STAR measured the global spin alignment of φ(1020) mesons in Au+Au collisions from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan I (BES I) program [1].\r\n\r\nThe global spin alignment, quantified by the 00th coefficient of the spin density matrix ρ00, is measured by a fit to the acceptance and efficiency corrected φ meson yield versus polar angle (θ∗) between the daughter kaon in the parent’s rest frame and the orbital angular momentum direction.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we present an alternative approach to extract ρ00 by utilizing the ⟨cos2 θ∗⟩ as a function of pair-invariant mass instead of analyzing the φ meson yields in cos θ∗ bins. The acceptance and efficiency effects are taken into account by using the combinatorial background. This method only uses the signal to background ratio and is insensitive to few percent variations in the yield vs. θ∗. We report preliminary results from this method and compare with previous measurements by STAR.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Abdallah et al. (STAR Collaboration), Nature 614, 244–248 (2022).",

      "Abstract": "We investigate the critical fluctuations in light-nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions based on the coalescence model, where we introduce corrections to the distribution function from critical correlators from the Ising model.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of the yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N^2_d$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively), in STAR collaboration [1], has shown a non-monotonic behavior as a function of collision energy in a heavy-ion collision. Based on the analyses with idealized setups, it was also suggested that the yield ratio is one of the observables for a possible signal of the QCD critical point [2]. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions. In our previous study, we expanded the distribution function of nucleons in terms of phase-space cumulants [3] and found that the effect of cumulants cancels in the yield ratio up to the second order, which also includes the effect of radial expansions.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this talk, we further investigate the effect of non-trivial phase-space distributions [3] by example distributions including the Woods-Saxon distribution, two Gaussian forms, and the blast-wave-type anisotropic flows. We find that the spatial structure decreases the ratio while the momentum anisotropy increases it. In the second part, we extend our analysis by evaluating the critical effect in the generalized light-nuclei ratio $N_p^{B-A}N_B^{A-1}/N_A^{B-1}$ [4,5] with $N_A$ being the nuclei yield of mass number A.  We introduce the critical correction to the phase-space distribution by employing the critical fluctuations from the Ising model.  We find that the overall non-monotonic behavior of the yield ratio arises from the increasing correlation length near the critical point. In addition, if the strength of the critical fluctuation is sufficiently significant, the collision energy dependence of the ratio exhibits double peaks by the interplay between the two- and three-point critical corrections.\r\n\r\n[1] STAR Collaboration, arXiv:2209.08058 (2022).\r\n[2] K.J.Sun, L.W.Chen, C.M.Ko and Z.Xu, Phys.

      "Abstract": "Charge balance functions (BFs) were introduced at the beginning of the RHIC era  as a tool to investigate the evolution of particle production in heavy-ion collisions and identify the presence of delayed hadronization as an indicator of the formation of long lived isentropic expanding quark gluon plasma in high-energy nucleus-nucleus (A--A) collisions. It later emerged that BFs are rather sensitive to the radial expansion dynamics of the matter formed in these collisions and can, in principle, be used to probe hadron production mechanisms such as the formation of clusters. Later still, it was found that the azimuthal dependence of hadrons BFs, particularly heavier hadrons, is sensitive to  the  diffusivity of light quarks. In this work, we show how the conservation of quantum numbers can be properly accounted for and how cross-species BF can be exploited to determine the relative strengths of distinct species pairs  from heavy hadron decay feeddowns, long range correlations arising at the onset of collisions, and  contributions from baryon stopping. We addtionally  examine the possibility of  probing the degree of equilibration achieved in A--A collisions (at both RHIC and LHC energies) as well as the evaluation  of QGP susceptibilities by means of measurements of charge, strange, and baryon BFs. We show that baryon BFs, in particular, may   enable a detailed assessment of  baryon stopping.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely employed in high energy nuclear physics, with applications in heavy-ion collisions, neutron star mergers and coalescing matter in black holes [1]. Due to the acausality and instability of relativistic Navier-Stokes (NS) theory [2], one usually employs Israel-Stewart-like (IS) formulations of fluid dynamics [3] in which the constitutive relations for the dissipative currents are replaced by relaxation type equations. This comes at the expense of a more complex structure of the partial differential equations being solved, which renders the assessment of features of solutions in the non-linear regime very intricate. More recently, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory has emerged [4], where theorems for causality, linear stability and existence of solutions can be rigorously established, but unconventional matching conditions are required. For all of the aforementioned theories, transport coefficients play a fundamental role. However, their computation is usually a very non-trivial task, even in the context of Kinetic Theory. We show that this difficulty can be circumvented for a system composed of classical ultra-relativistic scalar particles weakly interacting via a quartic potential. Then, the specific form of the cross-section [5] allows for the computation of transport coefficients without approximations beyond the power-counting scheme of the corresponding hydrodynamic theory. In this contribution, we calculate all transport coefficients of NS, BDNK and IS theories and demonstrate, in a Bjorken flow scenario, that NS and BDNK theories are pathological for large gradients and thus cannot be used to describe the early stages of heavy ion collisions. For BDNK and IS theories, attractor solutions are also analyzed.\r\n\r\n[1] W. Florkowski. Lect.Not. Phys. 999, 63-85, 2022; M. Chabanov et al.. Mon. Not. Roy. Astron.

In these low-energy HIC experiments,  diffusion processes of conserved charges play a vital role in  dynamic evolution of dense QCD matter.  Recently, thermoelectric effects such as Seebeck effect, which have been extensively studied in condensed matter materials, have also captured the attention of high-density HIC physics.  Thermoelectric Figure of Merit (ZT), which reflect strong couplings among electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and temperature, can be used as a common benchmark to quantify the effeciency of meterial at heat-to-electricity conversion.\r\n\r\nWe focus on the ZT in hadronic phase, where the themoelectric transports of mutiple conserved charges (the baryon number, strangeness and electric charge) are fully considered.  The different transport coefficients matrices are estimated using the Boltzmann kinetic theory in Hardron Resonance Gas model with and without repulsive mean field effect. We also study the  effect of magnetic field on ZT. Different to zero magnetic field, additional transverse ZT can appear at finite magnetic field, and we for the first time distinguish the calculation results of themoelectric coefficients in QCD medium under the adiabatic and isothermal condition.

In this contribution, we present intermittency analysis of the normalized factorial moments ($F\\rm{_{q}}$) of the multiplicity distributions of the charged particles produced in Pb--Pb collisions as a function of phase-space resolution. The spatial configurations of the charged particles in two-dimensional ($\\eta,\\varphi$) phase space are investigated. For a system with scale-invariant dynamical fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, the $F\\rm{_{q}}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing phase-space resolution, which is a signature of self-similar fluctuations and the fractal structure of the system. The dependence of the fractal dimension $D_{q}$ on the order parameter $q$ is indicative of the multifractal nature of the system. By relating the $q^{\\rm{th}}$-order $F\\rm{_{q}}$ to the normalized second-order factorial moment ($F\\rm{_{2}}$), we extract the scaling exponent ($\\nu$), which provides information about the order of the phase transition in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory.

This talk presents new precise measurements of $[p_\\mathrm{T}]$ cumulants up to 3rd order in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe and $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions. The multiplicity dependence of $[p_\\mathrm{T}]$ cumulants show deviations from expected power-law behavior. The average $\\left\\langle[p_\\mathrm{T}]\\right\\rangle$ shows a non-trivial rise in the ultra-central collisions, whereas the variance shows a clear and sharp drop in ultra-central collisions.

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia have been long considered as key features in heavy ion collision to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. One of the key signatures is the sequential yield suppression for different quarkonium states in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions compared to p+p collisions following the ordering of their binding energies. Moreover, sequential yield modification has also been observed in small collision systems such p+Au and p+Pb collisions. Theoretical models consider dissociation and regeneration effects to describe these experimental results, whereas the additional suppression of excited states in small systems is considered to be beyond initial-state effects which is premature to claim for any hot medium effect. To quantitatively test and disentangle such hot medium effects, a model study is performed in various small collision systems such as p+p, p+Pb, p+O, and O+O collisions for $\\Upsilon(nS)$ production. In this model, we incorporate a theoretical calculation of hot in-medium effects for $\\Upsilon(nS)$ states into a Monte Carlo simulation to more realistically probe the medium produced in heavy ion collisions with event-by-event initial collision geometry and hydrodynamical evolution. The theory calculation considers gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering for dissociation and their inverse reaction for regeneration and reasonably describes the modification of $\\Upsilon(1S)$ in Pb+Pb collisions. In this work (Phys. Rev. C 107, 054905 (2023)), we quantify the nuclear modification factor of $\\Upsilon(nS)$ as a function of charged particle multiplicity ($dN_{ch}/d\\eta$) and transverse momentum. We also calculate the elliptic flow of $\\Upsilon(nS)$ in small collision systems. The results are compared with existing experimental results and discussed in terms of prospects for the upcoming LHC oxygen ion run.",

      "Abstract": "Studies of charm production in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions are essential to understand some of the most fundamental aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics. They also provide the baseline for interpretation of charm data from larger colliding systems. Over the last decade, the measurement of the production cross-sections of charm mesons and baryons in $pp$ collisions has been at the centre of a wide experimental effort at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These cross-sections were measured over a wide transverse momentum and rapidity coverage, thanks to the complementary kinematic acceptance of the different LHC experiments. In this study, the measurements of the charm hadrons $D^0$, $D^+$, $D_s^+$, $\\Lambda_c^+$ and $\\Xi_c^0$ performed by the ALICE, CMS and LHCb collaborations in $pp$ collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=\\rm 5.02$ TeV are combined in transverse momentum and rapidity, and, using the most recent theoretical calculations, are extrapolated to the full phase space to determine the total charm-quark production cross section $\\sigma_{c\\bar{c}}$. We will discuss the final result, which increases the existing tension between experimental data and fixed order calculations, together with comparisons to PYTHIA predictions.",

Initial state effects are investigated by constructing central-to-peripheral ratios of dijet yields, $R_{\\mathrm{CP}}$.

These formalisms have distinct domains of validity in kinematic regions. Going beyond the shock wave approximation and considering the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, which arises from the interference of initial- and final-state scatterings, we show for the first time that CGC and HT formalisms can be unified to describe the same physics in the transition region where they overlap. This unified picture provides a framework for understanding the QCD dynamics in the transition from dilute to dense nuclear matter, paving the way for mapping out the QCD evolution phase diagram of nuclear medium from dilute to dense region.

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "High-energy nucleus-nucleus collision experiments have played a crucial role in exploring high-temperature quark matter, such as the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The study of various hadrons, characterized by diverse internal structures, constituent quark numbers, and quark species, has been essential for understanding QGP properties. It has become increasingly evident that hadron yields in nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions exhibit modifications compared to proton-proton collisions, which can be attributed to their internal structures. Therefore, analyzing the yields of hadrons with unidentified internal structures in such collisions can give valuable insights into their composition. Numerous hadrons with unknown internal structures, such as ${\\rm f_0}$ mesons (e.g., ${\\rm f_0}$(1500) and ${\\rm f_0}$(1710), leading glueball candidates), have been observed in the mass range of 1-2 GeV/c$^2$\r\nWith its advanced particle identification capabilities, precise secondary vertex determination, and extensive data sample, the ALICE experiment is ideally suited for this study. These features are crucial as these mesons decay into hadrons with relatively long lifetimes, such as the ${\\rm K^0_s K^0_s}$ pair. This presentation will showcase the cross-section of hadron production in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV and proton-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. The nuclear modification factor, R$_\\mathrm{pA}$, will be employed to provide insights into the internal structure of primary glueball candidate hadrons. The findings of this investigation have the potential to open up a new research domain utilizing the QGP, deepening our understanding of the internal structures of exotic hadrons and their roles in high-energy collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Two particle femtoscopy provide a powerful tool for studying the space–time dynamics of the hot and dense matter (QGP) created in these collisions such as the size, shape, and lifetime as well as advancing our understanding of the behavior of matter at extreme conditions by measuring the relative momentum correlations between pairs of particles emitted in the same direction from the collision. These correlations arise due to quantum statistics, Coulomb and strong final state interactions. From the non-identical particle correlation study, particularly the hyperon-nucleon correlations, one can obtain information about the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars and the existence of various exotic hadrons (H-dibaryons).We report the calculations of femtoscopic correlations between proton and lambda  pairs in Au+Au events simulated using the Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via CRAB (Correlation After Burner) to account for the Final State Interaction among the emitted particles. The Correlation Analysis Tool using the Schrödinger equation (CATS) package is used to analyze the p$-\\Lambda$ correlation functions obtained from these simulations and extract the source radii and to investigate the interaction potential for p$-\\Lambda$ pairs which do not have well determined scattering parameters. However, the calculated femtoscopic radii were compared to STAR experimental data. The study of source radii in heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies can provide information about the phase transition from hadronic matter to quark-gluon plasma and  can help to distinguish between different models of the initial state and particle production mechanisms. Furthermore having the source fixed at both high and low energies allows for a direct comparison of the interaction at different energies.",

      "Abstract": "The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a liquid created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions where quarks and gluons become deconfined. This state allows us to examine the emergent properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme conditions. sPHENIX, a new experiment at RHIC, studies the QGP created in Au-Au collisions and started taking data in 2023. Collimated sprays of particles, called jets, may be created in these collisions, typically in back-to-back (dijet) configurations. These dijets are produced prior to the formation of the QGP and interact with it during their development, losing energy ins a process called “jet quenching” which probes the nature of the QGP. When these dijets do not pass through the same path-length of QGP, the energy loss will be asymmetric. The dijet momentum imbalance (x$_J$) is defined as the ratio between the sub-leading (second highest energy) jet’s energy and the leading (highest energy) jet’s energy, and is a useful measure of energy loss. However, dijet measurements are sensitive to the underlying event and detector resolution. To correct for these effects we examine the development and application of Bayesian unfolding techniques on PYTHIA jets embedded into HIJING Au+Au background. Future uses will include implementation on measured dijet distributions in sPHENIX.",

In particular, the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are crucial for reconstructing and determining the energy of jets. High-energy jets produced by hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions provide valuable insight into how partons interact and lose energy in the QGP. In sPHENIX, jets are reconstructed by clustering energy from all three layers of the calorimeter. However, the presence of the underlying event (UE), which refers to all particles produced from sources other than the hard-scattering process, can lead to the overestimation of jet energy and distortion of jet properties. Therefore, it is crucial to have an accurate quantification and subtraction of UE in jet measurements.  This poster will present the status of sPHENIX event-by-event estimation of the UE as a function of event activity throughout the 2023 data-taking period and plans for extracting measurements with underlying event-subtracted reconstructed jets.",

The MVTX is the innermost tracking detector, boasting a spatial resolution of 5 $\\mu$m and covering 2.5-4.0 cm radially, and a pseudorapidity range of $|\\eta|$ <2. With 432 ALPIDE sensors, each containing approximately 0.5M 27 $\\mu$m x 29 $\\mu$m pixels in an area of 1.5cm x 3.0cm, determining the position of each pixel in the sPHENIX global coordinate system presents a significant challenge. Our first step is to establish the relative position of each sensor in the local MVTX coordinates with an accuracy of better than 5 $\\mu$m. To this end, we have developed an AI-ML-based approach to determine the deviations of each sensor's position and orientation from the ideal geometry (dx, dy, dz) in translation and (d$\\alpha$, d$\\beta$, d$\\gamma$) in rotation.

In this kinematic region, the DY cross-section is dominated by NLO gluon Compton scattering allowing access to the gluon density of the nucleus, xG(x). The DY events extraction requires a precise knowledge of the QCD background contributing to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum. A fit to the latter one is carried out including opencharm (OC), open-bottom (OB), charmonium ($\\psi$) and bottomonium ($\\Upsilon$) simulations. The CNM effects are investigated via the rapidity and p$_\\perp$ distributions of the DY lepton pair, and the possible impact of sPHENIX DY data on the xG(x) extraction is discussed.

However, in order to reach its design performance, the time-varying distortions due to the fields of the remaining ion backflow and primary ionization must be monitored and corrected.  The slowly varying component of the distortions is monitored by the TPC Outer Tracker (TPOT), a micromegas-based detector which provides an additional spacepoint for tracks within a limited azimuthal range.  This spacepoint enables a data-driven extraction of the distortion vectors within the detector, which can then be extrapolated to the entire chamber.

By integrating the digitized readout from the detector, one produces a 'digital current' which serves as a proxy for the ion backflow current.  The digital current can then be used to reconstruct the ion space charge density to calculate the electric and magnetic field distortions in the chamber, but at significant computational cost.  Machine learning methods provide a mechanism to reduce this computational cost while also reducing errors by training and validating with experimental data.

The traditional method of grouping connected hits into clusters, known as connected component analysis (CCA), becomes less effective in high-multiplicity events, such as Au+Au collisions with event pileup from multiple beam crossings, due to effects from $\\delta$-electrons and the high occupancy. A neural network (NN) clustering method, which uses an NN to predict the cluster position based on the distribution of hits, is supposed to improve the clustering performance. We simulate high-multiplicity events and the sPHENIX detector response and train the NN to predict the associated truth cluster position based on the distribution of the reconstructed hits. We will show the implementation of NN clustering at sPHENIX and our plans to enhance its performance by improving truth-information association and fine-tuning the parameters of the NN.",

The corresponding beam crossing for each track is determined from the precise timing of the INTT detector.

Recently-derived conditions on the causality of the hydrodynamic equations [1] can give a concrete answer --- if evolution is acausal, it is not a faithful representation of the underlying QCD theory.  It is now known that current simulation models reach acausal regimes, at least sometimes.  \r\n\r\nWe study the phenomenological effects of this knowledge in the context of a comprehensive, multi-system model-to-data comparison that was originally performed by the JETSCAPE Collaboration [2].  Different ways are explored to include information about causality violation (and therefore the validity of the model) into the analysis, and its effects on the extracted physical properties.    Specifically, when performing Bayesian inference we can include the information in the prior probability (quantifying our trust in the model based on the degree or frequency of causality violation), or in the model uncertainty (estimating an increased uncertainty when there is violation of causality).   The resulting changes in the posterior give an indication of the uncertainty that is contributed by model (in)validity, and  the importance of addressing these fundamental issues in our treatment of heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nAs an additional study, we identify various causes of acausality in hydrodynamic simulations, and therefore the best targets for designing more realistic models. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] Bemfica, Disconzi, Hoang, Noronha, Radosz, Phys.Rev.Lett. 126 (2021) 22, 222301\r\n[2] JETSCAPE Collaboration, Phys.Rev.C 103 (2021) 5, 054904; Phys.Rev.Lett. 126 (2021) 24, 242301",

      "Abstract": "Energy-energy correlators (EEC) have been proposed to study the structure of energy flow within jets. These functions are defined as the energy-weighted cross-section of particle pairs inside jets. The correlation as a function of pair distance and jet transverse momentum offers a clear separation between the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes, where one can probe the dynamics of quarks and gluons and their confinement into hadrons. In this work, using data from the ALICE experiment, we present measurements of 2-point EECs in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. By comparing these results to a p-p baseline, we can study the changes to jet dynamics caused by interactions between color charges and a cold nuclear medium. In particular, we can look into how the presence of cold nuclear matter modifies the hadronization mechanism.",

      "Abstract": "In this study, we investigate if machine learning can be used to reconstruct aspects of jet history. The space-time evolution of a jet shower is directly linked to local properties of the surrounding medium. Extracting the evolution poses a challenge, since experimentally we only have access to the final state hadron momenta. On the other hand, Monte Carlo simulations model the jet history in great detail. Here, we explore if the known history in simulations can be reconstructed by looking only at final state particles using machine learning. We consider jets in vacuum, generated by the JETSCAPE framework. We work with output data for both final state partons and final state hadrons. We use these datasets to train neural networks to predict the maximum opening angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ and the jet splitting function $z_G$ -- related to transverse and longitudinal jet structure respectively -- in the simulation. We compare the predictive powers of the parton data and the hadron data, to understand if and how information is lost during hadronization. Finally, we investigate ways to quantify and reduce information loss due to hadronization.",

      "Abstract": "Understanding the modification of jets and high-p_T probes in small systems requires the integration of soft and hard physics. We present recent developments in extending the JETSCAPE framework to build an event generator, which includes correlations between soft and hard partons, to study jet observables in small systems. The multi-scale physics of the collision is separated into different stages. Hard scatterings are first sampled at binary collision positions provided by the Glauber geometry. They are then propagated backward in space-time following an initial-state shower to obtain the initiating partons' energies and momenta before the collision. These energies and momenta are then subtracted from the incoming colliding nucleons for soft-particle production, modeled by the 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics + hadronic transport framework. This new hybrid approach includes non-trivial correlations between jet and soft particle productions in small systems. We calibrate this framework with the measured event activity distributions in p+p and p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. We further compare our results for final state hadron's p_T-spectra from low to high p_T in p+p and p+Pb collisions with experimental results in p+Pb at the LHC. Lastly, we present results of additional observables such as the distributions of jet recoiling from a high-p_T hadron and the nuclear modification factor R_{pPb} as a function of event activity.",

Hybrid Hadronization combines quark recombination, applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems. It can therefore smoothly describe the transition from very dilute parton systems like to full AA collisions. We test this picture by using JETSCAPE to generate jets in various systems. Comparison to experimental data for several observables at multiple energies allows for a precise calibration of vacuum baseline parameters in JETSCAPE and Hybrid Hadronization. We use charged hadron, identified hadron and jet spectra in a Bayesian calibration to find the best parameter tune. The inclusion of further observables in p+p and e+e- in the future is discussed.",

These measurements will be presented and compared to different nuclear formation models. The two most prevalent formation models—the thermal and coalescence models—are based on different underlying physics. A better understanding of (anti)nuclei production mechanisms is needed, which drives the effort to analyze high-statistics data sets from fixed-target experiments. Additionally, new updated measurements of proton, antiproton, π±, and K± spectra will be showcased, along with unique measurements of Omega and K0s production in p+p interactions.\r\n\r\nDeuteron production measurements are important for understanding cosmic-ray antinuclei. The detection of cosmic antinuclei holds the potential to be a breakthrough approach for identifying dark matter signatures. The main source of cosmic antinuclei background are interactions between cosmic-ray protons and interstellar hydrogen gas. Gaining a deeper insight into deuteron production in p+p interactions is an essential first step in modelling these astrophysical processes. Furthermore, modeling of light antinuclei production typically requires antiproton production cross sections as input. Precise antiproton measurements are crucial. The updated hadron spectra exhibit significantly reduced statistical uncertainties and extend the phase space coverage in rapidity and transverse momentum compared to earlier measurements. These advancements can be employed to refine our understanding of proton-proton interactions.",

The sPHENIX ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) and Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal), used for the first time at RHIC, will provide good energy measurements for full jet reconstruction. sPHENIX will enable an unprecedented series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements at sPHENIX in 200 GeV p+p, p+Au and Au+Au collisions. In particular, the heavy flavor hadron inside jet production can provide vital information about the heavy quark hadronization process and how such process gets modified in a nuclear medium. Less recombination contribution to the hadron production is expected at RHIC compared to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, which makes these measurements an unique approach to explore the universality of heavy quark fragmentation functions in different nuclear environments. We will present the performance projection of the D-meson inside jet reconstruction, the hadron-jet relative kinematic variable distributions, and projections in 200 GeV p+p and Au+Au simulations with realistic sPHENIX detector performance.

In addition to having the first hadronic calorimeter (HCal) at mid-rapidity at RHIC, sPHENIX also contains a tungsten-scintillator based Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) for measuring the energy of photons and electrons. Before physics analyses can take place using the EMCal, however, it must be calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale, and this will be done by calibrating the EMCal’s response relative the neutral pion’s ($\\pi^0$) invariant mass. $\\pi^0$’s are reconstructed from pairs of EMCal clusters that were produced by decay photons from $\\pi^0$’s.  However, due to cluster merging effects, this procedure is not practical at high momentum. Thus, as a high-energy cross-check on the energy scale calibration, the calorimeter’s response relative to $\\eta$ mesons, whose heavier mass allows for reconstruction without merging to much higher momenta, will also be measured. The EMCal’s successful calibration will enable measurements with the $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ mesons, which will take advantage of both sPHENIX’s large acceptance and the high luminosity 200 GeV Au + Au data set currently being recorded. This poster will show the status of the sPHENIX EMCal’s energy scale calibration and the status of sPHENIX’s first neutral meson analyses",

In this study, the momentum p of isolated tracks, those separated by a minimum distance from the nearest other tracks, are found utilizing the sPHENIX charged-particle tracking systems and are matched to calorimeter energy deposits with energy E; E/p distributions are then constructed for use in precise data-to-MC comparisons. The methodology regarding the minimization of background energy from neutral particles within the track isolation area will also be presented. These measurements can be used to understand the hadronic response and quantify the uncertainty in the calorimeter hadronic response between data and MC.",

The outer HCal is the outermost layer located outside the solenoid coil, and the inner HCal is positioned between the solenoid magnet and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The sPHENIX program, aimed at achieving precise jet measurements and analyzing the microscopic properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma, requires a well-calibrated energy scale for the calorimeters. This poster will present the advancements made in calibrating both the inner and outer HCals utilizing cosmic ray muons. Energy deposited by muons traversing the sectors is recorded, and events in which muons pass through all scintillator tiles in a tower are selected for analysis. The primary diagnostic is the Most Probable Value (MPV) of the ADC distributions associated with these events. Subsequently, MPVs undergo corrections to account for temperature variations and the tower tiles’ response to LED signals. These corrected MPVs determine the gain of each tower. A Monte Carlo study, based on Geant4 simulations, will establish a reference for the relative calibration of the gains on a tower-by-tower basis. The bias voltage applied to the silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) will be adjusted to fine-tune the gain and eliminate the outliers, resulting in a more accurate calibration of the HCals. This calibration process is essential for understanding the calorimeter response and contributes broadly to the sPHENIX experiment’s goals resulting in a more accurate calibration of the HCals.

This detector consists of 24 triangular sectors, each of which is divided into 31 optically isolated tiles of plastic scintillating material, such that light can be collected from a discrete area of the detector then converted later to an electronic signal. A wavelength shifting fiber is glued into each tile using an optical epoxy with an index of refraction matching that of the scintillator. The tiles cover 16 segments in $\\eta$ and 24 in $\\phi$. The sectors were installed into two disks covering a pseudorapidity of 2.1 < |$\\eta$| < 4.9. To build the detector, scintillating plastic was milled into a triangular shape to create 24 sectors. Grooves for the optical fibers were then machined into the sectors, in addition to channels to divide each sector into 31 tiles. Optical fibers were then glued into the grooves, and the channels were filled with a reflective epoxy to achieve optical isolation between tiles. An overview of this construction process will be given in detail, including the machining of the sectors, the installation of the fibers in the tiles, and the creation of two types of bundles of fiber optic assemblies. \r\n\r\nThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2117773.",

In this poster, we present the first D$^0$-tagged jet axes difference studies carried out in pp collision at 5.02 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC, with jets of transverse momentum $p_{\\mathrm{T,jet}} > 5 \\: \\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and D$^0$-mesons with $p_{\\mathrm{T,D^0}} > 2 \\: \\mathrm{GeV}/c$. The measurements include the radial distributions of D$^0$ mesons with respect to the jet axis, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{D,jet}}$, as well as a study of the opening angle, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{axis}}$, between various definitions for the axis of a D$^0$-tagged jet. We compare these results with those obtained from the inclusive, gluon-dominated, sample of jets. These measurements, at relatively low jet momentum, are sensitive to heavy-flavor production mechanisms and will serve as important groundwork for an in-depth understanding of charm-quark diffusion in the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "Many physics observables of interest in heavy-ion collisions require knowledge of the collision geometry. Geometric fluctuations lead to different symmetry planes of the initial geometry for each harmonic number, called participant planes. As the produced medium evolves, pressure gradients transform the initial state spatial anisotropy into final state momentum anisotropy. The angular distribution of particles can be described via Fourier coefficients $v_n$. The participant planes can be approximated via event planes, $\\psi_n$, which are determined from measured azimuthal distribution of particles produced in the collision. This poster reports the methods used for event plane determination in sPHENIX as well as the performance using a variety of sPHENIX subsystems based on simulation using a realistic GEANT description of the experiment. Initial results from the first data run will also be discussed..",

      "Abstract": "The sPHENIX detector is the next generation experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Starting commissioning in May, it will collect high statistics data sets from ultra relativistic Au+Au, p+p and p+Au collisions in the next 3 years. The readout is a combination of triggered readout for calorimeters and streaming readout for the silicon pixel/strip detectors and the time projection chamber (TPC). sPHENIX does not employ high level triggers which would require building events in real-time except for a small subset that is assembled online for monitoring purposes. Events are assembled offline from multiple input streams only during the multi pass offline reconstruction which includes calibration and space charge distortion corrections for the TPC data. This reconstruction will run near real-time within a fixed latency of when the data was taken. To meet its physics requirements sPHENIX has developed state of the art reconstruction software based on the \"A Common Tracking Software\" (ACTS) package which was adapted to reconstruct the TPC data. The raw data will be processed at the Tier 0 for the RHIC experiments - the Scientific Data Computing Center (SDCC) at BNL. The Production and Distributed Analysis (PanDA) system was chosen as workload management system to handle the complexities of our workflow.\r\n\r\nThis poster will show the details of the data processing for the sPHENIX experiment.",

      "Abstract": "The sPHENIX Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is a gaseous drift detector\r\ndesigned to measure charged particle tracks. It is filled with Argon/CF4 and uses\r\nGaseous Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils at readout for electron amplification\r\nand ion back-flow suppression. The electrons at readout are measured, converted\r\nto digital current, and their signal waveforms are processed to reconstruct the track.\r\nAt this stage, the positions of hits and clusters along the track can be measured.\r\nA successful measurement of these hits and clusters must correct for\r\ndistortion effects present in the TPC. There are three primary sources of distortion: static\r\ndistortions from E and B fields, average distortion from space charge, and event-by-event distortions due to fluctuations in space charge. This poster focuses on\r\na novel technique to measure the static distortions using a system of steerable\r\nionizing lasers. These provide straight tracks at many different angles with\r\nan ability to sample the entire TPC volume between periods when beam is\r\npresent. These laser induced tracks are used measure the distortions from non-uniform\r\nand slightly misaligned drift electric fields and solenoidal magnet fields in single\r\nvoxels of the TPC.

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is the main tracking detector in sPHENIX. Charged particles which pass through the TPC ionize the gas, with the transverse position being given by the readout pad and the time for the ionization electrons to drift to the endcaps defining the z position. The ionization electrons are clustered together in order to track particles and determine their momenta. In order to accurately track particles, calibrations must be performed and the performance of the TPC must be understood. As part of normal operation, space charge builds up within the TPC, leading to tracking distortions. These distortions must be accurately characterized over time such that they can be corrected as they evolve. Several calibration systems are used for this, including a set of diffuse lasers which illuminate the Central Membrane of the TPC. Aluminum stripes, deposited on the Central Membrane at well-surveyed positions, emit photoelectrons when struck by the diffuse laser. The resulting pattern can be reconstructed and used to characterize the 3-dimensional distortions at the position of the Central Membrane. These distortions are then extrapolated to the endcaps of the TPC in order to provide corrections throughout its entire volume. This poster will discuss the design, the algorithm, and the performance of the time dependent distortion corrections in the sPHENIX TPC and identify how this effort fits into the broader sPHENIX TPC calibration scheme.",

      "Abstract": "The new sPHENIX detector at RHIC will begin commissioning with Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV in Spring 2023. The sPHENIX trigger system is paramount to the success of the sPHENIX physics program. A system of custom digital Local Level-1 electronics (LL1) will enable trigger primitive generation related to interaction selection, jets, photons, hadrons, and Upsilons to pass to the Global Trigger (GL1). A single LL1 board compresses primitives from up to 1536 detector readout channels and produces a digest of event classifications that will be passed to the GL1. The Minimum Bias Detector (MBD) trigger will provide the primary selection criterion of vertex determination, triggering on hits in the high-rapidity region covered by the MBD. This will be pivotal in synchronizing the data-acquisition of separate detectors to collisions at RHIC. Next, the jet, photon, and hadron trigger will search for windows of high energy deposition in the electromagnetic (EMCAL) and the hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), seeking out collisions with jet production. For this trigger an additional set of LL1 electronics are used to collect information from the entire calorimeter system. Finally the electron pair trigger is designed to capture decayed Upsilons and will invoke a peak-finding algorithm to find pair electrons deposited into the EMCAL. This poster overviews the design and strategy of the LL1 trigger and will discuss the performance of the trigger and data acquisition systems and the status of trigger efficiency studies based on year-1 data, compared to  emulated data from sPHENIX simulations.",

However, competing energy-loss effects, such as the dependence on the opening angle of the shower, radiative emissions to large angles, and the medium response to the jet, can obscure interpretation. This talk presents two new observables aimed at disentangling these effects. First, we introduce a new infrared and collinear safe measurement of the jet energy flow within jets reconstructed with different resolution parameters $R$. Changing the jet $R$ varies the relative contribution of competing energy-loss effects. Additionally, we utilize the excellent ALICE PID capabilities in new measurements of jet-hadron correlations with identified hadrons and identified hadron ratios in jets in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 5.02~\\mathrm{TeV}$. The final state jet hadrochemical composition can differ from the vacuum due to medium-induced modifications to jet fragmentation or the medium response. Finally, the ALICE PID capabilities can also be exploited to study gluon jet fragmentation with the new LHC data in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6~\\mathrm{TeV}$.",

To achieve these goals, a precise tracking system is necessary. The tracking system of the sPHENIX detector consists of the MVTX, TPC, TPOT, and the Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT). The INTT is a two-layer barrel silicon tracker that plays a unique role among the tracking detectors. It is capable of bridging the tracks of the MVTX and the TPC. In addition, its precise timing resolution enables the INTT to associate individual tracks and events to eliminate pile-up events. The INTT barrel installation and cabling were completed in March 2023. We have since commissioned and confirmed installation procedures and detector responses.

      "Abstract": "Understanding the strong interaction between nucleons and hyperons is fundamental for the microscopic description of bound systems as well as for modeling the equation of the state of dense stellar objects, such as neutron stars. Conventional scattering and hypernuclei measurements are insufficient to support theoretical predictions about the interaction between hadrons containing strangeness. Recently, the ALICE Collaboration has shown that two-particle correlation measurements are a prominent tool for studying strong interaction in detail.\r\n\r\nDuring the ongoing Run 3 data-taking period at the LHC, the upgraded ALICE detector will deliver an increased luminosity that will enable precision studies of interactions in hadronic systems with strangeness up to S=-3 and with charm quark content. Consequently, it will be possible to test lattice QCD calculations and chiral effective field theory models with unprecedented accuracy. This will require constraining the emission source using correlation measurements of particle pairs for which the final-state interaction is well known. For this, the p-p correlations were measured for the first time in Run 3 and will be presented in this talk. In addition, the p-$\\Lambda$ correlation function was measured as a benchmark in the S=-1 sector. This is essential for the investigation of three-body nuclear forces, which are a vital missing element in the description of dense nuclear matter.

      "Abstract": "Nowadays, relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics including effects of finite viscosities is commonly used to extract transport properties of the quark gluon plasma (QGP), such as shear viscosity and bulk viscosity, from experimental data. However, according to the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in non-equilibrium statistical physics, fluctuations and dissipation are always accompanied with each other. Since phenomena induced by the hydrodynamic fluctuations, namely, thermal fluctuations associated with the viscosities, include the information of transport coefficients through FDR, these provide a multidimensional analysis of transport properties. Therefore, hydrodynamic fluctuations must be incorporated in the dynamical framework of relativistic heavy ion collisions. This could open up a new way of diagnosing the QGP properties precisely.\r\n\r\nWe derive equations of motion (EoM) of hydrodynamic fluctuations by considering the perturbative expansion of energy-momentum tensor around the Bjorken's boost invariant solution [1]. These EoMs are derived without any specific forms of constitutive equations contrary to a previous study in which constitutive equations from the first order dissipative hydrodynamics are assumed [2]. Therefore, this framework enables us to employ any kinds of constitutive equations at the second order dissipative hydrodynamics which satisfy the causality. This is the most precise framework in one-dimensional expanding system so far. With this framework, we describe the dynamics of (1+1)-dimensional causal hydrodynamic fluctuations and observe fluctuations of energy density are frozen in the early stage. It indicates that the distribution of energy density carries the information of the early stage of evolution. Furthermore, we analyze correlations of energy density fluctuations and find their behaviors are closely related with the properties of the medium such as relaxation time and sound velocity.\r\n\r\n[1] J.

The correlation functions are measured over a wide range of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle as a function of charged particle multiplicity. Previous measurement with LEP1 data at $\\sqrt{s}=91$ GeV shows no significant long-range correlations in either lab coordinate or thrust coordinate analyses, with associated yield distributions in agreement with predictions from the PYTHIA v6.1 event generator. The use of higher collision energy LEP2 data allows access to not only higher event multiplicitybut also to additional production channels beyond the $e^+e^- \\to \\gamma^\\star/Z \\to q\\bar{q}$ process. Notably, the highest multiplicity bin ($N_{\\rm trk} \\ge 50$) suggests a tantalizing disagreement with MC and implies the potential to search for collective phenomena in small systems. This measurement is pushing the studies of long-range correlation to the smallest collision system limit and includes the first flow coefficient ($v_n$) measurement in $e^+e^-$ collisions, which uses a Fourier decomposition analysis to quantify the anisotropy in the azimuthal two-particle correlation as a function of charged particles' transverse momentum.

      "Abstract": "The study of heavy-flavour mesons and baryons in hadronic collisions provides unique access to the properties of heavy-quark hadronisation in the presence of large partonic densities, where new mechanisms of hadron formation beyond in-vacuum fragmentation can emerge. Performing these measurements in intervals of charged particle multiplicities provides sensitivity to understand whether different hadronisation mechanisms are at play in small and large hadronic colliding systems.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, ALICE will present a selection of the latest charm and beauty production measurements in proton-proton (pp) collisions, which can shed light on the modification of the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanisms. New published results of the production of all prompt charm ground states in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which allowed us to measure the charm fragmentation fractions and the $\\mathrm{c\\bar{c}}$ production cross section at midrapidity, will be shown. The new final measurement of non-prompt $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}^+$ baryons in the same collision system will be discussed to provide a quantitative comparison between the hadronisation properties of beauty and charm hadrons.  \r\nNew measurements of $\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0,+}$ production as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, of $\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0}$ production in p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and the first measurement of $\\Xi_\\mathrm{c}^{0}$ production in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be also presented, shedding further light on the hadronisation of charm-strange baryons in different colliding systems. Finally, the status and prospects for the reconstruction of charm mesons and baryons on LHC Run 3 data, using the upgraded ALICE apparatus, will be shown for the first time.",

      "Abstract": "We propose a method to find local plane wave solutions to linearized equations of motion of relativistic hydrodynamics in inhomogeneous backgrounds, i.e., when fluid is rigidly moving with nonzero thermal vorticity in equilibrium. Our method is based on extending the conserved currents to the tangent bundle, using Wigner transforms. The Wigner-transformed conserved currents can then be Fourier transformed into the cotangent bundle to obtain the dispersion relations for space-time-dependent eigenfrequency. We show that the connection between the stability of hydrodynamics and the evolution of plane waves is not as straightforward as in the homogeneous case and is restricted to the equilibrium-preserving subspace of the cotangent bundle, which is determined by thermal vorticity. We apply this method to MIS theory and show that the interplay between the bulk viscous pressure and the shear stress tensor with acceleration and rotation leads to novel modes, as well as modifications of the already known ones.",

The study of these novel phenomena is of fundamental significance since they may reveal the topological structure of vacuum gauge fields, as well as the possible local violation of P and/or CP symmetries in strong interactions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present comprehensive measurements of anomalous chiral effects in Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively, with ALICE. The CME is studied using the charge-dependent two- and three-particle correlators. The Event Shape Engineering (ESE) technique, together with the Monte Carlo Glauber and T$_{\\rm R}$ENTo simulations of the magnetic field are employed to derive an upper limit on the CME signal. The ESE technique is also adopted to quantitatively constrain the strength of the CMW signal, which is examined by the correlation between the charge asymmetry and the elliptic flow. The CVE is studied using several combinations of azimuthal correlations between baryon pairs at different kinematic windows, such as $\\Lambda-p$, $\\Lambda-\\Lambda$ or $p-p$.

      "Abstract": "Two-particle correlation functions provide critical information about the medium quark--gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. Recent ALICE measurements have demonstrated large dynamical correlations between produced neutral and charged kaons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.76 $ TeV~\\cite{ALICE:2021fpb}. These integrated correlations cannot be described by conventional heavy-ion models, such as EPOS and AMPT. So far, the ALICE measurements can only be described by invoking the presence of condensates ~\\cite{Kapusta:2022ovq}. A candidate for such a condensate is the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC)~\\cite{Mohanty:2005mv}. DCC arises from chiral symmetry restoration in the QGP, which breaks during the phase transition to form a condensate which coherently emits hadrons. Therefore, the discovery of DCC would indicate that chiral symmetry is restored in the QGP, a major prediction of QGP formation that has yet to be confirmed experimentally. \r\n\r\nTo investigate these anomalous kaon correlations further, a differential analysis of two-particle angular correlation functions of charged and neutral kaons as a function of $\\Delta \\varphi$ and $\\Delta \\eta$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 5.02 $ TeV is intended.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of direct photons provide valuable information on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) because they are colour-neutral and created during all phases of the collision. Sources of photons include initial hard scatterings, Bremsstrahlung and the fragmentation process, jet-medium interactions, and radiation from the medium. \r\n\r\nDirect thermal photons, produced by the plasma, are sensitive to the collective flow at photon production time. Their exponential spectral shape gives access experimentally to an effective medium temperature.\r\nFurthermore, Bose-Einstein correlations can be used to study the space-time evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions with Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry. The correlation function is sensitive to the source size and the direct photon fraction.\r\n\r\nDirect prompt photons produced in hadronic collisions through annihilation and Compton processes have minimal event activity from the hard process, allowing the isolation method to suppress background photons from parton fragmentation and neutral meson electromagnetic decays. \r\nIsolated photon measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can constrain NLO pQCD predictions. Hadrons correlated with isolated photons are a promising channel to study the energy loss in heavy-ion collisions and to constrain the $Q^{2}$ of the initial hard scattering, obtaining information on the amount of energy lost by the parton recoiling off the photon. \r\n\r\nThe ALICE experiment reconstructs photons from conversion photons using its excellent tracking capabilities and directly in calorimeters. Combining these methods, ALICE can measure direct photons at mid-rapidity with transverse momentum from 0.4 GeV/$c$, where direct thermal photons should dominate until few GeV, then direct prompt photons take over and can be measured until about 100 GeV/$c$. \r\nThis talk presents ALICE measurements of direct-photon distributions using statistical (decay-photon subtraction, thermal photons) and isolation (prompt photons) methods in different collision systems and energies and their correlations.",

      "Abstract": "Jets provide a powerful tool to study the properties of hot nuclear matter and its effect on quantum processes. The degree of modification of jets by the medium depends on how well the medium can resolve the internal jet structure. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the multi-partonic structure of jets and their interaction with a strongly-interacting medium. Specifically, we focus on the R-dependence of the jet $v_2$ coefficients as a function of collision centrality, which provides a unique handle on coherence physics.\r\nUsing resummed quenching weights that incorporate both elastic and state-of-the-art radiative energy loss and embedding the system into a realistic heavy-ion environment, we compute the R-dependence of jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC. We observe a very mild R-dependence at RHIC kinematics, similar to what was found at the LHC. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data.\r\nFinally, we present results for the jet azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ as a function of R, which shows a sequential collapse of $v_2$ for moderate R jets towards the result for small R=0.1 as centrality is decreased. This behavior is due to the strong dependence of the decoherence angle $\\theta_c$ on the in-medium traversed length, which affects the size of the resolved phase-space over which quenching weights are resummed. Our results highlight the sensitivity of $v_2(R)$ to the typical value of $\\theta_c$ at a given centrality.",

To illustrate this, we study jet-particle correlations and the distributions of jet-induced identified particles with respect to the jet direction in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC via a multi-phase transport model. We find a strong enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios for associated particles at intermediate transverse momentum around the triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions, due to the coalescence of jet-excited medium partons. Since the lost energy from jets can diffuse to large angles, such baryon-to-meson-ratio enhancement is more pronounced for larger relative distance from the jet axis. We argue that the experimental confirmation of the enhancement of jet-induced baryon-to-meson ratios around the jets will provide an unambiguous evidence for the medium response to jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.\r\n[1] A.

All data have been collected by the STAR experiment in the fixed-target mode during the second phase of the RHIC beam energy scan program. The directed flow of hypernuclei shows a similar collision energy and mass dependence to light nuclei, as seen in the slope of $v_1$ at mid-rapidity $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$. This suggests that the two types of nuclei are formed in a similar way. We also observe that the slope $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$ decreases with increasing energy, with a stronger energy dependence for heavier nuclei. For light nuclei, the elliptic flow results indicate an out-of-plane expansion ($v_2 < 0$) at the lowest collision energy, whereas in-plane expansions ($v_2 > 0$) are evident at all other collision energies.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss these new results within the framework of a hadronic transport model in combination with coalescence after-burner calculations.",

Following the quantum kinetic theory, we decompose the polarization vector as the parts induced by thermal vorticity, shear tensor and the spin Hall effect (SHE). We find that the polarization induced by SHE and the total polarization strongly depends on the initial conditions.  At $7.7$GeV, SHE gives a sizeable contribution and even flips the sign of the local polarization along the beam direction for AMPT initial condition, which is not observed for SMASH initial condition. Meanwhile, the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction induced by SHE with AMPT initial condition does not always increase with decreasing collision energies. Next, we find that the polarization along the beam direction is sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient, but the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction is not.  Our results for the global polarization of $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ agree well with the STAR data. Interestingly, the global polarization of $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ is not always larger than that of $\\Lambda$ due to various competing effects.

The main STS functional building block is the detector module. It consists of a double-sided silicon sensor connected through a stack of low-mass microcables to the custom-developed readout ASICs on two front-end electronics boards. 876 modules are arranged in 8 tracking stations, where 1.8 million channels are read out with self-triggering electronics, matching the experiment’s data streaming and online event analysis concept. \r\nCurrently, the construction of the STS detector is progressing on several fronts. Firstly, the mechanical design is being finalized and tested, while the cooling concept is being assessed through a thermal demonstrator. In addition, modules assembled during pre-series are undergoing characterization, and the final production phase has begun, with multiple quality control steps in place to ensure reliable module performance and high production yield. The implementation of these quality control steps has involved the development of necessary hardware and software.

      "Abstract": "We present a new model for jet quenching via coherent gluon radiation and elastic scatterings off medium partons. The jet energy loss is simulated as a perturbative final-state vacuum parton shower followed by a medium-induced shower originating from elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. Above a phase threshold, the trial gluons will be formed and can produce coherent radiation themselves.\r\n\r\nThe model has been implemented in a Monte Carlo code and has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z prediction for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium. The realistic case with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. In particular, we show the influence of various parameters on the energy spectrum and transverse momentum distribution, such as the in-medium quark masses, the energy transfer in the recoil process, and the phase accumulation criteria, especially for low and intermediate energy gluons.\r\n\r\nThe model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind. As such, we also show the first results when the parton shower is coupled to realistic expanding medium modelled usign vHLLE code. Finally, we use Pythia for jet hadronization and draw a basic comparison to RHIC and LHC data.\r\n\r\nReference: to be submitted soon to arXiv/journal",

      "Abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, strong electromagnetic fields arising from the Lorentz-contracted, highly charged nuclei can be approximated as a large flux of high-energy quasi-real photons that can interact via the Breit-Wheeler process to produce $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs. The collision energy dependence of the cross section and the transverse momentum distribution of dielectrons from the Breit-Wheeler process in heavy-ion collisions are calculated with lowest-order EPA-QED. Within a given experimental kinematic acceptance, the cross section is found to increase while the pair transverse momentum decreases with increasing beam energy. The corresponding results are also compared with STAR measurements, which are consistent with each other and found to be sensitive to the nuclear charge distribution and the infrared-divergence of the ultra-Lorentz boosted Coulomb field. Following this approach we demonstrate that the experimental measurements of the Breit-Wheeler process in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be used to quantitatively constrain the nuclear charge radius. The extracted parameters show sensitivity to the impact parameter dependence, and can be used to study the initial-state and final-state effects in hadronic interactions.",

The cumulants of the distributions of the conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions can be related to the equation of state in lattice QCD (LQCD), making first-principles calculations accessible in the experiment. Recent results from LQCD suggest that the thermodynamic susceptibilities, which are related to the experimentally measurable cumulants of the conserved charges, are significantly affected by strong magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, measurements of the second-order cumulants of the (anti-)proton and net-proton numbers in Pb--Pb collisions with the ALICE detector at the LHC are presented. The moments of the net-proton number, used as a proxy for the baryon number, are calculated using the Identity Method to avoid the problem of misidentification. The new results cover a large momentum acceptance and the centrality range. The ratios of the cumulants in peripheral to central events give insight into the magnetic fields produced in the heavy-ion collisions.",

The positive skewness of the $\\langle p_{\\rm{T} }\\rangle$ fluctuation, which has been proposed as an essential consequence of the hydrodynamic evolution of the produced fireball in heavy-ion collisions, is observed. The kurtosis is found to decrease with increasing system size and saturates at the Gaussian expectation for most central Pb--Pb collisions.

      "Abstract": "The $B^\\pm$ meson is produced more frequently than any other meson containing beauty quarks in pp collisions at the LHC. Measuring its production cross-section is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows for testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Secondly, it provides an essential reference for measurements of its nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm A \\rm A}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The $B^\\pm$ meson $R_{\\rm A \\rm A}$ measurement can provide new constraints on the partonic energy loss mechanism in the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. Since the radiative energy loss depends heavily on the quark mass, the beauty quark, being the heaviest readily observable flavor, is a particularly valuable probe for investigating the mass dependence of the in-medium energy loss mechanisms. Due to its design, ALICE is unique in accessing beauty production in the low $p_{\\rm T}$-region at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$). \r\n\r\nThis poster shows a performance study of the exclusive reconstruction of the $B^\\pm$ meson at midrapidity through the decay channel $B^\\pm \\rightarrow J/\\psi + K^\\pm$, with the $J/\\psi$ reconstructed in its dielectron decay channel. Exclusive reconstruction of beauty mesons will be done for the first time in ALICE during LHC Run 3. In previous LHC runs, inclusive beauty hadron measurements were carried out via non-prompt $J/\\psi$ using the displacement of the secondary vertices with respect to the primary vertex. This study, however, relies on full reconstruction of the $B^\\pm$ meson candidate, taking advantage of the improved vertex resolution provided by the upgraded Inner Tracking System of ALICE, fully operational during the LHC Run 3. The poster will show the status of the $B^\\pm$ meson reconstruction and expected performance in pp collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm N \\rm N}} =$ 13.6 TeV at midrapidity.",

These collisions are considered to be an effective way to minimize the flow-driven background contribution to search for the possibly small CME signal. Anisotropic flow is an important tool to understand properties of the QGP medium. Elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is the second-order coefficient in the Fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane. Elliptic flow of charged hadrons has been measured in the isobar collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The magnitude of $v_{2}$ shows difference between the two isobar collisions despite the same nucleon number. This indicates a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between these nuclei. The $v_{2}$ measurements of the strange and multi-strange hadrons are excellent probes for understanding these initial state anisotropies of the medium produced in these collisions, owing to their smaller hadronic cross-section compared to light hadrons. The collected datasets include approximately two billion events per isobaric species, offering a unique opportunity for making this statistically hungry measurement.\r\nIn this poster, we will report measurements of the elliptic flow of $K_{s}^{0}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Lambda}$, $\\phi$, $\\Xi^{-}$, $\\overline{\\Xi}^{+}$, and $\\Omega^{-}$+ $\\overline{\\Omega}^{\\\r\n+}$ at mid-rapidity for Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) dependence of $v_{2}$ for minimum bias collisions and various centrality intervals will be shown. The $p_{T}$-integrated $v_{2}$ of these strange and multi-strange hadrons will also be shown. System size dependence of $v_{2}$ will be investigated by comparing the results in isobar collisions with those from Cu+Cu, Au+Au, and U+U collisions. The number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling for these strange hadrons will also be tested. Experimental data will be compared with transport model calculations to provide insight into the nuclear structure of the isobars.",

      "Country": "India",
      "Abstract": "Hadronic resonances are interesting candidates to study the properties of the hadronic phase, which is the time span between the chemical and kinetic freeze-outs,  formed during the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, comparable to the lifetime of hadronic phase ($\\sim$10 $-$ 12 fm/$c$), they decay in the hadronic phase and their decay products undergo rescattering or regeneration within the hadronic gas. Thus, the yields of the hadronic resonances alter than what was originally produced before the chemical freeze-out. This change in their yield, which is extensively studied to understand the properties of the hadronic phase, depends upon the lifeime of the decaying resonance, the interaction cross-sections of its decay daughters, and the lifetime of the hadronic phase.  \\\\\r\nIn this study, we explore the production yields of hadronic resonances by simulating pp, p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions at various centre of mass energies using the latest EPOS4 model. The EPOS4 model employs a comprehensive scheme for simulating high-energy particle collisions, which includes primary interactions based on S-Matrix theory, secondary interactions using a core-corona separation approach, hydrodynamic evolution, micro-canonical hadronization, and a final hadronic afterburner using UrQMD. This scheme allows for the simulation of parallel scatterings and accurately models the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions, thus providing some new understanding of a deep connection between four basic concepts in pp and AA collisions: parallel scattering, energy conservation, factorization, and saturation. We measure the transverse momentum spectra ( $p_{\\rm{T}}$ ), energy dependence of resonance production, ratio of yield of resonance particles to their corresponding stable particles, nuclear modification factor ( $R_{\\rm{pA}}$ and $R_{\\rm{AA}}$) for various hadronic resonances of different lifetimes and compare the results with the data available from the ALICE experiment at CERN.",

In addition, the ratio of $p_\\mathrm{T}$ spectra of $\\mathrm{\\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ in pp collisions, shows a separation between the highest and the lowest multiplicity classes within $5.3\\sigma$, with the maximum discrepancy occurring for $2\\ \\mathrm{GeV}/c<p_\\mathrm{T}<6\\ \\mathrm{GeV}/c$, suggesting that additional mechanisms, such as coalescence, might play a role in heavy quark hadronization. In p–Pb collisions, the $p_\\mathrm{T}$ behavior is similar to that observed in pp collisions but no strong multiplicity dependence is observed. In PYTHIA, the formation of hadrons is described by fragmentation of strings tuned from $\\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ and $\\mathrm{ep}$ collision measurements, and color reconnection mechanisms are necessary to capture the observed baryon to meson enhancement.

This poster reviews the details of $\\mathrm{\\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ analysis in pp and p–Pb collisions, and the comparison of data and models predictions.

We present the first measurements of the EECs for D$^0$-tagged jets in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. By comparing our results with EEC’s in inclusive (gluon-dominated) jets, we can search for modifications in the radiation pattern of jets due to mass effects such as the dead cone. We also compare with perturbative QCD predictions to measure the onset of non-perturbative physics.

Different observables of the jet-medium interaction probe the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and its dynamics. The bulk medium produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions is expected to be tilted with respect to the beam axis, while the hard scatterings are symmetric along the rapidity. This asymmetry between hard and soft processes coupled with in-medium interactions can induce a large rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) for jets. In fact, it has been observed that the $D^0$ mesons show a significantly larger $v_1$ signal as a function of rapidity compared to charged hadrons at the top-RHIC energy, reflecting the interplay between soft and hard processes. \r\n\r\nIn this poster, we report the first measurement of inclusive jets $v_{1}$ in isobar (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

      "Abstract": "The strangeness content of the final state in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been studied through measurements of kaons, Λ, Ξ and Ω baryons in pp, pA and AA collisions. $\\Sigma$ baryons contain a single strange quark and form a triplet, with the charge (+, 0, -) depending on the light quark content. In a thermal model scenario, these states are abundant enough to carry a significant fraction of the strangeness produced in the collision. However, the experimental measurement is challenging, and to date only $\\Sigma^{0}$ in 7 TeV pp collisions have been measured by ALICE, while few other experiments have measured the charged states at lower pp($\\rm p \\bar{p}$) collision energies.\r\nA number of methods to identify charged Σ have developed during the LHC Run 2. The decay $\\Sigma^{+}$ -> p $\\pi^{0}$ can be reconstructed via the direct detection of the proton and the two gammas from the $\\pi^{0}$ decay, either through them both converting to $\\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or through one converting and the other being reconstructed in the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS). Additionally, a method to detect anti-neutrons in the PHOS has been developed. This allows the (anti-$\\Sigma$)$^{\\pm}$ -> anti-n + $\\pi^{\\pm}$ decays to be reconstructed. We present the transverse momentum spectra of $\\Sigma^{+}$ and its charge conjugate anti-particle, in both minimum bias and high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. These are then compared to the latest MC simulations, including the tunes of PYTHIA, which best reproduce the existing hyperon data.\r\nWith the advent of Run 3, ALICE has improved the capability of the Inner Tracker, allowing the detection of the charged $\\Sigma$ particle with the reconstruction of its decay after traversing several detector layers. The performance of this novel reconstruction method is discussed. In addition, the prospects for measurements of the interaction between $\\Sigma$  and other baryon species will be discussed together with the implications for constraining the neutron star equation of state.",

Among them directed flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. It is an important probe to study the in-medium dynamics as it is sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of the produced medium. Minimum in the slope of directed flow ($dv_1/dy$) as a function of collision energy has been proposed as a signature of the first-order phase transition between hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma. The triangular flow $(v_3)$ typically arises from the initial condition fluctuations and is expected to be uncorrelated to the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\\Psi_{1}$).\r\nIn this poster, we will report measurements of  $v_1$ and $v_3$ for $\\pi$, $K$, $p$, $d$, and $t$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 4.5, 6.2, 7.2, and 7.7 GeV in fixed-target mode from the second phase of beam energy scan (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR.

      "Country": "NO",
      "Abstract": "In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the colliding nuclei are decelerated and kinetic energy is converted into new particles. This energy loss is referred to as baryon stopping. A fundamental question one can ask in the study of high energy heavy-ion collisions is how much baryon stopping there is. This can be quantified by measuring the net proton rapidity distributions. Previous measurements at RHIC and in fixed target experiments have shown that the amount of stopping decreases with increasing collision energy. At LHC energies, there are no experimental constraints beyond the central rapidity region, where there are no net protons.\r\n\r\nIn order to investigate the net proton distribution at LHC energies beyond mid-rapidity, we propose using the bremsstrahlung photons emitted from the nuclei as they slow down. In our recent study [1], we investigated stopping scenarios which are based on model calculations or phenomenology and consistent with existing data. Furthermore, we performed a detailed estimate of the background from hadronically produced photons, using the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator, aiming to investigate in which areas of phase space the bremsstrahlung photons constitute a viable observable for baryon stopping. The bremsstrahlung spectra are highly sensitive to the amount of nuclear stopping, and depending on the scenario, a significant signal over background is obtained for pseudorapidities η>∼4−5 and for photon energies ω<∼300−500MeV.\r\n\r\nHere, we expand our investigation to include the baryon stopping predicted by the EPOS4 event generator for PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN)=5.02TeV. EPOS4 gives zero net protons at mid-rapidity, making the bremsstrahlung spectrum from this stopping scenario plausible.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we discuss the bremsstrahlung spectrum coming from proton-proton collisions, which gives insight into the charge dependence of the signal to background ratio of bremsstrahlung photons in hadron collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

We employ various event generators in the study, including Pythia, Herwig and Sherpa for the proton-proton collision baseline. The Caeser framework is used to perform semi-numerical calculations for these observables. With the well-defined perturbative precision, non-perturbative contributions can be robustly extracted. For the medium jet substructure study, we investigate different Monte Carlo implementations of quenching models such as JETSCAPE, Jewel and QPythia. The jet observables have different sensitivities to physics ranging from parton shower to soft radiation, allowing us to quantify model differences and thereby point to modification patterns through which future experimental data may shed light on the nature of jet-medium interaction.",

      "Abstract": "Jet quenching measurements in heavy-ion collisions, such as the suppression of the jet yield compared to pp collisions, aim to elucidate the various mechanisms of parton energy loss. Differential measurements of the dependence of the inclusive jet nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) on the jet resolution parameter ($R$) may help disentangle energy loss mechanisms and discriminate between different jet quenching models. One recent $R$-dependence measurement by the ALICE collaboration hints that large-$R$ jets lose more energy. This result is inconsistent with the expectation that jets with larger radii will recover more of the energy redistributed to larger angles via jet-medium interactions. However, many models can describe the trend despite including different implementations of physics effects, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single energy loss mechanism. In this work, we utilize PYTHIA simulations coupled with phenomenologically-derived quenching to better understand the contribution of single effects to this observed $R$-dependence. These effects include the $R$-dependence of the vacuum jet spectrum, differences in energy loss of quark- and gluon-initiated jets, and the impact of wide-angle radiation recovered at large $R$. This work is carried out across RHIC and LHC $p_{\\rm T}$-scales, detector acceptances, and center-of-mass energies and compared to experimental data to help interpret experimental results.",

For the McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model, in many cases these expressions are shown to lead to solutions in closed analytic forms valid at all times. We also propose an alternative model which maintains UV-regularity by accounting for local correlations between color charges in the transverse plane, and softens the dependence on the IR-regulator by properly enforcing global color neutrality. The new model allows for a straight forward calculation of the time dependence of the gluon energy momentum tensor in early nuclear collisions in the weak field limit.

Therefore, measuring the beam energy dependence of J/$\\psi$ production will help disentangle different effects.\r\nIn this poster, we report the measurements of inclusive J/$\\psi$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV using the Beam Energy Scan Phase II (BES-II) data recorded by the STAR experiment. The J/$\\psi$ invariant yields and nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) are presented as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. Beam energy dependence of J/$\\psi$ $R_{AA}$ is discussed together with model comparisons.",

Imbedding the resulting pNJL partonic transport model in an extended multiphase transport (extended AMPT) model, we then study the elliptic flow splittings between particles and their antiparticles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at beam energy scan energies. We find that a weak quark vector interaction in the partonic phase is able to describe the elliptic flow splitting between protons and antiprotons in heavy-ion collisions at √sNN = 7.7 to 39 GeV. Knowledge of the quark vector interaction is useful for understanding the equation of state of quark matter at large baryon chemical potentials and thus the location of the critical point in the QCD phase diagram.",

      "Abstract": "When a jet injects energy and momentum into a droplet of QGP, it generates a wake that, after the QGP hadronizes, results in the creation of soft and semi-hard particles correlated with the jet direction. This medium response phenomenon plays a crucial role in describing various jet observables, as demonstrated by many jet quenching studies. However, the computational complexity of current techniques used to describe these wakes has hindered a thorough understanding of their phenomenological consequences. In this talk we will describe a computationally efficient approach to determine the properties of hadrons generated by QGP wakes on an event-by-event, jet-by-jet basis. Using a library of template solutions obtained within linearized hydrodynamics on a Bjorken flow, and employing the appropriate set of scalings, translations, rotations, and boosts to build the wake of any jet via superposition of templates, we achieve results similar to those obtained through 3+1D hydrodynamics, but with a computational cost that is orders of magnitude smaller.",

      "Abstract": "Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\\Delta\\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In this contribution, we report a fresh investigation of charge separation in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=200$ GeV with the STAR detector using the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) approach [1]. Our approach has several novel aspects, such as using three subevents to identify dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ by using subevent different from particles of interest for the ESE selection. Since the CME is a low-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ phenomenon, we further apply the ESE differentially to the $\\Delta\\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{inv}$), particularly at lower $m_{inv}$, which is dominated by a larger fraction of low-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ pions. We extract the signal as the intercept by projecting $\\Delta \\gamma$ to zero $v_{2}$, both integrated over inclusive mass and at low mass. Our results suggest non-zero intercept with an approximately 2$\\sigma$ significance, which we compare to the published results from the spectator/participant measurement [2]. The extracted signals, highly sensitive to the CME, may still be contaminated by residual flow as well as nonflow contributions\r\nin the $v_{2}$ measurement and in the three-particle correlator [3]. We investigate these contaminations in the ESE measurement, and also report measurement using the zero-degree calorimeter (ZDC) that largely supresses the nonflow contamination. We discuss the implications of our results and perspectives with the expected 10-fold increase in statistics from the RHIC runs in the years 2023 and 2025. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] J. Schukraft, A.

Jet quenching is also a consequence of QGP formation, but no significant evidence of it in small systems has been found to date. Measuring or constraining the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems is essential to determine the limits of QGP formation. The ALICE collaboration presents a broad search for jet quenching in high multiplicity (HM) pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, based on several observables: the semi-inclusive acoplanarity distribution of jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\\text{T}}$ hadron (h+jet); di-hadron correlations; and intra-jet measurements. Marked broadening of the h+jet acoplanarity distribution is observed in HM compared to minimum-bias (MB) events, which could arise from jet quenching. Both data and PYTHIA simulations suggest that this broadening arises from a generic bias of the HM selection towards multi-jet final states. In contrast, the di-hadron correlations between low-momentum particles exhibit azimuthal narrowing in HM relative to MB events, which are described by PYTHIA simulations and might arise from a similar HM bias. We also report the average charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation functions in HM and MB-selected populations, whose differences are qualitatively described by PYTHIA.

Collisions of deformed nuclear enhance the fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients $v_n$ and event-wise mean transverse momentum $[p_T]$, therefore offering a viable approach to establish clear correspondences between the structure of colliding nuclei and the final state observables.\r\n\r\nWe present measurements of $v_n$, $[p_T]$ fluctuations as well as $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations from the STAR experiment. Significant differences are observed for [$p_T$] fluctuations and $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations between $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au and $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions, which can be quantitatively explained by the large prolate deformation of $^{238}$U with $\\beta_{2, \\mathrm{U}} \\sim 0.28$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{U}} \\sim 0$. Striking differences are also observed in isobar collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, where ratios of many observables show significant deviations from unity and exhibit rich patterns as a function of centrality. A comparison with hydrodynamic model simulations suggests a large quadrupole deformation in Ru nucleus with $\\beta_{2, \\mathrm{Ru}} \\sim 0.16$ and a large octupole deformation in $^{96}$Zr nucleus with $\\beta_{3, \\mathrm{Zr}} \\sim 0.2$. The non-monotonic dependence of ratios of multiplicity distribution, $v_2$, and $[p_T]$ fluctuations in the mid-central collisions also requires a difference in the surface diffuseness between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr in the model\r\ncalculations. Combining all these observables, we can precisely constrain the parameters associated with various nuclear deformations in isobar nuclei. Building on our pioneering demonstration of nuclear structure effects, we present a more precise quantitative extraction of the quadrupole and octupole deformation parameters in $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei using heavy-ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "The observation of hyperon polarization has revealed the existence of large vorticities in the medium created by heavy-ion collisions. Global polarization indicates vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to the system's orbital angular momentum, while local polarization indicates vorticities along the beam direction due to anisotropic transverse expansion of the medium. With the high-statistics data collected by the STAR experiment for isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, we present the measurements of global polarization for $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, and $\\Xi^{\\pm}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azimuthal angle relative to the event plane. These measurements allow us to study possible magnetic field driven effects through the polarization difference between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr, owing to a larger magnetic field expected in the former. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the first measurements of $\\Lambda$ hyperon local polarization along the beam direction relative to the second and third-order event planes in isobar collisions will be presented. Comparisons with previous measurements in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC will be performed to gain important insights into the collision system size and energy dependence of the vorticities in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nPrevious measurements have shown a similar trend in the energy dependence between the global polarization and the slope of directed flow, suggesting a strong correlation between the initial tilt of the system and the vorticity [1]. For the first time, this correlation is investigated, and the dependence of the $\\Lambda$ global polarization as well as directed flow on the first-order flow vector ($q_1$) is presented in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 19.6$ GeV.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

      "Abstract": "Event classifiers based either on the charged-particle multiplicity or on event topologies, such as spherocity and Underlying Event, have been extensively used in proton-proton (pp) collisions by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. These event classifiers became very useful tools since the observation of fluid-like behavior in high multiplicity pp collisions, for example radial and anisotropic flow. Furthermore, the study as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the forward V0 ALICE detector allowed for the discovery of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, one drawback of the multiplicity-based event classifiers is that, requiring a high charged-particle multiplicity, biases the sample towards hard processes like multijet final states. These biases blur the effects of multi-parton (MPI) interactions and make it difficult to pin down the origins of fluid-like effects.\r\n\r\nThis contribution explores the use of a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, defined in ALICE using the charged-particle multiplicity estimated  in 2.8 < η < 5.1 and −3.7 < η < −1.7 intervals. New final results on the production of pions, kaons, protons, and unidentified charged particles at midrapidity (|η| < 0.8) as a function of flattenicity in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV will be discussed. It will be shown how flattenicity can be used to select events more sensitive to MPI and less sensitive to final state hard processes. All the results are compared with predictions from QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators such as PYTHIA and EPOS. Finally, a preliminary study using the flattenicity estimator using Run 3 data will be shown.",

      "Abstract": "Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Indeed, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by available theoretical models. Quarkonium polarization measurements provide also stringent tests of theoretical approaches, as this observable strongly depends on the quarkonium production mechanism at play. Another way to provide constraints on quarkonium production mechanisms is by looking at the production of J/$\\psi$ inside jets. For instance, quarkonium production in a parton shower predicts that J/$\\psi$ mesons are rarely produced in isolation, contrary to expectations from direct quarkonium production via parton-parton scattering. The measurement of quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions can also provide a reference for investigating the fate of charmonium in the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. ALICE can measure inclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$), at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\\it{y}$|< 0.9). Prompt and non-prompt charmonium separation is performed at midrapidity down to low $p_{\\rm{T}}$. In this contribution, we will report on recent quarkonium results in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, including Υ(nS) cross section measurements and Υ(1S) polarization at forward rapidity, as well as the prompt and non-prompt J/$\\psi$ production in jets at midrapidity. The status of new J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) polarization analyzes at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and forward rapidity will be shown. Finally, the status of new ongoing quarkonium production analyses using the Run 3 data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV will be shown both at mid and forward rapidities.

While estimates of differential azimuthal anisotropies, which we label $v^\\prime_n$, have been experimentally measured for various rare probes, the fluctuations in $v^\\prime_n$ have not been systematically studied. \r\n\r\nWe present a statistical formalism for the study of $v^\\prime_n$ and its correlations with the integrated azimuthal anisotropies (reference flow), $v_n$, by constructing correlators of azimuthal angles from multiple rare probe objects. We then construct multivariate cumulants and moments using these correlators, which can measure fluctuations to arbitrary order in $v'_n$. The experimental methods and procedures for computing these quantities are also discussed. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate how the measurements of the moments and cumulants can constrain the event by event distribution of $v'_n$, we propose a bivariate copula model to parametrize $v^\\prime_n$ and $v_n$, and their correlations. We are able to constrain parameters in the marginal distributions for $v'_n$ by sampling the distribution and evaluating joint moments of $v^\\prime_n$ and $v_n$.",

Our current knowledge of fragmentation functions is almost exclusively based on fits to data from $e^+ e^-$ collisions and semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes, both of which are mainly sensitive to quark fragmentation, leaving gluon fragmentation functions poorly constrained. Hadronic collisions at the LHC, however, produce data rich in gluon-initiated final states and offer excellent opportunities to study gluon fragmentation directly. In this poster, we present the potential for ALICE to investigate gluon fragmentation with unprecedented precision by measuring fragmentation into baryons and mesons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13.6$~TeV.",

Precise determination of dense baryonic matter properties requires multi-differential measurements of strange hadron yields and their collective flow, both for the most copiously produced $K_s^0$ and Λ as well as for rare (multi-)strange hyperons and their antiparticles.\r\n\r\nIn CBM strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ are reconstructed by their weak decays  using a Kalman Filter algorithm. A machine learning model based on boosted decision trees (XGBoost) is used to make a non-linear multi-parameter selection according to the topology of the decay with high purity and high background rejection. For the rare $Ξ^-$ baryon a special selection using two consecutive XGBoost models is used. The yield of the strange hadrons is extracted multi-differentially using a multi-step fitting routine, where each $p_T$-$y$-interval has its separately trained machine learning model.\r\n\r\nThe CBM performance for multi-differential analysis of yields and collective flow of strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ will be presented together with an estimation of systematic uncertainties.

Strangeness production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of the nuclear matter, such as the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at the chemical freeze-out temperature ($\\mu_S/T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ and $\\mu_B/T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$).\r\n\r\nMeasurements from the first phase of the BES program have indicated potential changes in the medium properties with decreasing collision energy.

During BES phase-II (BES-II), STAR has accumulated high statistics data in Au+Au collisions at various energies, which can help reduce the uncertainties in the strange hadron measurements, in particular for the multi-strange hadrons. Benefiting from the iTPC upgrade, the strangeness measurements are now extended from mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) to a larger rapidity range (|y|<1.0) as well.

      "Abstract": "The long-range ($|\\Delta\\eta| \\gt 2$) near-side ($\\Delta\\phi\\approx0$) ridge structure in a two-particle correlation analysis has been observed in heavy ion collision, which was well-explained by the hydrodynamic models based on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) effect. However, even though small systems such as pp and pPb collisions cannot have enough density and temperature to create the QGP matter, the ridge phenomenon appeared in high multiplicity events of small systems, which is controversial in the hydrodynamic models. Among numerous models to explain this phenomenon in small systems, the Momentum Kick Model (MKM) can give a description of it via a kinematic process where the high-momentum jet particles transfer their momentum to the medium partons called a ``kick\" process, leading to collective motion which becomes the ridge phenomenon in the MKM. The MKM has been applied to various experimental data, such as the STAR and the PHENIX, and has shown good agreement. Furthermore, since the ridge yields are dependent on multiplicity in high-energy collision experiments, C. Y. Wong built a multiplicity dependence on the MKM through an impact parameter and applied it to the CMS data for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV.\r\nRecently, the CMS Collaboration measured the ridge yields along the different $p_T$ and multiplicity ranges for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. To verify the MKM with multiplicity dependence, we expand the model analysis at 7 TeV to those at 13 TeV and provide the theoretical basis on two questions raised by the CMS Collaboration; the linearity of the ridge yield with multiplicity and the prominence at the middle $p_T$ range. Moreover, the CMS Collaboration suggested that the ridge structure does not have the collision energy dependence for pp collisions by comparing the ridge yields at 7 TeV with those at 13 TeV. From this surmise, we predict the future ridge behavior of the LHC Run3 at $\\sqrt{s}=5.3$ and $8.5$ TeV.",

      "Abstract": "In heavy ion collisions, the initial state geometry plays a crucial role in determining final state observables such as elliptic flow $v_2$ and radial flow reflected by event-wise average transverse momentum $[p_{\\rm T}]$. The initial state geometry is influenced by several nuclear shape parameters, including quadrupole deformation (β), triaxiality (γ) [1], nuclear radius (r), and skin depth (a) [2]. It is known from low-energy physics that many atomic nuclei exhibit a quadrupole shape that fluctuates around an average profile. This talk investigates the impact of nuclear shape fluctuations on initial state geometry in heavy ion collisions, focusing on eccentricity ($\\epsilon_2$) and inverse transverse size ($d_⊥$), which are linearly related to fluctuations of flow, i.e. $v_2 \\propto \\epsilon_2$ and $\\delta [p_T]\\propto \\delta d_{\\perp}$, and comparing them across different system sizes. Our aim is to quantify the effects of these parameters on initial state observables in a coherent manner. We show that overall quadrupole deformation fluctuations enhance the cumulants of $\\epsilon_2$ and $d_⊥$, while triaxiality fluctuations reduce the differences between prolate and oblate nuclei. Our results suggest that, in the large fluctuation limit, the initial state observables' values approach those obtained in collisions of rigid triaxial nuclei.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  [Impact of nuclear shape fluctuations in high-energy heavy ion collisions]\r\n[2]  [Scaling approach to nuclear structure in high-energy heavy-ion collisions]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Impact of nuclear shape fluctuations in high-energy heavy ion collisions]: https://rdcu.be/dbEns\r\n[Scaling approach to nuclear structure in high-energy heavy-ion collisions]:https://journals.aps.org/prc/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.L021901",

The strangeness population factor, $S_{\\rm A}=(^{A}_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm{H}/^{A}\\mathrm{He})/(\\Lambda/p)$ (A=3,4), is of particular interest as it directly relates to the ratio of light nuclei and hypernuclei coalescence parameters $B_{A}$.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "The validity of the Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM) has been successfully tested to adequately reproduce hadronic particle abundances over nine orders of magnitude in high energy collisions of heavy ions.  Assuming a thermally equilibrated system, experimental particle yields at RHIC and the LHC serve as an anchor for the determination of common freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram -- namely, the baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$) and the chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$) -- via thermal fits in the SHM framework. Heavy flavor particle production is of particular interest in heavy ion phenomenology by virtue of the large difference between the mass of the bare heavy quarks and the calculated pseudocritical hadronization temperature. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in the initial hard partonic scattering of heavy ion collisions. The produced charm and beauty quarks then interact with other constituents of the collision fireball and then potentially thermalize. These heavy quarks can then recombine with the surplus of deconfined light flavor quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma generated in a heavy ion collision; where the total number of constituent heavy quarks is assumed to stay constant until hadronization is reached. This thermal-like behavior of final state heavy flavor hadron yields allows for their production to be modeled in the context of the SHM using an additional fugacity parameter. In this contribution, we will show recent thermal fits to single charm hadrons measured in ALICE Pb+Pb Collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV and STAR Au+Au Collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV utilizing the same PDG2016+ hadronic spectrum as our previous work and a modified version of the most recent PDG2022 list. We will additionally show thermal model predictions of heavy quarkonia, and beauty and multi-charm hadron yields as a function of $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ and test their sensitivity to different values of $T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$.",

      "Abstract": "The initial state of heavy-ion collisions has a short lifetime and cannot be directly measured. As a result, various initial condition models exist. Although averaged event observables with different initial condition models give comparable results, event by event analysis can help to identify systematic differences.  To determine the initial conditions is crucial to assess systematic uncertainties of Bayesian analysis, that aim at the extraction of transport coefficients from experimental data. The qualitative impact of the choice of initial conditions in hydrodynamical simulations is studied on an event-by-event basis in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid\\textsuperscript{1}, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH\\textsuperscript{2} and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE\\textsuperscript{3,4}. Event-by-event correlations are studied for SMASH IC as well as for IP-Glasma and TRENTO, with and without early time out-of-equilibrium dynamics, for Au-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in different centrality classes.\r\n We observe that the initial state eccentricities $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\epsilon_3$ are, depending on the setup and the model, not independent and show correlations which also result due to the assumed linear response of flow to eccentricity\\textsuperscript{5} in correlations between the elliptic and triangular flow. Additionally, we also study initial momentum space information present in the SMASH and IP-Glasma initial condition models. We find that for very spherical events, the initial state momentum anisotropy significantly contributes to the final state momentum anisotropy, which means that the description of such events is especially sensitive to the choice of the initial state model.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] https://github.com/smash-transport/smash-vhlle-hybrid \r\n[2] https://github.com/smash-transport/smash \r\n[3] https://github.com/yukarpenko/vhlle \r\n[4] I.

The angular velocity of rotation is assumed to be much smaller than the inverse magnetic length, which allows us to ignore the effects of the causal boundary. Using the exact solution of the Dirac equation, we calculated the spectrum and intensity of electromagnetic radiation. The rotation significantly impacts the radiation intensity and is relevant to the relativistic heavy-ion phenomenology. The presentation is partially based on *Phys.Rev.D* 107 (2023) 5, L051901.",

      "Abstract": "For decades, heavy quarks and their bound states have served as ideal experimental and theoretical probes of the medium formed in heavy ion collisions. Specifically, suppression of heavy-heavy bound states in heavy ion relative to proton-proton collisions was postulated as a strong signal of the formation of a deconfined quark gluon plasma. More recently, the use of effective field theories (EFTs) and the formalism of open quantum systems (OQS) has allowed for great advances in first principles descriptions of in-medium heavy-heavy bound states. Using EFTs, one can systematically exploit the hierarchies of scale of the combined system to arrive at an effective description valid in a particular regime while the OQS formalism enables a quantum description of a system evolving coupled to and out of equilibrium with an environment. In this talk, we present recent results obtained by solving the Lindblad equation derived using the EFT potential nonrelativistic QCD and the OQS formalism describing the in-medium evolution and suppression of the Υ(1S), Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) states. We emphasize our good agreement with experimental data from the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS collaborations and the necessity of quantum regeneration to accurately describe the suppression of the excited states and double ratios thereof.",

The presence of a chiral imbalance can be detected in HIC by looking at observables related to the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). In off-central collisions,the nuclear matter also posses a very large vorticity. In order to preserve causality, a rotating system can not extend to infinity but must be confined in a finite region, for instance by means of a boundary condition.\r\n\r\nWe study a free gas of massless fermions confined in a finite cylinder in the presence of a constant magnetic field and with chiral imbalance. We impose the boundary condition using the MIT bag model and we compute the CME. We find that in a cylinder with fixed radius the CME current is decreasing for magnetic fields below a critical value that depend on the radius. Estimates and consequences in HIC are discussed.",

For the first time, we show that QCD kinetic theory smoothly connects these values to the later hydrodynamic ones, providing the missing link for a consistent $\\hat q$ evolution. We find that its evolution during the bottom-up kinetic scenario shows little sensitivity to the initial conditions, jet energies and models of the transverse momentum cutoff. We also observe that, similarly to the glasma case, the jet quenching parameter is enhanced along the beam axis as compared to the transverse direction during most of the kinetic evolution. With our results, jet quenching can thus become a promising experimental probe to gain insight into the nonequilibrium properties of the quark-gluon plasma.",

A perturbative calculation up to the one-loop order indicates that the momentum broadening of jets is enhanced at both the high temperature and high chemical potential, and approximately proportional to the parton number density in the partonic phase. We further investigate the behavior of $\\hat{q}$ in the vicinity of the critical endpoint (CEP) by coupling our calculation with a recently developed equation of state that includes a CEP in the universality class of the Ising model, from which we discover the partonic critical opalescence (PCO) -- a prominent enhancement of the momentum broadening of jets near CEP, contributed by the scatterings via the $\\sigma$ exchange process.

Charmonia are bound states of charm and anti-charm quark pairs. Their production process can be factorized  into two stages: the heavy quark production and the formation of the bound state. The former happens within initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfers, and can be well described by perturbative QCD. The second one, which involves long distances and soft momentum scales, is a typical non-perturbative process.  Measurements of J/$\\psi$ and $\\psi$(2S) cross section in pp collisions are crucial for studying charmonium production mechanisms and testing different QCD-based model calculations.

They can be related to the cumulants of the considered net-charges, for which STAR collaboration recently published experimental measurements of proxies, in Au-Au collisions at several energies of the Beam Energy Scan. Hence, the measured (co)variances of $\\pi^\\pm$, $p/\\overline{p}$ and $K^\\pm$ are used to build proxy ratios for the corresponding $2^\\text{nd}$ order cumulant ratios of electric charge Q, baryonic number B and strangeness S.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless important to disentangle the different effects contributing to these net-multiplicity cumulants of hadronic species, in addition to the fluctuations which they are supposed to probe. For this reason, we studied the impact of hadronic cascades on these observables, thanks to complete simulations of Au-Au collisions performed with EPOS 4. The results are compared with cumulant ratios of exact conserved charges, and proposed enhanced proxy ratios based on a study of the hadronic breakdown contributions to the total susceptibilities with lQCD and HRG model calculations.\r\n\r\nWe show that the use of $\\Lambda$ baryons variance, additionally to $\\sigma^2_\\pi$, $\\sigma^2_p$ and $\\sigma^2_K$ used by STAR, allow to build proxies that reconstruct quantitatively better the ratios of $B,Q$ and $S$ correlations.

      "Abstract": "The spin alignment of vector mesons emitted in heavy-ion collisions has recently been measured by the ALICE and STAR collaborations over a wide range of energies  [1, 2]. The alignment is part of the so-called tensor polarization, which is a property that is exclusive to particles of spin 1 and higher. Even though there have been substantial theoretical efforts, a definite explanation for the tensions between theory and experiments does not yet exist.\r\n\r\nIn this work [3], we derive an expression for the tensor polarization of a system of massive spin-1 particles in a hydrodynamic framework. Starting from quantum kinetic theory based on the Wigner-function formalism, we employ a modified method of moments which also takes into account all spin degrees of freedom. We find that the tensor polarization is independent of the nonlocal part of the collision term and sourced by the usual dissipative quantities of the fluid, i.e., the bulk-viscous pressure, the particle-diffusion current, and the shear-stress tensor. As an example, we compute the relevant transport coefficient in the case of an uncharged fluid, where, neglecting bulk effects, the tensor polarization is determined solely by the shear-stress tensor. In order to quantify this polarization effect, we provide a formula which can be used for numerical calculations of vector-meson spin alignment in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

The Energy-Energy correlator (EEC) is a jet substructure observable used to study the time evolution of the parton shower. This observable re-contextualizes jet substructure study by using the distribution of angular distance of all combinations of two final state particles within a jet weighted by the product of the fractions of jet energy carried by each constituent. With this definition, the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD effects can be separated without the need for re-clustering or rejection of soft constituents. The EEC distribution cleanly reveals the separation between these two regimes: i) from the free hadrons phase at small opening angles, and ii) from the perturbative fragmentation of quarks and gluons at large opening angles. \r\n\r\nIn this poster, the first measurement of the corrected EEC distribution at RHIC is presented using $pp$ collision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV collected by the STAR experiment. The EEC is shown differentially in jet transverse momentum and compared to predictions from the Monte-Carlo event generator PYTHIA-8 and next-to-leading-logarithmic pQCD calculation.

      "Abstract": "A quark is a subatomic particle, composed of the mass, electric charge, and color charge, the three fundamental elements found in the nature. Among these three fundamental elements, there are four fundamental interactions, which are the gravitational force between masses, the electromagnetic force between electric charges, the strong force between color charges, and the weak force between electric and color charges. Inside a quark, the weak force or interaction between electric and color charges influences and excites the quark, which relaxes and transits from one state to another by emitting a quark-antiquark pair, in analogy to the emission of a photon by an excited electron in an atom. A quark and an antiquark with either the same or different flavors and states combine to form a meson when they couple together via mainly the strong interaction, a charged lepton when they annihilate their color charges and combine their electric charges and masses, a neutrino when they annihilate both their color and electric charges and combine their masses, and a photon or gamma ray when they entirely annihilate all their mass, electric, and color charges. The decay of a particle (e.g. the beta decay of a neutron) with formation of leptons involves one or more quark-antiquark pair emissions and annihilations. This multi-pair quark and antiquark emission and annihilation process establishes a fine structure of the Feynman diagram for the quark decay with lepton formation and indicates the formed leptons as products rather than participants of the weak interaction. This study attempts to fully explain and describe how various possible particles (far more than the discovered so far) are formed, generated, decayed, and interacted via quark excitations, degenerations, pair productions and annihilations. We aim at advancing and developing the standard model of particle physics and quantum chromodynamics in terms of innovatively theorizing the weak interaction as an interaction between electric and color charges and creatively modelling quarks with two flavors and multiple excitations.

Our study is based on the quantum kinetic theory of spinning quarks and antiquarks and incorporates the relaxation of the dynamically generated spin polarization. The spin density matrix of vector mesons is obtained by quark coalescence via the Wigner function and kinetic equation. Our approach predicts a local spin correlation that is distinct from the non-local expressions previously obtained in phenomenological derivations. We estimate the magnitude of such local correlations in the glasma model of the preequilibrium phase of relativistic heavy ion collisions. It is found that the resulting spin alignment could be greatly enhanced and may be comparable to the experimental measurement in order of magnitude. We further propose new phenomenological scenarios to qualitatively explain the transverse-momentum and centrality dependence of spin alignment in a self-consistent framework.",

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia and open heavy-flavor hadrons are important probes to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are primarily generated at initial hard platonic scatterings and undergo the whole QGP evolution. Therefore, they are excellent probes of the QGP properties.Production of quarkonia depends on the dissociation and regeneration processes in the QGP, and also on the cold nuclear matter effect. To disentangle these effects and infer QGP properties, it is important to carry out differential precision measurements for various quarkonium states at different collision energies and system sizes. The STAR experiment offers opportunity to study the energy and colliding system size dependence of heavy-flavor production through large statistics samples of isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}{\\rm Ru}+^{96}_{44} \\rm Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}{\\rm Zr}+^{96}_{40}{\\rm Zr}$) at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, as well as Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6, 27 GeV and 54 GeV collected in the phase II of Beam Energy Scan program.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, the first measurements of $\\psi(2\\rm{S})$ and $J/\\psi$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, performed in isobaric collisions, will be presented. Centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the ratio of $\\psi(2\\rm{S})$ yield over that of $J/\\psi$ will be shown. These results together with measurements of the $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ states yield suppression allow a comprehensive study of binding energy dependent modifications to the quarkonium production in the medium. $J/\\psi$ polarization measurement provides a new angle for studying QGP properties and the $J/\\psi$ production mechanism. New measurments of inclusive $J\\psi$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV will be also presented. Furthermore, measurements of central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factors (R$_{\\rm CP}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of HFE in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 54.4GeV will be shown.",

      "Abstract": "Constraining the initial strong electromagnetic field effects, three-dimensional structure of the initial state, and the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at different temperatures ($T$), and baryon chemical potentials ($\\mu_B$) are critical objectives of the heavy-ion program at RHIC. The dominance of Faraday+Coulomb effect during the initial stages of non-central heavy ion collisions is predicted to result in a negative $\\Delta v_1$, defined by the difference in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) between positively and negatively charged particles. With the large dataset accumulated in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) phase II of STAR, we probe the beam energy dependence of $\\Delta v_{1}$  for charged pions, kaons, and protons as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum ($p_T$), and centrality at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 - 7.7 GeV. Our results support the notion of stronger $\\Delta v_{1}$ at lower collision energies, expected due to the longer lifetime of the electromagnetic field and shorter lifetime of the fireball and a stronger effect with increasing $p_T$.\r\n\r\nThe flow angular decorrelations ($r_n(\\eta)$) are sensitive to the 3D initial state,  and new observables such as the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\\Delta\\eta, \\Delta\\varphi)$ and flow-magnitude and flow angular correlations are sensitive to the  %the viscous attenuation in the final state  transport parameters of the evolution. We present new measurements of the beam energy dependence of higher-order flow-angular de-correlations $r_n(\\eta)(n=2,3)$, the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\\Delta\\eta, \\Delta\\varphi)$, higher-order flow-angular correlation $\\langle\\cos(a_{1}n_{1}\\Psi_{n1}+\\cdots+a_{k}n_{k}\\Psi_{nk})\\rangle$ and higher-order flow-magnitude correlations $SC(n,m)\\{4\\}$ and $SC(n,m)\\{6\\}$ for various event-shape and centrality selections of Au+Au collisions in different BES energies ( $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 - 11.5 GeV) at RHIC. We observe a non-monotonic behavior in the longitudinal width of $G_{2}(\\Delta\\eta, \\Delta\\varphi)$ with the collision energy, which is expected to be proportional to $\\eta/s$ according to the ansatz proposed by S. Gavin et. al.~[1]. Through these measurements we aim to gain insights into the role of electromagnetic fields and transport parameters of the QGP by disentangling the initial and final state effects.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

      "Abstract": "Previous analyses have shown a narrowing effect in the inclusive jet substructure. While this narrowing effect could be a result of jet quenching, it could also be caused due to a selection bias by which very quenched and broader jets are filtered out from the considered jet transverse momentum window. Photon-tagged jets, which correspond to a quark-enriched sample, can significantly reduce this potential selection bias and the effect coming from the change in the quark versus gluon fraction. They also allow for a selection on the degree of quenching. In this presentation, we show new photon-tagged jet results using proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV recorded with the CMS detector in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We present the decorrelation of jet axes calculated with energy-weighted and winner-take-all recombination schemes and compare the results between photon-tagged jets and inclusive jets. We also explore the modification of the groomed jet radius and angularity in PbPb collisions relative to pp collisions for jets that have lost up to 60\\% of their initial energy in the medium. The findings of these studies will contribute to a better understanding of the quark-gluon plasma and its properties.",

However, the experimental observables for the chiral magnetic/vortical effect (CME/CVE) are dominated by elliptic flow and nonflow backgrounds.  Recent STAR isobar data revealed a substantial background in the CME observable that prevented an unambiguous observation of the difference between two isobars. The Au+Au system has significant advantages over the isobar collisions, such as the larger magnetic fields and the lower statistical fluctuations.\r\n\r\nWe improve the analysis method with event shape variables (ESV), and apply it to  Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV in the search of the CME and CVE. After categorizing events based on ESV and extrapolating the CME/CVE observable towards zero flow limit, we report the $\\Delta \\gamma$ measurements using $h$-$h$  and $\\Lambda$-$p$ correlations. To fully assess the possible CME signal, we employ a broad spectrum of observables and analysis techniques: with and without the particle pair information in constructing ESVs, utilizing invariant mass for differential studies, exploiting STAR Event Plane Detector and Zero-Degree Calorimeter to minimize nonflow backgrounds.

      "Abstract": "A key open question in the study of multi-particle production in high-energy $pp$ collisions is the relationship between the \"ridge\" - observed azimuthal correlations between particles in the underlying event that extend over all rapidities and hard or semi-hard scattering processes. In particular, it is not known whether jets or their soft fragments are correlated with particles in the underlying event. This talk presents measurements of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with two different particle-pair selections. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. This shows that excluding charged particles associated with jets does not affect the measured correlations. In the second case, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. Particles associated with jets do not exhibit any significant azimuthal correlations with the underlying event, ruling out hard processes contributing to the ridge.",

They are the ideal probe to investigate the properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions as they experience the whole QGP evolution.

Moreover, measurements in p+p collisions provide the necessary reference for the interpretation of heavy-ion collision results. Experimentally, tagging a jet by its flavor content gives direct access to the initial parton kinematics and can provide information on how the energy is dissipated in the QGP medium. The possible studies include the flavor and mass dependence of jet quenching, the collisional energy loss, the dead-cone effect, and the modification of the fragmentation and jet structure in the medium.\r\nThe sPHENIX detector will begin commissioning with Au + Au collisions in Spring 2023. It provides an excellent vertex resolution using 3 layers of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) and Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT) detectors. The expected spatial resolution is <6μm and the track vertex distance of closest approach (DCA) <30 $\\mu$m for p$_T$>1 GeV/c. In addition, a full azimuthal coverage of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters provides an excellent tool to study jet physics.

      "Abstract": "The new sPHENIX detector at Brookhaven’s National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was designed to significantly further the study of the nature of hot nuclear matter. The use of jets as a probe in p+A and A+A collisions allows access to the interaction of the hard-scattered partons with the nuclear environment and is sensitive to a wide range of scales. sPHENIX will use energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter and in the hadronic calorimeter, the first of its kind used for mid-rapidity measurements at RHIC, to reconstruct jets. Measurements of the sub-structure of these jets can be used to study the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced during heavy ion collisions. This poster will outline the method used to construct purely calorimetric jets from underlying-event-subtracted calorimeter towers, by first clustering calorimeter towers into anti-k$_T$ R = 0.2 “sub-jets” and then clustering the sub-jets into larger R jets. We will show the status towards jet substructure measurements using this technique in the first year of Au+Au data-taking with sPHENIX.",

      "Abstract": "The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program aims to study the properties of strongly interacting matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at various energy densities and temperatures. Correlation femtoscopy technique is a useful tool to study systems undergoing QCD phase transitions, and can extract valuable information about the size, shape, and lifetime of the particle-emitting source in heavy-ion collisions. \r\n\r\nThis study presents the first comprehensive femtoscopic analysis of identical kaons and pions produced in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6 - 200 GeV from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phases I and II, focusing on charge, transverse momentum, and centrality-dependent properties. The charge-dependent analysis reveals differences at the level of correlation functions for both kaons and pions for the first time at these energies. This observation is consistent with Coulomb field effect due to residual charge after the collision and hadronic final state effects, as implemented in UrQMD. The three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis reveals that the extracted radii, assuming Gaussian distribution for emission source, increase with collision energy, decrease with transverse mass, and are generally larger for kaons compared to pions under the same conditions. The study compares experimental data with different model scenarios and discusses the implications of the trend of the extracted size and lifetime of the particle source with the change of collision energy.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of one-dimensional two-pion and two-kaon correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, utilizing Levy-stable distributions for the source shapes, is also presented. The current analysis status of the extracted Levy source parameters, including their dependence on average transverse mass and centrality, is reported. A comparison of the pion and kaon Levy exponent is presented, potentially shedding light on the deviation from the Gaussian approximation of the emission source. The obtained results are compared to UrQMD and EPOS model calculations.",

      "Abstract": "Collective flow is observed in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions where particle multiplicities are small and a quark-gluon plasma description is hard to justify. Here, we address the origin of such observations from a new angle, by performing an experimental investigation of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional ultra-cold Fermi gases with with controllable interactions and in the regime of small particle numbers. We study the inversion of the aspect ratio (akin to elliptic flow) in the expansion of samples of atoms initially prepared in elliptical traps. To overcome the finiteness of the samples, a statistical measure of the elliptic anisotropy is devised in full analogy with the methods employed in the analysis of high-energy collisions.\r\n\r\nWith ten or more fermions, we observe the emergence of elliptic flow due to inter-particle interactions, which justifies a hydrodynamic interpretation. We show that ideal hydrodynamic predictions using the equation of state of 2D Fermi gases in the many-body limit underestimate the measured elliptic anisotropy. Hence, we witness the breakdown of ideal hydrodynamics due to quantum corrections beyond standard dissipative ones but rather induced by the mesoscopic nature of our samples. We discuss how hydrodynamic equations could be generalized to account for these effects, and give an outlook on further possibilities with our experimental setup to advance our understanding of collective phenomena in few-particle systems.\r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n\r\n- Floerchinger et al., \"Qualifying collective behavior in expanding ultracold gases as a function of particle number\", Phys.

      "Country": "Korea",
      "Abstract": "The Ridge behavior in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions has been discussed a lot since it was first reported. However, small systems like proton-proton collisions are not enough to generate a medium called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in which the Ridge behavior is explained with high-order flows. In this work, we suggest the pure kinematic mechanism between jets and medium partons as tools for understanding the Ridge behavior; during jets passing through the medium, the momentum transferred from jets to medium partons makes the medium partons aligned along the direction of jets’ motion. It produces a collective motion of the medium, which is in charge of the Ridge behavior in small system collisions.\r\n\r\nWe adopt Parton Distribution from the hard scattering model (PDh) as a distribution function for initial medium partons’ momentum. The PDh is parameterized by a fallout parameter, $a$, a non-extensive parameter, $q$, and the temperature of the system, $T$; $a$ decides the shape of rapidity distribution and $q$ affects rapidity and transverse momentum distribution. And $T$ is related to scales of rapidity and transverse momentum distributions. We choose values of these free parameters by comparing PYTHIA8-string shoving simulation for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13 \\rm{TeV}$ with high-multiplicity.\r\n\r\nWe set the initial conditions that jet particles with $10 \\rm{GeV}$ lose their energy by $1 \\rm{GeV}$ while interacting with medium partons through bremsstrahlung. Then, we calculate the cross-section with various outgoing angles of jet particles using PDh and derive the two-particle angular correlation from this. We find out that the Ridge like behaviors appear when the outgoing jets’ angle gets smaller. To integrate over the scattering angles, we calculate the cross-sections for several angles within the jet radius of 0.4 and sum them over with the weights, which are from the experimental data. We calculate the correlation and find that Ridge like behaviors exist in pp collision, compared to the experimental data. We also find $v_{2}$ within 0.025 ~ 0.045, consistent with the experimental result.",

The study of three- and many-body dynamics has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics, particularly for understanding the structure of light nuclei and describing neutron-rich and dense nuclear matter.\r\n\r\nThe ALICE Collaboration has performed measurements of the K$^+$--d and p--d correlations analyzing high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The correlation functions are compared with effective two-body calculations anchored to results from K$^+$--d and p--d scattering experiments that provide an excellent description of the measured $\\mathrm{K}^+$–d correlation but fail to describe the p--d system. This discrepancy can only be resolved by performing a full three-body calculation that accounts for the underlying three-nucleon dynamics. The analysis demonstrates that nucleons are the explicit degrees of freedom also in the correlations among light nuclei produced at short distances in hadronic collisions and opens the possibility of investigating the effect of genuine many-body nuclear interactions at the LHC in the future.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy-ion collisions produce a quark-gluon plasma that undergoes rapid expansion and cooling, which presents a challenge for calculating jet quenching observables. Current approaches rely on analytical results for static cases, introducing theoretical uncertainties and biases in our understanding of the pre-equilibrated medium. To address this issue, we employ analytical re-summation schemes to incorporate multiple scattering in a class of expanding backgrounds. By introducing a new length scale related to the equilibration time of the QGP, we investigate the range of validity of Bethe-Heitler emissions, LPM interference effects, and higher-twist contributions to the emitted gluon spectrum. We also discuss methods to mitigate the non-local nature of the emission spectrum. Our analysis shows that strong jet quenching is only possible when the equilibration time of the medium is longer than its mean free path, highlighting the importance of medium modifications of jets in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions. By accounting for the expansion of the medium, our approach reduces the uncertainties in model predictions for jet quenching observables, providing insights into the nature of the pre-equilibrated medium. This work lays the foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of the QGP and the interplay between jets and the expanding medium.",

We show that the wave function distribution plays a significant role, especially, in the production of charmonium states, leading to the transverse momentum distribution of the ψ(2S) meson as large as that of the J/ψ meson. We also discuss the anisotropic flow, or elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states using the transverse momentum distribution of charmonium states. We find that the internal structure differences as well as feed-down contributions of charmonium states are averaged out for elliptic and triangular flow, resulting in similar elliptic and triangular flow for all charmonium states. Based on our evaluation of elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states we also discuss the quark number scaling of elliptic and triangular flow for charmonium states in heavy ion collisions.",

We further show that while the enhancement effect might be contaminated by the relatively larger decrease of K1 meson than K∗ meson during the hadronic phase, the signal will be visible through a systematic study on centrality as the kinetic freeze-out temperature is higher and the hadronic life time shorter in peripheral collisions than in central collisions.",

This non-prompt component is identified statistically by measuring the distance of closest approach (DCA) with the PHENIX silicon vertex detector (VTX).

Therefore, correlations between net-conserved charges could be used to study the magnetic field produced in peripheral heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\n We present the new results on the first-order correlations of net-proton, net-charge, and net-kaon, where net-proton and net net-koan act as a proxy of net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. The measurements are performed as a function of centrality in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV using the data recorded by the ALICE detector. The results are compared with corresponding results at lower collision energies from the STAR experiment at RHIC and with theoretical predictions from lattice QCD, the Hadron Resonance Gas model, and the HIJING event generator.",

      "Abstract": "$J/\\psi$ serves as an important probe to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. In Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, it has been observed that the $J/\\psi$ yield is strongly suppressed and its elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is consistent with zero, indicating $J/\\psi$'s strong coupling with the medium and its potentially small regeneration contribution. Besides those measurements, the $J/\\psi$ polarization can shed new light on the QGP properties and the $J/\\psi$ production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. For example, it has been hypothesized that $J/\\psi$ can be polarized due to the spin-orbit coupling between $J/\\psi$ and QGP's large angular momentum in non-central heavy-ion collisions. The early production of $J/\\psi$ also makes its polarization potentially sensitive to the strong magnetic field at the early stage. \r\n   In this poster, we will present the first measurement of $J/\\psi$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The $J/\\psi$ polarization in the Helicity frame and Collins-Soper frame, as well as with respect to the event-plane, in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV will be presented, and its physics implications will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Universality is omnipresent when certain classes of microscopic theories are coarse-grained into effective macroscopic descriptions. Hydrodynamic theories are such macroscopic descriptions in long-wavelength, low-frequency limits of many quantum field theories. On the phenomenological side, hydrodynamics not only serves as a successful macroscopic description of the Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (HICs) but also serves as the energy deposition bin of hard probes such as jets and heavy quarks. It is important to understand to what extent the propagation of the deposited energy can be described within hydrodynamics. We investigate the universality and validity of hydrodynamic theory by studying the propagation of energy-momentum perturbations in kinetic theories from microscopic to macroscopic scales. By comparing results for different microscopic theories, we find a remarkable degree of universality, where the evolution of energy-momentum perturbations of the QGP is rather well described by a pair of sound and nonhydrodynamic modes. We also discuss the future perspectives in hydrodynamic theories that one may explore based on these findings.",

      "Abstract": "The shear viscosity (eta) of a quark-gluon plasma in equilibrium can be calculated numerically using the Green-Kubo relation or analytically using several methods, including the Israel-Stewart, Navier-Stokes, relaxation time approximation, and Chapman-Enskog methods. In this work [1], we first examine these analytical methods for isotropic as well as anisotropic two-body scatterings. We confirm that the Chapman-Enskog method is the most accurate while correcting the typos in an earlier work on this subject. \r\n\r\nWe then apply the Chapman-Enskog method to study the shear viscosity of the parton matter in the center cell of central and midcentral Au+Au collisions at 200AGeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76ATeV from a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. At the parton scattering cross section of 3 mb that enables the transport model to reproduce bulk observables including the elliptic flow, the average eta/s of the parton matter is found to be very small, between one to three times 1/(4pi). In addition, as a result of using a constant Debye mass or cross section for parton scatterings, the eta/s ratio from the AMPT model increases with time (as the effective temperature decreases), contrary to the pQCD results that use temperature-dependent Debye masses. This can be a direction for future model improvements.\r\n\r\n[1] N. MacKay and Z.W. Lin. Eur. Phys. J. C 82, 918 (2022).",

      "Abstract": "We have studied the momentum transport coefficients, viz. shear and \r\nbulk viscosity, in a weakly magnetized ($eB << T^2$) deconfined thermal \r\nQCD medium at finite quark chemical potential ($\\mu$). The magnetic \r\nfield generates anisotropy in the medium, causing the previously \r\nisotropic scalar transport coefficients to become anisotropic and separate into several components. Depending upon the direction of the magnetic field and current, we can have three possible components, namely, longitudinal, transverse, and Hall. We have obtained five shear ($\\eta_0, \\eta_1, \\eta_2, \\eta_3$ and $\\eta_4$) and two bulk viscous components ($\\zeta_0$ and $\\zeta_1$) using relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under relaxation time approximation. Interaction among partons is incorporated through the quasiparticle mass of quarks and gluons (T, $\\mu$, B dependent), calculated using oneloop perturbative thermal QCD.\r\nIt is observed that the magnetic field acts differently on left (L) and \r\nright (R)-handed chiral modes of quark. This leads to the lifting of degeneracy in mass of those modes, in contrast to the strong magnetic field case ($eB >> T^2$), where these modes are degenerate. The magnetic field dependence of L and R modes of $\\eta_0$, $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_3$ is opposite in nature, viz. the L mode magnitude decreases whereas the R mode magnitude increases, with the magnetic field. This is in contrast to $\\eta_2$ and $\\eta_4$, for which, both the L and R mode magnitudes\r\nincrease with the magnetic field. The bulk viscous coefficients, $\\zeta_0$ and $\\zeta_1$ increase with magnetic field for both L and R mode. Also, these shear and bulk viscosities get amplified with quark chemical potential for both modes. Shear viscosity to entropy density ratios are found to be greater than $1/(4\\pi)$ for $\\eta_0, \\eta_1$ and $\\eta_3$, but less than $1/(4\\pi)$ for $\\eta_2$ and $\\eta_4$. The ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density for $\\zeta_0$ and $\\zeta_1$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour with temperature, showing minima or maxima around $T\\sim$ 200 MeV. Furthermore, the Reynolds number for L mode is found to be greater than \r\nthat for R mode due to a difference in mass densities.",

These results indicate the importance of filling the gap between 3.0 GeV and 7.7 GeV. The analyses of the remaining FXT data sets are ongoing to fill the gap and to see whether any critical behaviour is observed in the region between 3.2 and 7.7 GeV, although limited acceptance at the top FXT energies complicates these analyses.

Diffusion wake accompanying this Mach-cone provides a unique probe of the properties of quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by $\\gamma$-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. Using a two-Gaussian fit, we extract the diffusion wake and MPI contributions to the double peak. The diffusion wake valley is found to increase with the azimuthal angle away from the jet. It is also found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the $\\gamma$-jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to medium properties such as the shear viscosity and equation of state is also studied.",

Hyperons can be abundantly produced in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC. However, achieving high purity of reconstructed hyperons with high efficiency is particularly challenging in high charged-particle multiplicity environments.\r\n  The conventional reconstruction method of ALICE rejects many hyperon candidates by using topological cuts. To improve the detector performance, we studied the reconstruction of all hyperon candidates based on their decay vertex using the Kalman Filter (KF) technique. Furthermore, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm is applied to the LHC Run 2 Pb-Pb collision data based on the training by the combinatorial background and Monte Carlo simulation. By inputting many parameters for decay vertex reconstruction, we can make finer adjustments than would be possible by simply applying topological cuts manually. Therefore, BDT may help optimize cuts to better separate signal and background. This poster will report the current status of the reconstruction of Λ, Ξ, and Ω with the KF approach, discussing its performance and prospects for the future. These developments are important for the high-luminosity Pb-Pb data-taking campaign foreseen at the end of 2023.",

The modification of the high-virtuality parton shower in the QGP compared to that in proton-proton collisions offers insight into the nature of the medium's interactions with colored probes. To study the path-length dependence of hard partons traveling through the QGP, we apply a technique known as event-shape engineering to data from heavy-ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=200\\ \\mathrm{GeV}$ at STAR. Within a given eccentricity and centrality class, charged hadrons traveling in the event plane direction (having shorter path length) are compared to those traveling perpendicular to it (having longer path length). By fixing the centrality, we can control for the energy density. We then report a comparison of the ratios of in-and out-of-plane charged hadron spectra between two eccentricity classes, which accesses the dependence of energy loss on the collision geometry.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are produced at the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions, and they experience the whole evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in these collisions. Measurements of the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of charmed mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide ample evidence of strong interactions between charm quarks and the QGP. However, a complete understanding of the nature of the charm-medium interaction is yet to be achieved. Thus, new observables are needed to constrain theoretical models and the charm quark diffusion coefficient in the QGP.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of azimuthal and femtoscopic correlations involving charmed mesons can provide such new insights. Azimuthal correlations of charmed mesons can help to pin down the relative role of radiative and collisional energy losses for charm quarks. On the other hand, femtoscopic correlations, i.e., two-particle correlations at the low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions and the extent of the region from which correlated particles are emitted. Therefore,  a study of femtoscopic correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the bulk partons.\r\n\r\nWe will present the azimuthal correlations of $\\mathrm{D^0-{\\bar{D}} ^{0}}$  pairs and femtoscopic correlations of charmed mesons with identified hadrons measured by the STAR experiment at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\mathrm{\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200}$ GeV using high-statistics data collected in 2014 and 2016.

Chiral symmetry restoration can manifest itself in two different ways: a pole-mass shift or a broadening of the spectral function.\r\n In this poster, the feasibility study for measuring ω meson in the dimuon channel using the ALICE forward muon tracker is presented.

      "Abstract": "Hard partonic scatterings, occurring at the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, produce jets, which experience the full evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  As they traverse through the QGP, jets lose energy through collisional and radiative processes, collectively known as the jet quenching.  In semi-central heavy-ion events, the QGP takes an approximately elliptical shape in the transverse plane whose mean in-plane and out-of-plane distances differ.  This fact can be used to vary the average path length for jets traversing the QGP, and those traveling in-plane should experience less quenching effects than those traveling out-of-plane.  This differential quenching manifests as a suppression of jet yield out-of-plane relative to in-plane, quantified by jet $v_2$, the second order Fourier coefficient.  In this poster, jet $v_2$ will be presented from Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, and O+O collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}=200\\hbox{ GeV}$ with multiple jet resolution parameters.

Jet showering processes, with and without the quenching effect, are simulated with the JEWEL model, and are embedded with thermal backgrounds. Sequential substructure variables are extracted from the jet clustering history following an angular-ordered sequence, and are used in the training of a neural network built on top of a long short-term memory network. We measure the jet shape and jet fragmentation functions for jets classified  with  the neural network outputs, and quantify their in-medium modifications. The results support that the machine learning approach successfully identifies the quenching effect in the presence of the large uncorrelated background of soft particles created in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "We demonstrate that the early stages of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [1] are well described by the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, thus providing novel analytic results on the thermalization process of QCD in a heavy ion collision. These results provide an intuitive explanation of why a gas of quarks and gluons can relax so quickly towards equilibrium, and provide a starting point for a systematic exploration of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in QCD. All of the qualitative features exhibited in QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) simulations at weak coupling [2] are captured by the emergence of an effective low-energy instantaneous ground state for the 1-particle gluon distribution function, which defines the early-time kinetic theory attractor. This ground state may be pulled back to arbitrarily early times, where it represents a free-streaming solution, and at later times it integrally describes the BMSS fixed point, including the recently observed deviations from the original predictions for the scaling exponents [2].\r\n\r\nTo find this instantaneous ground state it is necessary to elucidate the deep connections between scaling and adiabaticity in expanding gluon plasmas [3]. We first solve the Boltzmann equation for gluons in the small-angle scattering approximation numerically and find that it features time-dependent scaling, reproducing the QCD EKT scaling of hard gluons [2]. By studying this equation analytically, we find that an appropriate momentum rescaling allows the scaling distribution to be identified as the instantaneous ground state of the operator describing the evolution of the distribution function, and the approach to the scaling function is described by the decay of the excited states. That is to say, the system evolves adiabatically, and the instantaneous ground state describes the early-time kinetic theory attractor. We obtain this ground state analytically. Corrections to the BMSS fixed point exponents agree quantitatively with those found previously in QCD EKT.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Baier, Mueller, Schiff, Son, arXiv:hep-ph/0009237\r\n[2] Mazeliauskas, Berges, arXiv:1810.10554\r\n[3] Brewer, Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Yin, arXiv:2203.02427",

Recently, proton cumulants from central Au+Au $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV collisions were reported, which implies that hadronic interactions are dominant at 3 GeV and the QCD critical point could exist at the collision energies higher than 3 GeV. The baryon-strangeness correlation is expected to deviate from the QGP expectation for the hadronic gas at high baryon-chemical potential region, which can be used to confirm the turning-off signal of the QGP.  Previously, the STAR measurement of baryon-strangeness correlation using (anti)protons and $\\rm K^{\\pm}$ shows no strong signal compared with theoretical prediction. So it is suggested to include hyperons in the measurement to study QCD phase transition.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we will report the second-order baryon-strangeness correlation using proton, $\\rm K^{\\pm}$, and $\\Lambda$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV from the fixed-target program at the STAR experiment.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "Nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles provide valuable information about the flavor dependent magnitude and characteristics of parton energy loss in $A+A$ collisions. Experimental measurements of $R_{AA}$ exhibit a distinct different dependence on transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Previous analyses of RHIC data treated the difference in the $p_{T}$ spectrum between $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions as a leading parton $p_{T}$ loss and empirically concluded that the flat $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ corresponds to a constant fractional $p_{T}$ loss ($\\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}$) [1]. This feature of $\\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $p_{T}$ can be understood via elastic collisions in classical dynamics. We analyze LHC measurements of the strong $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for light and heavy flavor leading particles. Our analyses indicate that LHC data for a variety of leading particle species are consistent with $\\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $\\sqrt{p_{T}}$, in contrast to proportional to $p_{T}$ at RHIC. In addition, Charm hadrons exhibit differing behavior compared to the other species studied, revealing possible unique heavy flavor dynamics. These distinct features are consistent with the scenario of increased contributions from radiative energy loss at LHC energies compared with stronger collisional energy loss dominance at RHIC energies. Moreover, linear trends between fractional energy loss and initial parton density at varying $p_{T}$ magnitudes indicate that the amount of parton energy loss does not depend strongly on the traversing geometrical path length of the parton during collision evolutions, which is in agreement with previous empirical findings at RHIC despite significant different initial parton densities formed at LHC and RHIC. We will also discuss further implications of the observed proportionality in LHC data and differences in fractional energy loss at varying $p_{T}$ scales.\r\n[1] Wang, G. and Huang, H. Phys. Lett.

We study the dynamics of heavy flavors using a hybrid framework that incorporates the MARTINI event generator, pythia8.1 for the initial production of heavy quarks, and Langevin dynamics to describe the evolution of heavy quarks in a 3+1-D expanding QGP medium. We include the interactions of heavy quarks with the medium constituents through the heavy quark transport coefficients. The space-time expansion of the QGP medium is described using the hydrodynamical approach MUSIC with IP-Glasma initial state and Bayesian-quantified viscous coefficients of the strongly-interacting matter. The properties of the QGP medium are probed by analyzing the heavy meson nuclear modification factor and flow coefficient for Pb+Pb collision. In this work utilizing for the first time IP-Glasma fluctuating initial states and hydrodynamics tuned to a global Bayesian analysis, we show that the observables associated with D-mesons are strongly influenced by the IP-Glasma initial state and bulk evolution.

      "Abstract": "The widely used Fourier expansion for studying collective motions in heavy-ion collisions implies that different modes of collectivity could be non-interdependent, driven by factorized actions in the created nuclear medium. Following this line of thought, we assume each non-dependent collective motion modulates the probability of particle emission with a single-harmonic Fourier expansion, and then express the final-state particle azimuthal distribution as the product of these expansions, \r\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{N^\\pm}\\frac{dN^\\pm}{d\\varphi} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1+2\\tilde{a}_n^\\pm\\sin n\\Delta \\varphi) \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1+ 2\\tilde{v}_n^\\pm\\cos n\\Delta \\varphi)$, instead of a long linear Fourier series. Here, $\\Delta\\varphi$ is the particle azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane. This scheme may better capture the genuine strength of each collectivity mode ($\\tilde{a_n}$ and $\\tilde{v_n}$), and results in non-leading cross terms between collectivity modes, with significant impacts on experimental observables.  We explore the possibility that the chiral magnetic effect (CME) [1] and elliptic flow can evolve separately, thereby their convolution affecting not only the observable that is sensitive to the CME, but also that to the shear-induced CME [2]. We employ the event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics model to showcase the implications of this scenario on searches for the CME. In addition, we also propose practical experimental tests using conventional flow harmonics and exploit a multiphase transport model to demonstrate the emergence of non-leading cross terms, such as the rapidity-odd component of triangular flow. The universality of the assumption regarding factorized actions can be investigated by analyzing real data collected from RHIC and the LHC, which will enhance our understanding of the collective motions.\r\n\r\n[1] D.

      "Abstract": "In nuclear collisions at low RHIC energies, although $s$ and $\\bar{s}$ quarks are produced in  pairs, there is a significant excess of $\\Omega^{-}$ over ${\\bar{\\Omega}}^{+}$ which suggests that $\\Omega^{-}$ carries a net baryon number. Such an excess of net baryon number at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions manifests effective mechanisms of baryon number transport over a large rapidity gap. Gluon junction has been proposed as a possible structure allowing for baryon number transport over large rapidity gaps. We also argue that the net $\\Omega^{-}$ production on the proton-going side of $p$+Au collisions may provide a sensitive probe of the gluon junction mechanism. We will present AMPT model simulations of $\\Omega$-$K$, $\\Omega$-$\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$-$\\Lambda$ correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6 GeV and 7.7 GeV as well as $p$+Au collisions at 62 GeV. These correlations reflect the effects of strangeness conservation and baryon number transport in nuclear collisions. In particular, the $\\Omega$-hadron correlations in AMPT show distinct dependence on baryon densities indicating quantitative sensitivity to details of the baryon number transport dynamics. Results from the default and string-melting versions of the AMPT calculations are used to examine the imprints on such correlations left by the hadronization schemes of string fragmentation and quark coalescence, respectively. AMPT calculations predict very significant differences in the correlations at 7.7 GeV between these hadronization schemes, which can be used experimentally to investigate the extent of roles played by partonic degrees of freedom in Au+Au collisions at this energy. Implications on the experimental program to measure these correlations with the STAR experiment at RHIC will also be discussed.",

These physics measurements require the pECal to have a moderate energy resolution, fine granularity, and a compact structure. We will present the current design of the pECal, a sampling calorimeter with a W-powder/ScFiber (W/ScFi) structure initially developed at UCLA. The W/ScFi detector design has unique features, such as a close-to-one e/h ratio suitable for hadron compensation, which is required for jet measurements. The simulated pECal performances match the requirements of the EIC scientific program very well. This design has been adopted by the current EIC detector plan (ePIC) and implemented in the ePIC software frameworks. I will discuss the design, advantages, and performances of the W/ScFi pECal detector based on the results of GEANT4 simulations.

With a range of different coefficients, we are able to obtain upper and lower bounds for converted symmetric nuclear matter with causality and stability constraints.

In the QGP medium, modifications to the fragmentation function compared to that in a vacuum can provide insights into the underlying mechanism of jet quenching. A study of the fragmentation function for charm meson tagged jets can reveal further details about the flavor dependence of the medium-induced parton energy loss.\r\n\r\nIn this poster, we report measurements of $\\rm D^{0}$ meson tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200 \\text{ GeV}$, collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

The coefficients associated with the charge and heat transport, such as the electrical conductivity, Hall conductivity, thermal conductivity and Hall-type thermal conductivity are determined using the nonextensive Tsallis framework within the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory. The Tsallis distribution function encodes the effect of the nonextensivity, where the deviation of parameter $q$ from unity signifies the extent of the nonextensivity. The matter produced in heavy ion collisions may not be exactly in the locally equilibrated state, and for understanding the properties of such matter to a greater degree, the nonextensive Tsallis framework is a relevant approach to follow. Our observation shows that the electrical and thermal conductivities as well as their Hall components increase with the nonextensivity and this implies an increased deviation of both charge and heat transports from their counterparts at $q=1$. It is observed that the deviations of the abovementioned transport coefficients from their respective equilibrated values get further increased at finite magnetic field, whereas these deviations become decreased at finite chemical potential. Furthermore, the effects of the nonextensivity on the flow characteristics through the Knudsen number, specific heat and elliptic flow have been explored.",

      "Abstract": "The production of light (anti)nuclei in high-energy hadronic collisions has been studied in depth with the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  Despite this, the production mechanism of light (anti)nuclei is still not well understood and remains a highly-discussed topic in the scientific community. One of the phenomenological models typically used to describe the hadronization process is the coalescence model. In this model, if the nucleons at kinetic freezeout are close in phase space and match their spin state they can bind and form a nucleus. More advanced coalescence model uses the Wigner formalism for the bound state.  A prediction of this model is an enhanced coalescence probability of nuclei in jets with respect to the underlying event in small collision systems. To test this prediction, ALICE has published a work where the (anti)deuteron coalescence parameter in and out of jets is measured in pp collisions, and the same study has been performed in p-Pb collisions, observing in both cases such enhancement.  In this poster, the prospects for light (anti)nuclei measurements in jets and in underlying event during the Run 3 will be presented, considering the developments along this research line and the expected precision obtained thanks to the integrated luminosity that will be collected.",

Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies [2,3]. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, and includes dynamical fluctuations in the saturation and particle production. As a proof of principle study, we average a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions and compute the rapidity and centrality dependence of the charged hadron multiplicities and elliptic flow for the LHC Pb+Pb collisions using 3+1 D viscous fluid dynamical evolution. In particular, we show that global energy conservation and spatial dependence of the nuclear PDFs are essential features to reach a good agreement with the measurements.\r\n\r\n[1] M. Kuha, J.

Since jets are multi-scale objects that connect asymptotically free partons to confined hadrons, jet substructure measurements in vacuum can provide insight into the parton evolution and the ensuing hadronization processes. With $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV $pp$ collision data recorded by the STAR experiment, we reconstruct full jets to measure CollinearDrop$-$SoftDrop jet correlation and the charge correlation ratio ($r_c$) with hadrons in jets, which probe the dynamics of the parton shower and hadronization, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe interplay between different stages of the parton shower can be explored with the correlation between SoftDrop and CollinearDrop groomed jet observables, the latter of which have an enhanced sensitivity to the soft radiation within jets. We present the first measurements of CollinearDrop jet mass and its correlation with SoftDrop groomed jet observables, such as the opening angle $R_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and the shared momentum fraction $z_{\\mathrm{g}}$. They are fully corrected for detector effects with a novel machine learning method, MultiFold, which preserves the correlations in the multi-dimensional observable phase space.\r\n\r\nPrecision measurements sensitive to the hadronization process are crucial for testing phenomenological models and furthering our understanding of non-perturbative QCD.

Two-particle azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavor particles is a differential measurement which allows for the study of the fragmentation of heavy quarks. By measuring the azimuthal correlation in different transverse momentum ($p_T$) regions, one can study the details of the structure and particle momentum distribution of jets produced by the heavy-quark fragmentation process. The azimuthal correlations between electrons from heavy-flavor decays (trigger) and charged particles (associated) are studied in different trigger and associate particle $p_T$ regions. A distinguishing feature of heavy-ion collisions is the production of a hot and deconfined state of nuclear matter, called Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By comparing the heavy-flavor and charged particle azimuthal correlations in Pb-Pb collisions to measurements in smaller collision systems, we can determine how the heavy-quark fragmentation is modified by interactions with the QGP medium. In this poster, ALICE results on the modifications of the azimuthal distribution in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Chiral symmetry is lost at low temperatures, and pions are massless in the chiral limit;  there is no longer any screening mass. The screening mass of mesons approaches the standard value of $2 \\pi T$ at high temperatures. The screening masses of mesons provide a gauge invariant and definite order parameter of chiral symmetry restoration. Different mesonic correlation lengths for flavor non-singlets, at least up to NLO, are well-defined gauge invariant physical quantities calculated earlier using the perturbative resummation techniques. It was found that these NLO corrections are small and come with a positive sign. The lattice simulation results match the existing perturbative results only in the high-temperature regime. There needs to be more clarity between the lattice results and the theoretical calculations at low temperatures, as the perturbative expansion fails at low temperatures. One of the ways to probe the low-temperature region is by using the non-perturbative Gribov resummation.

More insightful information about the production mechanism could be provided by measuring the full Probability Density Function (PDF) for the production of each strange particle specie and investigating if any deviation from pure uncorrelated statistical behavior is observed. Using this novel method, we can determine whether strangeness enhancement is connected to the high-multiplicity tail of the PDF or to a progressive increase in the number of events with few strange particles produced. In this contribution, we present new results on the full PDF for the production of $K^{0}_{\\rm S}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$ in pp collisions at $\\sqrt s$ = 5.02 TeV as a function of the multiplicity as well as single and pair production of the $\\phi$ meson in pp collisions at 13 TeV. In addition, we present new results on the transverse momentum spectra of Σ+ and its charge conjugate anti-particle, in both minimum bias and high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at √s=13 TeV, including prospects and performance of the reconstruction of Σ baryons in Run 3. The results are compared to state-of-the-art phenomenological models implemented in commonly-used Monte Carlo event generators, drastically enhancing the sensitivity to the different processes implemented in each approach.",

Recently, strangeness enhancement has also been observed in small systems at the LHC, but the underlying physics is not yet fully understood. This motivates studies of strange hadron production in small systems at RHIC, where the energy density of system is expected to be smaller than that at the LHC and therefore a hot and deconfined medium is less likely to be created. Investigating the multiplicity dependence of strange hadron production in small systems can naturally connect to peripheral heavy-ion collisions, and contribute to understanding the role of event multiplicity in strange hadron production. Furthermore, such studies will serve as a baseline for similar measurements in central heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will present new measurements of (multi-)strange hadrons ($K{_S}{^0}$, $\\Lambda$)  in $d$+Au and ($K{_S}{^0}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$) in $p$+$p$ collisions at 200 GeV, collected by STAR in 2015 and 2016 respectively.

We assume the magnetic field to be either constant or follow a profile extracted from general relativity calculations of magnetars and make use of two realistic models that can consistently describe chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement to quark matter, the CMF and the PNJL models. We find that net isospin, strangeness, and weak chemical equilibrium with leptons can considerably change the effects of temperature and magnetic fields on particle content and deconfinement in dense matter.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "The core goal of heavy-ion collision experiments is to shed light on how the phases and properties of strong-interaction matter arise from the fundamental constituents and interactions of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  To this end, heavy-ion collision experiments are searching for universal signs of criticality in the QCD phase diagram by measuring various macroscopic quantities. When those signatures of criticality are observed the ultimate scientific question will still remain unanswered— how do these universal behaviors at the macroscale arise from the microscopic degrees of freedom, quarks and gluons? In this talk we will answer this question. \r\n \r\nMacroscopic properties of the strong interaction near its chiral phase transition exhibit scaling behaviors, which are the same as those observed close to the magnetic transition in a 3-dimensional classical spin system with $O(4)$ symmetry. We show the universal scaling properties of the chiral phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We first establish a connection between the cumulants of the chiral order parameter, i.e. the chiral condensate, and the correlations among the energy levels of quarks in the background of gluons, i.e. the eigenspectra of the massless QCD Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to generalizations of the Banks–Casher relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations with varying light quark masses near the QCD chiral transition, we demonstrate the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses. Our study reveals how the hidden scaling features at the microscale give rise to the macroscopic universal properties of QCD.",

      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Over the past decades, the properties of dense matter have been widely concerned in connection with hypernuclei and hyperons. Their existence inside neutron stars softens the Equation of State (EoS), consequently limiting their masses to be lower than two solar masses (known as the \"hyperon puzzle\"). The limited number of experimental references in the region of high baryon chemical potential poses significant challenges for constructing an EoS. The matter under conditions similar to neutron star cores can be obtained with low-energy heavy-ion collisions. The strong interactions for hyperons and clusters can be studied with two-body systems, for example, nucleon-hyperon (e.g., $p-\\Lambda$) or nucleon-cluster (e.g., $p-d$, $p-t$, or $p-{}^{3}He$) as their interaction is not fully understood. Studies of two-particle correlations with clusters enable one to search for ground state of  ${}^{4}Li$, or the excited state of ${}^{4}He$. Created hadrons and clusters carry information available after thermal freeze-out. Therefore, photons with a relatively long mean free path and being emitted through the whole system's evolution are considered for studying earlier collision stages. \r\n\r\nFemtoscopy is a technique of measuring two-particle correlations in momentum space, proven to be a powerful tool for determining parameters of interactions and lifetimes in heavy-ion physics. It allows for the investigation of collision-generated system's spacetime features, having a lifespan of $10^{-23}$ seconds and a lifetime of femtometers ($10^{-15}$ m). One can study the two-body interactions, geometry, and dynamics by conducting such measurements experimentally.\r\n\r\nThe analysis uses the HADES detector at GSI/FAIR (Germany). Using detectors included in the spectrometer (among others, electromagnetic calorimeters, capable of detecting neutral particles) combined with specially created software, a dedicated framework, and reconstruction algorithm, one can identify $\\gamma$ particles, $\\Lambda$ hyperons, and clusters. The $p-\\Lambda$, $p-d$, $p-t$, $p-{}^{3}He$, and $\\gamma-\\gamma$ correlation functions will be presented for the first time.",

In this work we use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action for the first time to answer this question. This requires including the fast longitudinal expansion that characterizes heavy-ion collisions. Our framework, the 2PI effective action, is non-perturbative and derived directly from the underlying quantum-field theory. It encompasses existing descriptions of the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions, such as classical-statistical field theory and kinetic theory, in different limits, and therefore gives a unified, microscopic picture of the initial stages. In this talk we focus on \\(\\phi^4\\) theory (which shares many features with QCD) in the 2PI framework truncated at three loops.  We calculate the evolution of energy density and pressure anisotropy, as well as the momentum distribution of quasiparticles in the medium and their thermal mass. This allows us to see for the first time the onset of isotropization in quantum field theory in a geometric setup relevant for heavy-ion collisions. We address open questions in the field that the 2PI effective action can answer rigorously, such as how strong classical fields become quasiparticles, the role of vacuum fluctuations and the dynamics of soft modes throughout the initial stages.",

      "Abstract": "We have investigated the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, using relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD). For the description of time evolution of the ultraintense electromagnetic fields produced just after the collisions, construction of the relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD) is indispensable \r\nWe construct a relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) numerical simulation code for high-energy heavy-ion collisions as a first designed code in the Milne coordinates. Then we confirm that our code reproduces well the results of standard RRMHD tests in the Cartesian coordinates. Also, we verify the semi-analytic solutions of the accelerating longitudinal expansion of relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in a comparison with our numerical result.\r\nNext, we apply our RRMHD code to analysis of the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We consider the optical Glauber model as an initial model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the solution of the Maxwell equations with source term of the charged particles in two colliding nuclei as initial electromagnetic fields. The RRMHD simulation is performed with these initial conditions in Au-Au and Cu-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV. We have calculated the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow $\\Delta v_1$ and elliptic flow $\\Delta v_2$ in both collisions based on electric charge distributions as a consequence of RRMHD. Our results show that the directed and elliptic flows are approximately proportional to the electrical conductivity of the medium in both collisions. In the highly resistive case, our results of the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow are consistent with STAR data in Au-Au collisions. Furthermore, in Cu-Au collisions, the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow has a non-zero value at η = 0 which is also proportional to electrical conductivity of the medium. We conclude that the charge-dependent anisotropic flow is a good probe to extract the electrical conductivity of the QGP medium in high-energy heavy-ion experiments.\r\nNakamura, Miyoshi, Nonaka and Takahashi, Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 1, 014901.\r\nNakamura, Miyoshi, Nonaka and Takahashi, Eur.Phys.

      "Abstract": "We explore the far-off-equilibrium aspects of the (1+1)-dimensional early-stage evolution of a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma using hydrodynamics and kinetic theory. For a large set of far-off-equilibrium initial conditions we observe that the macroscopic evolution appears to violate simple rules based on the second law of thermodynamics. We provide an in-depth microscopic understanding of this apparently anomalous macroscopic phenomenon in terms of the novel concept of *viscous cooling* and establish its thermodynamic consistency. We use Boltzmann's H-function to formulate 'maximum-entropy hydrodynamics', a far-off-equilibrium macroscopic theory that can describe both free-streaming and near-equilibrium regimes of quark-gluon plasma in a single framework. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic theories but conceptually similar to anisotropic hydrodynamics which it generalizes and with which we compare, this formulation incorporates contributions to all orders in shear and bulk inverse Reynolds numbers, allowing it to handle large dissipative fluxes that characterize the early evolution stage in heavy-ion collisions. By considering flow profiles relevant for nuclear collisions at very high energies, we demonstrate that 'maximum-entropy hydrodynamics' provides excellent agreement with underlying kinetic theory throughout the fluid's evolution, especially in out-of-equilibrium regimes where traditional hydrodynamics breaks down.",

      "Abstract": "For heavy ion collisions in the TeV beam energy region, the large number of initial hard scatterings create a richly \"doped\" hot quark-gluon plasma containing many charm quarks/anti-quarks, thus providing a uniquely \"charming\" environment for the massive production of heavy flavor exotic hadrons such as the $\\chi_{c1}$ (also known as X(3872)), X(6900) and Tcc states. While such exotic states have been studied for decades in hadron physics, many questions about their basic properties and intrinsic structures (e.g. large hadron molecules versus compact tetraquarks) are not understood. High energy nuclear collisions show promise as a new test ground that has the potential to help resolve some of these challenges, with fresh experimental data from LHCb and CMS indicating nontrivial partonic medium effects on their production. As an example to demonstrate such opportunity, we report recent calculations of the yield of $\\chi_{c1}$ state based on two popular models of its possible configurations: a loose hadronic molecule or a compact tetraquark. It turns out that the two different structures have rather different sensitivity to the fireball volume in heavy ion collisions. By scanning centrality and thus systematically tuning the fireball volume, our dynamical simulations have indeed found about 2-order-of-magnitude difference in the $\\chi_{c1}$ yield and a markedly different centrality dependence between hadronic molecules and compact tetraquarks. This offers a novel approach for using fireball size as a “yardstick”  to calibrate the size of exotic hadrons and thus distinguishing the two scenarios. Lastly, the talk will discuss the ongoing progress in the recently formed ExoHad Topical Collaboration to integrate hadronic physics inputs with medium environment and examine exotic hadron properties both in quark-gluon phase and in hot hadron gas, which would be crucial for a successful program of studying their production in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Proton-lead collisions at LHC energies offer a unique possibility to investigate initial state effects in nuclear collisions. Thanks to its wide acceptance, ATLAS can measure several probes that can help characterize these effects over a wide kinematic range. By analyzing the centrality dependence of dijet production, it is possible to investigate the suppression of dijet events in central events compared to peripheral ones and correlate it to the kinematic of the parton-parton scattering, accessible thanks to the measurement of both jets in the final state. In 2016, the ATLAS experiment collected 165 nb$^{-1}$ of proton-lead collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV per nucleon pair. In this talk, we will present a new measurement of the centrality dependence of dijet production obtained using this dataset. We will also present the first measurement of the inclusive cross-section for top-quark pair production in dilepton and lepton+jet decay modes. This process is sensitive to effects at high Bjorken-x values, which are hard to access experimentally using other available probes, and thus provides complementary information on the behavior of nuclear parton densities.",

      "Abstract": "Suppression of open heavy flavors and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions is among the most informative probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Only in the past few years, systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP have been carried out in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size.\r\n\r\nSuch calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known [1] heavy quark diffusion coefficient. In this talk, we will describe its calculation at weak coupling in QCD up to next-to-leading order [2] and at strong coupling in N=4 Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. While it resembles the open heavy quark case, it has some crucial differences that highlight the relevance of quantum color correlations. Crucial insights are obtained by studying them in temporal axial gauge, where these correlators would naively be equal [4]. Furthermore, we will discuss the necessary setup to evaluate the quarkonium transport coefficients from lattice QCD, which, at present, is the only tool we have to study QCD in the non-perturbative regime. Finally, we will discuss the phenomenological implications that can be extracted from this correlator, with emphasis on the implications of the novel N=4 SYM results at strong coupling.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Casalderrey-Solana, Teaney, arXiv:hep-ph/0605199\r\n[2] Binder, Mukaida, Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Yao, arXiv:2107.03945\r\n[3] Nijs, Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Yao, arXiv:2304.03298\r\n[4] Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Yao, arXiv:2205.04477",

Earlier reconstructions of static quarkonium spectral functions from lQCD data have indicated an absence of screening of the heavy-quark (HQ) potential in the QGP, while previous T-matrix applications to the HQ free energies favor screening effects in combination with HQ mass shifts induced by in-medium selfenergies. The pertinent T-matrix results can semi-quantitatively describe the lQCD data for Wilson line correlators but refinements of the input parameters are necessary to improve the agreement, providing new insights. This renders the T-matrix a more accurate and reliable tool to make predictions for the spectral and transport properties of the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most unexpected findings of the LHC heavy ion program is the observation of stronger suppressions of the excited quarkonium states compared to the ground states in proton-lead (pPb) collisions. Such differences imply dissociation effects occurring at late stages, after the evolution of heavy quark pairs into well-defined physical states. The variety of binding energies within the charmonium and bottomonium families offers an experimental tool to characterize the phenomena at play. Moreover, measuring the excited states is crucial as they represent significant feed-down contributions to the production of the ground states in proton-proton collisions and must be accounted for in the interpretation of proton-nucleus data. We report studies of the relative suppression of quarkonia in pPb collisions performed in CMS. Nuclear modification factors as well as excited-to-ground state cross section ratios are measured as a function of particle transverse momentum and rapidity, and event activity (number of reconstructed tracks). The results are compared with several model calculations incorporating initial- and final-state effects.",

      "Abstract": "Properties of partonic fragmentation in QCD depend on parton flavours in $1\\rightarrow2$ splitting processes in parton showers due to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, and to the different masses of light- and heavy-flavour quarks. Heavy-flavour jets provide a unique experimental tool to probe these flavour dependencies, particularly at low and intermediate transverse momenta where mass effects are significant. The ALICE detector has excellent particle tracking and PID performance to tag jets with reconstructed heavy-flavour hadrons. These capabilities are essential for jet substructure studies as they remove significant contamination from heavy-flavour hadron decay products and allows us to trace the quark flavour through the splitting tree. We report a series of heavy-flavour jet substructure measurements tagged with a reconstructed $\\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. These include first measurements of the jet axes differences between different recombination and grooming schemes and the jet angularities where the angular exponent can tune the sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects. Additionally, the groomed momentum fraction and opening angle of the first splitting are reported, which link to fundamental ingredients of the splitting functions. Comparisons with flavour-untagged jets probe flavour dependencies from the charm quark mass and the high purity quark nature of the $\\rm{D}^{0}$-tagged jet sample. Further comparisons to different MC generators will assess the role of these flavour dependencies in other parton shower prescriptions.",

      "Abstract": "The interaction of heavy quarks with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) affects their azimuthal distribution and transverse momentum ($p_\\mathrm{T}$) spectrum, hence azimuthal anisotropy coefficients ($v_{n}$) and nuclear modification factors ($R_\\mathrm{AA}$) of heavy flavor hadrons are important probes of the QGP. However, a simultaneous modeling of $v_{n}$ and $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ is still challenging. This talk reports the first nonprompt $\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy elliptic ($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) coefficients in large systems, using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV, collected with the CMS apparatus. The measurements are performed as a function of transverse momentum, spanning 1--30 GeV/c, in three centrality classes, from central to midcentral collisions. Compared to the prompt $\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ results, the nonprompt $\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ $v_{2}$ flow coefficients are systematically lower and show less dependence on particle $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and centrality. An indication of nonzero $v_{3}$ coefficient of the nonprompt $\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ is observed. The wide $p_\\mathrm{T}$ range enables the study of various flow generation mechanisms, like diffusion at low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and path-dependent parton energy loss at low and high $p_\\mathrm{T}$, respectively. In addition, measurements of both prompt and nonprompt $\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ mesons cross sections in PbPb and proton-proton collisions, as well as $R_\\mathrm{AA}$, will be shown.

This can directly affect particle production in heavy-ion collisions and leads to characteristic signatures in particle correlations. I will discuss the underlying physics and present a formalism to study particle spectra on general hypersurfaces in a medium.

In this work, we implement BSQ charge dynamics in a fully integrated framework. We propagate these conserved charges within an upgraded version of the hydrodynamic model, v-USPhydro, that conserves the BSQ charge densities exactly. Our hydrodynamics simulation is informed by the full 4-D equation of state {T,μB,μS,μQ} from Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics and includes decays from the latest Particle Data Group 2016+. We find that we are able to reproduce both spectra and flow in our approach while also obtaining relatively large fluctuations in the chemical potentials {T,μB,μS,μQ} in local fluid cells at the freeze-out hypersurface even at LHC energies.

We focused on strangeness-neutral, isospin-symmetric QCD matter, which closely resembles the situation encountered in heavy-ion collision experiments. Using this EoS, we present here results on various QCD material parameters along lines of constant entropy per baryon number $s/n_B$. In particular we compute the specific heat, speed of sound, compressibility, and the thermal expansion coefficient along lines of constant $s/n_B$. We also present results at zero chemical potential for the isothermal speed of sound and isothermal compressibility. We show that in the vicinity of the crossover temperature, the speed of sound at fixed $s/n_B$ has a well localized minimum or \"soft point\" at large $s/n_B$, which  appears to vanish as $s/n_B$ decreases. We show that this is consistent with hadron resonance gas model calculations at low temperature and reflects the increasing importance of the baryon sector at low temperature. A similar behavior is found for the isothermal speed of sound, which decreases monotonically at low temperature for all $s/n_B$. Furthermore, we show that in the entire range of $s/n_B$ relevant for the beam energy scan at RHIC, the specific heat, compressibility, and thermal expansion coefficient show no indication for an approach to critical behavior that one would expect close to a possibly existing critical endpoint.",

We first use Bayesian inference within the color glass condensate framework to extract the proton shape fluctuations from HERA exclusive vector meson production data at $x = 10^{-3}$. With this input, we employ the JIMWLK evolution for the proton and nucleus geometry from HERA to LHC energies. We then do the hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the various hydrodynamic observables obtained using this setup with evolved geometry parameters with full JIMWLK evolution. We find the multiplicity distributions and $v_n-p_T$ correlations are sensitive to the JIMWLK evolution. These help us to understand the energy evolution of nuclear geometry in the future. \r\n    For electron+nucleus collisions, we find out that the nuclear geometric deformations and fluctuations affect diffractive vector meson productions, and that multi-pole deformations at different length scales manifest themselves at different regions of transverse momentum transfer. Further more, the JIMWLK evolution doesn’t wash out this effects. We systematically study the deformations effects of Uranium (U), Gold (Au), Oxygen-16 ($^{16}O$), and Neon ($^{20}Ne$) on the diffractive $J/\\Psi$ productions.

Out of the latter two quantities, an effective baryon (net quark) chemical potential is defined, which equals the baryon chemical potential after thermal equilibration. We then study thermalization and the production of three flavors of massless quarks in spatially homogeneous systems initially filled only with gluons. A complete parametric understanding for thermalization and quark production is obtained for both initially very dense or dilute systems, which are confirmed by detailed numerical simulations. For initial distributions more relevant for heavy-ion collisions, the complete thermal equilibration is found to be significantly delayed by considering quark production due to Pauli blocking. The implications of such an observation for heavy-ion phenomenology will also be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Baryon number is a strictly conserved quantity in QCD and is conventionally assumed to be divided equally among the three valence quarks in baryonic matter.  An alternative model is the baryon junction: a Y-shaped configuration of nonperturbative gluons that is connected to all three valence quarks and carries the baryon number.  Neither of these theories has been experimentally verified.  Because valence quarks carry the baryon's electric charge, we can test if they also carry the baryon number by comparing baryon stopping to charge stopping. This is done to high precision using the STAR isobar dataset of ${}^{96}_{44}\\rm{Ru} + {}^{96}_{44}\\rm{Ru}$ and ${}^{96}_{40}\\rm{Zr} + {}^{96}_{40}\\rm{Zr}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\\rm{GeV}$.  Results show that at mid-rapidity the ratio of the net-baryon yield, $B$, to the difference in net-charge yield, $\\Delta Q = Q(\\rm{Ru}) - \\textit{Q}(\\rm{Zr})$, is roughly twice as large in central collisions  as would be expected if the valence quarks carry the baryon number.  Another observable that is sensitive to the carrier of the baryon number is the net-proton yield in semi-inclusive photonuclear collisions, a type of ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision where one nucleus emits a quasi-real photon interacting with the other colliding nucleus.   We observe significant baryon stopping at low transverse momentum in photonuclear processes using $\\rm{Au}+\\rm{Au}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4~\\rm{GeV}$.   Our combined results in isobar collisions and photonuclear processes indicate deviations from the picture of valence quarks as the baryon carrier and favor the baryon junction hypothesis.",

This size difference represents the so-called neutron skin and is determined by the strong nuclear force in the same regime as that determining the masses and radii of neutron stars. The neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb, owing to its simple structure and large neutron excess, has been the target of many dedicated efforts. We present a state-of-the-art global analysis to fit a hydrodynamic model to soft sector measurements of ultrarelativistic $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions performed at the LHC to achieve the first determination of the neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb in scattering processes mediated by gluons at high energy. Thanks to the high sensitivity of high-energy observables such as the total hadronic cross sections and elliptic flow to the overall size of the colliding $^{208}$Pb ions, we achieve an accurate determination of the skin: $\\Delta r_{np}=0.217\\pm0.058$ fm. This is consistent with state-of-the-art nuclear theory predictions, and competitive in precision with a recent extraction from polarized electron scattering by the PREX collaboration at JLab.",

      "Abstract": "As dileptons are radiated from the extreme states of matter created in heavy-ion collisions with negligible final-state interactions, they retain the information imprinted on them at the time of their creation. Multi-differential measurements of dilepton invariant mass, momentum, and angular distributions can therefore serve as a unique tool to characterize the properties of matter in the interior of the hot and dense fireball.\r\n\r\nAn important property of virtual photons is their spin polarization defined in the rest frame of the virtual photon with respect to a chosen quantization axis. Even an isotropic thermal medium can exhibit nontrivial anisotropies in the angular distributions of the produced lepton pairs. While the total yield and observable spectra are proportional to the sum of the longitudinal and transverse components of the spectral function, the polarization depends on their difference. As the processes that drive the medium effects in the spectral function change with invariant mass and momentum, this becomes a powerful tool to study the composition and degrees of freedom of the hot and dense medium.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we utilize a coarse-grained hadronic transport approach to model the space-time evolution of the fireball. We calculate the polarization observables of thermal virtual photons as a function of mass and momentum and compare the results to existing measurements from HADES and NA60. Finally, we discuss the prospects of using an excitation function of virtual photon polarization to disentangle the contributions to the thermal dilepton radiation of hadronic and partonic origin.",

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "In-medium modifications of vector spectral functions are anticipated to carry imprints of restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature/baryon density. Strong modifications have been indeed measured via dimuon production at the CERN SPS, whereas it remains inconclusive how to quantify those changes as the direct consequence of chiral symmetry restoration. Given the difficulty that it is elusive to construct the axial-vector spectrum in heavy-ion experiments, the key phenomenon is that the vector meson mixes with the axial-vector meson in a medium via pion loops, known as chiral mixing. The chiral mixing effect can be quantified as a model-independent theorem at low temperature [1], whereas at the critical temperature the chiral symmetry restoration compels the vanishing chiral-mixing [2]. On-going experiments and recent development of hydrodynamic model bring us a unique opportunity to get insight into chiral symmetry restoration from investigation of the dilepton invariant mass spectra.\r\nIn this work, a case study is carried out by utilizing the following 3 scenarios: (A) chiral restoration absent, (B) chiral restoration present and (C) false chiral restoration. The scenario-B describes the in-medium spectral function of the rho meson from zero to the chiral crossover temperature [2]. The scenario-C is often argued to generate an increase of the dilepton yield, which is incorrect since the procedure does not capture the change of QCD ground state.\r\nWe combine the in-medium spectral function in the chiral effective field theory with state-of-the-art fluid dynamical simulations with temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities [3]. We find an increase of the yield at 1.2-1.4 GeV due to the degenerate $\\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons, whereas the scenario of false restoration leads to a substantial overestimate at 1.2 GeV and this also causes an underestimate below and above the $\\rho$ peak.\r\n\r\n[1] M.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Our ability to predict thermodynamic observables and determine the QCD critical point at real values of chemical potentials is severely limited by the infamous sign problem. To address this issue, there are two common approaches: expanding the QCD partition function in a Taylor series with respect to the charge chemical potentials ($\\mu_{B,Q,S}$) or analytically continuing from imaginary chemical potentials. However, both methods have limitations, particularly for larger values of the baryon chemical potential. Recently, we proposed a multi-point Pade approach[1] based on a (2+1)-flavor Lattice QCD simulation that uses multiple imaginary chemical potentials with temporal extents of $N_{\\tau}=4,6,8$. This method combines the benefits of the aforementioned approaches and is expected to provide more reliable quantitative predictions for small to intermediate values of the baryon chemical potential. Another, advantage we can use this method to estimate different critical points of QCD by examining the singularities of the Pade series.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we will focus on two critical points, well known Roberge-Weiss critical point, which arises when the baryon chemical potential is purely imaginary, and the QCD critical point, which will emerge at a real value of the baryon chemical potential. We use the multi-point Pade approach to locate the Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, which are obtained from lattice QCD simulated data. Our results demonstrate that the scaling of these singularities corresponds to the expected scaling of the well-known Roberge-Weiss transition. The universal scaling of singularities in the vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint is also investigated. Lee-Yang edge singularities associated with the QCD critical point at the real chemical potential for various temperatures are calculated. As the temperature decreases, the imaginary part of the singularities becomes smaller, hinting at a possible existence of a critical point at low temperatures. A machine learning technique is used to model the probability density of the singularities and interpolate the real and imaginary parts of the singularities between different temperatures. By employing a suitable scaling ansatz, the singularities are extrapolated towards the real axis, and the possible location of the QCD critical point is estimated. Preliminary results of ($T_{CEP},\\mu_B^{CEP}$) are consistent with model predictions and other lattice QCD calculations.\r\n[1] P.

I argue that the second-order susceptibility of the positive-parity state can become negative when the chiral symmetry is restored, as a natural consequence of the unique relationship of the mass to the order parameter and are indicative of approaching the critical point on the chiral phase boundary.

This feature makes the heavy flavor product an ideal probe to explore how a heavy flavor hadron is formed from a heavy flavor quark, which is referred to as the heavy quark hadronization. A series of heavy flavor hadron and jet simulation studies have been carried out with the newly developed EIC project detector conceptual designs. We will present reconstructed heavy flavor hadron mass and heavy flavor jet transverse momentum spectrums, the projected nuclear modifications of heavy flavor hadrons inside jets, and heavy flavor jet substructure distributions in $e+p$ and $e+A$ collisions with the EIC project detector design and the projected integrated luminosities at the EIC. These proposed EIC heavy flavor measurements will provide a unique path to explore the flavor dependent fragmentation functions and reveal the heavy quark nuclear transport properties in cold nuclear medium.

      "Abstract": "Parton saturation is one of the most intriguing phenomena in the high energy nuclear physics research frontier, especially in the upcoming era of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The lepton-jet correlation in deep inelastic scattering provides us with a new gateway to the parton saturation at the EIC. In particular, we demonstrate that azimuthal angle anisotropies of the lepton-jet correlation are sensitive to the strength of the saturation momentum in the EIC kinematic region. In contrast to the predictions based on the collinear framework calculation, significant nuclear modification of the anisotropies is observed when we compare the saturation physics results in e + p and e + Au scatterings. By measuring these harmonic coefficients at the EIC, one can conduct quantitative analysis in different collisional systems and unveil compelling evidence for saturation effects.",

      "Abstract": "Understanding the internal spin structure of the nucleon remains a challenge in strong interaction physics. The unique capability of RHIC to provide both longitudinally and transversely polarized hadronic collisions at various energies opened new avenues in studying the internal structure of the proton with unprecedented depth and precision. Significant progress has been made in the last few years through various measurements at STAR.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal spin measurements have contributed significantly to our understanding of the quark and gluon helicity distributions inside the proton. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, from STAR inclusive jet and dijet measurements, provides the first evidence of a positive gluon polarization with partonic momentum fraction $x > 0.05$. The reconstruction of $W^{\\pm}/Z$ in longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions indicates that there is a flavor separation of the light sea quark helicity distributions. In transversely polarized proton collisions, $W^{\\pm}/Z$-bosons provide the first constraint on the sea-quark Sivers function and contributes to the tests of the predicted sign change. The tilt of the dijet opening angle provides a direct access to the first Mellin momentum of the Sivers function and avoids the spin-correlated fragmentation contributions. The novel measurements of the azimuthal distributions of identified hadrons in jets and spin-dependent dihadron correlations directly probe the collinear quark transversity in the proton, with the former coupled to the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) Collins fragmentation function and the latter to the dihadron interference fragmentation function. These measurements shed lights on Sivers function, quark transversity and spin-dependent fragmentation functions in both collinear and TMD formalism. When combined with data from the future EIC, they will establish the validity and limits of factorization and universality, thus enabling a deeper understanding of fundamental QCD.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, an overview of recent results on both the longitudinal and transverse spin structure of the proton from STAR will be presented.",

In order to fully exploit \r\nthe theory also for phenomenology we introduce ALPACA [2], a Lorentz invariant parton \r\ncascade which is a representation of the AMY effective kinetic theory in the form of \r\na Monte Carlo event generator. It solves the Boltzmann equation with the full AMY\r\nkernels (elastic scattering and splitting/merging processes) by explicitly simu-\r\nlating the evolution of parton ensembles corresponding to single events. It is\r\nconstructed in a fully Lorentz invariant way by using a method pioneered in [3],\r\nwhich also underlies the parton cascade PCPC [4]. A complication arises from\r\nquantities like the screening mass, that enter the AMY kernels and are defined\r\nas integrals over the phase space densities. We develop a method for extracting\r\nthese locally from the parton ensemble without the need for further informa-\r\ntion. We perform an extensive validation of the framework in thermal equilibrium \r\nand present first results for out-of-equilibrium simulations for collisions of \r\nlight nuclei down to protons.

Measurements in various colliding systems at RHIC and LHC, including Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, O-O, p-Pb, and p-O,  enable precision tests of the medium-size, temperature, and mass dependencies of the in-medium parton propagation and shower formation. We employ a coupled DGLAP evolution framework that takes advantage of splitting functions recently obtained in soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCET$_{\\rm G}$) and  hard thermal loop (HTL) motivated collisional energy loss effects. With  jet quenching effects constrained to the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of charged hadrons  in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02~TeV, we present predictions for light and heavy-meson $R_{AA}$ in Xe-Xe, O-O and p-Pb collisions at the LHC. We find that the nuclear modification scales non-trivially with the quark mass and medium properties. In particular, there can be sizeable collision-induced attenuation of heavy mesons in small systems such as oxygen-oxygen and high-multiplicity p-Pb events. Finally, we analyze the impact of different models of initial-state parton dynamics on the search for QGP signatures in small colliding systems.",

The data set used at $\\sqrt{s} = 13 $~TeV corresponds to the full LHC Run-2 sample, with an integrated luminosity of 138~fb$^{-1}$. For charged constituents within a reconstructed jet of cone radius 0.8, two-particle correlations as functions of relative azimuthal angle ($\\Delta\\phi*$) and pseudorapidity ($\\Delta\\eta*$) are performed in a novel ``jet frame'', where constituent kinematics are re-defined relative to the jet direction being the $z$ axis. The correlation functions are studied in classes of in-jet charged multiplicity up to nearly 100 for different ranges of transverse momentum in the jet frame. Anisotropy Fourier harmonics are extracted from long-range azimuthal correlation functions for $\\left|\\Delta\\eta*\\right|>2$. The long-range elliptic anisotropy harmonic in data is compared to Monte Carlo event generators without including any long-range collective effects such as PYTHIA8 and Sherpa.",

We separately consider the effects of color charge and geometrical hot spot fluctuations, analytically performing the averages over both in a dilute-dense limit. We show that geometric fluctuations of hot spots inside the proton are the dominant source of eccentricity whereas color charge fluctuations only give a negligible correction. The size and number of hot spots are the most important parameters characterizing the eccentricities.\r\n\r\nBy employing a nonrelativistic vector meson wave function and working in the dilute limit of the Color Glass Condensate framework we are able to analytically calculate cross sections for vector meson production in our hot spot model. We find that the coherent cross section is sensitive to both the size of the target and the structure of the probe. The incoherent cross section is dominated by color fluctuations at small transverse momentum transfer (t), by proton and hot spot sizes as well as the structure of the probe at medium t and again by color fluctuations at large t. While the t-dependence of the cross section is well reproduced in our model, the relative normalization between the coherent and the incoherent cross sections points to the need for additional fluctuations in the proton.\r\n\r\n[1] S.

In addition, studies at high multiplicity in small collision systems exhibit signatures of collectivity, which is still not fully understood within a unified picture across system size. Jet quenching in small systems is not observed within current measurement precision, calling for more precise jet measurements.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents new results of charged and full jet production in pp and p--Pb collisions, and the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm pPb}$ at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$, $8$, and 13~TeV. These results are expected to be the most precise measurements of the $R_{\\rm pPb}$ by ALICE to date. To investigate whether jet energy is redistributed in cold nuclear matter, the cross-section ratios for different jet resolution parameters ($R$) are compared between pp and p--Pb collisions, as well as within each collision system. Finally, comparisons between data and model predictions are discussed. This result extends to lower jet transverse momentum than previously measured at the LHC, constraining hard parton production and fragmentation mechanisms applied in model calculations, and the impact of the nuclear-modified parton distribution function on jet production. This measurement also provides new constraints on jet quenching in small collision systems.",

      "Abstract": "One of the main goals in the study of hadronic interactions at LHC energies is the attempt to characterize the mechanisms involved in particle production in different regimes. The charged-particle multiplicity is one of the most interesting observables in these kind of studies. On the one hand, the pseudorapidity dependence of charged-particle production provides information on the partonic structure of the colliding hadrons and is sensitive to non-linear QCD evolution in the initial state. Measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity densities in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$= 5.36 TeV will be presented, for the first time with the wider pseudorapidity coverage achieved by ALICE in Run 3 thanks to newly installed central and forward trackers. On the other hand to understand the thermal-like behavior and the particle yields in pp collisions, a possible approach is to address the principles of quantum states and their entanglement in the produced system. The entanglement in the initial state has a measurable effect on the evolution of the system and is the driving mechanism behind the thermal-like behavior and particle yields observed. We will show equivalence in a calculation of the initial state entropy (calculated using PDF’s) and the final state entropy (calculated using multiplicity distributions) studying primary charged particles produced in pp collisions at 13 TeV.",

      "Abstract": "We propose a novel approach to investigate the evolution of jets in heavy-ion collisions by employing a combination of jet substructure measurements. Our method focuses on isolating the perturbative regime of jet evolution. As a proof of concept, we analyze the distribution of the hardest splitting above a transverse momentum scale, $k_{t,cut}$, in high-$p_t$ jets. For a $k_{t, cut}$ that is significantly greater than any medium scale, the observable is determined by vacuum-like emissions. Therefore, it serves as a unique baseline independent of the medium modeling. Furthermore, a moderate $k_{t,cut}$ enhances the sensitivity to energy loss, specifically highlighting the presence of a critical resolution angle. Finally, at low $k_{t,cut}$, the observable becomes sensitive to induced emissions and medium response. We validate the generality of our findings using various heavy-ion event generators, including Hybrid, JetMed, Jewel, and Matter+LBT/MARTINI  models. Consequently, these substructure measurements can serve as a valuable guideline for future model developments, effectively disentangling different medium contributions. Our study paves the way for the definition of jet observables that can be calculated from first principles, dominated by perturbative QCD, and within the experimental reach of Run3 at the LHC.",

These modifications can be measured using observables like jet momentum profile and generalized angularities to study the details of jet-medium interactions. Jet momentum profile ($\\rho(r)$) encodes radially differential information about jet broadening and has shown migration of charged energy towards the jet-periphery in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Measurements of generalized angularities (girth $g$ and momentum dispersion $p_T^D$) and LeSub (difference between leading and subleading constituents) from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC show harder, or more quark-like jet fragmentation, in the presence of the medium. Measuring these distributions in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC will help us further characterize the jet-medium interactions in a phase-space region complimentary to that of the LHC. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we present the first measurements of fully corrected $\\rho(r)$, $g$, $p_T^D$ and LeSub observables using hard-core jets (jets constructed using constituents with $p_T > 2$ GeV/c to suppress the combinatorial background) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

One example of such property is the medium resolution length, which is related to the smallest angle of emission where the medium can still resolve the daughter particles as individual particles. This can be probed for example through the energy-energy correlator. The medium resolution length has implications to parton energy loss, since two particles will emit energy more vigorously compared to one. Also other details of the parton energy loss, like the path-length dependency, could use precision measurements to provide better discriminating power between available theoretical models. Jets are a good observable to experimentally tackle these questions.

      "Abstract": "The FoCal is a high-granularity forward calorimeter to be installed as an ALICE upgrade subsystem during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 and take data during the LHC Run 4.\r\nIt will cover a pseudorapidity interval of $3.4 < \\eta < 5.8$, allowing to explore QCD at unprecedented low Bjorken-$x$ of down to $\\approx 10^{-6}$ -- a regime where non-linear QCD dynamics are expected to be sizable.\r\nIt consists of a compact silicon-tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) with pad and pixel longitudinal and transverse segmented readout layers to achieve high spatial resolution for discriminating between isolated photons and decay photon pairs. Its hadronic component (FoCal-H) is constructed from copper capillary tubes filled with scintillator fibers and used for isolation energy measurement and jets.\r\n\r\nThe FoCal detector extends the ALICE physics program with the capability, unique at the LHC, to investigate gluon Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in the low-$x$ regime. This not only enables the study of non-linear QCD effects such as gluon saturation, but also allows to provide experimental constrains for (nuclear) PDFs in a region of phasespace where experimental data is scarce.The detector design allows carrying out these explorations using a multitude of probes, including direct photons, jets, as well as photo-production of vector mesons such as the J/$/psi$ in proton-Pb and Pb-Pb ultra-peripheral collisions.In addition, correlations of different probes can be studied, including gamma-jet, jet--jet and $\\pi^0$--$\\pi^{0}$ correlations.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we give an overview of the small-x physics program of the FoCal detector, as well as an overview of the expected performance of the detector for various observables. The latter is quantified using recent experimental results of ever-improving prototypes of the detector, which were operated at the Test Beam facilities of CERN in the years 2021--2023.\r\nFurthermore, simulation studies are presented, which showcase the robustness of the detector design and its physics potential.",

      "Abstract": "The ALICE experiment is preparing for the ITS3 upgrade, which is set to take place during the LHC Long Shutdown 3. The aim of this upgrade is to replace the three innermost tracking layers with truly cylindrical wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). By adopting this innovative technology, ALICE will further reduce the material budget and the distance from the interaction point, thus significantly improving its tracking and vertexing capabilities. The R&D program for ITS3 includes several advancements, such as operability of bent MAPS, validation of the 65nm CMOS technology and employment of the stitching process to produce wafer-scale sensors.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ITS3 upgrade, ALICE is designing a completely new apparatus, ALICE 3, planned for LHC Run 5 and 6. The detector consists of a large MAPS-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by multiple systems for particle identification, including silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. The vertex detector will be based on an evolution of the ITS3 concept aiming at a track pointing resolution of better than 10 micron for $p_{\\rm T}$>200 MeV/c through the integration of the tracking layers in a retractable structure inside the beam pipe. ALICE 3 will, on the one hand, enable novel studies of the quark-gluon plasma and, on the other hand, open up important physics opportunities in other areas of QCD and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will cover both the ITS3 upgrade and the plans for ALICE 3, highlighting the detector concept, the physics performance, and the status of novel sensor R&D. It will showcase the achievements already made and provide an outline of the future plans for advancing the detector technologies.",

      "Abstract": "The intriguing phenomena emerging in the high-density quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter are being widely studied in the heavy ion program at the LHC and will be understood more deeply during the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) era. The CMS experiment is under the Phase II upgrade towards the HL-LHC era. A new timing detector is proposed with its timing resolution for minimum ionization particles (MIP) to be 30 ps. The MIP timing detector (MTD) will also provide the particle identification (PID) ability with a large pseudorapidity acceptance covering up to $|\\eta|<3$ through time-of-flight (TOF). Combining MTD with the other new subdetectors, i.e., a tracker with acceptance $|\\eta|<4$ and high-granularity calorimeters with acceptance $|\\eta|<5$, will enable deeper studies of high-density QCD matters in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. In this presentation, the performances of a broad range of measurements in the future CMS heavy ion programs will be discussed using TOF-PID. These include the (3+1)-dimensional evolution of heavy flavor quarks, QGP medium response to high transverse momentum parton energy loss at wide jet cone angles, collectivity in small systems, fluctuations and transport of initially conserved charges, and light nuclei physics.",

Recent measurements of the production of antinuclei as a function of rapidity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV have been carried out with ALICE to allow for the extrapolation of the nuclear production models at forward rapidity, region of interest for astrophysics.\r\nRecent results on the cross-section of nuclei-antinuclei annihilation will also be discussed in this contribution.

The shear stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation: it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field  each evolving according to different dynamical equation. For large magnetic fields we further show that the solutions of this theory display oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory.

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "In binary neutron-star mergers, violent changes in density drive the proton fraction out of equilibrium at timescales of milliseconds, comparable to those required by weak interactions to restore beta equilibrium. As a result, the pressure evolves out of phase with the density oscillations, giving rise to dissipative work that can be modeled as an effective bulk-viscous correction [1,2]. Near beta equilibrium, the correction to the pressure is known to follow an Israel-Stewart-like equation of motion, with transport coefficients determined by the equation of state outside beta equilibrium and weak-interaction rates [2]. However, it is not clear if that is the regime that actually occurs in neutron star mergers [3]. In this work, we shed new light on this problem in the following way. First, we show how this hydrodynamic description can be extended far from equilibrium, without approximations, allowing us to model neutron star matter that is arbitrarily far from beta equilibrium. We find that for realistic equations of state [4], the linear approximation in deviations from equilibrium commonly assumed in the field [1] has very limited applicability and, thus, realistic neutron star mergers are indeed in the far-from-beta equilibrium regime. We calculate the resulting far-from-equilibrium transport coefficients for equations of state that satisfy the latest constraints from multi-messenger observations from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. Our results pave the way for novel systematic studies of viscous effects in numerical simulations of binary mergers [3].\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] M. G. Alford, L. Bovard, M. Hanauske, L. Rezzolla and K.

      "Abstract": "The measurement of jets recoiling from a trigger hadron (hadron+jet) provides unique probes of medium-induced modification of jet production. Jet deflection via multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents may broaden the azimuthal correlation between the trigger hadron and the recoiling jet. In addition, the tail of this azimuthal correlation may be sensitive to single-hard Moli`ere scatterings off quasi-particles in the medium. The R-dependence of recoil jet yield probes jet energy loss and intra-jet broadening. In inclusive jet populations, the principle axis of energy flow in the plane transverse to the jet axis examines the correlation of particles outside the jet cone with the energy of the jet. This and the hadron+jet results may be sensitive to wake effects due to jet-medium energy transfer at low $p_\\mathrm{T}$. \r\nThis talk presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a trigger hadron in pp and Pb--Pb collisions. We observe that the jet yield at low $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and at large azimuthal angle between the trigger hadron and jet is significantly enhanced in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions, which we interpret through comparisons to model calculations.

Comparing the correlations with the prompt photon triggered hadron spectra, one can extract the property of the medium from various aspects and contribute to distinct models. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has collected its highest statistics of the $\\gamma$ and $\\pi^0$ triggered hadron events in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV in the RHIC Year-2014 run, and measured not only the inclusive spectra of the triggered hadrons but also the angle and energy dependent $I_{AA}$ and $D_{AA}$.

      "Abstract": "Partons traversing the hot and dense medium of deconfined color charges produced in collisions of heavy nuclei are expected to lose their energy primarily through medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung. As a result, the amount of induced energy loss is expected to depend on the QCD color charge carried by the parton, i.e. depend on whether it is a quark- or a gluon-initiated jet. In this talk, photon+jet events taken with the ATLAS detector in Pb+Pb and pp are used to constrain the color-charge dependence of jet energy loss. First, ATLAS presents the finalized result on the nuclear modification factor RAA for photon-tagged jets. By comparing this measurement to the RAA for inclusive jets, one can exploit the known difference in the quark-/gluon-initiated jet fraction between these two samples and extract the QCD color-charge dependence. Second, ATLAS presents a new measurement of photon plus two jet production in Pb+Pb collisions as compared to $pp$, where the configuration of quark+gluon jet pair is expected to dominate.

In this talk, we present new comprehensive ATLAS measurements of jet suppression and substructure performed using various jet radii and grooming techniques. New measurements of inclusive jet suppression ($R_{AA}$) in heavy-ion collisions are presented for jets reconstructed with different radii ($R$=0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. We will also present new results of the jet substructure which use Soft-Drop grooming procedure to identify the hardest parton splitting in the jet. The measurements are performed using different jet constituents such as charged tracks, smaller R calorimeter jets, and novel objects reconstructed using tracker and calorimeter information. The jet suppression is characterized using RAA and presented as a function of its transverse momentum ($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$), the angle of the hardest splitting ($r_{g}$), and the corresponding transverse momentum scale ($\\sqrt{d_{12}}$). These new measurements, along with theory comparisons, will elucidate the mechanisms of jet suppression, medium effects, and energy recovery in the QCD medium.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks (i.e. charm and beauty) are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Although they are initially produced out of kinetic equilibrium via hard partonic scattering processes, recent measurements of anisotropic flow of charmed hadrons pose the question regarding the possible thermalization of heavy quarks in the medium. Our recent work [1] has provided new insights on the level of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP. In particular, exploiting a mapping between transport theory and fluid-dynamics, we have shown how a fluid-dynamic description of the dynamics of charm quarks in the QCD plasma is feasible. Inspired by recent lattice-QCD calculations [2], we will show how a partial thermalization within the lifetime of the QGP is expected also for beauty quarks.\r\nWe will present results for spectra of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic code (FluiduM [3]) coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current in the QGP. We will also show preliminary calculations for beauty spectra. We compare our calculations with the most recent experimental data providing further constraints on the heavy-quark spatial diffusion coefficient [4]. \r\nThis work is funded via the DFG ISOQUANT Collaborative Research Center (SFB 1225).\r\n\r\n[1] Phys.Rev.D 106 3, 034021 (2022)\r\n[2] e-Print: 2302.08501 [hep-lat]\r\n[3] Phys.

      "Abstract": "Recent experimental results on the Λ+c/D0 ratio in proton-proton collisions – strongly enhanced compared to expectations relying on universal fragmentation fractions/functions in different colliding system, from e+e− to pp – led to speculations about possible medium effects affecting hadronization, previously considered a distinctive feature only of heavy-ion collisions. Here we show how the assumption of the formation of a small, deconfined and expanding fireball also in pp collisions, in which charm quarks can undergo rescattering and hadronization, allows one to qualitative reproduce unexpected experimental findings in the heavy-flavor particle ratios and distributions. For this purpose we apply to the proton-proton case the same in-medium hadronization mechanism previously developed to address heavy-ion collisions and based on local color-neutralization via recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite color charges from the background fireball. In our model the presence of diquark excitations in the hot medium favors the formation of charmed baryons and the recombination process, involving quite collinear partons from the same fluid cell, turns out to be an efficient mechanism to transfer the collective flow of the system to the final charmed hadrons.\r\nThe model -- described in detail in EPJC 82 (2022) 7, 607 -- allowed us to provide a good description of the charmed-hadron ratios and momentum-distribution in nucleus-nucleus collision. Its extension to the proton-proton case provides a consistent explanation for the enhanced Λ+c/D0 ratio observed in these collisions and leads to other interesting results for the charmed-hadron momentum distributions -- entering into the definition of the R_AA, in which the pp result can no longer be considered as the no-final-state-effect benchmark -- and for their elliptic-flow coefficient, reflecting the initial deformation of the fireball.\r\nHaving validated our modelling of the initial state of the fireball and its hydrodynamic evolution against the measured soft-particle multiplicity in pp collisions, we believe our results are pretty robust and provide a unified picture of heavy-flavor production from pp to AA collisions.",

      "Speaker": "Vincenzo Minissale",

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "In the past years, a Quasi-Particle Model (QPM) has been developed to study charm quark dynamics in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions supplying a satisfactory description of both the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of D mesons and leading to a first evaluation of the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$ from the phenomenology [1,2]. Within an event-by-event full Boltzmann transport approach followed by a hybrid hadronization via coalescence plus fragmentation, we will discuss for the first time $R_{AA}(p_T), v_2(p_T)$ and $v_3(p_T)$ predictions down to $p_T \\rightarrow 0$ for D and B mesons as well as $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\Lambda_b$ at both RHIC-sPHENIX and LHC energies [3]. Furthermore the analysis is extended to higher order anisotropic flows $v_n$ of D mesons, also evaluated by using the Event-Shape-Engineering (ESE) technique [4]. We find that QPM approach is able to correctly predict not only the new observables related to charm quark sector, but also the first available data on $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of single-electron from B mesons decays measured by ALICE. The role of the large  $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\Lambda_b$ production is relevant especially in the low $p_T$ region that is becoming accessible to sPHENIX and ALICE.\r\nA significant breaking of the expected scaling of the thermalization time $\\tau_{th}$ with $M_Q/T$ is found, studying the evolution with mass of $D_s(T)$ to better assess the comparison to lQCD calculations. Charm quark $D_s(T)$ is about $50\\%$ larger than the asymptotic value for $M_Q\\rightarrow \\infty$, while bottom $D_s(T)$ is only $20\\%$ higher. Such a behaviour entails for $M_Q\\rightarrow \\infty$, a $D_s(T)$ which is consistent within the current uncertainty to the most recent lattice QCD calculations with dynamical quarks and allows to envisage for bottom quark a thermalization time smaller than the one from $M_Q/T$ scaling.\r\n\r\n[1] X.

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia are a very interesting probe for the study of thequark gluon plasma (QGP), created in ultrarelativisitc heavy-ion collisions. They can elucidate several features of the QGP, which are not accessible to other probes. These include the energy loss of color neutral states and open heavy flavour partons in the QGP, the possible recombination of heavy quarks during the expansion of the QGP and the influence of the potential between c(b) and $\\bar c(\\bar b)$, which is modified in the QGP environment, on the production of quarkonia. \r\n\r\nWe present the first microscopic approach for the study of quarkonia. It follows the heavy quarks from their initial production to the detection as a part of a quarkonium or as open heavy flavour hadron. After being produced in EPOS4 by (shadowing modified) initial collisions, the heavy quarks interact mutually by a potential, calculated on the lattice. When the temperature of the surrounding QGP environment falls below the dissociation temperature of the quarkonia species, a density matrix, based quantum approach of Remler [1], describes the formation and destruction of quarkonia due to its interaction with the QGP medium while the QGP medium expands.\r\nThe expanding QGP is described by the EPOS4 approach, which has shown to reproduce a multitude of experimental observables in the light hadron sector. At freeze out the free heavy quarks combine through hadronization to open heavy flavour partons, which are well reproduced in this approach. We compare the J/$\\psi$ as well as the $\\psi'$, produced in Remler approach with the available data on transverse momentum spectra, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ and analyse, including feed down corrections, how the above processes influence the production of quarkonia.

      "Abstract": "Many new jet substructure observables have been studied in recent years, with particular attention to those which can be calculated by perturbative QCD. N-point energy correlators are currently attracting both theoretical and experimental interest. To comprehensively study the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of jet structure, we measured the energy-energy correlators (EEC) that emphasize the angular structure of the energy flow within jets. Defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs inside jets, the EECs as a function of pair distance show a distinct separation of the perturbative from the non-perturbative regime, revealing parton flavor dependent dynamics of jet formation as well as the confinement of the partons into hadrons. The projected 3-point correlator (E3C) is the first step in observing multi-particle correlations in jets. They encodes the shape dependence of energy flow in jets and supplement the EEC to cleanly access the pQCD region.\r\nWe present first measurements of the EECs for D0-tagged and inclusive (gluon-dominated) jets in pp and p--Pb collisions at 13 TeV and 5.02 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. By comparing our results with perturbative QCD predictions, we can measure the modification in the radiation pattern of jets due to mass effects and due to the presence of a cold nuclear medium. We also perform the first E3C measurement for inclusive jets in pp collisions at 13 TeV. This suite of measurements will serve as a baseline for future studies in heavy-ion collisions, allowing for disentanglement of the dynamics of the dead cone from interactions with the quark-gluon plasma.",

In heavy-ion collisions, the `formation time’ of a splitting takes on meaning due to interactions with the medium and is a critical feature for the phenomenology of medium-modified parton showers. The $g\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ splitting is especially suited to study this formation time, as the $c\\bar{c}$ virtuality is of the same order as medium effects and since the typical time is of the same order as the quark-gluon plasma lifetime. In this talk we demonstrate how to study this process from hadron distributions inside jets containing two D mesons. In particular, we show how the virtuality distribution of the original splitting depends characteristically on the formation time.",

We demonstrate that approximately 50% of the pT-differential triangular flow difference between the measurements by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations can be explained by the use of reference flow vectors from different rapidity regions. This emphasizes the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelation for anisotropic flow measurements in asymmetric nuclear collisions, and the need for (3+1)D simulations. We further present results for the beam energy scan of d+Au collisions and compare to PHENIX data. The same framework is used to describe p+Pb collisions and photo-nuclear events in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We compare to experimental data on momentum anisotropies from the ATLAS Collaboration and find good agreement with the measured elliptic flow. Again, the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelations is highlighted, as they dominate the elliptic flow hierarchy between p+Pb and γ+Pb collisions.

For quite a number of years, jets have been successfully used to probe the properties of the special form of matter, the quark gluon plasma (QGP), formed in high-energy heavy ion collisions. One of the most recognized signatures of the QGP, the jet quenching phenomenon, has been evidenced by a wide range of LHC measurements from lead-lead collisions. More recently, experimental results through multiparticle correlation techniques provided some evidence of possible QGP formation in the smaller colliding systems, such as high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, but confirmation of the jet quenching expected for QGP remains elusive for such collisions. In this talk, systematic measurements of jet properties are presented for proton-lead collisions data collected by the CMS experiment to search for hot medium production or effects of cold nuclear matter in small systems.

      "Abstract": "Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, predicts that at sufficiently high temperature and/or high energy density, normal nuclear matter converts into a deconfined state of quarks and gluons, known as the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). To investigate the phase diagram of the QCD matter, the Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider (RHIC) started the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program in  2010, delivering Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 62.4 GeV.  The success of the BES-I program justified the second phase of Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) with higher statistics and detector upgrades.  Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}}$= $7.7-54.4$ $\\text{GeV}$ were collected during $2017-2021$, covering a large area of the QCD phase diagram in temperature and baryon chemical potential by varying the collision energy, centrality, and rapidity.  In particular, the installed Event Plane Detector (EPD) enables the measurement of charged particle production at far-backward pseudorapidity.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we  present pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 27 GeV with the EPD ($2.15 < |\\eta| < 5.09$).  We will also present the transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons ($\\pi^{\\pm}$, $K^{\\pm}$, $p$ and $\\bar{p}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$  = 7.7 to 54.4 GeV within mid-rapidity ($|y| < 1$). The mid-rapidity yields of identified hadrons show the expected signatures of large baryon stopping at lower energies and the dominance of pair production at higher energies. The centrality dependence of integrated yields (dN/dy and dN/d$\\eta$), average transverse momenta ($\\langle p_{T} \\rangle$), particle ratios,  chemical and kinetic freeze-out parameters will also be presented.  These results will be compared to published results at other collision energies and the new insights to the QCD phase diagram will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "This talk will present the Bayesian inference approach for quantitatively characterizing the 3D dynamics of heavy-ion collisions and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program. To model the dynamics of the collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV, we employ a (3+1)D dynamical initialization model coupled with the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade hybrid framework [1]. To account for shear and bulk viscous effects at RHIC BES energies, we derive the out-of-equilibrium corrections to particle distributions with multiple conserved charge currents using Grad's moment and Chapman-Enskog methods. A fast model emulator is then trained in a 22-dimensional parameter space to accurately predict identified particle yields, average transverse momenta, and charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients. By carrying out a joint Bayesian analysis of the RHIC BES phase I measurements for Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 19.6, and 200 GeV, we set robust constraints on initial-state baryon stopping and the $\\mu_B$ and $T$ dependence of the QGP shear and bulk viscosity. Our results show that the Bayesian inference approach with our full (3+1)D hybrid framework effectively extracts the QGP properties and the 3D dynamics of the collision events from the RHIC BES measurements and provides quantitative insights into the QCD matter in a baryon-rich environment.\r\n\r\n[1] C.

We impose stability and causality constraints and discuss the possible ranges of free parameter choices arising from the 3D Ising model to QCD mapping.

We extend prior attractor studies of non-conformal systems by using a realistic mass- and temperature-dependent relaxation time and explicitly computing the effect of varying both the initial momentum-space anisotropy and initialization time on the time evolution of a large set of integral moments. Our findings are consistent with prior studies, which found that there is an attractor for the scaled longitudinal pressure, but not for the shear and bulk viscous corrections separately. We further present evidence that both late- and early-time attractors exist for all moments of the one-particle distribution function that contain greater than one power of the longitudinal momentum squared.",

The infinite hierarchy of moments can be truncated by keeping only the three lowest moments that correspond to the three independent components of the energy-momentum tensor. By comparing the moment equations with the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations, we demonstrate that the latter are able to capture the early-time, collisionless dynamics, albeit approximately, due to their relaxation-type structure [1]. We also derive second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics from the three-moment truncation and find that there are ambiguities in the definition of some second-order transport coefficients. In order to understand the nature of these ambiguities, we derive the full second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics by employing Chapman-Enskog expansion and also from a novel entropy approach and show that such ambiguities are inherent when defining some of the second-order transport coefficients [2]. We show that these ambiguities affect the ability of the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics to reproduce the results of kinetic theory.

Both collisional broadening and medium-induced radiative corrections in the initial state are considered  in the soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons (SCET$_{G}$) approach. We demonstrate that in-medium bremsstrahlung exhibits rapidity divergences as $x\\rightarrow 1$ and collinear divergences at the endpoints $x=0,1$ of the emission spectra. We further show that the rapidity divergences lead to Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution of the collision kernel and can be resummed into the transverse momentum broadening of particle production. In turn, the endpoints divergences of in-medium radiation can be resummed through the collinear evolution of parton densities in  nuclear matter. The TMD factorization framework is applied to understand the transverse-momentum spectra of Drell-Yan pair production in $pA$ and $\\pi A$ collisions and provides calculations with improved accuracy for hadron production in cold QCD processes at RHIC and LHC.",

The resulting initial state anisotropies, coupled with similar final state effects, may account for the observed azimuthal anisotropy of the produced high transverse momentum hadrons, without modification to the angle integrated spectra ($R_{AA} \\simeq 1$).

Furthermore, the incorporation of stochastic fluctuations may be important for the modeling of hydrodynamics in small systems such as proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. We present a new general formalism for introducing thermal fluctuations in relativistic hydrodynamics which incorporates the recent developments on the causality and stability of relativistic hydrodynamic theories. Our approach is based on the recently introduced information current [1], which measures the net amount of information carried by perturbations around equilibrium in a relativistic many-body system. The resulting noise correlators are guaranteed to be observer-independent for thermodynamically stable models, which differs from previous approaches employed in the literature. We obtain a Martin-Siggia-Rose [2] action principle within our formalism and compare it to previous proposals for hydrodynamic effective actions. Finally, we present a few applications, which include the Israel-Stewart theory in a general hydrodynamic frame [3]. We find the adoption of a general hydrodynamic frame introduces new independent structures to the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor which are not present in previous calculations done in the Landau or Eckart hydrodynamic frames.\r\n \r\n[1] L.

      "Abstract": "There is increasing interest in using high-energy collisions to probe the structure of nuclei, in particular with the high-precision data made possible by collisions performed with pairs of isobaric species. A systematic study requires a variation of parameters representing nuclear properties such as radius, skin thickness,  angular deformation, and short-range correlations, to determine the sensitivity of the various observables on each of these properties. In this work we propose a method for efficiently carrying out such study, based on the shifting of positions of nucleons in Monte-Carlo samples.  We show that by using this method, statistical demands can be dramatically reduced --- potentially reducing the required number of simulated events by orders of magnitude --- paving the way for systematic study of nuclear structure in high-energy collisions.\r\n\r\nAs an application, we perform a systematic study of short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations and their effects on heavy-ion observables.  Using our methods these effects, though small, can be precisely studied without the need for large numbers of simulations.  In particular, we illustrate the limitations of a simple exclusion radius as a proxy for realistic nucleon-nucleon correlation functions.\r\n\r\nReference:  arXiv:2302.14026",

      "Speaker": "Rachel Steinhorst",
      "Institute": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "One of the main challenges in the theory of heavy ion collisions is understanding how an initial state of two highly Lorentz-contracted nuclei acquires the features of a hydrodynamic plasma in a characteristic time of 1 fm/c. Arguably, the most successful descriptions of this out-of-equilibrium stage have been established by finding so-called “attractor” solutions in the various (simplified) theories that attempt to capture out-of-equilibrium dynamics of QCD. These attractors are characterized by a loss of sensitivity to the initial conditions, which is achieved because the kinetic theory is dynamically driven to a preferred “attractor surface” in the phase space of the theory, often well before hydrodynamization in weakly coupled kinetic theory.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework [1,2] is a promising candidate to describe and characterize attractors in a model-independent formulation. In principle, all that needs to be done is to establish the dominance of an effective ground state in the dynamics of the system. This was done analytically in [2] for the first stage of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [3], demonstrating a dynamical reduction in the number of active degrees of freedom much earlier than the hydrodynamic regime. A key observation made in [2] was that such effective ground states may require a time-dependent change of coordinates for their dominance to be manifest. Ultimately, such a change of coordinates is one of the defining characteristics of the sought attractor solution, and therefore it becomes imperative to define a procedure to find the “optimal” coordinate transformation for a given theory. In this talk, we will lay out a candidate for such a procedure and will consider the example of collision-driven dynamics in the Bjorken-expanding kinetic theory of a dilute gluon gas to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to describe attractor solutions. We will then lay out the path to explore more realistic descriptions of the expanding QGP, including the later stages of bottom-up thermalization, and the transverse expansion of the medium.\r\n\r\n[1] Brewer, Yan, Yin, arxiv:1910.00021\r\n[2] Brewer, Scheihing-Hitschfeld, Yin, arXiv:2203.02427 \r\n[3] Baier, Mueller, Schiff, Son, arXiv:hep-ph/0009237",

Based on a recent community white paper [1], we discuss physics opportunities for nuclear structure and QGP studies offered by high-energy nuclear collisions, with an emphasis on i) \\textit{isobar collisions}, offering clean access to the structural properties of the colliding ions, as well as ii) collisions of bowling-pin-shaped 20Ne isotopes as a means to complement and broaden the hot QCD program envisaged via 16O+16O collisions.

      "Country": "TU Wien",
      "Abstract": "We study the hydrodynamization process in the aftermath of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions using effective kinetic theory simulations and different observables. For the pressure ratio $P_T/P_L$, we observe that its late-time evolution becomes universal in units of the kinetic relaxation time for sufficiently large couplings signaling the onset of a hydrodynamical attractor. In contrast, at weak couplings, it converges earlier to a bottom-up attractor in terms of the thermalization time scale $\\tau_{\\text{BMSS}} = \\alpha_s^{-13/5}/Q_s$. We interpret these as two limiting attractors. The dynamics of the occupancy of hard modes, the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient, and the jet quenching parameter are better described by a bottom-up limiting attractor even for moderate couplings. Therefore, the previous conjecture that the hydrodynamical attractor governs the late-time approach toward hydrodynamization is not complete. Our results rather indicate that a weak coupling attractor emerges additionally in the coupling regime relevant for heavy-ion collisions for certain observables.",

      "Speaker": "Luca Micheletti",
      "Institute": "CERN",
      "Country": "Switzerland",
      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are produced at the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions, on a time scale shorter than the medium formation time, and are sensitive to the large initial magnetic field produced perpendicular to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter direction and beam direction) in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised. The quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron in the hadronisation process. Experimentally, the heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring the spin density matrix element of spin 1 hadrons (as the  $\\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson). Any deviation of ρ00 parameter from ⅓ can be attributed to the spin alignment of $\\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson.\r\nWe will present the first measurement of the $\\rho_{00}$ parameter of  $\\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson in Pb–Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=5.02~$TeV, exploiting the large data sample collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the LHC Run 2 in 2018. A comparison with the $J/\\psi$ polarisation measurement will also be reported to investigate the effect of the magnetic field. In this study, one of the main background sources is represented by the feed-down contribution from B-meson decays, as vector mesons which decay from scalar B mesons are expected to be longitudinally polarized due to the helicity conservation in weak decays. In this context, the final measurement of the spin alignment of prompt and non-prompt $\\rm{D}^{*+}$ mesons in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}= 13~$TeV, used to quantify the effect of the feed-down in the Pb–Pb measurements, will be presented.",

These processes provide strong constraints on the nuclear photon flux and its dependence on the impact parameter and photon energy. Comparisons of the measured cross-sections to QED predictions from the Starlight and SuperChic models are also presented. Tau-pair production measurements can constrain the tau lepton's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (g-2), and a recent ATLAS measurement using muonic decays of tau leptons in association with electrons and tracks provides one of the most stringent limits available to date. Similarly, light-by-light scattering proceeds via loop diagrams, which can contain particles not yet directly observed. Thus, high statistics measurements of light-by-light scattering shown in this talk provide a precise and unique opportunity to investigate extensions of the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles.",

The rate of the dielectron emission is proportional to the medium's electromagnetic spectral function. In the dielectron mass range from $400$ MeV/$c^{2}$ to $800$ MeV/$c^{2}$, the spectral function probes the in-medium $\\rho$ meson propagator which is sensitive to the medium’s properties including the total baryon density and the temperature. Meanwhile, the low energy range of the spectral function provides information about the medium’s electrical conductivity. Therefore, by measuring thermal dielectron production, we can study the microscopic interactions between the electromagnetic current and the medium.\r\n\r\nThe STAR experiment has recorded large datasets of Au+Au collisions during the Beam Energy Scan Phase-II (BES-II) program, spanning center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) from 3.0 to 19.6 GeV with detector upgrades that benefit the dielectron measurement via extended transverse momentum and rapidity coverages as well as enhanced particle identification capability.

      "Abstract": "Electromagnetic probes such as photons and dielectrons (e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs) are a unique tool to study the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. They are produced at all stages of the collision with negligible final-state interactions. At intermediate dielectron invariant mass ($m_{\\rm ee} > 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$), thermal radiation from the quark-gluon plasma carries information about the early temperature of the medium. At LHC energies, it is however dominated by a large background from correlated heavy-flavour hadron decays. At smaller $m_{\\rm ee}$, thermal radiation from the hot hadronic phase contributes to the dielectron spectrum via decays of $\\rho$ mesons, whose spectral function is sensitive to chiral-symmetry restoration. Finally, at vanishing $m_{\\rm ee}$, the real direct photon fraction can be extracted from the dielectron data. In pp collisions, such measurement in minimum bias events serves as a baseline and a fundamental test for perturbative QCD calculations, while studies in high charged-particle multiplicity events allow one to search for thermal radiation in small colliding systems. The latter show surprising phenomena similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions.\r\nIn this talk, final ALICE results, using the full data sample collected during the LHC Run 2, will be presented. They include measurements of the dielectron and direct-photon production in central Pb--Pb at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pairs, $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, of 5.02 TeV, as well as of direct photons in minimum bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

An excess of direct photons, above prompt photon production from hard scattering processes and consistent with thermal photon emission is observed. The integrated yields scale as $(dN_{ch}/d\\eta)^\\alpha$, with $\\alpha=1.12$, above multiplicities of 20-30.

      "Abstract": "Dileptons are an invaluable tool for mapping out the phase diagram of QCD because they grant observational access to the entire space-time history of heavy-ion collisions. We calculate thermal dilepton yields from Au+Au collisions at BES energies -- $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=7.7, 19.6, 27, 54.4, 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV -- using a realistic (3+1)-dimensional multistage dynamical framework. The underlying emission rates, which include baryon chemical potential dependence for the first time, are implemented from perturbation theory in a manner which smoothly interpolates between the strict next-to-leading order and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regimes. By comparing the slope of the invariant mass spectrum with the average temperature of the fluid (at different evolution times), we assess the efficacy of this observable as a thermometer of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Furthermore, we are able to explore the capability of dileptons as a QGP `baryometer' via their sensitivity to the dynamical evolution and dissipation of baryon charge included in the simulations. We also investigate the correlation between the medium lifetime and the integrated dilepton yields in central and peripheral Au+Au collisions across the different beam energies. Finally, we compare the thermal dielectron invariant mass spectra with those from hadronic cocktail contributions and available STAR measurements. Our results provide a quantitative baseline for dilepton yields at BES energies and highlight the importance of this observable in probing features of QCD thermodynamics.",

      "Abstract": "Photonuclear reactions are induced by the strong electromagnetic field generated by ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. These processes have been extensively studied in ultraperipheral collisions, in which the impact parameter is larger than twice the nuclear radius. In recent years, the observation of coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction has been claimed in nucleus--nucleus (A--A) collisions with nuclear overlap, based on the measurement of an excess (with respect to hadroproduction expectations) in the very low transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm{T}}$) J/$\\psi$ yield. Such quarkonium measurements can help constraining the nuclear gluon distribution at low Bjorken-x and high energy. In addition, they can shed light on the theory behind photon induced reactions in A--A collisions with nuclear overlap, including possible interactions of the measured probes with the formed and fast expanding quark-gluon plasma. In order to confirm the photoproduction origin of the very low-$p_{\\rm{T}}$ J/$\\psi$ yield excess, polarization measurement is a golden observable. It is indeed expected that the produced quarkonium would keep the polarization of the incoming photon due to s-channel helicity conservation. ALICE can measure inclusive and exclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum, at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\\it{y}$|< 0.9). In this contribution, we will report on the new preliminary measurement of the $\\it{y}$-differential cross section and the new first polarization analysis at LHC of coherently photoproduced J/$\\psi$ in peripheral Pb--Pb collisions. Both measurements are conducted at forward rapidity in the dimuon decay channel. These results will be discussed together with the recent results on coherent J/$\\psi$ photoproduction as a function of centrality at both mid and forward rapidities.

We discuss in detail the quantum mechanics of forming excited states, utilizing the Wigner distribution functions of angular momentum eigenstates of isotropic 3-D harmonic oscillators. We describe how resonance decays can be handled, based on a set of minimal assumptions, by creating an extension of hadron decays in PYTHIA 8.

However, it is essential to investigate their performance with rapidity-dependent measurements at low collision energies, where boost-invariance is expected to be strongly violated. In this study, we calibrate a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic framework using rapidity distributions of charged particles and net protons for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7–200$ GeV. We observe significant rapidity dependences in thermodynamic properties at the hadronization process near the chemical freeze-out. The effects on the rapidity dependence of particle production due to longitudinal flow and system size are also highlighted. A rapidity-dependent thermal model is developed, incorporating the dynamical features of the multistage framework. We evaluate the performance of different thermal model scenarios in extracting the freeze-out profiles, using the rapidity-dependent yields of the multistage framework and comparing them to the hydrodynamic freeze-out hypersurface as a closure test [1]. Bayesian analysis is applied to constrain the longitudinal flow, system size in rapidity space, and thermodynamic properties for nuclear matter created at low beam energies. Our Bayesian model selection analysis reveals a longitudinal flow stronger than Bjorken in the experimental measurements as beam energy decreases. Our study provides a simple numerical approach for extracting rapidity-dependent thermodynamic parameters at freeze-out for low-beam energy collisions. Furthermore, analyzing freeze-out profiles through data-driven methods using this model offers quantitative guidance to computationally-demanding hybrid approaches [2].\r\n\r\n[1] Lipei Du, Han Gao, Sangyong Jeon, and Charles Gale, “Rapidity scan with multistage hydrodynamic and statistical thermal models,” arXiv: 2302.13852.\r\n[2] Han Gao, Lipei Du, Sangyong Jeon, and Charles Gale, “Constraining longitudinal dynamics and freeze-out thermodynamics with Bayesian Analysis in a hydrodynamics-inspired thermal model,” in preparation.",

      "Abstract": "Viscous hydrodynamics serves as a successful mesoscopic description of the QGP produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In order to investigate, how such an effective description emerges from the underlying microscopic dynamics we calculate the non-hydrodynamic and hydrodynamic modes of linear response in the sound channel from a first-principle calculation in kinetic theory. We do this with a new approach wherein we linearize and discretize the collision kernel to calculate eigenvalues directly. This allows us to study the Green's functions at any point in time or frequency space. Our study focuses on scalar theory with quartic interaction and we find that the analytic structure of Green's functions in the complex plane is far more complicated than just poles or cuts which is the first step towards an equivalent study in QCD kinetic theory.",

We use kinetic theory to study the far-from-equilibrium evolution of an expanding plasma with an anisotropic momentum-space distribution. We identify slow and fast degrees of freedom in the far-from-equilibrium plasma from the evolution of moments of this distribution. At late times, the slow modes correspond to hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and are naturally gapped from the fast modes by the inverse of the relaxation time. At early times, however, there are an infinite number of slow modes. From the evolution of the slow modes we generalize the paradigm of the far-from-equilibrium attractor to vector and tensor components of the energy-momentum tensor, and even to higher moments of the distribution function that are not part of the hydrodynamic evolution. We predict that initial-state momentum anisotropy decays slowly in the far-from-equilibrium phase and may persist until the relaxation time.",

      "Abstract": "We report on progress in understanding thermalization in QCD at the full quantum level. Previous studies of thermalization of highly excited states in QCD, as they arise in heavy ion collisions, have either involved the (semi-)classical evolution of highly occupied gluon states or kinetic theory. Both approaches omit or approximate essential properties of quantum mechanical systems including coherence and entanglement. An alternative paradigm of understanding thermalization of an isolated quantum system is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which states that matrix elements of local observables in the energy eigenstate basis are equal to the corresponding microcanonical ensemble values, up to random corrections that decrease exponentially with the system size. In this talk, we will show results of testing this hypothesis for the 2+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory on a lattice. The results indicate a subset of physical states in QCD also satisfy the ETH. We will then discuss physical implications of these results. Finally, the simplifications of the Hamiltonian formulation used in this work will be useful for future quantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.",

      "Abstract": "The investigation of the quark content of hadrons has been a major goal of non-perturbative strong interaction physics. In the last decade, several resonances in the mass range 1000-2000 MeV/$c^2$ have emerged that cannot be explained by the quark model. The internal structure of exotic resonances such as $\\rm f_0$, $\\rm f_1$, and $\\rm f_2$ is currently unknown. Different scenarios are possible ranging from two-quark, four-quark, molecule, a hybrid state, or glueballs. A modification of the measured yields of these exotic hadrons in A--A and p--A collisions as compared to pp collisions has been proposed as a tool to investigate their internal structure. \r\n\r\nThe excellent particle identification capabilities of the ALICE detector along with the large data sample collected in pp and p--Pb collisions provide an opportunity for multi-differential studies of such high-mass resonances. In this presentation, the first-ever measurement of $\\rm f_1$ production in pp collisions and measurements of $\\rm f_0$ and $\\rm f_2$ production both in pp and p--Pb collisions will be presented. The measurements of their mass, width, and yields will be presented and their sensitivity to the internal structure of these exotic resonances will be discussed.

      "Abstract": "One main motivation of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC is to search for the QCD critical point and the onset of deconfinement. Strangeness production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of the nuclear matter, such as the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at the chemical freeze-out temperature ($\\mu_S/T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ and $\\mu_B/T_{\\mathrm{ch}}$).\r\n\r\nMeasurements from the first phase of the BES program have indicated potential changes in the medium properties with decreasing collision energy. However, the precision of those measurements is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions. During BES phase-II (BES-II), STAR has accumulated high statistics data in Au+Au collisions at various energies, which can help reduce the uncertainties in the strange hadron measurements, in particular for the multi-strange hadrons. Benefiting from the iTPC upgrade, the strangeness measurements are now extended from mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) to a larger rapidity range (|y|<1.0) as well. In this talk, we will present new STAR measurements of strange hadron ($K_s^0$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Xi$, $\\bar{\\Xi}$, $\\Omega$, $\\bar{\\Omega}$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, 19.6 GeV from BES-II and $\\Omega$($\\bar{\\Omega}$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, including transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra, nuclear modification factors, baryon-to-meson and antibaryon-to-baryon ratios.

Through the simultaneous measurement of high $p_T$ direct photons ($\\gamma^{dir}$) and $\\pi^0$ production for event samples selected by event activity, the final state effects could be disentangled from cold-nuclear-matter effects and event-selection biases that are inherent in using the standard Glauber model. This isolation of final state effects is achieved by approximating the nuclear modification factor by the double ratio $R_{xA}=(\\gamma^{dir}/\\pi^{0})_{pp}/(\\gamma^{dir}/\\pi^{0})_{xA}$. While the cold-nuclear-matter effects in $x+$A collisions cancel in the ($\\gamma^{dir}/\\pi^{0})_{xA}$ ratio, the effective number of binary collisions is given by $N_{\\mathrm{coll}}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\gamma^{dir}_{xAu}/\\gamma^{dir}_{pp}$, which eliminates the dependence on the Glauber model. In addition, many systematic uncertainties cancel in the double ratio. To shed light on the origin of the observed final state suppression and to test if it is consistent with energy loss in droplets of QGP, the results from $d+$Au collisions are compared to preliminary data from smaller ($p+$Au) and larger ($^3$He$+$Au) collision systems.",

At late times, we find that only the color singlet component of the quark’s reduced density matrix survives the in-medium evolution and that the density matrix becomes asymptotically diagonal in both transverse position and momentum spaces. In addition, we observe an accelerated entropy growth due to the larger phase space being explored by the quark and that the quantum and classical quark entropies converge at late times. We further observe that the quark state loses all memory of the initial condition. Combined with the fact that the reduced density matrix satisfies Boltzmann-diffusion transport, we conclude that the quark reduced density matrix can be interpreted as a classical phase space distribution. Finally, we comment on how this approach can offer a generic way to study parton evolution in the QGP and establish a strong connection to initial stage physics.",

Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies.

Some results, however, remain disjoint: the jet mass and jet angularities, including girth and thrust, are strongly-correlated observables that have given seemingly conflicted answers on the angular quenching of jets traversing the QGP. ALICE has carried out new systematic measurements of these and other perturbatively-calculable angularities using consistent definitions for the first time, resolving the long-standing girth-mass problem, and revealing quenching effects at broad angles. Concurrently, applying soft drop grooming isolates the narrowing in the core of quenched jets. Grooming can also be employed to resolve medium scattering centers, with varying methods to focus on regions of the splitting phase space. \r\nWe present the first application of dynamical grooming in heavy-ion collisions to search for excess $k_{\\mathrm{T,g}}$ emissions as a signature of point-like scatters, providing new constraints on searches for in-medium Molière scattering. We also present a new approach for studying jet-medium opacity, based on a time-like rather than angular perspective. By employing a new time reclustering strategy, we potentially enable a time-dependent study of jet substructure observables.

A unified description of both vacuum and medium-induced emissions is therefore lacking.\r\nIn this work, we build a toy Monte-Carlo parton shower ordered in formation time, virtual mass, and opening angle, representing equivalent formulations at leading logarithmic accuracy. Aiming at a link with jet substructure, we compute the Lund Plane distributions and trajectories for each ordering prescription. We also compute the distributions in number of splittings and final partons, with the goal of clarifying the differences in shower evolution to be expected from the different ordering variables. Further, we investigate the sensitivity of ordering prescriptions to medium effects by counting the number of events obeying a decoherence condition.",

To address this challenge, state-of-the-art real-time AI technology is being developed using modern deep neural networks and AI-centric hardware innovations. Supported by the DOE Office of Science Nuclear Physics AI-Machine Learning initiative program, this project aims to process extremely high-rate data streams from the tracking detectors of the upcoming sPHENIX experiment at RHIC by integrating real-time readouts and the intelligent control system that accelerates AI inference with FPGA hardware. This design allows us to collect rare heavy-flavor events with high efficiency in the high rate p+p collisions of O(10) MHz with much limited DAQ bandwidth at 15kHz. The developed approach includes high efficiency heavy-flavor trigger algorithms in the Graph Neural Network framework trained by full sPHENIX p+p collision simulation data, the optimized conversion of AI models into Firmware using the hls4ml package developed by the HEP community, and the deployment of real-time AI technologies on the powerful FELIX-711(712) boards with the Xilinx Kintex Ultrascale FPGA. The successful deployment of AI-based real-time data streaming and reduction at sPHENIX will have significant and immediate impacts: minimizing the computation resources and accelerating the end-to-end pipeline from experiments to physics discovery.   Our project delivers a demonstrator that brings essential benefits to a key science driver of the sPHENIX experiment and enables comprehensive studies of heavy-flavor production in p+p and p+Au collisions.

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor quarks (charm and bottom), produced in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, serve as excellent probes to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). When traversing the medium, charm quarks suffer from `jet quenching' thanks to the interactions with the QGP. It can manifest as degradation of charm quark energy and modifications to the fragmentation pattern, both of which are predicted to depend on parton flavor and quark mass. The energy loss can be quantified by comparing yields of charmed mesons or tagged charm jets in heavy-ion collisions to those in $p$+$p$ collisions. On the other hand, medium-induced modifications to the jet shower can be studied using the jet fragmentation function, i.e., the transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) fraction of the jet carried by hadrons along the jet axis ($z = \\vec{p}_{\\rm T, hadron}\\textbf{.}\\hat{p}_{\\rm T, jet}/|\\vec{p}_{\\rm T, jet}|$).\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we report the first measurement of the $\\rm D^{0}$ meson production yield at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 1$) in isobar collisions (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200 \\text{ GeV}$, with the STAR experiment at RHIC. We present nuclear modification factors as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ for different centrality classes, and compare them to similar measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200 \\text{ GeV}$. We complement the $\\rm D^{0}$ meson studies with measurements of $\\rm D^{0}$ meson tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 200 \\text{ GeV}$. For the first time, we show measurements of charm jet fragmentation function in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, and the nuclear modification factor as a function of $z$. Additionally, we report the yield modifications of $\\rm D^{0}$-tagged jets as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ and the radial profile of the $\\rm D^{0}$ mesons in these tagged jets. These reported measurements can help constrain theoretical calculations of parton flavor, parton mass and system size dependencies of parton interactions with the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "The suppression of jets in heavy-ion collisions can provide detailed information about the hot, dense plasma formed in these collisions at the LHC. Jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the mass of the fragmenting parton. For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy-quark-initiated jets, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. This energy loss mechanism can be studied by measuring differences in the suppression of $b$-tagged and inclusive jets in $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions. Besides the $b$-tagged jet measurements, an alternative method for probing the interactions of heavy quarks with the plasma is the study of the correlations between heavy-quark pairs, which is sensitive to the relative importance of collisional versus radiative scattering processes. In this talk, we report new ATLAS measurements of $b$-tagged and inclusive jet production as well as the measurement of the yield of correlated muon pairs from heavy-flavor decays in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\textrm{NN}}~=~5.02$~TeV. For $b$-tagged and inclusive jet, the transverse momentum distributions in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions, as well as the nuclear modification factors, $R_{AA}$, in Pb+Pb collisions, are presented together with comparisons to theoretical calculations. The measurement of correlated muon pairs from heavy-flavor decays includes per-event yields, scaled by the nuclear thickness function, $T_{AA} $ will be discussed. Detailed studies of how the shape of the correlation in azimuthal-angle separation between the two muons changes from peripheral to central Pb+Pb collisions and comparison to the corresponding measurements in $pp$ collisions are also presented.",

We study both the longitudinal and transverse jet tomography in dijet events by triggering the leading jet propagating along the direction of the event plane in heavy-ion collisions. Simulations are performed using the linear Boltzmann transport model with event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds. We find that the initial jet production positions in the transverse plane can be simultaneously located by combining the dijet transverse momentum imbalance $x_{J} = p^\\mathrm{subleading}_{T} / p^\\mathrm{leading}_{T}$ and jet transverse momentum asymmetry perpendicular to the initial jet directions for different leading jet $p_{T}$ regions. The jet tomography can be used to scan the initial jet production positions and to study jet quenching observables in detail, such as the medium-modified jet shape and jet fragmentation functions.",

      "Abstract": "Quark-gluon plasma, which is a strongly coupled liquid at its natural length scales, must at the same time feature weakly coupled quark and gluon quasiparticles that appear only in hard processes that can resolve its short-length structure. In particular, high-energy partons in a jet shower can scatter off, and kick, the quark and gluon quasiparticles within a droplet of QGP when these Moliere scattering processes occur with a large enough momentum transfer. Here, we implement this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jets in heavy ion collisions. \r\n\r\nThroughout its evolution within the expanding cooling droplet of QGP, the shower of jet and recoil partons inject energy and momentum into the QGP, producing wakes. The large impact of the wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the medium on jet observables makes finding distinctive signatures of scattering off QGP quasiparticles challenging.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid model is particularly valuable for identifying observables that are more/less sensitive to consequences of scattering off quasiparticles and less/more sensitive to consequences of wakes in the QGP because when we turn Moliere scattering off the model contains no effects of scattering — energy loss in the model arises from strongly coupled physics, not from scattering.  \r\n\r\nWe show that jet shapes and fragmentation functions are more sensitive to the contribution of the wake to the reconstructed, and identify various groomed jet observables (eg soft drop splitting angle, leading $k_T$, and girth) that are insensitive to this contribution and that show reasonable sensitivity to scattering off quasiparticles, with those in gamma-jet events of particular interest. We also investigate Z-hadron correlation observables and Z-jet acoplanarity observables constructed with the winner-take-all definition of the jet direction. We construct several promising observables from inclusive subjets within jets, and show that Moliere scattering increases the number of subjets and yields subjets which are more widely distributed and more widely separated.  These observables are unaffected by the wake; they are directly sensitive to “sprouting a new subjet”, the intrinsic feature of Moliere scattering which makes its effects different from those of the wake.",

      "Abstract": "In 2017, the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured finite global angular momentum in heavy-ion collisions through a spin polarization measurement of $\\Lambda$ hyperons. This measurement revealed a high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence for vorticity in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for the first time. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of angular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is applied to study the generation of global angular momentum by the interaction of two nuclei. As SMASH provides access to the whole phase-space evolution of every particle at any given time, it allows to assess the fraction of angular momentum generated in the fireball by all participants. We confirm the previous modeling by Becattini \\textit{et al} within a geometric Glauber model approach, which found that the angular momentum transfer reaches a unique maximum in mid-central collisions during time evolution [arXiv:2212.14385v1]. The corresponding impact parameter is around $b=4-6$ fm for all beam energies from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.41-200$ GeV. \r\nEven though angular momentum is not conserved locally in the transport approach a priori, we identify the contributions to the conservation violation and propose optimal setups for different energy regimes that recover conservation, based upon the test particle method and the treatment of Fermi motion. Furthermore, the system size and centrality dependence are investigated.",

The reported $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ for $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}$ provides useful information regarding the energy loss mechanism of charm quark in the quark-gluon plasma. Its $p_\\mathrm{T}$-dependence is similar to that of other charm and beauty hadrons but with its minimum shifted towards higher $p_\\mathrm{T}$. Comparing the $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{c}/\\mathrm{D}^{0}$ production ratio in pp and PbPb collisions suggests that coalescence as an hadronization process is not significant for $p_\\mathrm{T} > 10$~GeV/c.

For that, we employ a Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model capable of reproducing the latest lattice QCD results at zero and finite baryon density, known to predict a high-density critical endpoint. For the first time, we numerically find the posterior probability distribution for holographic model parameters from the lattice data at zero chemical potential, and extract their most likely values. This is possible thanks to new numerical developments which, by boosting the performance of our calculations, allow us to sample a large number of fits to the data via Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we find the maximum a posteriori estimate for the location of the critical point, as well as estimates for the corresponding statistical error bands. We determine the linear combination of model parameters which is the most relevant for these uncertainties and investigate its role for the equation of state at lower densities. Our analysis is performed for two competing model parametrizations, one of which may or may not present a critical point for samples of the prior distribution. We use the posterior distribution for this parametrization to infer the probability that a QCD critical point exists and is situated in a region of the phase diagram that can be probed by ongoing and future heavy ion collision experiments. Preliminary results favor a critical point around a baryon chemical potential of $570 - 650$ MeV and a temperature of $99 - 107$ MeV, with most of the uncertainty concentrated along a single line.",

      "Abstract": "It has long been understood that non-monotonic variation of non-Gaussian cumulants of particle multiplicities as a function of decreasing collision energy and, hence, increasing baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ can yield tell-tale signatures of the presence of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram. In this talk, we shall present quantitative estimates for the magnitude and $\\mu_B$-dependence of the skewness and kurtosis of the proton multiplicity as a function of the separation $\\Delta T$ between the temperature at a critical point and at freezeout.  These provide a modern update of estimates first attempted in [1], for the first time including the effects of the change in the sign of the critical contribution to the kurtosis discovered in [2] in a way that incorporates the mapping between the universal physics around an Ising critical point onto the QCD phase diagram [3,4].  \r\n\r\nSeveral of us have recently quantified the reduction in the magnitude of the Gaussian cumulant of the proton multiplicity relative to equilibrium expectations, arising because both critical slowing down and baryon number conservation limit the growth of critical fluctuations [5].  In this talk, we describe how the dynamics in the critical regime (including critical slowing down and baryon number conservation) limit the growth of the non-Gaussian cumulants.  It has been understood since they were first proposed as signatures of a critical point that dynamical effects make the actual cumulants much smaller than they would be in equilibrium; for the first time, we estimate how much smaller.  We close by using the newly developed maximum entropy freezeout procedure [6] to make estimates of the magnitude of the skewness and kurtosis of proton multiplicity that can be expected in RHIC BES data if nature places a critical point near where these collisions freeze out. \r\n \r\n[1] Athanasiou, Rajagopal, Stephanov, arXiv:1006.4636.\r\n[2] Stephanov, arXiv: 1104.1627.\r\n[3] Parotto et al, arXiv:1805.05249.\r\n[4] Karthein et al, arXiv:2103.08146.\r\n[5] Pradeep, Rajagopal, Stephanov and Yin, arXiv:2204.00639.\r\n[6] Pradeep, Stephanov, arXiv:2211.09142.",

      "Abstract": "Higher-order cumulants ($C_n$) of net-baryon distributions are sensitive to the nature of the QCD phase transition. Recent lattice QCD calculations [1] suggest a negative $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in the crossover regime at small baryon chemical potential ($\\mu_B \\leq$ 110 MeV). In addition, lattice QCD predicts a special ordering of cumulant ratios for systems of thermalized QGP [2]: $C_3/C_1 > C_4/C_2 > C_5/C_1 > C_6/C_2$. Both predictions can be tested in heavy-ion collision experiments by measuring higher-order cumulants of the net-proton multiplicity distributions.\r\n\r\nIn the high $\\mu_B$ region of the QCD phase diagram, proton multiplicity distributions are utilized to probe characteristics of the phase transition. The variance of proton multiplicity within azimuthal subvolumes of phase space may provide insight into local parton density fluctuations. The deviation of this variance from a binomial baseline along with proton factorial cumulants over the full azimuth [3] may be observables sensitive to a possible first-order phase transition. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we report measurements of net-proton $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in Au+Au collisions with center-of-mass energies from 3 GeV to 200 GeV, where the 3 GeV data are from the fixed-target program and the other data sets are from the Beam Energy Scan program phase I at RHIC-STAR. Proton factorial cumulants and the variance of proton multiplicities in azimuthal partitions are also presented.

The recent experimental data from the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), provides measurement of variance of $\\langle p_t \\rangle$ at fixed multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and a steep fall of the variance is observed over a narrow range of $N_{ch}$, for most of the central collision events (Fig. 14 and 15, \\href{https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HION-2021-01/}{ATLAS : HION-2021-01}). Such a behaviour cannot be reproduced by previously existing models, such as HIJING which treats Pb+Pb collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. However, our model results can accurately reproduce the peculiar pattern in the variance of $\\langle p_t \\rangle$ that is observed by ATLAS. To explain such a novel phenomenon, we argue that at a given multiplicity, the impact parameter ($b$) fluctuation plays an important role; the transverse momentum per particle increases with the increasing impact parameter. A larger $b$ corresponds to a smaller collision volume resulting in a higher density. In relativistic thermodyanimcs, a higher density corresponds to a higher initial temperature which implies a larger energy per particle leading to a larger $\\langle p_t  \\rangle$. Thus at a fixed $N_{ch}$, a higher $\\langle p_t  \\rangle$  at a larger b is the effect of the thermalization of the system at a higher temperature. To illustrate this point further, we provide results for Pb+Pb collision from hydrodynamic simulation with TRENTO + MUSIC at b=0 and compare with corresponding HIJING results. From the hydro results, we find a very strong correlation between $\\langle p_t \\rangle$ and $N_{ch}$ at fixed impact parameter, which is not observed in HIJING where there is no thermalization. The strong correlation is the consequence of the thermalization that is assumed in the hydro simulation.\r\n( R. Samanta, S. Bhatta, J. Jia, M.

The net baryon and electric charge rapidity distributions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can elucidate how different \r\nconserved charges are transported along the longitudinal direction during the collision. Recent preliminary measurements in isobar collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) show that the scaled net-baryon to net-electric charge number ratio at midrapidity ($B/\\Delta Q * \\Delta Z/A$) is between 1.2 and 2, in line with predictions from the string junction model. This measurement is compatible with the picture where the baryon number is carried by gluon junctions. In this work, we develop a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework with multiple conserved charge currents. We employ the 3D MC-Glauber model for the initial conditions, which allows for modeling baryon stopping separately from electric charge stopping within the string junction picture. Simulating the coupled propagation of net baryon and electric charge currents including the charge-dependent lattice-QCD-based equation of state, we study how net baryon and electric charges are evolved during different stages of heavy-ion collisions. We make predictions of net baryon and net electric charge rapidity distributions for Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV, which can be compared with STAR measurements.",

By determining the breakdown of hydrodynamics as a function of system size and energy, we find that it is quantitatively accurate in central lead-lead collisions at LHC energies, but should not be used in typical proton-lead or proton-proton collisions, where the development of collective flow can not accurately be described within hydrodynamics. \r\n\r\n[1] V.E.

      "Abstract": "The early dynamics in heavy-ion collisions involves a rapid, far from equilibrium evolution. This early pre-equilibrium stage of the dynamics can be modeled using kinetic equations. The effect of this pre-equilibrium stage on final observables derived from transverse momenta of emitted particles is negligible. Therefore, the kinetic equations in the relaxation time approximation for a non-boost invariant system are solved (P.Bozek     Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 034916). The asymmetry of the flow with respect to the reaction plane at different rapidities is found to be very sensitive to the degree of non-equilibrium in the evolution. This suggests that the rapidity odd directed flow is a sensitve probe of the  occurrence of non-equilibrium effects and could be used to estimate the asymmetry of the pressure between the longitudinal and transverse directions. The study of kinetic evolution in the longitudinal direction allows also a modelling of the early pre-Bjorken flow stage of the equilibration.",

      "Institute": "University of Minnesota",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Intermediate pT jets (minijets) are created by initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collision experiments. They can constitute a significant portion of the particle multiplicity but do not lend themselves to hydrodynamic treatment as their transverse momenta are larger than the typical saturation scale of the bulk matter.Their orientation is independent of the underlying event and they can significantly reduce flow in the collective motion of the bulk medium. They also introduce an additional source of fluctuations.\r\n\r\nWe study minijets in a new jet+hydro concurrent framework where jet quenching leads to energy and momentum injection in the QGP. Minijets are sampled using PYTHIA and hydro is initialized using the IPGlasma framework. Both of these are concurrently evolved using MUSIC with the minijet quenching being governed by the Hybrid Model. Both the jet and thermal hadrons do hadronic cascade through UrQMD after the freezeout.\r\n\r\nWe find that this effort requires substantial recalibration of the transport coefficients in hydrodynamic simulations to explain the data. As extraction of transport properties is one of the major goals of the heavy-ion program, we posit that this significant contribution needs to be accounted for. We will also discuss the effect of these minijets on observables like pT-spectra, flow vn and correlations between different vn_s. We also look at the relation between initial state spatial anisotropy and the final state momentum anisotropy in the presence of minijets.",

Relativistic heavy ion collisions are in a unique position to identify the $f_0(980)$ quark content by the empirical NCQ (number of constituent quarks) scaling of elliptic flow $v_{2}$. In this talk, we present the first reconstruction of $f_0(980)$ via its main decay channel, $f_0(980) \\to\\pi^+\\pi^-$, using proton-lead collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at 8.16 TeV. The $f_0(980)$ yield is studied as a function of the azimuthal angle relative to the event plane, reconstructed from the forward hadron calorimeters, to extract the $v_{2}$ parameter. The $v_{2}$ of the $f_0(980)$ is then compared to $v_{2}$ values from other hadrons to infer in a novel way the quark content of the $f_0(980)$.",

Cases involving Au+Au collisions are considered, performed at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamics in the beam direction is constrained using the measured pseudo-rapidity distribution of charged particles and the net proton rapidity distribution. Within this framework, the directed flow of mesons is driven by the sideward pressure gradient from the tilted source, and that of baryons mainly due to the initial asymmetric baryon distribution with respect to the beam axis driven by the transverse expansion. Our approach successfully reproduces the rapidity- and beam energy-dependence of $v_1$ for both mesons and baryons. We find that the $v_1(y)$ of baryons has strong constraining power on the initial baryon stopping, and together with that of mesons, the directed flow probes the equation of state of the dense nuclear matter at finite chemical potentials. We also provide predictions for the upcoming STAR Beam Energy Scan II measurements of the pseudo-rapidity dependent $v_1$ for charged particles at 27 GeV.\r\n\r\n[1] L. Du, C. Shen, S. Jeon, and C.

Specifically, we perform fully 3D multi-stage hydrodynamic simulations initialized by a parameterized model for rapidity-dependent energy deposition [1] and we calibrate on a range of observables such as hadron multiplicity, anisotropic flow vectors, and mean transverse momentum --- including their rapidity-dependent fluctuations and correlations. We utilize Bayesian inference to constrain properties of the early- and late-time dynamics of the system, and further harness the results to do experimental design and study the effectiveness of various potential measurements (e.g. from upgraded detectors) at improving these constraints.\r\n\r\n[1] C.

Significant differences were observed in the measured multiplicity ($N$) and elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$) between the two isobar systems [1]. The isobar ratio (Ru/Zr) of CME-sensitive observable, $v_2$-scaled charge separation ($\\Delta\\gamma/v_2$) is close to but systematically larger than the inverse multiplicity ($1/N$) ratio. This indicates the potential existence of a CME signal, as well as the presence of remaining background that is different between the isobars [2]. In this contribution, we present two post-blind analyses of the isobar data that address the remaining backgrounds and attempt to extract any possible CME signal. One of the analysises applies a weighting procedure such that the two isobar systems have identical distributions of $N$ and $v_{2}$, and then compares the CME-sensitive observables ($\\Delta\\gamma$ correlator and signed Balance Functions [3]) between two isobars with matched $N$ and $v_{2}$. The other analysis examines the two- and three-particle nonflow contributions to the isobar ratio of $\\Delta\\gamma / v_{2}$ using real data as well as HIJING simulation. This allows the estimation of a modified background baseline for the $\\Delta\\gamma/v_2$ ratio.  The overall contribution of nonflow is found to be positive, resulting in a background baseline larger than the inverse multiplicity ratio and generally consistent with the isobar measurements.

The global spin alignment of vector mesons could originate from non-CME mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions, and is  characterized by the 00-component of the spin density matrix, $\\rho_{00}$. We find that the CME observables show similar dependence on $\\rho_{00}$, and could receive  a positive (negative) contribution from $\\rho$-decay pions,  if the $\\rho_{00}$ of $\\rho$ mesons is larger (smaller) than 1/3.

Sphaleron damping also significantly impacts the time evolution of both vector and axial charge perturbations in the presence of a magnetic field.

In particular, chiral matter is expected to exhibit novel transport phenomena arising from the interplay between quantum anomalies and electromagnetic and vortical fields [1]. In order to study these effects in fluid systems like the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions, it is important to develop consistent theories of relativistic chiral hydrodynamics which capture the underlying anomaly and include dissipation. Attempts to develop such theories--even their dissipationless counterparts--have suffered from fundamental issues of acausality, instability, and ill-posedness of the initial value problem [2]. Following an effective field theory approach [3-7], we have constructed a first-order relativistic chiral hydrodynamic theory which is stable and causal within a range of values of transport coefficients.

      "Abstract": "The global spin alignment of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions can reveal valuable information about the strong force field and the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. The STAR collaboration recently observed a large global spin alignment of $\\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions using the data from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program (BES-I) [1]. This cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms but may be attributable to the influence of vector meson force fields. In this contribution, we present new measurement of $\\rho^0$ global spin alignment as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality for Au+Au, Ru+Ru, and Zr+Zr collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We discuss the implications of our results for the search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect, as the global spin alignment of $\\rho^0$ mesons can effectively influence the measurement of charge separation across the reaction plane. Additionally, we present new precision and differential measurements of $\\phi$-meson global spin alignment as a function of $p_T$, centrality, and rapidity (y) at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, using higher-statistics data from the BES-II program. Furthermore, we have conducted a comparative study of the global spin alignment of $\\phi(s,\\bar{s})$, $\\omega(u,\\bar{u},d,\\bar{d})$, and $J/\\psi(c,\\bar{c})$ through hadronic or leptonic decay modes in isobar collisions of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  These studies with more differential measurements and with vector mesons of various quark contents aim to understand the role of the strong field in nuclear structure and the evolution of nuclear matter. The addition of new particle species and measurements through previously unexplored decay channels can help understand the intricate effects of in-medium and hadronization mechanisms on global spin alignment.",

      "Abstract": "Hydrodynamics provides quantitative descriptions of various flow measurements in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting the strongly-coupled nature of the hot QCD matter. A ubiquitous phenomenon in fluid dynamics is the formation of vortex rings. In heavy-ion collisions, different conditions can give rise to toroidal vortex structure in the QGP medium, such as the medium's response to jet thermalization [1] and the early-stage longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collisions [2]. Considering these scenarios, in this talk, we will present a systematic study of how $\\Lambda$ hyperon's polarization can probe these toroidal vortex structures in QGP. We define a \"ring observable\" in terms of the $\\Lambda$ production plane polarization [2]. It represents a measure of the effects caused by the vorticity induced in the ring formation. By conducting event-by-event analysis with the state-of-the-art (3+1)D theoretical framework [3, 4], we demonstrate that this ring observable is a highly sensitive probe for thermalizing energy-momentum currents deposited from high-energy jets and for the early-time longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collision systems. An experimental indication of such ``smoke rings'' formed in the QGP would represent a significant advancement in studying the emergent phenomena of many-body QCD at multiple length scales.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] W.

      "Abstract": "In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), exclusive vector meson photoproduction, e.g., $\\rho^{0}$ and $J/\\psi$, has been considered one of the most sensitive probes to the gluon structure in heavy nuclei. Recently, it was discovered that the linear polarization of the photons involved in these processes can enable measurements of the nuclear geometry through the so-called entanglement-enabled spin interference with the $\\rho^{0}$ meson. However, the possibility that the interference can happen at the level of vector mesons cannot be falsified using $\\rho^{0}$ data. The longer lifetime and non-localized wave function of $J/\\psi$ at the time of its decay would not result in an interference pattern similar to the $\\rho^0$ unless the entanglement occurs between the photon and the Pomeron phases emitted from each nucleus, providing an opportunity to study the source of the entanglement.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will report first measurements of the differential cross sections of photoproduced $J/\\psi$ as functions of rapidity $y$ and $p^{2}_{T} \\approx -t$ (up to $2.25~\\rm{(GeV/c)^2}$) in Au+Au UPCs at $\\sqrt{s_{_\\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV recorded by STAR. The results will be presented for different combinations of neutron emission detected in zero degree calorimeters, which can be used to resolve the photon energy ambiguity.

We also present the first measurement of the interference pattern for those photoproduced  $J/\\psi$. The observation of a positive $\\cos(2\\Delta \\phi)$ modulation in the angular separation between the $J/\\psi$ and one of its decay daughters is predicted to be a signature of entanglement between the photon and Pomeron phases.

      "Abstract": "Gluons are found to become increasingly dominant constituents of nuclear matter when being probed at higher energies or smaller Bjorken-$x$ values. This has led to the question of the ultimate fate of nuclear gluonic structure at extreme density. In ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions, the coherent heavy-flavor vector meson production via photon-nuclear interactions is of particular interest, since its cross section is sensitive to the nuclear gluon density. However, in symmetric UPCs, a two-way ambiguity in determining the photon-emitter and the target prevents the extraction of contributions involving high- and low-energy photon-nucleus interactions. This limitation, therefore, had so far reduced our capability to probe the extremely small-$x$ regime. In this talk, we will present the first measurement of coherent charmonium photoproduction, where the two-way ambiguity is solved by implementing a forward neutron tagging technique using UPC lead-lead collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at 5.02 TeV. Results of coherent J/$\\psi$ production and a new measurement of coherent $\\psi\\mathrm{(2S)}$ production will be presented. The new results on $\\psi\\mathrm{(2S)}$ provide a heavier mass scale thus complementing the results on J/$\\psi$ toward smaller Bjorken-$x$ values.

Although, the High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES) at GSI was primarily designed to measure Di-Electrons, it also features a very rich program measuring hadronic probes in the region of moderate temperature and high-baryon density in the QCD phase diagram. Recently, the spectrometer was upgraded with a new RICH photon detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter. While the first allows for a strongly improved electron identification, the latter allows for photon measurements in HADES for the first time without involving the conversion process.\r\n\r\nThose experimental upgrades allow for a clear reconstruction of the $\\Sigma^0$ baryon in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV beam energy in the electromagnetic decay to Lambda and photon. This collision energy is right at threshold for Lambda production, however it's below for the Sigma0. In p+p collisions a rise of the $\\Lambda/\\Sigma^0$ ratio is measured, which, if also existent for A+A collisions, would have strong impact on the extraction of ($T,\\mu_B$) values from thermal models as the $\\Lambda/\\Sigma^0$ is usually fixed following isospin symmetry. The analysis presented in this work allows for a $\\Sigma^0$ signal with a significance of roughly 10 in the $\\Lambda \\gamma$ channel while no signal is observed in the $\\Lambda e^{\\pm}$ channel reconstructing conversion photons and, if existing, Dalitz decays. Full acceptance and efficiency studies allow for a fully corrected $\\Sigma^0$ production yield, extracting a $(\\Lambda+\\Sigma^0)/\\Sigma^0$ ratio.

      "Abstract": "Authors: G. Coci, S. Glässel, V. Kireyeu, J. Aichelin, C. Blume, V. Kolesnikov, V. Voronyuk and E. Bratkovskaya\r\n\r\n\r\nThe formation of weakly bound clusters and hypernuclei in the hot and dense environment at midrapidity is one of the surprising phenomena observed experimentally in heavy-ion collisions from low SIS to ultra-relativistic LHC energies. This is also known as the `ice in a fire' puzzle. Three approaches have been advanced to describe the formation of clusters:  cluster formation during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interactions between nucleons  ('potential mechanism') and deuteron production by catalytic hadronic reactions ('kinetic mechanism') as well as by coalescence at  kinetic freeze-out. \r\n\r\nWe present here results from PHQMD [1,2], a novel microscopic n-body transport model based on the QMD propagation of the baryonic degrees of freedom with density dependent 2-body potential interactions. The clusters, formed via 'potential' mechanism, are recognized by the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm  which is identifying bound clusters by correlations of baryons in coordinate space.\r\nThe PHQMD approach allows for studying in the same framework the two above mentioned mechanisms,  to investigate  how and when clusters are formed and finally for comparing the results with present data from GSI to RHIC energies. \r\n\r\nWe report on our recent findings, in particular that:\r\n\r\n- The clusters produced via coalescence and potential mechanisms are created after the fast hadrons are escaped from the reaction zone, i.e.  clusters remain in transverse direction closer to the center of the heavy-ion collision than free nucleons. Thus, since the 'fire' is not at the same place as the 'ice', cluster can survive which explains the ice in the fire puzzle. Our PHQMD results for deuteron production by potential mechanism agree quantitatively with results of UrQMD for coalescence deuterons, thus, this finding doesn't depend on the transport model involved.\r\n            \r\n- For the `kinetic' deuterons the PHQMD results agrees with those from SMASH - if one limits the catalytic hadronic reaction channels to those realized in SMASH, however, accounting for all isospin channels of the various $\\pi NN\\leftrightarrow \\pi d$, $NNN\\leftrightarrow N d$ reactions leads to an enhanced production of deuterons.\r\n      \r\n- On the other hand, we find that considering the quantum nature of the deuteron --  by taking into account  the finite size properties of the deuteron by means of an excluded volume in coordinate space and by the projection onto the deuteron wave function in momentum space -- reduces substantially the kinetic deuteron production in a dense medium as encountered in heavy-ion collisions. This makes the 'kinetic' mechanism sub-dominant compared to the deuteron formation by potential interactions between nucleons. \r\n \r\n- The sum of kinetic deuterons and that produced in by potential interactions reproduces well the experimental data from SIS to RHIC energies\r\n      \r\n- The coalescence deuterons and potential deuterons have only about 20\\% of the nucleons in common. This leads to a different rapidity distribution and to a different $p_T$-distribution at low $p_T$. This difference can be used to identify experimentally the production mechanism which is realized in nature.\r\n\r\n- Heavier clusters like $t$, $^3He$ and $^4He$ as well has hypernuclei are also well reproduced by the potential mechanism\r\n\r\nSome of the presented result have been published in Refs.

We further systematically check the consistency of the assumptions—such as collinearity, softness, and large formation time—made in the derivation of radiative energy loss, with the final numerical model. We find that the large formation time approximation breaks down at modest to high momenta $p_T \\geq 30~\\mathrm{GeV}$. Comparison to data at higher momenta thus requires a rederivation of GLV, DGLV, and short path length correction results; with the large formation time assumption relaxed. We also show that the usual elastic energy loss treatment vastly overpredicts the suppression in small systems; thus, small path length corrections to elastic energy loss are required for quantitative comparison to data in small systems.",

This region of collision energies from few to few tens of GeV is particularly interesting for the exploration of dense baryon matter and search of the critical point of QCD. However, fluid-dynamical modelling here poses notable challenges. Contraction of the incoming nuclei is much weaker, which results in a long inter-penetration phase and a complex initial-state geometry. Conventional hydrodynamic models, where the fluid phase starts at a fixed proper time τ0, therefore miss the compression stage of the collision. Hence, they miss the key sensitivity to the EoS of the dense medium.\r\nIn our approach [1], we circumvent this issue by representing the incoming nuclei as two cold, baryon-rich fluids with appropriate energy and baryon densities. The newly produced matter is represented by a third baryon-free fluid, which is generated by the friction between the two colliding fluids. Our MUlti Fluid simulation for Fast IoN collisions (MUFFIN) model is implemented from scratch using a versatile 3+1 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. We present benchmark calculations for Au-Au collisions at different RHIC BES energies and discuss the challenges in constructing the approach.\r\n\r\n[1] Jakub Cimerman, Iurii Karpenko, Boris Tomášik, and Pasi Huovinen, Phys.

      "Abstract": "Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions do not become reliable until $O(1)$ fm/$c$ after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration of a multi-stage dynamical evolution model built around a VAH fluid dynamic core with experimental data for $p_T$-integrated observables from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of constraining the specific viscosities of the QGP at higher temperatures than other previously used models [1]. We also find that the model has fewer tensions with the $p_T$-integrated input data than the previously calibrated JETSCAPE SIMS model [2]. Finally, we use the calibrated VAH and JETSCAPE SIMS models, with the four different particlization models studied in [2], to predict a number of $p_T$- *differential* observables, including $p_T$-spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_{2,3,4}\\{2\\}(p_T)$ for several identified hadron hadron species. We find [3] that the $p_T$-dependence of the anisotropic flow coefficients is *very sensitive* to the choice of particlization model, and that the VAH predictions agree with available data much better than all available calibrated variants of the JETSCAPE SIMS model. We therefore propose the VAH approach as a superior framework for describing the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies.  \r\n*Supported by the NSF CSSI program under grant OAC-2004601 (BAND Collaboration) and by the DOE Office of Science, Office for\r\nNuclear Physics under Award No. DE-SC0004286.\r\n[1] D.

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the measurements of anisotropic flow coefficient ($v_n$) offer insights into collective hydrodynamic expansion and transport properties of the produced medium at higher collision energies, while they are sensitive to the compressibility of the nuclear matter and nuclear equation of state at lower collision energies. The second phase of the Beam Energy Scan program (BES-II) was carried out at RHIC to focus on the most crucial energy range from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =7.7$ GeV to $27$ GeV in collider mode and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV to $7.7$ GeV in fixed-target mode, providing an ideal lever-arm to explore $v_n$. For such energies, the STAR BES-II upgrades enable us to measure $v_n$ in a wide pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) range with high precision.\r\n\r\nDirected flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles and nuclear fragments in heavy-ion collisions, and it is sensitive to early non-equilibrium dynamics. The measurement of $v_1$ in a wide $\\eta$ range allows us to test the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation and provides insights into the baryon-stopping mechanism. On the other hand, triangular flow ($v_3$) in nuclear collisions is often mentioned as being developed from event-by-event geometrical fluctuations in the participant region which has no correlation to the first-order event plane ($\\Psi_{1}$). However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and $\\Psi_1$.\r\n\r\nIn this contribution, we will show the measurement of charged particle $v_1$ over six units of $\\eta$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ and $19.6$ GeV and compare with transport and hydrodynamic model calculations. We will also show the results of $v_3$ in fixed-target mode for identified hadrons and light nuclei with respect to $\\Psi_1$, comparing with theoretical models to identify the source of nonzero $v_3\\{\\Psi_1\\}$ and to demonstrate its vital connection to the equation of state.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Deciphering the process of hadronization has long been a formidable challenge, in part due to its non-perturbative nature. Over the years, various phenomenological models have emerged, all attempting to unravel the complexity of hadron production. Despite their different theoretical foundations, many of these models successfully account for the average yield of hadrons. This has spurred the scientific community to search for innovative observables capable of discerning the fundamental principles governing these models. In pursuit of this goal, the ALICE Collaboration has studied an extensive array of event-by-event Pearson correlations between hadrons with distinct quantum numbers. Conducting a system size scan of these measurements unveils a powerful means to identify and analyze emerging QCD phenomena in small collision systems. In this presentation, ALICE will show the latest findings on antiproton--antideuteron and net-kaon--net-Xi correlations in various collision systems (pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb). These observables offer the advantage of being unaffected by resonance or weak decays. The measurements will be compared to various hadronization models, delving into the intriguing topic of the onset of thermalization in QCD matter. The measured correlations are used to estimate the correlation volume between hadrons stemming from the conservation of baryon and strange quantum numbers.",

      "Speaker": "Blair Daniel Seidlitz",
      "Institute": "Columbia University (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "This talk presents a measurement of longitudinal decorrelation in $pp$ collisions with ATLAS. The deposited energy in the transverse $(x,y)$ plane is expected to vary, depending on the longitudinal $(z)$ slice examined, which is correlated with the rapidity of the produced particles. Thus, particles from different rapidity slices will have flow vectors that differ in magnitude and orientation due to the longitudinal variation, longitudinal decorrelation, which grows with increasing particle rapidity separation. For flow harmonic $n$, such longitudinal decorrelations have been characterized, for large systems, in terms of $r_n$, the ratio of large-rapidity-gap to small-rapidity-gap correlations. This analysis performs the first measurements of $r_n$ in $pp$ collisions at 5~TeV and 13~TeV. The analysis is carried out via a two-particle correlation method, utilizing charged tracks of varying $\\eta$ within $|\\eta|<2.5$ and topo-clusters of $4.0<|\\eta_\\mathrm{ref}|<4.9$. Because non-flow effects are more significant in $pp$ collisions, non-flow template subtraction procedures are applied. Final results are quoted for $r_2$ and its slope $F_2$, over a range of multiplicities. Similar non-flow subtraction techniques are applied to the full multiplicity range of Xe+Xe collision data and the results are compared to the two $pp$ energies at appropriate multiplicities. This gives some of the first detailed information on the correlation between longitudinal and transverse energy deposition in $pp$ collisions.",
