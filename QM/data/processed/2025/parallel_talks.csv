Parallel session 17,parallel,EPJ Featured Talk: The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations,"Parida, Tribhuban",IISER Berhampur,Unknown,"Event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[p_T]$ have been measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, but this topic has so far received less attention than anisotropic flow. Yet the physical mechanism is identical for both phenomena: A long-range correlation in the initial stages, followed by collective expansion. While the origin of anisotropic flow is a fluctuation in the shape of the fireball, that of $[p_T]$ fluctuations is a fluctuation in the initial temperature. It generates a fluctuation in the fluid velocity, which is carried over to the $p_T$ spectrum of outgoing particles. The same fluctuation is present at all rapidities and generates a long-range correlation. 

We make hydrodynamic predictions for the fluctuation of the spectrum, which is a new observable $v_0(p_T)$ introduced by Schenke, Shen and Teaney [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00690] which has not yet been measured, and for which first experimental results will hopefully be shown at this conference. Like anisotropic flow $v_n(p_T)$, $v_0(p_T)$ is predicted to have a strong mass ordering in the $p_T$ range where hydrodymamics applies. We show that our hydrodynamic calculation reproduces precisely the observed dependence of $[p_T]$ fluctuations on $p_T$ cuts which has previously been observed by PHENIX and ATLAS. We argue that the mechanism of quark coalescence should give rise to a splitting between the $v_0(p_T)$ of baryons and mesons at higher $p_T$, similar to that observed for anisotropic flow.

systematically gauge the approach by making contact with lattice results

plot [1]. We furthermore discuss steps towards making contact with experiment 
via baryon number fluctuations [4].

Parallel session 35,parallel,Non-Fluctuational Signature of the QCD Critical Point,"Sogabe, Noriyuki",University of Illinois Chicago,USA,"We study the influence of the QCD critical point on the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the lines of constant specific entropy (entropy per baryon) on the phase diagram are drawn towards a special point on the coexistence (first-order) line where the specific entropy reaches a maximum [1]. We study the interplay between this feature of the isentropic trajectories and the freezeout curve. If the critical point is located near the freezeout curve, a region inaccessible by isentropic expansion appears on the freezeout curve. This behavior of the isentropes could provide a novel, non-fluctuational signature of the critical point requiring significantly lower statistics than the fluctuational signatures.

Parallel session 23,parallel,Hadron Production in Au+Au Collisions from STAR Fixed-Target Experiment,"Li, Hongcan",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Hadrons have been suggested as sensitive probes for the medium properties of nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. A dense baryon-rich medium is formed during collisions at center-of-mass energies of a few-GeV. Since (anti-)strange hadrons and anti-protons are produced near or below the threshold, their phase space distribution and yield ratios may provide strong constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of high baryon density matter.



In this presentation, the recent results on $\pi^{\pm}$, $\rm{K}^{\pm}$($\rm{K}^0_S$), $\phi$, $p$($\overline{p}$), $\Lambda (\overline{\Lambda})$ and $\Xi^-(\overline{\Xi}^{+})$  production at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.0 - 7.7 GeV in Au + Au collisions with fixed-target mode from the STAR experiment will be presented. The transverse momentum spectra ($p_{\rm T}$), rapidity density distributions (dN/dy) and their yield ratios as a function of centrality and collision energy are able to provide unique information about QCD phase structure. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and dN/dy ratios of baryon to anti-baryon will provide important input to differentiate between hadron production via quark coalescence and hadronic scattering. Enhancement of baryon to meson ratio hints at an onset of deconfinement in this energy range. We will also explore the centrality dependence of hadron yields, and the evolution of the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperature, baryon chemical potential and average radial expansion flow in the reported energy range, which can give insights on the EoS of the created medium. These results will be compared with those from higher collision energies and the physics implications will be studied by comparing to the model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hongcan', 'last_name': 'Li', 'fullName': 'Li, Hongcan', 'id': '9414324', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c37cf12f1fdb81e4de1d15b36249ff3e', 'db_id': 9414324, 'person_id': 9157265}"

The lightest (anti-)hypernuclei are the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda\text{H}$), which consists  of a pair of nucleons and  a $\Lambda$ hyperon, and its anti-nucleus (${^3_{\bar{\Lambda}}}\overline{\rm H}$).  Significant knowledge has recently been acquired regarding the mass, lifetime, and binding energy of $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$. However, its exact spin, whether $\frac{1}{2}$ or  $\frac{3}{2}$, remains undetermined in both experimental and theoretical studies. Here, we present a novel method of using the hypertriton global polarization in heavy-ion collisions to decipher not only  its total spin but also its internal spin  structure.  This method is based on the finding that  its three different  spin structures  exhibit distinct beam energy dependence of its global polarization when it is produced in these collisions from the coalescence of proton, neutron and $\Lambda$. Future observations of the (anti-)hypertriton global polarization thus provide the opportunity to unveil the spin structure of (anti-)hypertriton and its production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'KaiJia', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, KaiJia', 'id': '9289007', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Modern Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China', 'emailHash': '2e132dd95185baf2c04021a64d830f8b', 'db_id': 9289007, 'person_id': 8881904}"

We investigate the formation of light nuclei and hypernuclei in the 
rapidly expanding nuclear matter after relativistic nucleus-nucleus 
collisions. The primary hadronization phase including the strangeness 
production is described with UrQMD model. It is demonstrated that the 
nucleation process can be explained within the statistical approach by 
applying the local equilibrium concept. We subdivide the expanding 
nuclear system into several parts (clusters) consisting of nucleons and 
hyperons which are close in the phase space. The production of nuclei 
takes place inside these clusters, and it can be described as their 
statistical decay in the coexistence region of the nuclear phase 
transition. The local chemical equilibrium concept explain consistently 
many experimental data which was not possible with the statistical 
models under assumption of global chemical equilibrium [1,2]. This model 
was also successfully applied to describe experimental data on both 
normal nuclei and strange hypernuclei production in the GSI and RHIC-BES 
energy range [3,4]. We predict the production of double hypernuclei up 
to $^4_{\Lambda \Lambda}$H and further intermediate mass nuclei up to 
$^8$Be for Au+Au central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3 GeV, recently 
explored by the STAR experiments [4]. The production of charmed nuclei 
is discussed too. These new nuclei can be identified by the measurement 
of the correlated particles.

Parallel session 35,parallel,"The antiproton puzzle, QCD critical point, and fireball properties in heavy-ion collisions","Vovchenko, Volodymyr",University of Houston,Unknown,"We contrast the behavior of ordinary and factorial cumulants of proton number and point out that the latter has numerous advantages over the former, in particular with regards to the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions. The new RHIC BES-II data on factorial cumulants of protons is analyzed, indicating clear deviation of two- and three-particle proton correlations from the non-critical baseline at collision energies below 10 GeV. Multiple scenarios for this deviation are explored, including the possibility of critical fluctuations and the implications for the QCD phase diagram.

We also illustrate that the acceptance dependence of the appropriately scaled factorial cumulants, $\hat{C}_n/(\hat{C}_1)^n$, is flat if all correlations are driven by long-range correlations only, making it a clean probe of short-range correlations. Furthermore, global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations predict identical $\hat C_2/(\hat C_1)^2$ of proton and antiprotons at given collision energy. However, the analysis of RHIC BES-I data reveals a remarkably strong splitting between scaled factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons, which is at odds with the expectation based on a single-fluid hydrodynamics picture. We argue that such a splitting indicates incomplete equilibration between stopped and produced matter, which can be further probed with upcoming high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II with extended acceptance coverage.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Volodymyr', 'last_name': 'Vovchenko', 'fullName': 'Vovchenko, Volodymyr', 'id': '9288828', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston', 'emailHash': 'aac727a4ed7f29c5f8821cc339003226', 'db_id': 9288828, 'person_id': 8877848}"
Parallel session 35,parallel,First order transition region of an equation of state for QCD with a critical point,"Karthein, Jamie",MIT,USA,"In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition [1]. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.

At zero temperature the pion condensate appears at $\mu_I = m_\pi/2$. Recent numerical studies at physical quark masses show that the pion condensation boundary remains vertical up to the meeting point with the chiral crossover line. If this result remains valid when the light quark mass (and the pion mass) goes to zero, then in the chiral limit at temperatures below the chiral transition the pion condensation happens at arbitrary nonzero $\mu_I$. We report on results of a lattice QCD simulation of a 2+1 flavour QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potential, at smaller-than-physical light quark mass, that support this scenario.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Volodymyr', 'last_name': 'Chelnokov', 'fullName': 'Chelnokov, Volodymyr', 'id': '9288933', 'affiliation': 'Goethe Universität', 'emailHash': '834141d6e16125250f35449a5536a388', 'db_id': 9288933, 'person_id': 8937046}"

We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. The phase diagram is drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. 
Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that up to $\mu_B \approx 400$~MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range.

Parallel session 24,parallel,Stochastic Hydrodynamics and the Density Frame,"Bhambure, Jay",Stony Brook University,USA,"We describe a unique formulation of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics based on the *density frame*. The equations of motion are strictly first order in time and have no non-hydrodynamic modes. The only fields are the energy and momentum densities $T^{0\mu}$ and the only parameters are the equilibrium equation state and the shear and bulk viscosities. We compare numerical results to QCD kinetic theory simulations for a set of one dimensional tests -- we find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics, and the simulation is well behaved outside of this regime. The results are compared to a second-order formulation developed by Bemfica, Disconzi,  Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) as well as to second-order hydrodynamics as implemented in MUSIC.

In the density frame we propose a strikingly simple algorithm to simulate stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on the Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. Then random (three) momentum transfers between fluid cells are proposed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as the Boltzmann weight. On average the algorithm reproduces viscous hydrodynamics in the density-frame. The algorithm can be generalized to general coordinates and space-time foliations by parallel transporting the proposed momentum transfers.

We show that the energy flow out of the jet cone, driven by turbulent gluon cascades, is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums gluon splittings at arbitrary angles and is enhanced by the medium length, L. The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\ln(1/R)$, and $\ln(R/\theta_c)$, and powers of $L$.

Parallel session 24,parallel,A new effective theory for stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics,"Mullins, Nicki",Illinois Urbana Champaign,Unknown,"Thermal fluctuations are a fundamental feature of dissipative systems that are essential for understanding physics near the expected critical point of QCD and in small systems. Such fluctuations can be modeled by including a stochastic source in the standard hydrodynamics equations. However, when this is done naively strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions [1–3]. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem [4], we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional [5]. For divergence type theories [6], the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. This generating current is related to the free energy, which allows for a systematic understanding the stability properties of the system. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic.

Parallel session 24,parallel,Limit cycle of hydrodynamic attractor in ultracold quantum gases,"Mazeliauskas, Aleksas",Heidelberg University (DE),United States,"Hydrodynamic attractors are a universal phenomenon of strongly interacting systems that describe the hydrodynamic-like evolution far from local equilibrium. The rapid hydrodynamization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma is behind the remarkable success of hydrodynamic models of high-energy nuclear collisions. Until now, hydrodynamic attractors have been studied only in monotonically expanding systems, e.g., Bjorken expansion. This work shows that a system undergoing an oscillating isotropic expansion exhibits a novel attractor behavior that resembles a limit cycle in dynamical systems. This phenomenon can be studied in ultracold quantum gases with externally modulated scattering length, which opens the way to the experimental discovery of hydrodynamic attractor phenomenon.

The combined fit confirms the challenges of the framework to describe both $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+Pb$ data simultaneously hinting at shortcomings of the framework. We discuss major sources of uncertainty and suggest possible solutions including model extensions.

Moreover,  the decay daughters of these vector mesons inherit polarization of the photons, which could be used to access the initial collision geometry.  Thus, measurement of differential cross sections of J/$\psi$ photoproduction and the azimuthal anisotropy of their decay daughters offer a novel and direct probe into both the gluonic structure and the initial collision geometry.

We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment [1] using zero degree calorimeters, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which $E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$ and compare its results with the results of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. We discuss the role of preequilibrium and equilibrium processes. In addition we analyze the role of scattering of high-energy photons for small neutron multiplicities. Emission of the small number of neutrons at high (virtual) photon energies ($E_{\gamma} >$ 1 GeV) seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section for four- and five-neutron emission is rather difficult. Several open issues will be discussed.

In this work, we go one step further and perform a global Bayesian analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb data at the LHC varying simultaneously the shapes of Xe, Pb and relevant Trajectum model parameters. This allows us to systematically assess the sensitivity of observables or ratio of observables to the shape of both Pb (in particular its neutron skin) and Xe (in particular $\beta_2$, its octupole $\beta_3$, $\gamma$ and its skin). Our Bayesian extractions lead to a picture for the ground states of these nuclei that is in remarkable agreement with complementary results using methods in low-energy nuclear structure physics.

For instance, central collisions of near-spherical Au nuclei create a QGP with a fixed, circular geometry, whereas prolate-shaped uranium nuclei can collide in a variety of orientations, producing QGP droplets of diverse shapes and sizes. Hence, by comparing systems with similar mass numbers, such as $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au, we can map out their shape differences and gain deeper insights into the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_2$, $p_T$ fluctuations, and
$v_2 - p_T$ correlations in $^{238}$U + $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au + $^{197}$Au collisions. Our results reveal large differences in these observables between the two systems, particularly in central events. A comparison with hydrodynamic model calculations indicates a large deformation in uranium nuclei, consistent with previous low-energy experiments. However, data also imply a small deviation from axial symmetry in the ground states of the colliding $^{238}$U nuclei [1]. Our work introduces a novel approach for imaging nuclear shapes, enhances the modeling of QGP initial conditions, and sheds light on nuclear structure evolution across different energy scales. The potential applications of this method for other nuclear species are explored.

For the first time, correlations between higher-order moments ($\langle v_{n}^{k}v_{m}^{l}\rangle$, where $n,m = 2,3,4$ and $k,l = 2,4,6$) between two ($v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ or $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$) or even three flow harmonics ($v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$) are measured and compared between Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions as a function of collision centrality. These new measurements have been calculated with multiparticle mixed harmonic cumulants (upto 8th order) using charged particles in the wide pseudorapidity region of the CMS detector ($|\mathrm{\eta}| < 2.4$) and in the transverse momentum range of $0.5 < p_\mathrm{T} < 3.0$ GeV/c. The results have also been compared to several theoretical model predictions. The observables measured in this analysis have been used to closely probe the non-linearities between $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ and their corresponding eccentricities $\epsilon_{2}$, $\epsilon_{3}$ and $\epsilon_{4}$. This not only helps us to constrain the deformation parameters of Xe nuclei, but can also significantly constrain initial-state model parameters and give us a better understanding of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Aryaa', 'last_name': 'Dattamunsi', 'fullName': 'Dattamunsi, Aryaa', 'id': '9381762', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IN)', 'emailHash': '1b51ab06cd300fbc789fa255d62462f9', 'db_id': 9381762, 'person_id': 9125564}"

Parallel session 4,parallel,Perturbative high-energy evolution in the IP-Glasma initial state,"Mäntysaari, Heikki",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We include the perturbative JIMWLK energy evolution into the IP-Glasma initial state description used to simulate the early-time dynamics in heavy ion collisions. By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. This enables us to predict how the initial state evolves when moving from RHIC to LHC energies. [1]

Previously, the energy dependence in IP-Glasma was introduced through a Bjorken-$x$ dependent saturation scale extracted from fits to DIS structure data. In contrast, in our work we move beyond this parametrized approximation by providing a method to directly calculate the energy dependence. The energy-dependent initial state description is then coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics in the quark-gluon plasma phase and to the UrQMD hadronic afterburner, enabling us to simulate the full space-time evolution in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate that incorporating the JIMWLK evolution significantly affects various flow observables.

The JIMWLK evolution applied in this work is constrained by the available $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production data from HERA and from Ultra Peripheral Collisions at the LHC [2]. In addition to the JIMWLK-evolved initial state description, we determine an effective energy-dependent parametrization describing the energy-dependent nucleon structure, which can approximate the effect of JIMWLK evolution in IP-Glasma, enabling faster simulations.

Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies [2,3]. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent fluctuating nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. We show, by averaging a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions for 3+1 dimensional hydrodynamical evolution, that we obtain a good agreement with the rapidity-dependent multiplicity and elliptic flow data for LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. This suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has successfully explained the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities. As a further application of MC-EKRT, we also study event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities.

Recently, heavy-ion collisions have demonstrated their potential as an imaging tool for nuclear structure by examining anisotropic flow and its correlations with the mean transverse momentum. Hints of a triaxial structure in $^{129}$Xe have been found experimentally and theoretically using these methods; however, these studies were limited to exploring the first moment of the $\gamma$ distribution and could not distinguish between a rigid rotor and $\gamma$-soft nuclei. 

In this talk, a comprehensive study of the quadrupole deformation, nuclear diffuseness, and triaxial structure of $^{129}$Xe is presented through investigations of various anisotropic flow and mean transverse momentum observables. Additionally, the $\gamma$-soft structure of the $^{129}$Xe nuclei is investigated experimentally for the first time in heavy-ion collisions using a novel six-particle normalized cumulant, $ NC(v_2^4, \delta p_{\rm T}^2) $, which correlates the fourth moment of the elliptic flow, $ v_2^4$, with the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, $ \delta p_{\rm T}^2 $. This correlation is measured in Xe–Xe collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV  against the baseline of spherical Pb nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE experiment at the LHC.

These correlations, driven by fluctuation-dissipation relations near local equilibrium, provide key insights into the transport properties of the QGP and can become particularly significant in the vicinity of the QCD critical region.

In this talk, we present a theoretical framework for calculating two-particle correlations of charged hadrons. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we first derive an evolution equation for four-point functions of fields in complex scalar field theory. This equation can be interpreted using the Boltzmann-Langevin Equation (BLE), which  predicts the two-particle correlations in momentum space amongst the charges of a conducting fluid.

Parallel session 32,parallel,Tilted emitting source in the heavy-ion collisions,"Lisa, Michael",Unknown,Unknown,"The three-dimensional structure of the initial state in heavy-ion collisions have become important topic of interest in the community, since it provides insights into the origins of anisotropic flow, the breaking of boost invariance, longitudinal de-correlation, and particle correlations observed after kinetic freeze-out. One of the important properties of the 3D initial state is the tilt of the particle-emitting source away from the beam direction—a phenomenon particularly pronounced at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This tilt, rooted in the initial collision geometry’s three-dimensional structure, is relevant for understanding phenomena such as directed flow and particle polarization. However, a direct extraction of tilt from such measurements remains challenging.

By employing azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT), we explore the relationship between the tilt parameter measured experimentally and the predicted tilt of freeze-out coordinates from UrQMD model  [1]. This approach allows us to investigate the tilt of the pion-emitting source in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.5, and 27 GeV using asHBT techniques. 

While tilt might naively be expected to correlate strongly only with collision centrality, our findings indicate a more pronounced dependence on the momentum of particle pairs. This momentum dependence invites a reevaluation of directed flow: rather than attributing it to a uniform tilt of the emission source, we propose that distinct regions of homogeneity with varying orientations may underlie these observations.

Our approach offers a framework that the STAR experiment can employ to perform a precision extraction of tilt using the high-statistics BES-II data—measurements of which are currently underway and whose prospects we discuss here. By accurately determining tilt angles across different particle types and momenta, we aim to provide a more precise description of directed flow across species and momenta. This method offers a potentially clearer and more detailed framework for understanding directed flow and other phenomena influenced by the three-dimensional initial state.

Parallel session 21,parallel,Search for the Strange Dibaryons with Baryon Correlations in Isobar Collisions at STAR,"Zhang, Kehao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Dibaryons, exotic states composed of six quarks, have long been a subject of interest in understanding the strong interaction beyond conventional hadrons. Among these, strange dibaryons, which contain strange quarks, offer an important role of studying the hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-hyperon ($YY$) interactions . Of particular interest are the spin-0 $H$ ($S$ = -2) and the spin-2 $N\Omega$ ($S$ = -3) dibaryon state, which are considered promising candidates for the strange dibaryon bound state. In heavy-ion collisions, two-particle femtoscopy is a powerful and unique method for extracting information about the spatio-temporal properties of the source, characterising the final state interactions (FSI), and searching for the possible bound states.

In this talk, we will present the measurements of baryon-baryon correlation functions, including $p$-$\Xi^{-}$, $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$ and $p$-$\Omega^{-}$ pairs, in Isobar collisions (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The correlation functions are analyzed within the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism. The extracted scattering length and effective range will be presented. Those measured parameters will be compared with recent Lattice QCD and effective theory model calculations.

This talk presents precise ATLAS measurements of the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions, highlighting distinct patterns in ultra-central collisions due to suppression of the geometric component as the overlap area reaches its maximum.New measurements exploring the dependence of these observables on momentum and pseudorapidity ranges are also presented.

Data on this interaction are scarce, solely based on scattering experiments. Since data points are only available at rather high relative momenta and their uncertainties are sizeable, theory calculations are not well constrained. Particularly the characteristics of the interaction in the triplet channel spin configuration are highly uncertain, and it is not yet clear if the interaction in this channel is attractive or repulsive. In this regard, two-particle intensity interferometry (femtoscopy) of $\Sigma$ baryons and nucleons can provide valuable information. 
The reconstruction of the weak decay of $\Sigma^+$ baryons is very challenging. Its decay into a proton and a neutral pion via the weak interaction has a branching ratio of around 50%, with the neutral pion decaying electromagnetically almost exclusively into two photons. In this talk, a novel reconstruction method will be shown which makes use of sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve the reconstruction efficiency and purity of the $\Sigma^+$ baryons, enabling the measurement of their correlation function with protons for the first time.

In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner [1]. We calibrate on rapidity- and pT-differential observables–examining the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties–and highlight the tension between them within our model. We quantify the additional constraints provided by rapidity dependent measurements and we emphasize the similarity in posteriors from separate calibrations of large and small systems. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in additional smaller systems in $p$-Au and $^3$He-Au, as well as statistically-sensitive or proposed measurements in the calibrated systems. Furthermore, we predict longitudinal de-correlations, highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference.

However, no conclusive evidence of jet quenching—characterized by the energy loss of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ partons traversing the medium—have been observed in these smaller systems. This paradox raises an intriguing question: How can a medium that exhibits hydrodynamic-like behavior and substantially modifies the distribution of final-state hadrons have little to no effect on high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles? To explore this, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$) as a function of particle transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and event multiplicity in pp and pPb collisions, recorded by CMS at 13 TeV and 8.16 TeV, respectively. In particular, first measurements of $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential multiparticle cumulants using the subevent method are reported, probing an extended phase space region up to high $p_\mathrm{T}$ values.

The Fourier coefficients in the expansion of particle azimuthal distribution describe the collective response of the medium to the shape of the initial collision geometry, 
and are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS). A non-monotonic slope in the first-order flow coefficient $v_1$ (directed flow) is proposed as a potential signature of a first-order phase transition between the QGP and hadronic phase. The second-order coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow) exhibits NCQ scaling at top RHIC and LHC energies, reflecting partonic collectivity, but this scaling vanishes at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV. The third-order coefficient $v_3$ (triangular flow) is typically driven by initial-state fluctuations and is uncorrelated with the reaction plane.

Parallel session 16,parallel,Initial momentum and conserved charges to final flow,"William Luzum, Matthew",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor, as well initial conserved charge densities. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations
 of large and small systems. 
 With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.

In very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken.  Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.

Parallel session 16,parallel,Latest Anisotropic Flow Measurements in Pb–Pb Collisions with ALICE: New Insights into QGP Properties,"Lu, Zhiyong",China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN),China,"Characterizing the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions requires identifying observables sensitive to different stages of the collision. Recent studies show that measuring collective anisotropic flow and the complex interplay between its Fourier harmonics ($v_n$) and $(\Psi_n$) can effectively disentangle contributions from various collision phases, providing insights into QGP transport properties and the initial state of the system.

In this talk, the latest flow measurements from ALICE for Pb–Pb collisions at the highest center-of-mass collision energy, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, ever achieved in a laboratory are presented. This includes the flow coefficient $v_n$, and mixed harmonic cumulants. Added to this are the first measurements of multiharmonic correlations using symmetric cumulants for hexagonal flow harmonics and new symmetry plane correlators, totaling 25 correlators—16 of which are newly introduced with enhanced estimators. Differential results for selected observables are also provided as a function of kinematic variables, alongside standard centrality dependence. In particular, $p_{\rm T}$-differential flow is further extended to extremely high-$p_{\rm T}$ regions, providing new inputs for hard processes. These results are compared with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations, offering unique insights for future model developments and further constraining the properties of QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, multi-particle elliptic flow measurements in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions will be discussed, evaluating higher-order flow coefficients and the role of octupole deformation in shaping the initial state of the system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhiyong', 'last_name': 'Lu', 'fullName': 'Lu, Zhiyong', 'id': '9385562', 'affiliation': 'China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN)', 'emailHash': '84ab38ccf3b79212b1fbeba798acc5c8', 'db_id': 9385562, 'person_id': 8894069}"

Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production has a special role to shed light on the collective behavior of particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the magnitude of the $\rm{J}/\psi$ elliptic flow measured at the LHC in Pb-Pb collisions is interpreted as a signature of the charm-quark thermalization in the QGP, supporting the scenario of charmonium (re)generation at low $p_{\rm T}$. Interestingly, the observation of collective-like effects in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions raises questions about the minimal conditions needed for QGP formation. In this contribution, measurements of quarkonium flow coefficients from small (pp) to large (Pb–Pb) collision systems carried out by the ALICE collaboration will be presented. New results on $\rm{J}/\psi$ $v_{2}$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV using event-plane and scalar product methods as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ and rapidity will be discussed.

When a fluid expands too fast, as in heavy ion simulations at early times, the large viscous stresses modify the propagation speeds, leading to superluminal signaling [2]. Since we would not trust hydrodynamic information speeds anyway, this may not sound like such disconcerting news, were it not for some recent theorems that link causality violations to instabilities due to time-reversed dissipation [3]. In this talk, I will discuss the physical implications of early-time causality violations in heavy-ion simulations, and how current state-of-the-art hydrodynamic solvers such as MUSIC deal with the expected early-time pathologies [4]. Particular attention will be devoted to the following pressing question: How can hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions be seemingly stable when theory indicates they should not be?

In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. In the second, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. In $pp$ collisions, excluding jet-associated particles does not affect the ridge, and no significant azimuthal correlations are found between jet-associated particles and the underlying event, ruling out hard-process contributions to the $pp$ ridge. New measurements extending this analysis to $p$+Pb collisions are also presented. Prior $p$+Pb flow measurements have indicated a small but significant high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ up to a $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of 50 GeV. This is in contrast to suppression measurements which indicate no clear suppression of high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons.

We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio %\eta/s% in the early stages of the collision.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maurice', 'last_name': 'Coquet', 'fullName': 'Coquet, Maurice', 'id': '9288739', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR)', 'emailHash': 'f3efe6834dfd958b57b1c7f7f1a96d8d', 'db_id': 9288739, 'person_id': 8885871}"

The Z boson has a very short lifetime and can decay to dimuon final states that can be precisely measured. These properties make it a valuable tool for studying the initial state of heavy ion collisions. It has been proposed that the momentum of muons resulting from a Z decay, and therefore the experimentally observed mass and width of the Z boson, may be modified by the presence of the immense initial-state electromagnetic fields that are thought to be created in heavy ion collisions. Using the CMS experiment, we report the first search for a modification of the observed Z boson mass and width in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV relative to those observed in pp collisions. In addition, measurements of Z boson yields and azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, will be discussed. The centrality and rapidity dependence of the measurements are compared to theoretical models. Taken together, these measurements provide new insights into the role of initial electromagnetic fields, nuclear parton distribution functions, and initial-state geometry in heavy ion collisions. The production of top quarks in heavy ion collisions serves as a novel tool for investigating nuclear parton distribution functions at high Bjorken-x. Although being a quark, the top has a short lifetime, decaying predominantly to a W boson and b quark pair, before hadronizing. Leptonic final states from the subsequent W boson decay are thus effectively electroweak probes of the medium they traverse before reaching the detector.

In this contribution, we present our recently published study on the electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter. We implement the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, hadronic many-body theory is utilized to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. Vertex corrections are then introduced to maintain gauge invariance. In particular, we examine the transport peak and electric conductivity along a proposed phase transition line, and under conditions comparable to those expected in future heavy-ion experiments. We compare the transport properties for hadronic matter and a pion gas, in order to examine the individual contributions of various particles to the electric conductivity.

Parallel session 8,parallel,A generalized picture of colour decoherence in dense QCD media,"Mayo López, Xoán",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela - IGFAE,Unknown,"One of the most striking modifications induced by the QGP on a QCD parton shower is the breaking of angular-ordering. This was established in a series of pioneering papers almost 15 years ago by studying the radiation pattern off a QCD antenna in the presence of a medium [1,2]. These effects were captured by a single critical angle solely depending on the medium properties. Constraining the values of $\theta_c$, and more generally the physics of colour decoherence, is one of the targets of the heavy-ion experimental program at the LHC.

In this talk, we will demonstrate that the notion of a critical angle that exclusively depends on the medium properties no longer holds after accounting for medium effects during the formation of the antenna. This generalisation of the results of Refs. [1,2] shows that each splitting in an in-medium parton shower experiences colour decoherence in a different fashion. In addition, the total rate of emissions is enhanced with respect to previous calculations. This result has important implications for the experimental quest of determining medium modifications to parton evolution, as well as in the formulation of in-medium parton showers.

For the first time in PbPb collisions, the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons relative to $Z$ bosons are measured in bins of charged hadron $p_\mathrm{T}$ to search for in-medium parton shower modifications and medium recoil effects. The analysis focuses on events containing at least one $Z$ boson with $40 < p_\mathrm{T} < 350$ GeV. A significant modification in the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions for charged hadrons in the low $p_\mathrm{T}$ range, around 1 to 2 GeV, is observed compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The results are consistent with expectations from phenomenological models, including medium recoil and the medium response to hard probes traversing the quark-gluon plasma.

Di-hadron correlations can naturally separate effects from different angular scales and enable jet substructure measurements without jet reconstruction bias. Similar to the energy-energy correlator (EE) in jets where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes are separated, by studying analogous correlation in the full event, one can unravel potential larger-scale structures that may arise from the interaction of high-energy recoiling particles with the quark-gluon plasma.

In the measured ensemble, particles oriented in the direction in which the medium is shorter are over-represented as compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the elliptic anisotropy for jets, obtaining quantitative agreement with available experimental data.

Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. The ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations is determined by the physics of color coherence. We find that jet $v_2$ has a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of the critical angle $\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, we show that the relative size of jet $v_2$ for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follows a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to experimentally reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter. To this end, precise jet measurements from sPHENIX will be determinant as one explores larger values of $\theta_c$ in AuAu collisions. Our study incorporates results for OO collisions at the LHC as well, providing predictions for both jet $R_{\rm AA}$ and jet $v_2$ for different $R$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yacine', 'last_name': 'Mehtar-Tani', 'fullName': 'Mehtar-Tani, Yacine', 'id': '9288870', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': 'ccfab5687e96802d8cffe3401603ec08', 'db_id': 9288870, 'person_id': 8931671}"

On one hand, the quenching effect, often quantified through the nuclear modification factor (e.g., $R_{AA}$), is well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, it is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the observation of collectivity in these collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon. And O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems.

In this talk, we present the first measurements of the following three observables related to the jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$), inclusive jet $R_{cp}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{cp}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV.

Parallel session 14,parallel,Measurement of flavor effects in charm-induced jet showers at the perturbative/non-perturbative boundary with ALICE,"Dhankher, Preeti",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"Jet substructure provides precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offers more differential ways to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of single hadrons. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as to the mass of partons through the dead-cone effect.

In this talk we present three key charm-tagged jet measurements, using jets tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D^{0}}$-meson. The first are measurements of the differences between three different axis definitions inside the jets. These different definitions vary in their sensitivity to wide-angle soft radiation and systematically probe the radiation pattern off of charm quarks. Next are the jet angularities, which characterise the weighted angular distribution of the jet constituents. These powerful observables probe the parton shower, with sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects that can be tuned by adjusting the importance of wide-angle radiation. Finally, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator for $\rm{D^{0}}$-meson tagged jets. This observable is defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs within jets and reveals the detailed structure of QCD radiation from heavy quarks, allowing for a distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative effects in charm showers. Comparisons of all these results to measurements of dominantly gluon-initiated jets, as well as to various event generators, are sensitive to flavor-dependent effects in both the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms. Moreover, comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations emphasize the need for improved theoretical modelling of heavy-quark jets and provide critical insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Preeti', 'last_name': 'Dhankher', 'fullName': 'Dhankher, Preeti', 'id': '9385577', 'affiliation': 'University of California Berkeley (US)', 'emailHash': '184c051c94f8207fefa81704e7c391a9', 'db_id': 9385577, 'person_id': 9129392}"

Using novel tracing methods, splittings of charm quarks are isolated to measure fundamental properties such as the dead-cone effect and the charm-quark splitting function. By using the new high statistics data samples of Run 3, we present new measurements of the dead-cone effect and splitting function of charm quarks, differentially in the energy of the emitter, through measurements of jets tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. At the low energies uniquely accessible to the ALICE experiment, comparisons of these measurements to an inclusive-jet baseline probe the evolution of the dead-cone of charm quarks with unprecedented accuracy. With increasing energy of the emitting charm quark, the dead-cone angle is predicted to get smaller, allowing for the isolation of the impact of Casimir colour factors.

Parallel session 14,parallel,Color Coherence on Recoils,"Pablos, Daniel","IGFAE, USC",Unknown,"In the last years, it has become clearer that recoiling particles originated due to elastic scatterings between the energetic partons within a jet and the medium constituents within the QGP are of great importance for jet quenching phenomenology. Current implementations in state-of-the-art models consider that the elastic scattering process takes place between an on-shell energetic parton and the medium constituent. Crucially, however, highly energetic partons produced during jet evolution cannot be considered in general as on-shell states coming from infinity, and their correct description is in terms of a collection of color correlated dipoles. In this talk we present the first computation of the properties of the soft recoils produced as a result of perturbative elastic scatterings between a color coherent dipole and a quark medium constituent.

Our findings [1] indicate that the angular phase space of these soft recoiling quarks is tightly constrained by the opening angle of the color coherent dipole, owing to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we provide the first estimate of the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics.

In RHIC Run-24, sPHENIX sampled 107/pb of p+p collision data at 200 GeV using an efficient high-p$_T$ jet trigger. This dataset represents a major increase in the luminosity times acceptance compared to previous measurements for this collision energy, along with the first HCal at mid-rapidity at RHIC.

Comparisons between the suppression observed in the inclusive sample of jets with the suppression of b-tagged jets and jets produced at forward rapidity (quark enhances sample of jets) are needed to understand the impact of parton mass and parton flavor on energy loss. Tagging of the $b$-jets is achieved using neural networks trained on Monte Carlo simulation samples and validated in a data-driven way with an independent approach involving the detection of muons from semileptonic decays of B-hadrons.

We then pay special attention to the anisotropies in the momentum broadening between the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the collision axis.

Parallel session 5,parallel,Imaging the Jet-Induced Medium Response with Energy Correlators,"Kudinoor, Arjun Srinivasan",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"In heavy-ion collisions, jets formed from hard-scattered partons experience an overall energy loss and have a modified internal structure compared to vacuum jets. These modifications are a result of the interactions between the energetic partons in a jet shower and the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). As the jet traverses the QGP, it loses momentum to the medium, which in turn responds to the presence of the jet. This “medium response” modifies the momentum distribution of the (soft) hadrons produced when the QGP freezes out. Since these hadrons carry the momentum lost by the parton shower, they and the modified shower both contribute to the energy flow in jets. The quantitative description of the medium response is an open question under active investigation. Recently, the projected N-point energy correlators (ENCs) have seen a resurgence of interest to probe vacuum QCD. For the first time [1], we will present a computation of the full three point energy-energy-energy correlation function in heavy-ion collisions and demonstrate its use for studying the shape of the energy flow originating from medium response. For this study, we utilize the Hybrid Model that implements a hydrodynamical medium response via the wake. We will show that measuring three-point correlation functions offer a promising experimental avenue for imaging the wake of the jet as when the three angles are well-separated the three-point correlator is dominated by the medium response.

These interactions allow for the study of various photon-induced processes at high energies. The products of exclusive UPC interactions are typically characterized by very low transverse momenta products, which present several challenges to efficiently select with a trigger. In Run 3, the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) FastOR trigger provided a novel tool to trigger on these processes at Level 1. The TRT trigger was, for the first time, adapted for use in heavy-ion collisions, allowing it to trigger on low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles ($p_\mathrm{T} > 200$ MeV), including muons from coherent J/Psi decays. Another feature of many UPC collisions is single-sided nuclear breakup or multiple photon exchange, which causes one or both of the colliding ions to emit forward neutrons.  
The Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detects these neutrons and provides a fully digital trigger. This tool allows for triggering on many distinct neutron topologies within the Level 1 system. In Run 4, the new joint ATLAS-CMS HL-ZDC will be installed, providing similar triggering capabilities in the more challenging environment of the HL-LHC.

Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The unknown Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD. We use maximum entropy freeze-out of fluctuations to make estimates for the factorial cumulants of proton multiplicities, assuming thermal equilibrium, for a family of EoSs with a 3D Ising-like critical point, varying the microscopic inputs that determine the location and strength of the critical point.

Such a critical point is increasingly predicted to be located in the high baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) region around $\mu_B$ = 500 - 650 MeV [3–8]. In 2018, the STAR Experiment started collecting data in a fixed-target configuration in order to map the high baryon chemical potential region of the phase diagram ($\mu_B$ = 420 - 720 MeV). Critical fluctuations may be observed by measuring various orders of cumulants, $C_n$, of the distributions of baryon number. The collision-energy dependence of net-proton $C_4$/$C_2$ from STAR’s measurements in Beam Energy Scan I hinted at a possible non-monotonic deviation from the non-critical baseline in Au+Au collisions from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 19.6 GeV, and the first published result from the fixed-target program, in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV is consistent with the non-critical baseline [9–13].

However, the connection between higher-order baryon number cumulants calculated in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics and higher-order net proton number cumulants may not be straightforward. Moreover, correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number have been suggested as sensitive probes for detecting changes in the degrees of freedom that carry strangeness at low temperatures (hadrons) and high temperatures (quarks) [1]. A non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model can explain baryon-strangeness correlations calculated in QCD at low temperatures and small chemical potentials, especially when additional strange hadrons are included (QMHRG2020).
In this presentation, we will show the ratio of first-order to second-order baryon number fluctuations and compare them with the RHIC BES-II results for proton number fluctuations. We will argue that a simple non-interacting HRG model cannot explain the RHIC BES-II results at higher densities, particularly at lower beam energies. Additionally, we will compare higher-order baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD results and argue that these results rule out the possibility of a QCD critical point in the BES-II collider mode. We will also discuss the potential influence of corrections arising from global charge conservation in heavy-ion collisions [2].

Parallel session 30,parallel,Universal scaling near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Mitra, Sabarnya",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"The chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD is expected to be of second order if the breaking of axial anomaly remains sufficiently strong at the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ [1]. This is supported by lattice QCD calculations [2]. However, FRG model calculations suggest that the scaling window, in which universal scaling relations hold, may be small [3]. Furthermore, whether or not the $U_A(1)$ symmetry gets effectively restored at $T_c$ remains to be controversial. This suggest that a more detailed analysis of universal critical behavior close to $T_c$ , as well as a direct determination of the relevant universality class for the chiral phase transition [1,4] in (2+1)-flavor QCD are needed.

In this talk we present new results from a study of the scaling behavior
of an improved order parameter $M = M_\ell - H \chi_\ell$ for chiral symmetry restoration in the light 2-flavor sector of (2+1)-flavor QCD. Here $M_\ell$ and $\chi_\ell$ are multiplicatively renormalized light quark chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, respectively. Furthermore, $H = m_l/m_s$ is the light-to-strange quark mass ratio.

We construct ratios of $M$ for two different values of the light quark mass, $m_l$ (or $H$ equivalently), and $T$ close to $T_c$ . In the scaling region we find a unique intersection point for these ratios at $T=T_c$, which allows us to determine $T_c$ and the underlying universality class of the chiral phase transition, from the knowledge of critical exponent $\delta$.

The approach followed here will allow to further constrain the influence of axial anomaly on universal critical behavior in (2+1)-flavor QCD. It also provides a new way of determining the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ , which strengthens the upper bound on the temperature range within which a critical end point in QCD for non-vanishing values of  chemical potential can possibly be found in heavy ion experiments.

In this regime, the net-baryon number cumulants computed  using the HRG and lattice QCD partition functions are in good agreement up to third order. However, starting with the fourth-order cumulants, the LQCD results are significantly lower than the corresponding HRG results. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally verify the full QCD partition function by measuring the fourth-order cumulants of the net-proton number distributions.

In this talk, ALICE data for net-proton number cumulants up to sixth order in proton-proton collisions at top LHC energy are presented to search for effects of a possible chiral phase transition in this small system. An extension of the net-proton measurements in Pb-Pb collisions to fourth order is also presented.

In ultra-central collisions, the QGP volume saturates and remains constant; instead, entropy fluctuations cause temperature variations in the system. This property can be probed by measuring the correlation between the average transverse momentum (⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩) and the multiplicity of charged hadrons. This contribution shows the latest ALICE measurements
of charged-hadron ⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩ and its higher-order cumulants in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions. Results are in close agreement with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, by fitting the relative increase of ⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩ to the relative change in the average charged-particle density at midrapidity, it is possible to extract the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the QGP, which indicates how fast compression waves propagate through the QGP medium. The extracted cs shows a strong dependence on the choice of the centrality estimators used to select ultra-central collisions, highlighting the sensitivity of this measurement to experimental biases. This observation suggests a need for careful reassessment of methods for determining cs from heavy-ion data. The measurements are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art models in ultra-central events.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Omar', 'last_name': 'Vazquez Rueda', 'fullName': 'Vazquez Rueda, Omar', 'id': '9385569', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston (US)', 'emailHash': '0c62b8f5f93358d94035814c5373af75', 'db_id': 9385569, 'person_id': 8937365}"

In this region, the heavy-ion collision systems will undergo a first-order phase transition. This phase transition is expected to proceed via spinodal decomposition as the system explores the metastable and unstable areas of the equation of state. To conclusively claim the discovery of the first-order phase transition curve, it is crucial to include spinodal effects in phenomenological simulations of these collisions and identify their experimental signatures. For the first time, we present a covariant formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics including spinodal decomposition [1]. These equations account for surface effects between the two phases and can be used in hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. We solve them for a nearly boost invariant flow and discuss the effects of phase separation on system evolution.

There are significant discussions in the field about the initial conditions, including the colliding energy and the size of the system, needed to generate a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is expected that the threshold can be revealed by the measurements of the colliding energy and system size dependence of baryon-to-meson enhancement. Recent datasets collected by STAR in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3 and 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan II program and in different collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV (d+Au, Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru) provide us a chance to look into the $\Omega$/$\phi$ ratios and possibly locate the threshold of QGP production.
In addition, (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity in different collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV can be compared with the results from LHC, where an intriguingly smooth increase in these ratios was first reported.
Furthermore, rapidity density of (anti-)strange baryons may give insight into the baryon stopping mechanism.

Parallel session 29,parallel,"Production, flow, and properties of hypernuclei in heavy-ions with ALICE","Ditzel, Janik",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons. The measurement of the production of hypernuclei with mass number A=3 and 4 in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful tool to investigate the hyper-nucleosynthesis mechanism. In the coalescence model, the production yields are sensitive to the interplay between the spatial extension of the nucleus wavefunction and the baryon-emitting source size, whereas, in the statistical hadronization model, the nuclear structure does not come into play in the production. Hypernuclei span over a wide range of wavefunction radii, from about 2 fm for A=4 hypernuclei to about 10 fm for the hypertriton, making them ideal probes to test such models. In addition, the study of hypernuclei properties provides information on the nucleon-hyperon interactions, complementing the results obtained through femtoscopy correlation measurements. The strength of such interactions is a fundamental input to calculate the equation-of-state of the high-density nuclear matter found inside neutron stars.
This contribution presents recent measurements of ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H, ${}^{4}_\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}_\Lambda$He based on the data samples collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Besides the yield measurement, the production mechanisms can be investigated via anisotropic flow and global spin polarization measurements, comparing the behaviour of hypernuclei with their non-strange counterpart.

Parallel session 29,parallel,Exploring the hadronic phase with momentum and azimuthal distribution of short-lived resonances and understanding the internal structure of exotic resonances,"Kim, Junlee",CERN,Switzerland,"Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By contrasting the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the ϕ-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^{*}$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution will present new results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^{*}$(892) and ϕ(1020) in Pb–Pb collisions obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results will be compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret which underlying mechanism can describe the experimental observations.

In addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. Proposed Glueball candidates like the f$_2$(1270), f$^{′}_2$(1525), and f$_0$(1710) also provide opportunities to explore the gluonic bound states predicted by lattice QCD. Utilizing its excellent particle identification capabilities ALICE has recently conducted detailed studies of the exotic resonance production in pp collisions data at √s = 13 and 13.6 TeV. This contribution will present new measurements of exotic resonances such as f$_0$(980), f$_1$(1285), and the glueball candidates to get more insight into their internal structure.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Junlee', 'last_name': 'Kim', 'fullName': 'Kim, Junlee', 'id': '9385713', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'd5ef3818a51ebafe5ec952d903ed8768', 'db_id': 9385713, 'person_id': 8940221}"

Measurements on their yields can help us investigate their production mechanisms. In particular, the ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He and  $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) are bounded substantially tighter compared to the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H. The large radius of the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H leads to suppression in coalescence models, but not in the thermal model where the size of the nucleus does not play a role. As such, studying the $A=3-5$ hypernuclei yields allow us to extract information on the effects of hypernuclear binding on hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions.

Parallel session 23,parallel,Probing the structure of light exotic hadron $f_0(980)$ with elliptic flow in p-Pb collisions at the LHC,"Wang, Yili",Peking University,Unknown,"The study of exotic hadrons has long been a topic of great interest for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As one of the light exotic hadrons, the structure and constituent quark content of $f_0(980)$ have been debated for decades, with theories suggesting it could be a tetraquark state ($s\bar sq\bar q$) or a hadronic molecule ($K\bar K$). Recently, the CMS experiment has measured the elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$ of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions and concluded that  $f_0(980)$ is an ordinary $s\bar s$ meson, based on the number-of-constituent-quarks (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow [1]. Assuming that loosely bound light exotic hadrons can only survive at the kinetic freeze-out of the expanding hadronic matter, we have implemented the first $K\bar K$ coalescence model to a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic and hadronic transport model to calculate the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV.  Using the well tuned phase-space distributions of kaons in this collision, our coalescence model results agree well with the CMS flow measurements,  providing thus a strong evidence for the $K\bar K$ molecular nature of $f_0(980)$. Our study also indicates that the CMS Collaboration may have unjustifiably ruled out the $K\bar K$ molecular state of $f_0(980)$ by not considering the different $v_2$ scalings in  the coalescence of hadrons and the coalescence of quarks[2].

Parallel session 23,parallel,Deuterons emergence through coalescence with ALICE,"Mahlein, Maximilian",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Germany,"One of the unresolved issues in hadron–hadron collisions is the microscopic understanding of how light (anti)(hyper)nuclei are created. Several differential measurements of (anti)(hyper)nuclei yields, momentum distributions, and fluctuations have been carried out in pp, p–A, and A–A collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Comparisons to models based on statistical hadronization or nucleon coalescence generally provide a good fit to the data. However, these models are grounded in different underlying scenarios, leading to a highly model dependent interpretation of the results.
In this work, new results based on femtoscopy correlations of deuteron proton and deuteron–pion pairs measured in pp and Pb–Pb collisions by ALICE at collision energies of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, respectively, are presented. Deuteron–proton correlations allow for studying the particle-emitting source size of deuterons compared to other hadrons. The deuteron source aligns with the proton source across all colliding systems. In pp collisions, the deuteron–pion correlation reveals the residual interaction between pions and nucleons from short lived Δ decays, followed by nucleon coalescence into deuterons. This effect is not observed in Pb–Pb collisions due to the large pion  multiplicities.
These results demonstrate, in a model-independent manner, that coalescence is a viable mechanism for (anti)deuteron production in ultra-relativistic hadron–hadron collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maximilian', 'last_name': 'Mahlein', 'fullName': 'Mahlein, Maximilian', 'id': '9386313', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '9bc002b10bbbaa678f3f1e17d8ac5445', 'db_id': 9386313, 'person_id': 9130216}"

In particular, they can carry signals from the pre-equilibrium stage since the very high energy density of this stage can result in significant charm-medium interaction. Using a hybrid simulation framework that combines the IP-Glasma model for initial-state with viscous hydrodynamic evolution MUSIC to model the medium, we study charm quark propagation through different stages of the collision, from pre-equilibrium to hadronization. Heavy quark initial production is generated using PYTHIA and their interactions within the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic medium are modeled through Langevin dynamics in MARTINI. Our results reveal that both the nuclear modification factor and anisotropic flow coefficients of D-mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are sensitive to the momentum-dependent energy loss of charm quarks in the initial stages.

In fact, the early production of heavy quarks ($c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$) make charmonia an ideal tool to investigate the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, at LHC energies the recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks pairs, namely (re)generation, was found to significantly affect charmonium observables, in contraposition to the well known suppression mechanism. This aspect makes the production measurements of ground and excited states more and more relevant to discriminate among the scenarios foreseen by the different theoretical models. In addition, the possibility to isolate the non-prompt charmonia, i.e. originating from beauty hadron decays, provides an insight into the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. In this contribution, recently published results by the ALICE collaboration of inclusive charmonia production obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented. At midrapidity, the measurements of prompt and non-prompt  J/$\psi$ production will be shown, while at forward rapidity the measurement will be extended to the excited state as the $\psi$(2S).

In this talk, wwe present a generalization of this code that incorporates the regime where $rT \sim 1$ in the one-gluon exchange approximation.

This model naturally improves the description of quark susceptibilities previously underestimated in the simple $QPM$. Coupling the $QPMp$ modeling to an event-by-event transport approach based on Langevin equations, we evaluate the heavy-flavour $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{n}(p_T)$ for $D$, $\Lambda_c$, $B$, $\Lambda_b$ hadrons in $PbPb$ as well as for $OO$ at $5$ $ATeV$. In $PbPb$ we find a quite good prediction for both $D$ meson and leptons from $B$ decays at least within current experimental uncertainties; we also discuss the additional information that can be carried by collisions of light $OO$ system. 
A main general result is that for charm quark the extracted space diffusion Ds(T) appears to be significantly larger (about $30-40\%$) wrt the recent lQCD/NREFT results at momentum $p=0$. We propose a novel analysis that point out the crucial role of the momentum dependence of the interaction to draw solid conclusions about the agreement between the phenomenological approach and lQCD calculation as well as to determine the thermalization time of HQ and in particular its mass dependence from charm to bottom quark. We will point out that $\Lambda_c$ production and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of D meson at very low momenta ($p_T<1.5$ $GeV$) will allow for a novel and more solid determination of the space diffusion coefficient.

Parallel session 27,parallel,Unscreened potential and quarkonium width in QGP,"Larsen, Rasmus",Stony Brook University,United States,"Screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part. We determine the complex potential in QGP using lattice calculations on lattices with large temporal extent $N_{\tau}=16-36$. The complex potential is extracted from the Wilson line correlators and physically motivated forms of the corresponding spectral functions [1,2]. We find that the real part of the complex potential is not screened in QGP independently of the detailed form of the spectral functions. We also estimate the imaginary part of the potential using prior information from various theoretical calculations [2].

Lattice calculations also find that the wave function of bottomonium states does not change much across the QCD transition [3]. This is consistent with the observation of the unscreened potential. Therefore, we use the vacuum wave function of different quarkonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_c(1P)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\chi_b(1P)$ and $\chi_b(2P)$ states

The transport of heavy quarks in the QGP medium is described by a Langevin-based transport model that has been augmented to incorporate medium-induced radiation. This transport model is coupled to a bulk evolution model based on 2+1D relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. The heavy quark transport coefficients are derived from non-perturbative T-matrix calculations, which account for resonant correlations near the QGP transition temperature.  Hadronization of the heavy quark is described by a fragmentation plus coalescence model. We utilize the resonance recombination model that satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions. The recombination probabilities are derived from resonant heavy-quark scattering rates.

These correlations have also an influence on hidden heavy flavour mesons produced in pp collisions.

In heavy-ion collisions, where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state is produced, charm and beauty quarks are produced on a timescale shorter than the medium formation time, being sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the fireball and to the magnetic field produced perpendicularly to the reaction plane in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large angular momentum and initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised, and the quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron during the hadronization process. Experimentally, heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring either the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ of spin-1 bosons (as the D$^{*+}$ meson) or the longitudinal polarization $P_{\rm z}$ of spin ½ fermions (as the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryon). Measurements in pp collisions provide a crucial baseline to disentangle the amount of charm-hadron polarization induced by the charm-quark polarization inherited from the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions.

The production cross section of beauty hadrons can be theoretically described with the factorisation approach as a convolution of the parton distribution functions of the incoming projectiles, the perturbative partonic cross section, and the fragmentation functions describing the transition from quarks to hadrons. Measurements of the production cross section of beauty hadrons in proton–proton (pp) collisions are therefore excellent tests of pQCD calculations. Measurements down to low transverse momenta are also fundamental ingredients for the estimation of the $\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ production cross section. Moreover, the relative abundances of different beauty-hadron species also gives insights about the beauty-quark hadronisation mechanisms.

Parallel session 3,parallel,Studying charm and beauty quark production and hadronisation with charm hadron measurements with ALICE,"Dello Stritto, Luigi",CERN,Switzerland,"Recent observations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have revealed a significant enhancement in baryon production in hadronic collisions compared to e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, challenging the long-held assumption of fragmentation universality. This phenomenon, initially observed in the charm sector, has also been observed in the beauty sector, indicating a broader implication for heavy-flavor hadronization processes. This observation has led to the development of several models attempting to explain these observations, by implementing modified hadronization approaches with respect to the in-vacuum fragmentation process. Proposed mechanisms include color reconnection beyond leading-color approximation, hadronisation via coalescence, and feed-down from unobserved resonant states in a statistical hadronization approach.

To further elucidate this phenomenon, recent studies have focused on baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of event multiplicity. Intriguingly, evidence of a multiplicity dependence, with increased ratios in high-multiplicity events, has been observed in both the charm and beauty sectors, suggesting a possible connection between baryon enhancement and the local parton density. These investigations have significant implications also for heavy-ion physics, potentially bridging the gap between phenomena observed in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive understanding of these effects is essential for refining our theoretical models of heavy-quark hadronisation in hadronic environments.

We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy [1]. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment [2] shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

These calculations can provide some insight into the nature of the tetraquark candidates, whether as a bound meson pair or as a looser configuration of four individual partons which can influence their interactions in the nuclear medium, such as in heavy-ion collisions. The kinematic distributions of these states as a function of $y$ and $p_T$ are also studied.

Additionally, anisotropic flow can produce local vorticities in both in-plane (z) and out-of-plane (y) directions, leading to local polarization. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program, including the Fixed-Target (FXT) mode at STAR, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hyperon ($\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$,  $\Xi^{\pm}$, $\Omega^{\pm}$) global polarization over a wide range of baryon chemical potential.

Unlike the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), where the induced dipole moment fluctuates randomly from event to event, the CMW generates an electric quadrupole moment with a same sign for a given net charge state of the system, thus CMW can be observed even when CME is not detected. The CMW leads to charge-dependent elliptic flow ($v_2$) which correlates with charge asymmetry ($A_{ch}$) of the system. 
Experimental searches for the CMW, however, face challenges from background contributions related to elliptic flow and nonflow. 
The correlation between triangular flow $v_3$ and $A_{ch}$ will be discussed as a background indicator.
Similar to the CME search, we use RHIC isobar collisions ($^{96}_{44}\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}\rm Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$) at STAR for the CMW search, anticipating a stronger signal in $^{96}_{44}\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}\rm Ru$ due to its larger magnetic field. 
In addition, we compare with Au+Au to study the system dependence at the top RHIC energy, examining the magnetic field effects from isobar to Au+Au. 
The prerequisite of the CMW is expected to change with collision energy. 
We present the measurement of slope $ r_2$ of $v_2$ vs. $A_{ch}$ correlation in isobar collisions and Au+Au collisions with BES-II data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 19, 27 and 200 GeV.
We use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions.

Parallel session 1,parallel,Initial-state-driven spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions,"Speranza, Enrico",CERN,Switzerland,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of spin-polarization effects in heavy-ion collisions. Most approaches assume that final-state particles become polarized only if the thermal vorticity and shear are non-zero at freeze-out. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different polarization mechanism. For the first time, spin density is introduced in the initial state in a similar way as one introduces energy density. We argue that the collision of two nuclei, which occurs among participant nucleons carrying spin, deposits in the transverse plane a spin density that polarizes the produced QCD fireball along some random direction. If the subsequent evolution (e.g., kinetic or hydrodynamic) of the fireball does not alter this effect, the spins of the particles emitted at freeze-out will be polarized along the same direction. Using a simple model, we estimate that the polarization induced by initial-state fluctuations is on the order of 1% in central collisions, increasing to over 10% in noncentral collisions. At high energies, it is thus much larger than the polarization due to event-by-event fluctuations of the thermal vorticity. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable able to reveal net-spin fluctuations in the initial states, for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons. This new effect depends little on beam energy and could be promptly studied at both the LHC and RHIC. Finally, besides introducing new tools to probe spin effects in nuclear collisions, this work provides a framework to define spin initial conditions suitable for extensions of hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Enrico', 'last_name': 'Speranza', 'fullName': 'Speranza, Enrico', 'id': '9288709', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'da90b3b19a2df3cc4da56647b6d76e11', 'db_id': 9288709, 'person_id': 8871182}"

Parallel session 1,parallel,Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,"Li, Han-Sheng",Purdue University,Unknown,"Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of particles of interest (POI's). Event-shape engineering (ESE) [1] and event-shape selection (ESS) [2] are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. The former groups events according to the elliptic anisotropy vector $\vec{q}_2$ of particles in phase space different from that of POI's, thus to the dynamical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$, whereas the latter groups events according to $\vec{q}_{2,{\rm pair}}$ of pairs of POI's themselves, thus to the statistical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$. In this talk, we conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations [3]. 
It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept, because of the limited dynamical fluctuation range of $v_2$ than that of  statistical fluctuations.
It is found that the ESE method can faithfully probe the CME when the $\vec{q}_2$ phase space is distanced from the POI's, while nonflow effect cannot be neglected when the $\vec{q}_2$ and POI's phase spaces are close. The ESS method, on the other hand, is obscured because of the intertwining $\vec{q}_{2,{\rm pair}}$, $v_2$, and $\Delta\gamma$, all of which are computed from the same POI's. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the  event content, such as the relative mixtures of background-contributing sources, and thus is not a robust measure of the CME.

This parametric model explicitly depends on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters and is ideal for studying their effects on equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties.

Recent studies [1] show that the directed flow ($v_{1}$) of $K^{*0}$ is strongly affected during the hadronic stage due to asymmetric loss in different sides of the $p_{x}$ axis in momentum space caused by the tilted fireball and density dependent rescattering. Therefore the $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ can be a good probe to study the late-stage hadronic interaction and provide more information (e.g rescattering affected by variations in matter density across phase-space) compared to the yield measurement integrated over full azimuth and rapidity.

Centrality-dependent difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $K^{*0}$ resonances will be presented.  The difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $\phi$  mesons will be also shown. The results will be compared with a hydrodynamic model that incorporates a hadronic afterburner [1].  The measured $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ resonances can provide more insights into hadronic rescattering and regeneration processes in heavy-ion collisions and can constrain transport-based models of QCD matter.

Parallel session 9,parallel,Extending the fluid-dynamic description to the initial state,"Kirchner, Andreas",Duke University,Unknown,"Over the past two decades, research has shown that various observables measured in heavy-ion collisions can be effectively described using relativistic fluid dynamics across different collision systems and energies. However, a common challenge in these studies is the modeling of the transition from the initial state to the fluid-dynamic phase. While the collision likely involves complex, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is possible that a second-order fluid theory can adequately capture its softer features. If successfully completed, this approach could lead to a comprehensive dynamical description of a heavy-ion collision, where the only free parameters are related to the thermodynamics and the transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.
In our work (arXiv:2410.08169), we investigate this possibility. We discuss how to characterize the state prior to the collision within this framework, the implications of relativistic causality on the equations of motion, the entropy production from shear and bulk viscous dissipation during the initial longitudinal dynamics, and how this can inform sensible initial conditions for subsequent transverse expansion.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andreas', 'last_name': 'Kirchner', 'fullName': 'Kirchner, Andreas', 'id': '9288821', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '38c463da6d6e5adf03f79ea724bf098f', 'db_id': 9288821, 'person_id': 8893591}"

Parallel session 9,parallel,Covariant Formulation of Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics and Equilibration of Spin: Linear and Nonlinear Perspectives,"Shokri, Masoud","Goethe University, ITP",Unknown,"Spin hydrodynamics is the extension of standard relativistic hydrodynamics with the total angular momentum considered as an independent conserved charge, where the total angular momentum is often expressed as a surface integral of a rank-3 tensor.
This rank-3 tensor is then decomposed into orbital and spin parts, which, by using the definition of orbital angular momentum in Cartesian coordinates and the energy-momentum tensor conservation, leads to the equation of motion for the spin tensor.
This treatment is not covariant under coordinate transformations, even in flat spacetime.
We address this issue by redefining the orbital and total angular momentum in a covariant way, which can also be extended to curved spacetime in cases where the Belinfante and Hilbert definitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent.
Then, we review the constitutive equations of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics developed from a systematic expansion in the reduced Planck constant, $\hbar$.
This formulation is inspired by, but not necessarily based on, quantum kinetic theory.
Up to the first order in $\hbar$, there is no back-reaction from the spin sector to fluid dynamics, and, therefore, solutions to standard hydrodynamics act as an input for the equations of motion for the spin tensor.
We consider three simple solutions to the fluid’s equation of motion: hydrostatic, linearized hydrodynamics, and conformal Bjorken flow.
We demonstrate that, up to first-order in $\hbar$, the spin waves are not affected by the fluid waves, and therefore, the results from the hydrostatic case and linearized hydrodynamics are the same.
This shows that our results for the damping of spin waves are not modified by slight fluid perturbations.
For the case of conformal Bjorken flow, we first review the consequences of conformal invariance in spin hydrodynamics and, in particular, show that conformal invariance should be considered only in the limit where $\hbar$ vanishes.
Then, we use the attractor solution to find the evolution of the spin potential.
We show that the spin potential in this nonlinear regime is damped in a similar fashion to the linear regime.
These results strengthen our previous findings on the possible long equilibration time for spin, and support a dynamical treatment of spin degrees of freedom.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Masoud', 'last_name': 'Shokri', 'fullName': 'Shokri, Masoud', 'id': '9288758', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University, ITP', 'emailHash': '9931bbf824507435f6505164e4926e46', 'db_id': 9288758, 'person_id': 8883170}"
Parallel session 19,parallel,Resummed spin hydrodynamics from quantum kinetic theory,"Wagner, David",Florence University,Unknown,"In the past years, different observables related to the spin polarization of hadrons such as $\Lambda$-Baryons have attracted much attention and continue to find new applications. 
While some measurements (such as the global polarization) are straightforwardly reproduced by assuming the spins of the particles to be in equilibrium, the explanation of more differential observables (such as the local polarization) remains a subject of active discussion.

A crucial ingredient in a more thorough description of spin dynamics is a formulation of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that accounts for the finite (and possibly long [1]) timescale of spin relaxation, i.e., of the approach of the spin potential $\Omega_0^{\mu\nu}$ to the thermal vorticity $\varpi^{\mu\nu}$. In such a theory, the spin potential remains a dynamical quantity that follows certain evolution equations, akin to the Bloch equations for the magnetization in the (nonrelativistic) description of spin dynamics.

The main result to be presented are the equations of motion for such a theory, derived from first principles based on quantum kinetic theory [2]. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach [3], a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. 
It is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential $\Omega_0^{\mu\nu}$, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor $\mathfrak{t}^{\mu\nu}$. For a simple truncation, all first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.

We argue that fluctuations of strong-force fields with short correlation length may be the key to solve the puzzle. We derive a relativistic spin Boltzmann equation for vector mesons from Kadanoff-Baym equations, incorporating an effective quark-meson model for interaction and the quark coalescence process for hadronization. Our calculations of the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ for unflavored vector mesons reveal that all field contributions appear in squared terms. This finding indicates that anisotropies in local field correlations, relative to the spin quantization axis, lead to the spin alignment of unflavored vector mesons. We propose that the large spin alignment observed for $\phi$ mesons at lower energies arises from effective $\phi$ fields that  polarize the strange quarks and antiquarks, which in turn form polarized $\phi$ mesons via coalescence during the hadronization stage.  The strength of the $\phi$ field can be inferred from the experimental data on $\phi$-meson spin alignment as functions of collision energy reported by STAR Collaboration. Our findings show a transverse momentum dependence of $\rho_{00}$ in fair agreement with STAR data, and we also predict the azimuthal angle dependence of $\rho_{00}$. The proposed polarization mechanism driven by fluctuating strong-force fields may open a new window into a hitherto unknown behaviour of QCD interaction.

Parallel session 19,parallel,An end-to-end generative model for heavy-ion collisions,"Sun, Jing-an",Fudan University,Unknown,"The multistage approach based on hydrodynamics has achieved remarkably success in modeling heavy-ion physics, providing an accurate description of experimental particle spectra as well as various signatures of collective flow, flow correlations, and fluctuations. However, traditional numerical simulations of hydrodynamics are challenged by recent high-precision measurements: to probe the finer details in the system via statistics-demanding observables, 10^9-10^10 collisions events are commonly required. As heavy-ion collision physics enters a high-precision era, theoretical modeling needs to evolve to meet growing computational demands.
 
In this work, we introduce DiffHIC, a generative diffusion model designed to bridge this gap. The model simulates ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end, taking initial entropy density profiles as input and producding two-dimensional final particle spectra. By comparing observables derived from particle spectra generated by both traditional numerical simulations and our trained generative model, we demonstrate that DiffHIC not only accurately replicates integrated and differential observables but also effectively captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These results indicate that DiffHIC successfully learns the intricate mapping from initial entropy density profiles to final particle spectra, governed by a set of nonlinear hydrodynamic and Boltzmann transport equations. While preserving the fine  details of the underlying physical processes, DiffHIC significantly accelerates end-to-end heavy-ion collision simulations. For example, DiffHIC can simulate a single central collision event in just 0.1 seconds on a GeForce GTX 4090 GPU.

Parallel session 19,parallel,Understanding quantum corrections to momentum broadening in a weakly coupled QGP,"Weitz, Eamonn",Universität Bielefeld,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, the transverse momentum broadening coefficient, $\hat{q}$ plays an integral role in characterising how a high-energy parton loses energy to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it passes. Over the last few years, it has been shown [1,2] that $\hat{q}$ starts to receive radiative corrections at $\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, featuring potentially large logarithms. Indeed, better understanding the nature of these logarithmic corrections is extremely relevant for the goal of obtaining a precise theoretical description of parton energy loss.
During this talk, I will begin by presenting our results from [3], where we investigate how the inclusion of thermal effects impacts these radiative corrections. I will then report on our progress in understanding how the logarithmic phase space is deformed, once one relaxes the so-called harmonic oscillator approximation. In this direction, we make use of the improved opacity expansion [4], which has recently found success in analytically describing, at leading order, the interface of the single and multiple-scattering regimes.

For typical nuclei used in collisions, like gold and lead, this ratio, also known as the charge fraction ($Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$), is around 0.4. On the other hand, studies of isolated neutron stars and the dynamics of their birth and mergers require $Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$ as low as 0.01. We propose a new finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter EoS [1] that can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point observations of isolated neutron stars and nuclear experiments. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data from low to intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. With our new method, we can separately quantify the uncertainty in the $Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$ and finite $T$ components of the EoS without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We check the accuracy of our framework using a microscopic equation of state up to T = 100 MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B \geq$ 1100 MeV (∼ 1 − 2 $n_{\rm sat}$) and find that the error introduced is less than 5%, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$.

We discuss that the model calculations with the $\Lambda$ potential are consistent with the $\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1] and the $\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2].

A unified approach integrating heavy-ion collisions, other nuclear experiments, and neutron stars with the modern nuclear force from chiral EFT has provided valuable insights into the properties of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter (e.g. Ref. [3]). This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of both nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. For a microscopic description of dense matter, such an approach must be performed also for the hyperon sector. A precise understanding of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter is essential for addressing the long-standing hyperon puzzle of neutron star physics. 

In this talk, we consider the $\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2] at RHIC-BES energies to verify the $\Lambda$ potential based on chiral EFT [4]. This potential is sufficiently repulsive at high densities to solve the hyperon puzzle and has proven by us to be consistent with the $\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1]. We employ a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) implemented into the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2. We show that the model with the $\Lambda$ potential from chiral EFT can reproduce the experimental data [2], while a more attractive $\Lambda$ potential also reproduces the data. Thus, additional constraints on the Λ potential are demanded.

We will also report the analysis of $v_1$ for $\Lambda$ with various updates including the covariant collision term [5] and the hyperon-nucleon scattering cross section from up-to-date chiral EFT forces [6]. A consistent treatment of the $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ potentials based on chiral EFT will also be discussed.

Parallel session 25,parallel,Astrophysical Equation-of-State Constraints on the Color-Superconducting Gap,"Steinhorst, Rachel",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"We demonstrate that astrophysical constraints on the dense-matter equation of state place an upper bound on the color-superconducting gap in dense matter above the transition from nuclear matter to quark matter. Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817). At baryon number chemical potential $\mu = 2.6~\text{GeV}$ we find a 95% upper limit on the CFL pairing gap $\Delta$ of $457~\text{MeV}$ using overly conservative assumptions and 
$216~\text{MeV}$ with more reasonable assumptions.

Parallel session 25,parallel,Quark matter at four loops,"Paatelainen, Risto",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Completing the perturbative four-loop pressure of cold quark matter (QM) has been shown to significantly constrain the neutron-star-matter equation of state. Building on the milestone results in [1, 2], where all screened gluonic contributions to the QM pressure at this order were computed, the remaining challenge lies in evaluating the missing hard contributions arising from four-loop QCD vacuum diagrams at finite density. In this talk, we will present the latest progress in calculating these four-loop contributions [3], with a particular focus on the new algorithmic technique based on Loop Tree Duality (LTD), originally developed for perturbative computations in high-energy collider physics, which we recently generalized to finite density [4]. This novel approach tackles multiloop computations via direct numerical integration of entire Feynman diagrams, enabling the treatment of complex four-loop diagrams at finite density that were previously considered impossible to evaluate.

Parallel session 25,parallel,Listening to the long ringdown: a novel way to pinpoint the equation of state in neutron star cores,"Ecker, Christian",Goethe,Unknown,"Multimessenger signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are promising tools to infer the largely unknown properties of nuclear matter at densities that are presently inaccessible to laboratory experiments.
The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS).
In this talk I will present a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the “long ringdown”, and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores.
By applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, I will show a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christian', 'last_name': 'Ecker', 'fullName': 'Ecker, Christian', 'id': '9288978', 'affiliation': 'Goethe', 'emailHash': 'b8b179020045474ca0d6d7a5db8da145', 'db_id': 9288978, 'person_id': 8938456}"
Parallel session 9,parallel,The space of transport coefficients allowed by causality,"Heller, Michal",Ghent University,Unknown,"As an effective theory, relativistic hydrodynamics is fixed by symmetries up to a set of transport coefficients. A lot of effort has been devoted to explicit calculations of these coefficients. Here we adopt a more general approach, deploying bootstrap techniques to rule out theories that are inconsistent with microscopic causality. What remains is a universal convex geometry in the space of transport coefficients, which we call the hydrohedron. The landscape of all consistent theories necessarily lies inside or on the edges of the hydrohedron. We analytically construct cross-sections of the hydrohedron corresponding to bounds on transport coefficients that appear in sound and diffusion modes’ dispersion relations for theories without stochastic fluctuations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michal', 'last_name': 'Heller', 'fullName': 'Heller, Michal', 'id': '9288984', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c6a9b04f2032b5d725ba02dec761835d', 'db_id': 9288984, 'person_id': 8939076}"
Parallel session 21,parallel,EPJ Featured Talk: First direct measurement of radial flow in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Saha, Swati",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (NISER) (IN),India,"The observation of long-range correlations is a crucial indicator of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions and has been instrumental in establishing the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at RHIC and LHC. In this study, the first direct measurement of radial flow is presented using a new observable, $ v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T}) $, formulated to capture the long-range correlations in the transverse momentum $ p_{\rm T} $ spectrum. Unlike anisotropic flow coefficients $ v_{\rm n}(p_{\rm T}) $, which are influenced by both shear and bulk viscosity, $v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T}) $ is sensitive solely to the bulk properties of the QGP medium, making it a valuable probe for studying bulk viscosity and the hydrodynamic evolution of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions.

The measurement of $ v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T})$ is reported across various centrality classes for inclusive charged particles and identified particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector. To minimize short-range non-flow correlations, a rapidity gap technique similar to that used in anisotropic flow measurements is employed. At low $p_{\rm T}$, characteristic mass ordering, typically associated with collective flow in $v_{\rm n}(p_{\rm T})$, is observed. At higher $ p_{\rm T} $, where hydrodynamic descriptions fail, a baryon-meson splitting indicative of quark coalescence is observed. Measurements are compared with the hydrodynamic model MUSIC under varied initial conditions, as well as non-hydrodynamic models like HIJING and EPOS.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Swati', 'last_name': 'Saha', 'fullName': 'Saha, Swati', 'id': '9385539', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (NISER) (IN)', 'emailHash': 'eb001b2c53e8766c9291029bcfe856fa', 'db_id': 9385539, 'person_id': 8899579}"

The data collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS North Area allows for a comprehensive scan of the strangeness production across various collision energies and system sizes. 

This presentation will focus on the new results of the strangeness production in central collisions of medium-sized nuclei, such as Ar+Sc, at the SPS energy range. In particular, the results for Lambda hyperons and charged and neutral K mesons will be shown. The energy and system size dependencies of Lambda-to-pion and strangeness-to-pion ratios are also explored. Moreover, an unexpected excess of charged over neutral meson production in Ar+Sc and pi-+C interactions will be presented.

Parallel session 25,parallel,EPJ Featured Talk: Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics in accretion disks,"Kushwah, Khwahish","Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Unknown,"We generalize the relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory recently derived in Ref. [1] to describe the dissipative dynamics occurring in accretion disks in presence of large magnetic fields. For this purpose we consider a relativistic dilute gas composed of electrons and ions described by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and simplify it using the 14-moment approximation. This procedure leads to an extended version of the MHD theory traditionally employed in astrophysics simulations [2,3] which typically considers only the parallel component of the shear-stress tensor aligned with magnetic field, B. In our framework, we consider all three distinct, non-degenerate components of the shear-stress tensor relative to B, each governed by unique dynamical equations. We demonstrate that this novel framework exhibits oscillatory behavior in strong magnetic fields that cannot be captured by the conventional MHD formulation, similar to what was observed in Ref. [1]. We finally compare both frameworks in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In particular, we analyze the equations in conditions that lead to firehose instability [4], which is usually observed in simulation-based frameworks.
