,poster,Third-body Coulomb effect in pion correlation femtoscopy,"Kraeva, Anna",National Research Nuclear  University MEPhI (RU),UK,"The characteristics of the system created in collisions of heavy ions can be explored via spatial and temporal parameters obtained using the method of correlation femtoscopy. 
At low energies, the size of the particle emission region extracted from femtoscopic correlations is affected by the initial system isotopic spin and Coulomb interaction of the correlated particles with the residual electric charge.
Studies of such effects on the reaction dynamics can provide a clearer estimation of the temporal characteristics of the particle emission processes.

In this report, the results of the measurements of femtoscopic correlations will be presented for identical pions produced in Au+Au collisions at a high-baryon density regime using the UrQMD (Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics) model. The influence of the isospin and residual electric charge on the femtoscopic parameters is demonstrated, and the implementation in the experiments to evaluate the influence of effects is discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anna', 'last_name': 'Kraeva', 'fullName': 'Kraeva, Anna', 'id': '9536159', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear  University MEPhI (RU)', 'emailHash': '9091199e8b92639b495e911cb9d9260c', 'db_id': 9536159, 'person_id': 8930521}"
Parallel session 17,parallel,EPJ Featured Talk: The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations,"Parida, Tribhuban",IISER Berhampur,Unknown,"Event-by-event fluctuations of the transverse momentum per particle $[p_T]$ have been measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, but this topic has so far received less attention than anisotropic flow. Yet the physical mechanism is identical for both phenomena: A long-range correlation in the initial stages, followed by collective expansion. While the origin of anisotropic flow is a fluctuation in the shape of the fireball, that of $[p_T]$ fluctuations is a fluctuation in the initial temperature. It generates a fluctuation in the fluid velocity, which is carried over to the $p_T$ spectrum of outgoing particles. The same fluctuation is present at all rapidities and generates a long-range correlation. 

We make hydrodynamic predictions for the fluctuation of the spectrum, which is a new observable $v_0(p_T)$ introduced by Schenke, Shen and Teaney [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00690] which has not yet been measured, and for which first experimental results will hopefully be shown at this conference. Like anisotropic flow $v_n(p_T)$, $v_0(p_T)$ is predicted to have a strong mass ordering in the $p_T$ range where hydrodymamics applies. We show that our hydrodynamic calculation reproduces precisely the observed dependence of $[p_T]$ fluctuations on $p_T$ cuts which has previously been observed by PHENIX and ATLAS. We argue that the mechanism of quark coalescence should give rise to a splitting between the $v_0(p_T)$ of baryons and mesons at higher $p_T$, similar to that observed for anisotropic flow.

,poster,EPJA Featured Poster: How much angular momentum is stopped at midrapidity in collisions from O(1) to O(1000) GeV energies?,"Akridge, Zachary",Indiana University,USA,"The spin polarization of hadrons emitted from heavy-ion collisions can serve as a probe of the angular momentum contained within the colliding system. Recent measurements of hyperon global spin polarization at midrapidity from ALICE, STAR, and HADES, spanning a collisional beam energy range from O(1000) to O(1) GeV, have shown a monotonic trend of continually increasing signal with decreasing energy even in the region extremely close to the two-nucleon-mass threshold. This appears surprising, as the angular momentum stopped at midrapidity depends on two competing factors: with decreasing beam energy, the total angular momentum drops quickly while a bigger fraction of the total angular momentum gets stopped in midrapidity. As such, a non-monotonic dependence on beam energy is expected for midrapidity angular momentum, which should first increase with decreasing beam energy and then decrease, approaching zero when beam energy comes down to the threshold.
In this work, we present a quantitative model (dubbed “Glauber+”) of initial nucleon stopping based on general requirements of energy-momentum conservation in binary collisions. We further use measurements of midrapidity net proton numbers to constrain the key model parameter that characterizes the inelasticity of binary collisions. This allows us to predict the initial angular momentum at midrapidity across a wide range of beam energies, which indeed shows a non-monotonic behavior with a peak around 5 GeV. The discord in the beam energy dependence between initial angular momentum and the observed global spin polarization casts intriguing questions on conventional interpretations assuming a strong positive correlation between them, especially in the very low energy region. The corresponding rapidity distributions of initial angular momentum are also obtained across beam energies, which could provide valuable initial conditions for spin hydrodynamics simulations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Akridge', 'fullName': 'Akridge, Zachary', 'id': '9360896', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University', 'emailHash': 'bdb4e5c81f529fcbe01d558777b94839', 'db_id': 9360896, 'person_id': 8925230}"

Parallel session 35,parallel,Non-Fluctuational Signature of the QCD Critical Point,"Sogabe, Noriyuki",University of Illinois Chicago,USA,"We study the influence of the QCD critical point on the trajectories describing the evolution of the expanding fireball in heavy-ion collisions. We find that the lines of constant specific entropy (entropy per baryon) on the phase diagram are drawn towards a special point on the coexistence (first-order) line where the specific entropy reaches a maximum [1]. We study the interplay between this feature of the isentropic trajectories and the freezeout curve. If the critical point is located near the freezeout curve, a region inaccessible by isentropic expansion appears on the freezeout curve. This behavior of the isentropes could provide a novel, non-fluctuational signature of the critical point requiring significantly lower statistics than the fluctuational signatures.

Parallel session 23,parallel,Hadron Production in Au+Au Collisions from STAR Fixed-Target Experiment,"Li, Hongcan",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Hadrons have been suggested as sensitive probes for the medium properties of nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. A dense baryon-rich medium is formed during collisions at center-of-mass energies of a few-GeV. Since (anti-)strange hadrons and anti-protons are produced near or below the threshold, their phase space distribution and yield ratios may provide strong constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of high baryon density matter.



In this presentation, the recent results on $\pi^{\pm}$, $\rm{K}^{\pm}$($\rm{K}^0_S$), $\phi$, $p$($\overline{p}$), $\Lambda (\overline{\Lambda})$ and $\Xi^-(\overline{\Xi}^{+})$  production at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.0 - 7.7 GeV in Au + Au collisions with fixed-target mode from the STAR experiment will be presented. The transverse momentum spectra ($p_{\rm T}$), rapidity density distributions (dN/dy) and their yield ratios as a function of centrality and collision energy are able to provide unique information about QCD phase structure. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and dN/dy ratios of baryon to anti-baryon will provide important input to differentiate between hadron production via quark coalescence and hadronic scattering. Enhancement of baryon to meson ratio hints at an onset of deconfinement in this energy range. We will also explore the centrality dependence of hadron yields, and the evolution of the chemical and kinetic freeze-out temperature, baryon chemical potential and average radial expansion flow in the reported energy range, which can give insights on the EoS of the created medium. These results will be compared with those from higher collision energies and the physics implications will be studied by comparing to the model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hongcan', 'last_name': 'Li', 'fullName': 'Li, Hongcan', 'id': '9414324', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c37cf12f1fdb81e4de1d15b36249ff3e', 'db_id': 9414324, 'person_id': 9157265}"

,poster,Probing initial state effects in nuclear collisions via dijet and spectator neutron measurements with the ATLAS detector,"Hu, Qipeng",University of Science and Technology of China (CN),China,"The measurement of dijets in proton-lead collisions at the LHC provides unique possibilities for investigating both nuclear and nucleon initial state effects as a function of parton scattering kinematics. In particular, color fluctuation effects can significantly alter the average interaction strength of the proton, biasing the number of nucleon-nucleon interactions with the Pb nucleus and, therefore, the event activity. Both event activity and break-up neutrons, detected by Zero Degree Calorimeters, are common estimators used to assess the geometry of the p+Pb collision. This talk presents recent results obtained through the analysis of dijet events in $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 8.16$ TeV $p$+Pb data collected by ATLAS in 2016. ATLAS has measured the sensitivity of both forward transverse energy and zero-degree spectator neutron energy to changes in the Bjorken-$x$ of the parton extracted from the proton ($x_p$) in the hard-scattering. Both these estimators exhibit a systematic negative bias in events characterized by a high $x_p$, although the spectator neutron energy is found to be much less sensitive to these selections than the forward transverse energy. By measuring geometry estimators in well-separated regions of rapidity, this result can provide complementary constraints for color fluctuation modeling. Furthermore, the spectator neutron energy is a novel observable that is influenced by the number of wounded nucleons and the dynamics of nuclear evaporation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Qipeng', 'last_name': 'Hu', 'fullName': 'Hu, Qipeng', 'id': '9524347', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China (CN)', 'emailHash': '9af0ff76e7af9ee0a48a24b84d41f2ec', 'db_id': 9524347, 'person_id': 8922021}"

We investigate the formation of light nuclei and hypernuclei in the 
rapidly expanding nuclear matter after relativistic nucleus-nucleus 
collisions. The primary hadronization phase including the strangeness 
production is described with UrQMD model. It is demonstrated that the 
nucleation process can be explained within the statistical approach by 
applying the local equilibrium concept. We subdivide the expanding 
nuclear system into several parts (clusters) consisting of nucleons and 
hyperons which are close in the phase space. The production of nuclei 
takes place inside these clusters, and it can be described as their 
statistical decay in the coexistence region of the nuclear phase 
transition. The local chemical equilibrium concept explain consistently 
many experimental data which was not possible with the statistical 
models under assumption of global chemical equilibrium [1,2]. This model 
was also successfully applied to describe experimental data on both 
normal nuclei and strange hypernuclei production in the GSI and RHIC-BES 
energy range [3,4]. We predict the production of double hypernuclei up 
to $^4_{\Lambda \Lambda}$H and further intermediate mass nuclei up to 
$^8$Be for Au+Au central collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3 GeV, recently 
explored by the STAR experiments [4]. The production of charmed nuclei 
is discussed too. These new nuclei can be identified by the measurement 
of the correlated particles.

Parallel session 35,parallel,"The antiproton puzzle, QCD critical point, and fireball properties in heavy-ion collisions","Vovchenko, Volodymyr",University of Houston,Unknown,"We contrast the behavior of ordinary and factorial cumulants of proton number and point out that the latter has numerous advantages over the former, in particular with regards to the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions. The new RHIC BES-II data on factorial cumulants of protons is analyzed, indicating clear deviation of two- and three-particle proton correlations from the non-critical baseline at collision energies below 10 GeV. Multiple scenarios for this deviation are explored, including the possibility of critical fluctuations and the implications for the QCD phase diagram.

We also illustrate that the acceptance dependence of the appropriately scaled factorial cumulants, $\hat{C}_n/(\hat{C}_1)^n$, is flat if all correlations are driven by long-range correlations only, making it a clean probe of short-range correlations. Furthermore, global baryon conservation and volume fluctuations predict identical $\hat C_2/(\hat C_1)^2$ of proton and antiprotons at given collision energy. However, the analysis of RHIC BES-I data reveals a remarkably strong splitting between scaled factorial cumulants of protons and antiprotons, which is at odds with the expectation based on a single-fluid hydrodynamics picture. We argue that such a splitting indicates incomplete equilibration between stopped and produced matter, which can be further probed with upcoming high-statistics data from RHIC BES-II with extended acceptance coverage.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Volodymyr', 'last_name': 'Vovchenko', 'fullName': 'Vovchenko, Volodymyr', 'id': '9288828', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston', 'emailHash': 'aac727a4ed7f29c5f8821cc339003226', 'db_id': 9288828, 'person_id': 8877848}"
Parallel session 35,parallel,First order transition region of an equation of state for QCD with a critical point,"Karthein, Jamie",MIT,USA,"In addition to signals for the critical point, evidence for a first order phase transition would indicate a nontrivial structure within the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, while not a direct measurement of the critical point, the presence of a first order transition would imply its existence. This motivates the need to understand signatures of this first order transition in addition to directly studying the effect of a critical point. To this effect, we map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition [1]. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter. Thus, we describe the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which is useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to 3D Ising model ones available in the literature.

We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. The phase diagram is drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. 
Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we show that up to $\mu_B \approx 400$~MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range.

The equations of motion are strictly first order in time and have no non-hydrodynamic modes. The only fields are the energy and momentum densities $T^{0\mu}$ and the only parameters are the equilibrium equation state and the shear and bulk viscosities. We compare numerical results to QCD kinetic theory simulations for a set of one dimensional tests -- we find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics, and the simulation is well behaved outside of this regime. The results are compared to a second-order formulation developed by Bemfica, Disconzi,  Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) as well as to second-order hydrodynamics as implemented in MUSIC.

In the density frame we propose a strikingly simple algorithm to simulate stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on the Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. Then random (three) momentum transfers between fluid cells are proposed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as the Boltzmann weight. On average the algorithm reproduces viscous hydrodynamics in the density-frame. The algorithm can be generalized to general coordinates and space-time foliations by parallel transporting the proposed momentum transfers.

The solution of this equation sets the initial condition for a non-linear DGLAP-like evolution equation, which describes the collinear early vacuum cascade resolved by the medium at angles exceeding the medium resolution angle, $\theta_c$. For asymptotic jet energies, the medium-induced cascade displays an exponential behavior that generalizes the Poisson-like distribution of parton energy loss. This formulation enables the resummation of leading contributions in $\ln(1/R)$, and $\ln(R/\theta_c)$, and powers of $L$.

Such fluctuations can be modeled by including a stochastic source in the standard hydrodynamics equations. However, when this is done naively strange features can appear such as negative self-correlation functions [1–3]. We construct an effective theory for nonlinear stochastic relativistic hydrodynamics that ensure a well-posed mathematical formulation. Using Crooks fluctuation theorem [4], we derive a symmetry of the effective action that incorporates fluctuations through a suitable free energy functional [5]. For divergence type theories [6], the action can then be fully specified using a single vector generating current. This generating current is related to the free energy, which allows for a systematic understanding the stability properties of the system. The equations of motion obtained using this procedure are guaranteed to be flux conservative and symmetric hyperbolic. This ensures that these equations are well-posed (for suitable initial data) and are in a form that can easily be simulated, including with Metropolis techniques [7].

Parallel session 34,parallel,Nuclear suppression in diffractive vector meson production within the color glass condensate framework,"Roch, Hendrik",Wayne State University,Unknown,"Diffractive vector meson production is a golden channel in the search for gluon saturation. The color glass condensate (CGC) framework has been successfully applied to describe diffractive vector meson production in $e+p$ collisions at HERA. Predictions for $\gamma+Pb$ collisions realized in ultraperipheral collisions at the LHC are however overestimating the experimental data at large center of mass energy, implying that the calculated saturation effects are not strong enough to describe the nuclear suppression. In this work we perform a combined Bayesian analysis of $J/\psi$ production data from both $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+Pb$ collisions within the CGC framework based on an impact parameter dependent McLerran-Venugopalan model combined with JIMWLK evolution to describe the center of mass energy dependence.

Differential measurements of photon-induced $J/\psi$ production provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations.   The linear polarization of photons involved in these processes enables imaging of the nucleus via spin interference effect in vector meson photoproduction, which  can be quantified by measuring the azimuthal angular modulation between the $J/\psi$ momentum and its decay daughters' momenta.  Moreover,  the decay daughters of these vector mesons inherit polarization of the photons, which could be used to access the initial collision geometry.  Thus, measurement of differential cross sections of J/$\psi$ photoproduction and the azimuthal anisotropy of their decay daughters offer a novel and direct probe into both the gluonic structure and the initial collision geometry.
 
 In this contribution, we will present the diﬀerential cross sections of photon-induced coherent $J/\psi$  in  Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These cross-section measurements will also be compared with existing d+Au and Au+Au data to investigate system size dependencies.

We calculate cross sections for single and any number of n, p, $\alpha$, $\gamma$ in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision for LHC energies emitted in forward/backward directions. We analyze the production of a given number of neutrons relevant for a recent ALICE experiment [1] using zero degree calorimeters, for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. In our approach, we include both single and multiple photon exchanges as well as the fact that not all photon energies are used in the process of equilibration of the residual nucleus. We propose a simple two-component model in which $E_{exc} \neq E_{\gamma}$ and compare its results with the results of HIPSE and EMPIRE codes. We discuss the role of preequilibrium and equilibrium processes. In addition we analyze the role of scattering of high-energy photons for small neutron multiplicities. Emission of the small number of neutrons at high (virtual) photon energies ($E_{\gamma} >$ 1 GeV) seems to be crucial to understand the new ALICE data. All effects work in the desired direction, but the description of the cross section for four- and five-neutron emission is rather difficult. Several open issues will be discussed.

In this work, we go one step further and perform a global Bayesian analysis of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb data at the LHC varying simultaneously the shapes of Xe, Pb and relevant Trajectum model parameters. This allows us to systematically assess the sensitivity of observables or ratio of observables to the shape of both Pb (in particular its neutron skin) and Xe (in particular $\beta_2$, its octupole $\beta_3$, $\gamma$ and its skin). Our Bayesian extractions lead to a picture for the ground states of these nuclei that is in remarkable agreement with complementary results using methods in low-energy nuclear structure physics.

For instance, central collisions of near-spherical Au nuclei create a QGP with a fixed, circular geometry, whereas prolate-shaped uranium nuclei can collide in a variety of orientations, producing QGP droplets of diverse shapes and sizes. Hence, by comparing systems with similar mass numbers, such as $^{238}$U and $^{197}$Au, we can map out their shape differences and gain deeper insights into the initial conditions of heavy ion collisions.

By numerically solving the JIMWLK equation on an event-by-event basis, we obtain the energy (Bjorken-$x$) dependent structure of the colliding nuclei. This enables us to predict how the initial state evolves when moving from RHIC to LHC energies. [1]

Previously, the energy dependence in IP-Glasma was introduced through a Bjorken-$x$ dependent saturation scale extracted from fits to DIS structure data. In contrast, in our work we move beyond this parametrized approximation by providing a method to directly calculate the energy dependence. The energy-dependent initial state description is then coupled to relativistic hydrodynamics in the quark-gluon plasma phase and to the UrQMD hadronic afterburner, enabling us to simulate the full space-time evolution in heavy ion collisions. We demonstrate that incorporating the JIMWLK evolution significantly affects various flow observables.

The JIMWLK evolution applied in this work is constrained by the available $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production data from HERA and from Ultra Peripheral Collisions at the LHC [2]. In addition to the JIMWLK-evolved initial state description, we determine an effective energy-dependent parametrization describing the energy-dependent nucleon structure, which can approximate the effect of JIMWLK evolution in IP-Glasma, enabling faster simulations.

I will also discuss pA collisions using an advanced nuclear model with individual quark hot spots focusing on rapidity-dependent factorization breakdown and event plane fluctuations.

In particular, the initial stages influence the emission spectrum of hard partons traversing the plasma. Such calculations require the knowledge of the momentum-broadening kernel $C$, which describes the probability of a jet parton receiving a momentum kick. While it is often employed in a harmonic approximation using the jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, in this talk, I will present our results for the kernel $C$ from QCD kinetic theory beyond this approximation. We show that the kernel is consistent with previous extractions of $\hat q$ and find that it is highly anisotropic at early times and that small-momentum exchange processes are more likely than expected from a Landau-matched thermal system. Our results may lead to a better description of jet quenching during the initial stages, which can be particularly significant for the ongoing and upcoming light-ion collision programs.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Lindenbauer', 'fullName': 'Lindenbauer, Florian', 'id': '9288701', 'affiliation': 'TU Wien', 'emailHash': '6f56c18325322a7029f9290f37c89bd4', 'db_id': 9288701, 'person_id': 8882881}"
Parallel session 4,parallel,Monte Carlo EKRT event generator for initializing 3+1 D fluid dynamics in high energy nuclear collisions,"Niemi, Harri",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We present a novel Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model, MC-EKRT, for computing partonic initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions [1]. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and RHIC energies [2,3]. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, includes dynamical minijet-multiplicity fluctuations in the saturation and particle production, introduces a new type of spatially dependent fluctuating nuclear parton distribution functions, and accounts for the conservation of energy/momentum and valence-quark number. We show, by averaging a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions for 3+1 dimensional hydrodynamical evolution, that we obtain a good agreement with the rapidity-dependent multiplicity and elliptic flow data for LHC Pb+Pb and RHIC 200 GeV Au+Au collisions. This suggests that the same saturation mechanism that has successfully explained the mid-rapidity observables, works well also at larger rapidities. As a further application of MC-EKRT, we also study event-by-event fluctuations and decorrelations of initial eccentricities.

Recently, heavy-ion collisions have demonstrated their potential as an imaging tool for nuclear structure by examining anisotropic flow and its correlations with the mean transverse momentum. Hints of a triaxial structure in $^{129}$Xe have been found experimentally and theoretically using these methods; however, these studies were limited to exploring the first moment of the $\gamma$ distribution and could not distinguish between a rigid rotor and $\gamma$-soft nuclei. 

In this talk, a comprehensive study of the quadrupole deformation, nuclear diffuseness, and triaxial structure of $^{129}$Xe is presented through investigations of various anisotropic flow and mean transverse momentum observables. Additionally, the $\gamma$-soft structure of the $^{129}$Xe nuclei is investigated experimentally for the first time in heavy-ion collisions using a novel six-particle normalized cumulant, $ NC(v_2^4, \delta p_{\rm T}^2) $, which correlates the fourth moment of the elliptic flow, $ v_2^4$, with the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, $ \delta p_{\rm T}^2 $. This correlation is measured in Xe–Xe collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.44$ TeV  against the baseline of spherical Pb nuclei in Pb–Pb collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the ALICE experiment at the LHC.

However, the fluid nature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) gives rise to short-range correlations stemming from hydrodynamic fluctuations. These correlations, driven by fluctuation-dissipation relations near local equilibrium, provide key insights into the transport properties of the QGP and can become particularly significant in the vicinity of the QCD critical region.

In this talk, we present a theoretical framework for calculating two-particle correlations of charged hadrons. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we first derive an evolution equation for four-point functions of fields in complex scalar field theory. This equation can be interpreted using the Boltzmann-Langevin Equation (BLE), which  predicts the two-particle correlations in momentum space amongst the charges of a conducting fluid.

Parallel session 32,parallel,Tilted emitting source in the heavy-ion collisions,"Lisa, Michael",Unknown,Unknown,"The three-dimensional structure of the initial state in heavy-ion collisions have become important topic of interest in the community, since it provides insights into the origins of anisotropic flow, the breaking of boost invariance, longitudinal de-correlation, and particle correlations observed after kinetic freeze-out. One of the important properties of the 3D initial state is the tilt of the particle-emitting source away from the beam direction—a phenomenon particularly pronounced at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This tilt, rooted in the initial collision geometry’s three-dimensional structure, is relevant for understanding phenomena such as directed flow and particle polarization. However, a direct extraction of tilt from such measurements remains challenging.

By employing azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT), we explore the relationship between the tilt parameter measured experimentally and the predicted tilt of freeze-out coordinates from UrQMD model  [1]. This approach allows us to investigate the tilt of the pion-emitting source in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.5, and 27 GeV using asHBT techniques. 

While tilt might naively be expected to correlate strongly only with collision centrality, our findings indicate a more pronounced dependence on the momentum of particle pairs. This momentum dependence invites a reevaluation of directed flow: rather than attributing it to a uniform tilt of the emission source, we propose that distinct regions of homogeneity with varying orientations may underlie these observations.

Our approach offers a framework that the STAR experiment can employ to perform a precision extraction of tilt using the high-statistics BES-II data—measurements of which are currently underway and whose prospects we discuss here. By accurately determining tilt angles across different particle types and momenta, we aim to provide a more precise description of directed flow across species and momenta. This method offers a potentially clearer and more detailed framework for understanding directed flow and other phenomena influenced by the three-dimensional initial state.

Recent hydrodynamic model studies suggest that event-wise mean transverse momentum ($[p_\mathrm{T}]$) is sensitive to the overlap area, and that fluctuations in nuclear overlap size (geometric component) can be distinguished from other sources (intrinsic component) using higher-order moments of the $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ distribution.

This talk presents precise ATLAS measurements of the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions, highlighting distinct patterns in ultra-central collisions due to suppression of the geometric component as the overlap area reaches its maximum.New measurements exploring the dependence of these observables on momentum and pseudorapidity ranges are also presented.

Data on this interaction are scarce, solely based on scattering experiments. Since data points are only available at rather high relative momenta and their uncertainties are sizeable, theory calculations are not well constrained. Particularly the characteristics of the interaction in the triplet channel spin configuration are highly uncertain, and it is not yet clear if the interaction in this channel is attractive or repulsive. In this regard, two-particle intensity interferometry (femtoscopy) of $\Sigma$ baryons and nucleons can provide valuable information. 
The reconstruction of the weak decay of $\Sigma^+$ baryons is very challenging. Its decay into a proton and a neutral pion via the weak interaction has a branching ratio of around 50%, with the neutral pion decaying electromagnetically almost exclusively into two photons. In this talk, a novel reconstruction method will be shown which makes use of sophisticated reconstruction algorithms and machine learning techniques to improve the reconstruction efficiency and purity of the $\Sigma^+$ baryons, enabling the measurement of their correlation function with protons for the first time. The obtained correlation function will be discussed and related to latest theoretical calculations using Chiral Effective Field Theories, providing new constraints on the $\Sigma$–nucleon interaction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Benedict', 'last_name': 'Heybeck', 'fullName': 'Heybeck, Benedict', 'id': '9385534', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt (DE)', 'emailHash': '60851502a9f498bb56690c4692eb77ba', 'db_id': 9385534, 'person_id': 9129371}"

In particular, we perform fully 3D multi-stage simulations including rapidity-dependent energy deposition with global energy conservation, along with relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and a hadronic afterburner [1]. We calibrate on rapidity- and pT-differential observables–examining the respective constraints on initial state and transport properties–and highlight the tension between them within our model. We quantify the additional constraints provided by rapidity dependent measurements and we emphasize the similarity in posteriors from separate calibrations of large and small systems. We use our calibrated model to make predictions of observables in additional smaller systems in $p$-Au and $^3$He-Au, as well as statistically-sensitive or proposed measurements in the calibrated systems. Furthermore, we predict longitudinal de-correlations, highlighting the dependence of flow measurements on the rapidity of the regions of interest and reference.

This paradox raises an intriguing question: How can a medium that exhibits hydrodynamic-like behavior and substantially modifies the distribution of final-state hadrons have little to no effect on high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles? To explore this, we present a comprehensive analysis of differential Fourier coefficients ($v_{n}$) as a function of particle transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) and event multiplicity in pp and pPb collisions, recorded by CMS at 13 TeV and 8.16 TeV, respectively. In particular, first measurements of $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential multiparticle cumulants using the subevent method are reported, probing an extended phase space region up to high $p_\mathrm{T}$ values.

The Fourier coefficients in the expansion of particle azimuthal distribution describe the collective response of the medium to the shape of the initial collision geometry, 
and are sensitive to the equation of state (EOS). A non-monotonic slope in the first-order flow coefficient $v_1$ (directed flow) is proposed as a potential signature of a first-order phase transition between the QGP and hadronic phase. The second-order coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow) exhibits NCQ scaling at top RHIC and LHC energies, reflecting partonic collectivity, but this scaling vanishes at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3$ GeV. The third-order coefficient $v_3$ (triangular flow) is typically driven by initial-state fluctuations and is uncorrelated with the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies reveal a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\Psi_{1}$), attributed to collision geometry and the potential in the responsive medium.\\

Parallel session 16,parallel,Initial momentum and conserved charges to final flow,"William Luzum, Matthew",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor, as well initial conserved charge densities. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations
 of large and small systems. 
 With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.

In very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken.  Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.

In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. In the second, correlations are measured between particles within jets and charged particles from the underlying event. In $pp$ collisions, excluding jet-associated particles does not affect the ridge, and no significant azimuthal correlations are found between jet-associated particles and the underlying event, ruling out hard-process contributions to the $pp$ ridge. New measurements extending this analysis to $p$+Pb collisions are also presented. Prior $p$+Pb flow measurements have indicated a small but significant high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ $v_2$ up to a $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of 50 GeV. This is in contrast to suppression measurements which indicate no clear suppression of high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadrons.

In this contribution, we discuss the essential steps towards investigating such soft dileptons.

We focus on dileptons with invariant masses large enough that they are produced through quark-antiquark annihilation in the early stages of the collision. The angular distribution of the lepton in the rest frame of the pair then reflects the angular distribution of quark momenta. At early times, the transverse pressure of the quark-gluon plasma is larger than its longitudinal pressure as a result of the fast longitudinal expansion, which results in an oblate lepton distribution. By contrast, direct (Drell-Yan) production by quarks and antiquarks from incoming nuclei, whose momenta are essentially longitudinal, results in a prolate distribution. As the invariant mass increases, Drell-Yan gradually becomes the dominant source of dilepton production, and the lepton distribution evolves from oblate to prolate. The invariant mass at which the transition occurs is highly sensitive to the equilibration time of the quark-gluon plasma or, equivalently, the shear viscosity over entropy ratio %\eta/s% in the early stages of the collision.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maurice', 'last_name': 'Coquet', 'fullName': 'Coquet, Maurice', 'id': '9288739', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR)', 'emailHash': 'f3efe6834dfd958b57b1c7f7f1a96d8d', 'db_id': 9288739, 'person_id': 8885871}"

The Z boson has a very short lifetime and can decay to dimuon final states that can be precisely measured. These properties make it a valuable tool for studying the initial state of heavy ion collisions. It has been proposed that the momentum of muons resulting from a Z decay, and therefore the experimentally observed mass and width of the Z boson, may be modified by the presence of the immense initial-state electromagnetic fields that are thought to be created in heavy ion collisions. Using the CMS experiment, we report the first search for a modification of the observed Z boson mass and width in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ TeV relative to those observed in pp collisions. In addition, measurements of Z boson yields and azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, will be discussed. The centrality and rapidity dependence of the measurements are compared to theoretical models. Taken together, these measurements provide new insights into the role of initial electromagnetic fields, nuclear parton distribution functions, and initial-state geometry in heavy ion collisions. The production of top quarks in heavy ion collisions serves as a novel tool for investigating nuclear parton distribution functions at high Bjorken-x. Although being a quark, the top has a short lifetime, decaying predominantly to a W boson and b quark pair, before hadronizing. Leptonic final states from the subsequent W boson decay are thus effectively electroweak probes of the medium they traverse before reaching the detector.

Several facilities including the Schwer-Ionen Synchrotron (SIS), the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have potential to probe low energy dilepton signals in ongoing and future experiments.
In this contribution, we present our recently published study on the electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter. We implement the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, hadronic many-body theory is utilized to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. Vertex corrections are then introduced to maintain gauge invariance. In particular, we examine the transport peak and electric conductivity along a proposed phase transition line, and under conditions comparable to those expected in future heavy-ion experiments. We compare the transport properties for hadronic matter and a pion gas, in order to examine the individual contributions of various particles to the electric conductivity. In addition, we calculate the transport peak along a proposed phase transition line, and find that the electric conductivity shows a decreasing tendency from high to low collision energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joseph', 'last_name': 'Atchison', 'fullName': 'Atchison, Joseph', 'id': '9288614', 'affiliation': 'Abilene Christian University', 'emailHash': '30cedb9e93b85dd9cc9e717f610d97a0', 'db_id': 9288614, 'person_id': 8809055}"

In this work, we propose a dynamic approach to fluidizing hadrons in state-of-the-art evolutions of intermediate beam energy HICs, based on the local energy density. This provides a natural core-corona separation, in contrast to commonly employed initalizations based on a constant proper time.

This generalisation of the results of Refs. [1,2] shows that each splitting in an in-medium parton shower experiences colour decoherence in a different fashion. In addition, the total rate of emissions is enhanced with respect to previous calculations. This result has important implications for the experimental quest of determining medium modifications to parton evolution, as well as in the formulation of in-medium parton showers.

They have the potential to provide unprecedented insight on the interplay between vacuum scales inside of a jet and its medium modification.

We demonstrate how these correlators open up important new avenues in phenomenology.

For the first time in PbPb collisions, the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons relative to $Z$ bosons are measured in bins of charged hadron $p_\mathrm{T}$ to search for in-medium parton shower modifications and medium recoil effects. The analysis focuses on events containing at least one $Z$ boson with $40 < p_\mathrm{T} < 350$ GeV. A significant modification in the azimuthal angle and pseudorapidity distributions for charged hadrons in the low $p_\mathrm{T}$ range, around 1 to 2 GeV, is observed compared to reference measurements from pp collisions. The results are consistent with expectations from phenomenological models, including medium recoil and the medium response to hard probes traversing the quark-gluon plasma.

Similar to the energy-energy correlator (EE) in jets where perturbative and non-perturbative regimes are separated, by studying analogous correlation in the full event, one can unravel potential larger-scale structures that may arise from the interaction of high-energy recoiling particles with the quark-gluon plasma.

In the measured ensemble, particles oriented in the direction in which the medium is shorter are over-represented as compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the elliptic anisotropy for jets, obtaining quantitative agreement with available experimental data.

Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. The ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations is determined by the physics of color coherence. We find that jet $v_2$ has a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of the critical angle $\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, we show that the relative size of jet $v_2$ for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follows a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to experimentally reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter. To this end, precise jet measurements from sPHENIX will be determinant as one explores larger values of $\theta_c$ in AuAu collisions.

On one hand, the quenching effect, often quantified through the nuclear modification factor (e.g., $R_{AA}$), is well established in large collision systems, such as Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions. On the other hand, it is absent in smaller p+A collisions despite the observation of collectivity in these collisions, either because the medium is not formed, or its temperature or lifetime is too low to cause jets to lose much energy. This highlights the need for studying the system size dependence of the jet quenching phenomenon. And O+O collisions provide a great opportunity for such studies as they bridge the gap between these small and large systems.

In this talk, we present the first measurements of the following three observables related to the jet quenching: inclusive charged hadron $R_{AA}$ at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$), inclusive jet $R_{cp}$, and semi-inclusive hadron+jet $I_{cp}$, using O+O collisions data collected with the STAR detector in 2021 at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. For jet measurements, combinatorial background is subtracted based on the event mixing technique, while background fluctuations and detector effects are corrected via unfolding.

Parallel session 14,parallel,Measurement of flavor effects in charm-induced jet showers at the perturbative/non-perturbative boundary with ALICE,"Dhankher, Preeti",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"Jet substructure provides precise tests of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and offers more differential ways to study hadronization mechanisms, compared to measurements of single hadrons. QCD predicts that jet radiation patterns depend on the mass and color charge of the initiating parton. Parton showers, in particular, are sensitive to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, as well as to the mass of partons through the dead-cone effect.

In this talk we present three key charm-tagged jet measurements, using jets tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D^{0}}$-meson. The first are measurements of the differences between three different axis definitions inside the jets. These different definitions vary in their sensitivity to wide-angle soft radiation and systematically probe the radiation pattern off of charm quarks. Next are the jet angularities, which characterise the weighted angular distribution of the jet constituents. These powerful observables probe the parton shower, with sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects that can be tuned by adjusting the importance of wide-angle radiation. Finally, we present the first measurement of the energy-energy correlator for $\rm{D^{0}}$-meson tagged jets. This observable is defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs within jets and reveals the detailed structure of QCD radiation from heavy quarks, allowing for a distinction between perturbative and non-perturbative effects in charm showers. Comparisons of all these results to measurements of dominantly gluon-initiated jets, as well as to various event generators, are sensitive to flavor-dependent effects in both the parton shower and hadronization mechanisms. Moreover, comparisons with next-to-leading order calculations emphasize the need for improved theoretical modelling of heavy-quark jets and provide critical insights into the parton-to-hadron transition in QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Preeti', 'last_name': 'Dhankher', 'fullName': 'Dhankher, Preeti', 'id': '9385577', 'affiliation': 'University of California Berkeley (US)', 'emailHash': '184c051c94f8207fefa81704e7c391a9', 'db_id': 9385577, 'person_id': 9129392}"

Using novel tracing methods, splittings of charm quarks are isolated to measure fundamental properties such as the dead-cone effect and the charm-quark splitting function. By using the new high statistics data samples of Run 3, we present new measurements of the dead-cone effect and splitting function of charm quarks, differentially in the energy of the emitter, through measurements of jets tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. At the low energies uniquely accessible to the ALICE experiment, comparisons of these measurements to an inclusive-jet baseline probe the evolution of the dead-cone of charm quarks with unprecedented accuracy. With increasing energy of the emitting charm quark, the dead-cone angle is predicted to get smaller, allowing for the isolation of the impact of Casimir colour factors. Such differential measurements in the charm sector not only illuminate the role of mass and Casimir colour factors when compared to inclusive jets, but also provide a lower mass heavy quark-enriched sample which is crucial for comparisons to measurements in the beauty sector, in order to isolate the mass dependence of the dead-cone effect.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nima', 'last_name': 'Zardoshti', 'fullName': 'Zardoshti, Nima', 'id': '9385579', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '70b5b1e46f746f7d89856f34404d2890', 'db_id': 9385579, 'person_id': 9129393}"
Parallel session 14,parallel,Color Coherence on Recoils,"Pablos, Daniel","IGFAE, USC",Unknown,"In the last years, it has become clearer that recoiling particles originated due to elastic scatterings between the energetic partons within a jet and the medium constituents within the QGP are of great importance for jet quenching phenomenology. Current implementations in state-of-the-art models consider that the elastic scattering process takes place between an on-shell energetic parton and the medium constituent. Crucially, however, highly energetic partons produced during jet evolution cannot be considered in general as on-shell states coming from infinity, and their correct description is in terms of a collection of color correlated dipoles. In this talk we present the first computation of the properties of the soft recoils produced as a result of perturbative elastic scatterings between a color coherent dipole and a quark medium constituent.

Our findings [1] indicate that the angular phase space of these soft recoiling quarks is tightly constrained by the opening angle of the color coherent dipole, owing to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we provide the first estimate of the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics.

This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake.

For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy quarks, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. Comparisons between the suppression observed in the inclusive sample of jets with the suppression of b-tagged jets and jets produced at forward rapidity (quark enhances sample of jets) are needed to understand the impact of parton mass and parton flavor on energy loss. Tagging of the $b$-jets is achieved using neural networks trained on Monte Carlo simulation samples and validated in a data-driven way with an independent approach involving the detection of muons from semileptonic decays of B-hadrons. A detailed quantification of the differences between the $b$-jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and the inclusive jet $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is also provided, together with comparisons to theory.

These interactions modify the internal structure of jets, making jet substructure an invaluable tool for probing the microscopic properties of the QGP. N-point Energy Correlators, defined as energy-weighted N-particle correlations inside jets, have emerged as a novel substructure observable in proton-proton collisions, where they show a clear separation of perturbative and non-perturbative effects. Recent measurements in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions show striking modifications of the Energy-Energy Correlators (EECs) compared to vacuum QCD baselines.

In this talk we present a measurement of the EECs in Pb-Pb collisions, presenting results at low jet transverse momentum for the first time. Such a measurement is essential in mapping jet modification across different kinematic regimes in the QGP. In addition we present the first measurements of the 3-point Energy Correlator in Pb-Pb collisions, along with their ratios to the EECs.

In pp collisions, the angular dependence of the EEC cross section shows a distinct separation of the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes, revealing the partonic dynamics of jet formation and the confinement of partons into hadrons. There have been an increasing number of theoretical studies predicting how the presence of a medium modifies the EECs with respect to the vacuum case. In this talk, we present measurements of the EECs for inclusive jets in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV.

In this talk, we will show that jets retain a memory of their original distribution before losing energy, allowing us to define a new EEC-based observable that corrects for the leading-order effects of this selection bias while keeping sensitivity to other medium effects.

Parallel session 5,parallel,Imaging the Jet-Induced Medium Response with Energy Correlators,"Kudinoor, Arjun Srinivasan",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"In heavy-ion collisions, jets formed from hard-scattered partons experience an overall energy loss and have a modified internal structure compared to vacuum jets. These modifications are a result of the interactions between the energetic partons in a jet shower and the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). As the jet traverses the QGP, it loses momentum to the medium, which in turn responds to the presence of the jet. This “medium response” modifies the momentum distribution of the (soft) hadrons produced when the QGP freezes out. Since these hadrons carry the momentum lost by the parton shower, they and the modified shower both contribute to the energy flow in jets. The quantitative description of the medium response is an open question under active investigation. Recently, the projected N-point energy correlators (ENCs) have seen a resurgence of interest to probe vacuum QCD. For the first time [1], we will present a computation of the full three point energy-energy-energy correlation function in heavy-ion collisions and demonstrate its use for studying the shape of the energy flow originating from medium response. For this study, we utilize the Hybrid Model that implements a hydrodynamical medium response via the wake. We will show that measuring three-point correlation functions offer a promising experimental avenue for imaging the wake of the jet as when the three angles are well-separated the three-point correlator is dominated by the medium response.

These interactions allow for the study of various photon-induced processes at high energies. The products of exclusive UPC interactions are typically characterized by very low transverse momenta products, which present several challenges to efficiently select with a trigger. In Run 3, the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) FastOR trigger provided a novel tool to trigger on these processes at Level 1. The TRT trigger was, for the first time, adapted for use in heavy-ion collisions, allowing it to trigger on low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles ($p_\mathrm{T} > 200$ MeV), including muons from coherent J/Psi decays. Another feature of many UPC collisions is single-sided nuclear breakup or multiple photon exchange, which causes one or both of the colliding ions to emit forward neutrons.  
The Zero-Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) detects these neutrons and provides a fully digital trigger. This tool allows for triggering on many distinct neutron topologies within the Level 1 system. In Run 4, the new joint ATLAS-CMS HL-ZDC will be installed, providing similar triggering capabilities in the more challenging environment of the HL-LHC.

Heavy-ion collisions offer a unique opportunity to search for signatures of such a critical point by analyzing event-by-event fluctuations in particle multiplicities. To draw meaningful conclusions from experimental data, a theoretical framework is needed to link QCD thermodynamics with the particle spectra and correlations observed in detectors. The unknown Equation of State (EoS) of QCD near a critical point can be related to the universal Gibbs free energy of the 3D Ising model using four non-universal mapping parameters whose values are determined by the microscopic details of QCD.

Such a critical point is increasingly predicted to be located in the high baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) region around $\mu_B$ = 500 - 650 MeV [3–8]. In 2018, the STAR Experiment started collecting data in a fixed-target configuration in order to map the high baryon chemical potential region of the phase diagram ($\mu_B$ = 420 - 720 MeV). Critical fluctuations may be observed by measuring various orders of cumulants, $C_n$, of the distributions of baryon number. The collision-energy dependence of net-proton $C_4$/$C_2$ from STAR’s measurements in Beam Energy Scan I hinted at a possible non-monotonic deviation from the non-critical baseline in Au+Au collisions from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 19.6 GeV, and the first published result from the fixed-target program, in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV is consistent with the non-critical baseline [9–13].

However, the connection between higher-order baryon number cumulants calculated in equilibrium QCD thermodynamics and higher-order net proton number cumulants may not be straightforward. Moreover, correlations between conserved net baryon number and net strangeness number have been suggested as sensitive probes for detecting changes in the degrees of freedom that carry strangeness at low temperatures (hadrons) and high temperatures (quarks) [1]. A non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model can explain baryon-strangeness correlations calculated in QCD at low temperatures and small chemical potentials, especially when additional strange hadrons are included (QMHRG2020).
In this presentation, we will show the ratio of first-order to second-order baryon number fluctuations and compare them with the RHIC BES-II results for proton number fluctuations. We will argue that a simple non-interacting HRG model cannot explain the RHIC BES-II results at higher densities, particularly at lower beam energies. Additionally, we will compare higher-order baryon number fluctuations with lattice QCD results and argue that these results rule out the possibility of a QCD critical point in the BES-II collider mode. We will also discuss the potential influence of corrections arising from global charge conservation in heavy-ion collisions [2].

Parallel session 30,parallel,Locating the QCD critical point from first principles through contours of constant entropy density,"Shah, Hitansh",University of Houston,Unknown,"We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively, at expansion order $\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^2)$ [1]. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.

Parallel session 30,parallel,Universal scaling near the chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Mitra, Sabarnya",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"The chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD is expected to be of second order if the breaking of axial anomaly remains sufficiently strong at the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ [1]. This is supported by lattice QCD calculations [2]. However, FRG model calculations suggest that the scaling window, in which universal scaling relations hold, may be small [3]. Furthermore, whether or not the $U_A(1)$ symmetry gets effectively restored at $T_c$ remains to be controversial. This suggest that a more detailed analysis of universal critical behavior close to $T_c$ , as well as a direct determination of the relevant universality class for the chiral phase transition [1,4] in (2+1)-flavor QCD are needed.

In this talk we present new results from a study of the scaling behavior
of an improved order parameter $M = M_\ell - H \chi_\ell$ for chiral symmetry restoration in the light 2-flavor sector of (2+1)-flavor QCD. Here $M_\ell$ and $\chi_\ell$ are multiplicatively renormalized light quark chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility, respectively. Furthermore, $H = m_l/m_s$ is the light-to-strange quark mass ratio.

We construct ratios of $M$ for two different values of the light quark mass, $m_l$ (or $H$ equivalently), and $T$ close to $T_c$ . In the scaling region we find a unique intersection point for these ratios at $T=T_c$, which allows us to determine $T_c$ and the underlying universality class of the chiral phase transition, from the knowledge of critical exponent $\delta$.

The approach followed here will allow to further constrain the influence of axial anomaly on universal critical behavior in (2+1)-flavor QCD. It also provides a new way of determining the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ , which strengthens the upper bound on the temperature range within which a critical end point in QCD for non-vanishing values of  chemical potential can possibly be found in heavy ion experiments.

In this regime, the net-baryon number cumulants computed  using the HRG and lattice QCD partition functions are in good agreement up to third order. However, starting with the fourth-order cumulants, the LQCD results are significantly lower than the corresponding HRG results. This offers a unique opportunity to experimentally verify the full QCD partition function by measuring the fourth-order cumulants of the net-proton number distributions.

In this talk, ALICE data for net-proton number cumulants up to sixth order in proton-proton collisions at top LHC energy are presented to search for effects of a possible chiral phase transition in this small system.

In ultra-central collisions, the QGP volume saturates and remains constant; instead, entropy fluctuations cause temperature variations in the system. This property can be probed by measuring the correlation between the average transverse momentum (⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩) and the multiplicity of charged hadrons. This contribution shows the latest ALICE measurements
of charged-hadron ⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩ and its higher-order cumulants in ultra-central Pb–Pb collisions. Results are in close agreement with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, by fitting the relative increase of ⟨$p_{\rm T}$⟩ to the relative change in the average charged-particle density at midrapidity, it is possible to extract the speed of sound ($c_s$) in the QGP, which indicates how fast compression waves propagate through the QGP medium. The extracted cs shows a strong dependence on the choice of the centrality estimators used to select ultra-central collisions, highlighting the sensitivity of this measurement to experimental biases. This observation suggests a need for careful reassessment of methods for determining cs from heavy-ion data. The measurements are compared with predictions from state-of-the-art models in ultra-central events.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Omar', 'last_name': 'Vazquez Rueda', 'fullName': 'Vazquez Rueda, Omar', 'id': '9385569', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston (US)', 'emailHash': '0c62b8f5f93358d94035814c5373af75', 'db_id': 9385569, 'person_id': 8937365}"

In this region, the heavy-ion collision systems will undergo a first-order phase transition. This phase transition is expected to proceed via spinodal decomposition as the system explores the metastable and unstable areas of the equation of state. To conclusively claim the discovery of the first-order phase transition curve, it is crucial to include spinodal effects in phenomenological simulations of these collisions and identify their experimental signatures. For the first time, we present a covariant formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics including spinodal decomposition [1]. These equations account for surface effects between the two phases and can be used in hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions. We solve them for a nearly boost invariant flow and discuss the effects of phase separation on system evolution.

There are significant discussions in the field about the initial conditions, including the colliding energy and the size of the system, needed to generate a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). It is expected that the threshold can be revealed by the measurements of the colliding energy and system size dependence of baryon-to-meson enhancement. Recent datasets collected by STAR in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, 17.3 and 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan II program and in different collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV (d+Au, Au+Au, O+O, Zr+Zr, Ru+Ru) provide us a chance to look into the $\Omega$/$\phi$ ratios and possibly locate the threshold of QGP production.
In addition, (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity in different collision systems at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV can be compared with the results from LHC, where an intriguingly smooth increase in these ratios was first reported.

Parallel session 29,parallel,"Production, flow, and properties of hypernuclei in heavy-ions with ALICE","Ditzel, Janik",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons. The measurement of the production of hypernuclei with mass number A=3 and 4 in heavy-ion collisions is a powerful tool to investigate the hyper-nucleosynthesis mechanism. In the coalescence model, the production yields are sensitive to the interplay between the spatial extension of the nucleus wavefunction and the baryon-emitting source size, whereas, in the statistical hadronization model, the nuclear structure does not come into play in the production. Hypernuclei span over a wide range of wavefunction radii, from about 2 fm for A=4 hypernuclei to about 10 fm for the hypertriton, making them ideal probes to test such models. In addition, the study of hypernuclei properties provides information on the nucleon-hyperon interactions, complementing the results obtained through femtoscopy correlation measurements. The strength of such interactions is a fundamental input to calculate the equation-of-state of the high-density nuclear matter found inside neutron stars.
This contribution presents recent measurements of ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H, ${}^{4}_\Lambda$H, and ${}^{4}_\Lambda$He based on the data samples collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 2 and Run 3.

Parallel session 29,parallel,Exploring the hadronic phase with momentum and azimuthal distribution of short-lived resonances and understanding the internal structure of exotic resonances,"Kim, Junlee",CERN,Switzerland,"Hadronic resonances are crucial probes to understand the various phases of matter created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, the yields of these resonances can be affected by competing rescattering and regeneration mechanisms in the final hadronic phase. Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. Final state observables such as elliptic flow, transverse momentum spectra, and measured yields of resonances could be significantly modified due to the interaction in the hadronic phase. By contrasting the yields of longer-lived resonances, such as the ϕ-meson with shorter-lived ones, such as the K$^{*}$(892), it is possible to obtain information about the properties and timescales of the hadronic phase. This contribution will present new results on production yields, spectra, and flow harmonics for K$^{*}$(892) and ϕ(1020) in Pb–Pb collisions obtained by the ALICE Collaboration. The results will be compared with state-of-the-art models to interpret which underlying mechanism can describe the experimental observations.

In addition to probe hadronic phase, the study of resonances also offers valuable insights into the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Resonances such as the f$_0$(980) and f$_1$(1285) challenge the traditional quark model. Their structure is yet unknown as they could potentially be tetraquark states or meson-meson molecules. Proposed Glueball candidates like the f$_2$(1270), f$^{′}_2$(1525), and f$_0$(1710) also provide opportunities to explore the gluonic bound states predicted by lattice QCD. Utilizing its excellent particle identification capabilities ALICE has recently conducted detailed studies of the exotic resonance production in pp collisions data at √s = 13 and 13.6 TeV.

Measurements on their yields can help us investigate their production mechanisms. In particular, the ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He and  $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) are bounded substantially tighter compared to the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H. The large radius of the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H leads to suppression in coalescence models, but not in the thermal model where the size of the nucleus does not play a role. As such, studying the $A=3-5$ hypernuclei yields allow us to extract information on the effects of hypernuclear binding on hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions.

Parallel session 23,parallel,Probing the structure of light exotic hadron $f_0(980)$ with elliptic flow in p-Pb collisions at the LHC,"Wang, Yili",Peking University,Unknown,"The study of exotic hadrons has long been a topic of great interest for the understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). As one of the light exotic hadrons, the structure and constituent quark content of $f_0(980)$ have been debated for decades, with theories suggesting it could be a tetraquark state ($s\bar sq\bar q$) or a hadronic molecule ($K\bar K$). Recently, the CMS experiment has measured the elliptic flow anisotropy $v_2$ of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions and concluded that  $f_0(980)$ is an ordinary $s\bar s$ meson, based on the number-of-constituent-quarks (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow [1]. Assuming that loosely bound light exotic hadrons can only survive at the kinetic freeze-out of the expanding hadronic matter, we have implemented the first $K\bar K$ coalescence model to a hybrid viscous hydrodynamic and hadronic transport model to calculate the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of $f_0(980)$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV.  Using the well tuned phase-space distributions of kaons in this collision, our coalescence model results agree well with the CMS flow measurements,  providing thus a strong evidence for the $K\bar K$ molecular nature of $f_0(980)$. Our study also indicates that the CMS Collaboration may have unjustifiably ruled out the $K\bar K$ molecular state of $f_0(980)$ by not considering the different $v_2$ scalings in  the coalescence of hadrons and the coalescence of quarks[2].

Parallel session 23,parallel,Deuterons emergence through coalescence with ALICE,"Mahlein, Maximilian",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Germany,"One of the unresolved issues in hadron–hadron collisions is the microscopic understanding of how light (anti)(hyper)nuclei are created. Several differential measurements of (anti)(hyper)nuclei yields, momentum distributions, and fluctuations have been carried out in pp, p–A, and A–A collisions at ultra-relativistic energies. Comparisons to models based on statistical hadronization or nucleon coalescence generally provide a good fit to the data. However, these models are grounded in different underlying scenarios, leading to a highly model dependent interpretation of the results.
In this work, new results based on femtoscopy correlations of deuteron proton and deuteron–pion pairs measured in pp and Pb–Pb collisions by ALICE at collision energies of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, respectively, are presented. Deuteron–proton correlations allow for studying the particle-emitting source size of deuterons compared to other hadrons. The deuteron source aligns with the proton source across all colliding systems. In pp collisions, the deuteron–pion correlation reveals the residual interaction between pions and nucleons from short lived Δ decays, followed by nucleon coalescence into deuterons. This effect is not observed in Pb–Pb collisions due to the large pion  multiplicities.
These results demonstrate, in a model-independent manner, that coalescence is a viable mechanism for (anti)deuteron production in ultra-relativistic hadron–hadron collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maximilian', 'last_name': 'Mahlein', 'fullName': 'Mahlein, Maximilian', 'id': '9386313', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '9bc002b10bbbaa678f3f1e17d8ac5445', 'db_id': 9386313, 'person_id': 9130216}"

However, the challenges of robustly isolating the formation time of a splitting phenomenologically has prevented formation time-dependent modification effects from being accessed experimentally. We address these challenges using heavy flavour, which offers an additional handle on tracing the propagation of individual quarks through the medium.

In particular, they can carry signals from the pre-equilibrium stage since the very high energy density of this stage can result in significant charm-medium interaction. Using a hybrid simulation framework that combines the IP-Glasma model for initial-state with viscous hydrodynamic evolution MUSIC to model the medium, we study charm quark propagation through different stages of the collision, from pre-equilibrium to hadronization. Heavy quark initial production is generated using PYTHIA and their interactions within the pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic medium are modeled through Langevin dynamics in MARTINI. Our results reveal that both the nuclear modification factor and anisotropic flow coefficients of D-mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are sensitive to the momentum-dependent energy loss of charm quarks in the initial stages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hadronization mechanisms—specifically fragmentation and coalescence—play a crucial role in shaping the final-state charm observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bjoern', 'last_name': 'Schenke', 'fullName': 'Schenke, Bjoern', 'id': '9288918', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Lab', 'emailHash': '4a88eb902ae580760430eaf0464746cf', 'db_id': 9288918, 'person_id': 8858157}"

In fact, the early production of heavy quarks ($c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$) make charmonia an ideal tool to investigate the evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, at LHC energies the recombination of uncorrelated charm quarks pairs, namely (re)generation, was found to significantly affect charmonium observables, in contraposition to the well known suppression mechanism. This aspect makes the production measurements of ground and excited states more and more relevant to discriminate among the scenarios foreseen by the different theoretical models. In addition, the possibility to isolate the non-prompt charmonia, i.e. originating from beauty hadron decays, provides an insight into the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. In this contribution, recently published results by the ALICE collaboration of inclusive charmonia production obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented.

This model naturally improves the description of quark susceptibilities previously underestimated in the simple $QPM$. Coupling the $QPMp$ modeling to an event-by-event transport approach based on Langevin equations, we evaluate the heavy-flavour $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_{n}(p_T)$ for $D$, $\Lambda_c$, $B$, $\Lambda_b$ hadrons in $PbPb$ as well as for $OO$ at $5$ $ATeV$. In $PbPb$ we find a quite good prediction for both $D$ meson and leptons from $B$ decays at least within current experimental uncertainties; we also discuss the additional information that can be carried by collisions of light $OO$ system. 
A main general result is that for charm quark the extracted space diffusion Ds(T) appears to be significantly larger (about $30-40\%$) wrt the recent lQCD/NREFT results at momentum $p=0$. We propose a novel analysis that point out the crucial role of the momentum dependence of the interaction to draw solid conclusions about the agreement between the phenomenological approach and lQCD calculation as well as to determine the thermalization time of HQ and in particular its mass dependence from charm to bottom quark. We will point out that $\Lambda_c$ production and the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of D meson at very low momenta ($p_T<1.5$ $GeV$) will allow for a novel and more solid determination of the space diffusion coefficient.

Parallel session 27,parallel,Unscreened potential and quarkonium width in QGP,"Larsen, Rasmus",Stony Brook University,United States,"Screening of the heavy quark anti-quark potential was suggested as the cause of quarkonium melting in quark gluon plasma (QGP). Perturbative QCD calculations within potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD) on the other hand do not lead to a screened potential in general and the thermal correction to the potential also has an imaginary part. We determine the complex potential in QGP using lattice calculations on lattices with large temporal extent $N_{\tau}=16-36$. The complex potential is extracted from the Wilson line correlators and physically motivated forms of the corresponding spectral functions [1,2]. We find that the real part of the complex potential is not screened in QGP independently of the detailed form of the spectral functions. We also estimate the imaginary part of the potential using prior information from various theoretical calculations [2].

Lattice calculations also find that the wave function of bottomonium states does not change much across the QCD transition [3]. This is consistent with the observation of the unscreened potential. Therefore, we use the vacuum wave function of different quarkonium states and the imaginary part of the potential obtained by us on the lattice to estimate the size of in-medium widths of $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\chi_c(1P)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\chi_b(1P)$ and $\chi_b(2P)$ states

The transport of heavy quarks in the QGP medium is described by a Langevin-based transport model that has been augmented to incorporate medium-induced radiation. This transport model is coupled to a bulk evolution model based on 2+1D relativistic viscous fluid dynamics. The heavy quark transport coefficients are derived from non-perturbative T-matrix calculations, which account for resonant correlations near the QGP transition temperature.  Hadronization of the heavy quark is described by a fragmentation plus coalescence model. We utilize the resonance recombination model that satisfies energy conservation and provides an equilibrium mapping between quark and meson distributions.

In heavy-ion collisions, where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) state is produced, charm and beauty quarks are produced on a timescale shorter than the medium formation time, being sensitive to the initial angular momentum of the fireball and to the magnetic field produced perpendicularly to the reaction plane in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large angular momentum and initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised, and the quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron during the hadronization process. Experimentally, heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring either the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ of spin-1 bosons (as the D$^{*+}$ meson) or the longitudinal polarization $P_{\rm z}$ of spin ½ fermions (as the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryon). Measurements in pp collisions provide a crucial baseline to disentangle the amount of charm-hadron polarization induced by the charm-quark polarization inherited from the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions.

The production cross section of beauty hadrons can be theoretically described with the factorisation approach as a convolution of the parton distribution functions of the incoming projectiles, the perturbative partonic cross section, and the fragmentation functions describing the transition from quarks to hadrons. Measurements of the production cross section of beauty hadrons in proton–proton (pp) collisions are therefore excellent tests of pQCD calculations. Measurements down to low transverse momenta are also fundamental ingredients for the estimation of the $\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ production cross section. Moreover, the relative abundances of different beauty-hadron species also gives insights about the beauty-quark hadronisation mechanisms.

Parallel session 3,parallel,Studying charm and beauty quark production and hadronisation with charm hadron measurements with ALICE,"Dello Stritto, Luigi",CERN,Switzerland,"Recent observations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have revealed a significant enhancement in baryon production in hadronic collisions compared to e$^+$e$^-$ and ep collisions, challenging the long-held assumption of fragmentation universality. This phenomenon, initially observed in the charm sector, has also been observed in the beauty sector, indicating a broader implication for heavy-flavor hadronization processes. This observation has led to the development of several models attempting to explain these observations, by implementing modified hadronization approaches with respect to the in-vacuum fragmentation process. Proposed mechanisms include color reconnection beyond leading-color approximation, hadronisation via coalescence, and feed-down from unobserved resonant states in a statistical hadronization approach.

To further elucidate this phenomenon, recent studies have focused on baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of event multiplicity. Intriguingly, evidence of a multiplicity dependence, with increased ratios in high-multiplicity events, has been observed in both the charm and beauty sectors, suggesting a possible connection between baryon enhancement and the local parton density. These investigations have significant implications also for heavy-ion physics, potentially bridging the gap between phenomena observed in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive understanding of these effects is essential for refining our theoretical models of heavy-quark hadronisation in hadronic environments.

In this contribution, the first measurements of $\mathrm{D^0}$-, $\mathrm{D^+}$-, $\mathrm{ D_s^+}$-meson and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^+$-baryon $v_2$ in different centrality intervals of Pb–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run 3 are shown. The measurements are compared to model predictions that incorporate various implementations of heavy-quark interaction and hadronization with the QGP constituents. Moreover, the measurement of the $\mathrm{D^0}$-meson elliptic flow in pp collisions is presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chuntai', 'last_name': 'Wu', 'fullName': 'Wu, Chuntai', 'id': '9385587', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Padova (IT)', 'emailHash': '723b56d4e9df069d4c1efe2c52b70be0', 'db_id': 9385587, 'person_id': 9129397}"
Parallel session 3,parallel,Statistical Production of $B_c$ Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions at the LHC Energy,"He, Min",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,Unknown,"The recombination production of $B_c$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy is facilitated by the abundant and highly thermalized charm ($c$) quarks transported in the deconfined medium created. We study the production of $B_c$ mesons via $c$ and bottom ($b$) quark recombination in a statistical fashion by placing $B_c$ in the position of a member of the family of open $b$ hadrons, which allows us to make quantitative predictions for the modifications of the production fraction ($f_c$) of $B_c$ mesons and its relative production to $B$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at the same energy [1]. The statistical production yield of $B_c$ mesons is converted into the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution with the shape computed from resonance recombination using the $c$- and $b$-quark phase space distributions that have been simulated via Langevin diffusion and constrained by open $c$- and $b$-hadron observables. Supplemented with the component fragmented from $b$-quark spectrum that dominates at high $p_T$, the total $p_T$ spectrum of $B_c$ mesons is obtained and converted into the $p_T$ dependent nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). Both $f_c$ and the integrated $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibit a $\sim5$-fold enhancement in central Pb-Pb collisions relative to the $pp$ reference. Comparison with data measured by the CMS experiment [2] shows decent agreement within theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

Additionally, anisotropic flow can produce local vorticities in both in-plane (z) and out-of-plane (y) directions, leading to local polarization. The RHIC Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program, including the Fixed-Target (FXT) mode at STAR, provides a unique opportunity to investigate hyperon ($\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$,  $\Xi^{\pm}$, $\Omega^{\pm}$) global polarization over a wide range of baryon chemical potential.

Unlike the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), where the induced dipole moment fluctuates randomly from event to event, the CMW generates an electric quadrupole moment with a same sign for a given net charge state of the system, thus CMW can be observed even when CME is not detected. The CMW leads to charge-dependent elliptic flow ($v_2$) which correlates with charge asymmetry ($A_{ch}$) of the system. 
Experimental searches for the CMW, however, face challenges from background contributions related to elliptic flow and nonflow. 
The correlation between triangular flow $v_3$ and $A_{ch}$ will be discussed as a background indicator.
Similar to the CME search, we use RHIC isobar collisions ($^{96}_{44}\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}\rm Zr+^{96}_{40}Zr$) at STAR for the CMW search, anticipating a stronger signal in $^{96}_{44}\rm Ru+^{96}_{44}\rm Ru$ due to its larger magnetic field. 
In addition, we compare with Au+Au to study the system dependence at the top RHIC energy, examining the magnetic field effects from isobar to Au+Au. 
The prerequisite of the CMW is expected to change with collision energy. 
We present the measurement of slope $ r_2$ of $v_2$ vs. $A_{ch}$ correlation in isobar collisions and Au+Au collisions with BES-II data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 19, 27 and 200 GeV.
We use the spectator planes from the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV and from the Event Plane Detector (EPD) at lower beam energies to determine the magnetic field direction. The large pseudorapidity gap between the particles of interest and the EPD or ZDC helps minimize nonflow contributions.

Parallel session 1,parallel,Initial-state-driven spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions,"Speranza, Enrico",CERN,Switzerland,"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of spin-polarization effects in heavy-ion collisions. Most approaches assume that final-state particles become polarized only if the thermal vorticity and shear are non-zero at freeze-out. In this sense, polarization is a final-state effect. Here, we propose a different polarization mechanism. For the first time, spin density is introduced in the initial state in a similar way as one introduces energy density. We argue that the collision of two nuclei, which occurs among participant nucleons carrying spin, deposits in the transverse plane a spin density that polarizes the produced QCD fireball along some random direction. If the subsequent evolution (e.g., kinetic or hydrodynamic) of the fireball does not alter this effect, the spins of the particles emitted at freeze-out will be polarized along the same direction. Using a simple model, we estimate that the polarization induced by initial-state fluctuations is on the order of 1% in central collisions, increasing to over 10% in noncentral collisions. At high energies, it is thus much larger than the polarization due to event-by-event fluctuations of the thermal vorticity. To measure this phenomenon, we introduce a two-particle angular correlation observable able to reveal net-spin fluctuations in the initial states, for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 hadrons. This new effect depends little on beam energy and could be promptly studied at both the LHC and RHIC. Finally, besides introducing new tools to probe spin effects in nuclear collisions, this work provides a framework to define spin initial conditions suitable for extensions of hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Enrico', 'last_name': 'Speranza', 'fullName': 'Speranza, Enrico', 'id': '9288709', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'da90b3b19a2df3cc4da56647b6d76e11', 'db_id': 9288709, 'person_id': 8871182}"

Parallel session 1,parallel,Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,"Li, Han-Sheng",Purdue University,Unknown,"Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics. The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of particles of interest (POI's). Event-shape engineering (ESE) [1] and event-shape selection (ESS) [2] are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. The former groups events according to the elliptic anisotropy vector $\vec{q}_2$ of particles in phase space different from that of POI's, thus to the dynamical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$, whereas the latter groups events according to $\vec{q}_{2,{\rm pair}}$ of pairs of POI's themselves, thus to the statistical fluctuations of the POI's $v_2$. In this talk, we conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations [3]. 
It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept, because of the limited dynamical fluctuation range of $v_2$ than that of  statistical fluctuations.
It is found that the ESE method can faithfully probe the CME when the $\vec{q}_2$ phase space is distanced from the POI's, while nonflow effect cannot be neglected when the $\vec{q}_2$ and POI's phase spaces are close. The ESS method, on the other hand, is obscured because of the intertwining $\vec{q}_{2,{\rm pair}}$, $v_2$, and $\Delta\gamma$, all of which are computed from the same POI's. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the  event content, such as the relative mixtures of background-contributing sources, and thus is not a robust measure of the CME.

The thermodynamics of this rigidly rotating system induces, kinematically, an infinite local temperature state at the light cylinder, where the velocity of the system equals the speed of light. We show that the infinite-temperature cylinder serves as a barrier (literally, a ``firewall'') characterized by emerging boundary conditions that protect the system from artifacts of superluminal motion outside of the cylinder. In particular, the local (differential) formulation of the gap equation naturally imposes that chiral symmetry is always restored at the light-cylinder. As a consequence, the rigidly rotating system cannot host a single chirally broken phase in the whole space. On the contrary, the system in a thermodynamic ground state resides in a mixed phase that comprises dynamically broken and dynamically restored phases located at different distances from the rotation axis. The existence of such mixed inhomogeneous phases is demonstrated explicitly.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sergio', 'last_name': 'Morales Tejera', 'fullName': 'Morales Tejera, Sergio', 'id': '9447178', 'affiliation': 'West University of Timisoara', 'emailHash': '0ad8fa28fc50b97ae872d6ac8a0f44b3', 'db_id': 9447178, 'person_id': 8894722}"

BES Phase-I studied Au+Au collisions from center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{_{\rm{NN}}}} $) of 7.7 to 62.4 GeV. BES Phase-II extended these measurements in several important ways, one of which was the addition of a fixed-target program that pushed the collision energy down to 3.0  GeV  (or baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm{B}},$ up to  720 MeV). 

Fixed-target (FXT) collisions at STAR allow for a more extensive scanning of the QCD phase diagram to an important region where the QCD critical point may lie, and to a region dominated by dense baryonic matter. One key measurement in both FXT and collider modes is the spectrum of the light hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}, \ \rm{K^{\pm}}$, p$(\bar{p})$) as a function of transverse momentum, rapidity, and collision centrality. Such measurements enable the empirical determination of the colliding system's location on the phase diagram at chemical freeze-out. Moreover, certain observables involving the production of hadrons have been proposed as a signature of a first order phase transition between hadronic matter and QGP. Specifically, studying the rapidity density distribution ($dN/dy$) of protons as a function of center-of-mass energy has been suggested as a way to probe the nature of the QCD phase transition from hadron gas to QGP. 

In this talk, the transverse momentum spectra and rapidity density distributions of pions, kaons, and (anti-)protons are presented in an energy range of $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm{NN}}}} = 3.2 - 27$ GeV, which includes measurements from both FXT and collider configurations.

Parallel session 12,parallel,Measurement of directed flow of $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ Resonances in Au+Au collisions at RHIC BES energies,"Nasim, Md.","University of California, Los Angeles",USA,"It is known from earlier studies that the hadronic interaction affects the measured yield of short lived resonance e.g. $K^{*0}$.  Recent studies [1] show that the directed flow ($v_{1}$) of $K^{*0}$ is strongly affected during the hadronic stage due to asymmetric loss in different sides of the $p_{x}$ axis in momentum space caused by the tilted fireball and density dependent rescattering. Therefore the $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ can be a good probe to study the late-stage hadronic interaction and provide more information (e.g rescattering affected by variations in matter density across phase-space) compared to the yield measurement integrated over full azimuth and rapidity. 

We present the first measurement of directed flow of $K^{*0}$ resonances in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV. Centrality-dependent difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $K^{*0}$ resonances will be presented.  The difference in directed flow between charged kaons and $\phi$  mesons will be also shown. The results will be compared with a hydrodynamic model that incorporates a hadronic afterburner [1].  The measured $v_{1}$ of $K^{*0}$ resonances can provide more insights into hadronic rescattering and regeneration processes in heavy-ion collisions and can constrain transport-based models of QCD matter.

Parallel session 9,parallel,Extending the fluid-dynamic description to the initial state,"Kirchner, Andreas",Duke University,Unknown,"Over the past two decades, research has shown that various observables measured in heavy-ion collisions can be effectively described using relativistic fluid dynamics across different collision systems and energies. However, a common challenge in these studies is the modeling of the transition from the initial state to the fluid-dynamic phase. While the collision likely involves complex, far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is possible that a second-order fluid theory can adequately capture its softer features. If successfully completed, this approach could lead to a comprehensive dynamical description of a heavy-ion collision, where the only free parameters are related to the thermodynamics and the transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.
In our work (arXiv:2410.08169), we investigate this possibility.

Parallel session 9,parallel,Covariant Formulation of Semi-Classical Spin Hydrodynamics and Equilibration of Spin: Linear and Nonlinear Perspectives,"Shokri, Masoud","Goethe University, ITP",Unknown,"Spin hydrodynamics is the extension of standard relativistic hydrodynamics with the total angular momentum considered as an independent conserved charge, where the total angular momentum is often expressed as a surface integral of a rank-3 tensor.
This rank-3 tensor is then decomposed into orbital and spin parts, which, by using the definition of orbital angular momentum in Cartesian coordinates and the energy-momentum tensor conservation, leads to the equation of motion for the spin tensor.
This treatment is not covariant under coordinate transformations, even in flat spacetime.
We address this issue by redefining the orbital and total angular momentum in a covariant way, which can also be extended to curved spacetime in cases where the Belinfante and Hilbert definitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent.
Then, we review the constitutive equations of semi-classical spin hydrodynamics developed from a systematic expansion in the reduced Planck constant, $\hbar$.
This formulation is inspired by, but not necessarily based on, quantum kinetic theory.
Up to the first order in $\hbar$, there is no back-reaction from the spin sector to fluid dynamics, and, therefore, solutions to standard hydrodynamics act as an input for the equations of motion for the spin tensor.
We consider three simple solutions to the fluid’s equation of motion: hydrostatic, linearized hydrodynamics, and conformal Bjorken flow.
We demonstrate that, up to first-order in $\hbar$, the spin waves are not affected by the fluid waves, and therefore, the results from the hydrostatic case and linearized hydrodynamics are the same.
This shows that our results for the damping of spin waves are not modified by slight fluid perturbations.
For the case of conformal Bjorken flow, we first review the consequences of conformal invariance in spin hydrodynamics and, in particular, show that conformal invariance should be considered only in the limit where $\hbar$ vanishes.
Then, we use the attractor solution to find the evolution of the spin potential.
We show that the spin potential in this nonlinear regime is damped in a similar fashion to the linear regime.
These results strengthen our previous findings on the possible long equilibration time for spin, and support a dynamical treatment of spin degrees of freedom.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Masoud', 'last_name': 'Shokri', 'fullName': 'Shokri, Masoud', 'id': '9288758', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University, ITP', 'emailHash': '9931bbf824507435f6505164e4926e46', 'db_id': 9288758, 'person_id': 8883170}"
Parallel session 19,parallel,Resummed spin hydrodynamics from quantum kinetic theory,"Wagner, David",Florence University,Unknown,"In the past years, different observables related to the spin polarization of hadrons such as $\Lambda$-Baryons have attracted much attention and continue to find new applications. 
While some measurements (such as the global polarization) are straightforwardly reproduced by assuming the spins of the particles to be in equilibrium, the explanation of more differential observables (such as the local polarization) remains a subject of active discussion.

A crucial ingredient in a more thorough description of spin dynamics is a formulation of dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that accounts for the finite (and possibly long [1]) timescale of spin relaxation, i.e., of the approach of the spin potential $\Omega_0^{\mu\nu}$ to the thermal vorticity $\varpi^{\mu\nu}$. In such a theory, the spin potential remains a dynamical quantity that follows certain evolution equations, akin to the Bloch equations for the magnetization in the (nonrelativistic) description of spin dynamics.

The main result to be presented are the equations of motion for such a theory, derived from first principles based on quantum kinetic theory [2]. Employing the inverse-Reynolds dominance (IReD) approach [3], a resummation scheme based on a power counting in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers is constructed, leading to hydrodynamic equations that are accurate to second order. 
It is found that the spin dynamics can be characterized by eleven equations: six of them describe the evolution of the components of the spin potential $\Omega_0^{\mu\nu}$, while the remaining five provide the equation of motion of a dissipative irreducible rank-two tensor $\mathfrak{t}^{\mu\nu}$. For a simple truncation, all first- and second-order transport coefficients are computed explicitly.

Our calculations of the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ for unflavored vector mesons reveal that all field contributions appear in squared terms. This finding indicates that anisotropies in local field correlations, relative to the spin quantization axis, lead to the spin alignment of unflavored vector mesons. We propose that the large spin alignment observed for $\phi$ mesons at lower energies arises from effective $\phi$ fields that  polarize the strange quarks and antiquarks, which in turn form polarized $\phi$ mesons via coalescence during the hadronization stage.  The strength of the $\phi$ field can be inferred from the experimental data on $\phi$-meson spin alignment as functions of collision energy reported by STAR Collaboration. Our findings show a transverse momentum dependence of $\rho_{00}$ in fair agreement with STAR data, and we also predict the azimuthal angle dependence of $\rho_{00}$. The proposed polarization mechanism driven by fluctuating strong-force fields may open a new window into a hitherto unknown behaviour of QCD interaction.

Parallel session 19,parallel,An end-to-end generative model for heavy-ion collisions,"Sun, Jing-an",Fudan University,Unknown,"The multistage approach based on hydrodynamics has achieved remarkably success in modeling heavy-ion physics, providing an accurate description of experimental particle spectra as well as various signatures of collective flow, flow correlations, and fluctuations. However, traditional numerical simulations of hydrodynamics are challenged by recent high-precision measurements: to probe the finer details in the system via statistics-demanding observables, 10^9-10^10 collisions events are commonly required. As heavy-ion collision physics enters a high-precision era, theoretical modeling needs to evolve to meet growing computational demands.
 
In this work, we introduce DiffHIC, a generative diffusion model designed to bridge this gap. The model simulates ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions from end to end, taking initial entropy density profiles as input and producding two-dimensional final particle spectra. By comparing observables derived from particle spectra generated by both traditional numerical simulations and our trained generative model, we demonstrate that DiffHIC not only accurately replicates integrated and differential observables but also effectively captures higher-order fluctuations and correlations. These results indicate that DiffHIC successfully learns the intricate mapping from initial entropy density profiles to final particle spectra, governed by a set of nonlinear hydrodynamic and Boltzmann transport equations. While preserving the fine  details of the underlying physical processes, DiffHIC significantly accelerates end-to-end heavy-ion collision simulations. For example, DiffHIC can simulate a single central collision event in just 0.1 seconds on a GeForce GTX 4090 GPU.

Parallel session 19,parallel,Understanding quantum corrections to momentum broadening in a weakly coupled QGP,"Weitz, Eamonn",Universität Bielefeld,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, the transverse momentum broadening coefficient, $\hat{q}$ plays an integral role in characterising how a high-energy parton loses energy to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it passes. Over the last few years, it has been shown [1,2] that $\hat{q}$ starts to receive radiative corrections at $\mathcal{O}(g^2)$, featuring potentially large logarithms. Indeed, better understanding the nature of these logarithmic corrections is extremely relevant for the goal of obtaining a precise theoretical description of parton energy loss.
During this talk, I will begin by presenting our results from [3], where we investigate how the inclusion of thermal effects impacts these radiative corrections. I will then report on our progress in understanding how the logarithmic phase space is deformed, once one relaxes the so-called harmonic oscillator approximation. In this direction, we make use of the improved opacity expansion [4], which has recently found success in analytically describing, at leading order, the interface of the single and multiple-scattering regimes.

Parallel session 25,parallel,Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state,"Mroczek, Débora",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Intermediate to low energy heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to the finite temperature ($T$), high baryon number density ($n_B$) QCD equation of state (EoS) at a ratio between charged and total number of baryons that is fixed by the colliding species. For typical nuclei used in collisions, like gold and lead, this ratio, also known as the charge fraction ($Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$), is around 0.4. On the other hand, studies of isolated neutron stars and the dynamics of their birth and mergers require $Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$ as low as 0.01. We propose a new finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter EoS [1] that can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point observations of isolated neutron stars and nuclear experiments. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data from low to intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions. With our new method, we can separately quantify the uncertainty in the $Y^{\rm QCD}_Q$ and finite $T$ components of the EoS without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We check the accuracy of our framework using a microscopic equation of state up to T = 100 MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B \geq$ 1100 MeV (∼ 1 − 2 $n_{\rm sat}$) and find that the error introduced is less than 5%, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$.

Parallel session 25,parallel,"Lambda potential in dense matter from chiral EFT: Bridging heavy-ion collisions, hypernuclei, and neutron stars","Jinno, Asanosuke",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We investigate the validity of the $\Lambda$  single-particle potential ($\Lambda$ potential) in dense matter that is based on chiral effective field theory (chiral EFT) that is sufficiently repulsive to solve the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars. We discuss that the model calculations with the $\Lambda$ potential are consistent with the $\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1] and the $\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2].

A unified approach integrating heavy-ion collisions, other nuclear experiments, and neutron stars with the modern nuclear force from chiral EFT has provided valuable insights into the properties of the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter (e.g. Ref. [3]). This approach contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of both nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. For a microscopic description of dense matter, such an approach must be performed also for the hyperon sector. A precise understanding of the hyperon potentials in nuclear matter is essential for addressing the long-standing hyperon puzzle of neutron star physics. 

In this talk, we consider the $\Lambda$ directed flow $v_1$ [2] at RHIC-BES energies to verify the $\Lambda$ potential based on chiral EFT [4]. This potential is sufficiently repulsive at high densities to solve the hyperon puzzle and has proven by us to be consistent with the $\Lambda$ hypernuclear spectroscopy [1]. We employ a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (RQMD) implemented into the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2. We show that the model with the $\Lambda$ potential from chiral EFT can reproduce the experimental data [2], while a more attractive $\Lambda$ potential also reproduces the data. Thus, additional constraints on the Λ potential are demanded.

We will also report the analysis of $v_1$ for $\Lambda$ with various updates including the covariant collision term [5] and the hyperon-nucleon scattering cross section from up-to-date chiral EFT forces [6]. A consistent treatment of the $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ potentials based on chiral EFT will also be discussed.

Pairing effects in the color-flavor locked (CFL) quark matter phase increase the pressure at high density, and if this effect is sufficiently large then the requirements of causality and mechanical stability make it impossible to reach such a pressure in a way that is consistent with what is known at lower densities. The intermediate-density equation of state is inferred by considering extensions of chiral effective field theory (CEFT) to neutron star densities, and conditioning these using current astrophysical observations of neutron star radius, maximum mass, and tidal deformability (PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1624-2230, PSR J0740+6620, GW170817).

Building on the milestone results in [1, 2], where all screened gluonic contributions to the QM pressure at this order were computed, the remaining challenge lies in evaluating the missing hard contributions arising from four-loop QCD vacuum diagrams at finite density. In this talk, we will present the latest progress in calculating these four-loop contributions [3], with a particular focus on the new algorithmic technique based on Loop Tree Duality (LTD), originally developed for perturbative computations in high-energy collider physics, which we recently generalized to finite density [4]. This novel approach tackles multiloop computations via direct numerical integration of entire Feynman diagrams, enabling the treatment of complex four-loop diagrams at finite density that were previously considered impossible to evaluate.

At beam energies below top SPS energy, the baryon density becomes maximal and its effect on $\rho$ meson broadening can be measured by NA60+ with utmost precision. 
NA60+ will have sensitivity to the $\rho−a_1$ chiral mixing mechanism, which provides access also to the properties of the a1 by exploring the thermal dimuon mass spectrum in the range 1 < M < 1.4 GeV.
For dimuon masses above 1.5 GeV, the temperature of the emitting source can be directly extracted by a fit of the mass spectrum. The experimental program of NA60+ plans to determine for the first time a caloric curve by measuring the temperature vs beam energy, with particular focus on $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ < 10 GeV, which is believed to be essential to map out the phase transition regime at high $\mu_B$.

Moreover, the momentum dependence of the medium response signal, especially across a range of parton momenta, remains largely unexplored. In this presentation, we utilize high-momentum partons produced over a wide range of parton momentum in lead-lead collisions, to probe the QGP created in heavy ion collisions. By studying the underlying event in the opposite direction of the high-momentum parton, we can gain deeper insights into the QGP's response to hard probes.

,poster,Light hypernuclei production in small collision systems with ALICE,"Reetz, Carolina Anna",Heidelberg University (DE),Germany,"Hypernuclei are objects composed of nucleons and hyperons. Measuring their properties and production provides insights into the force that binds strange hadrons to ordinary nucleons, which is poorly known. Additionally, measuring hypernuclei production in high-energy hadronic collisions offers a critical test for nucleosynthesis models, such as statistical hadronization and coalescence approaches. The difference between these two models is expected to be significant in pp and p–Pb collisions, as the wave function radii of the hypernuclei are larger than the size of the colliding systems. Therefore, the system size is crucial in yield determination within the two pictures. This contribution presents the new results on A=3 and A=4 hypernuclei measured in pp collisions collected by ALICE during the LHC Run 3. The results are consistent with the expectations from state-of-the-art coalescence models, warranting the comparison with measurements of heavier states. Finally, the first ALICE measurement of the hypertriton $^3_{\rm Λ}$H two-to-three body relative branching ratio is shown, providing an additional constraint to the $^3_{\rm Λ}$H properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Carolina Anna', 'last_name': 'Reetz', 'fullName': 'Reetz, Carolina Anna', 'id': '9406009', 'affiliation': 'Heidelberg University (DE)', 'emailHash': 'e20aa0cef13129ac78e2cf377966f40a', 'db_id': 9406009, 'person_id': 9149669}"
,poster,sPHENIX Novel Jet Background Subtraction and Full Detector Simulation Using Self-Supervised Generative AI Models,"Go, Yeonju",Brookhaven National Laboratory (US),USA,"Machine learning models have previously been utilized to address the challenge of subtracting combinatorial backgrounds from jets in heavy-ion collisions, with most earlier efforts focusing on supervised regression models. In this talk, we introduce the first self-supervised application of a generative AI model for jet background subtraction. We utilize UVCGAN [1], a Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN), to perform unpaired translations of full detector calorimeter data between heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions. This approach effectively isolates jets from combinatorial backgrounds in heavy-ion collisions while preserving both global jet kinematics and jet substructure.
Additionally, we present the effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as AI-based generative surrogate models for full-detector, whole-event, and high-fidelity simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments [2]. Trained on HIJING minimum-bias data simulated with Geant4 in the sPHENIX geometry, DDPMs achieve speedups of approximately 100 times over Geant4 simulations. This allows for the rapid generation of large datasets for applications requiring high statistics heavy ion simulation, such as the background events for jet embedding. Both methods were trained and benchmarked with simulated sPHENIX data, which will be discussed in this talk.

,poster,Unraveling fragmentation using jet substructure at LHCb,"Ramirez Garcia, Manuel",University of Michigan (US),USA,"Jet substructure measurements at the LHC produce precision tests of jet formation and fragmentation in vacuum as well as at the high temperatures and densities formed in heavy-ion collisions.

Mapping out individual emissions in the Lund jet plane for heavy-flavour jets and comparing to light-quark-enriched jets tagged by a Z boson reveals significant mass-dependence to jet fragmentation, offering a decisive channel to decipher in-medium modification to jet fragmentation across different kinematics. At the same time, measuring heavy-flavour jet mass with a theoretically-safe flavour tagging algorithm for the first time tests perturbative QCD at unprecedented theoretical precision and probes the gluon splitting contribution to heavy-flavour production, a yet-unobserved probe of how the medium resolves quark entanglement. The LHCb collaboration presents recent jet substructure results at forward rapidity in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

,poster,Hadronization studies using heavy-flavour jets at LHCb,"Lesser, Ezra",CERN,Switzerland,"The nonperturbative process of hadronization has recently been the subject of intense experimental investigation at the LHC. Since heavy quark production is suppressed at the hadronization scale, heavy-flavour hadrons offer an insightful probe into this effect, connecting perturbative parton-level calculations with experimental final states. Jets produced in conjunction with heavy hadrons offer additional information about hadronic formation at various mass scales and how hadronization depends on the partonic final states. In particular, recent measurements of in-jet quarkonium production suggest significant parton shower production, where gluons split into heavy quark-antiquark pairs. This further complicates the interpretation of charmonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions as evidence of QGP formation. Jet substructure can also be used to probe the formation of exotic hadrons, whose structure is still not well understood.

The ALICE measurements of neutral meson production give constraints on parton distribution functions (PDF) and fragmentation functions (FF), and provide essential background corrections for direct photon and dilepton analyses. The results in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are furthermore shown as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity and the correlation of the  $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ meson with jets.

Measurements in high-multiplicity pp collisions have revealed similarities to Pb--Pb collisions for observables that were previously attributed to the formation of a QGP, suggesting a continuous evolution from small to large collision systems.

,poster,Bottomonia production and polarization in pp collisions with ALICE,"Lu, Pengzhong",University of Science and  Technology of China (CN),China,"Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. From a theoretical point of view, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by the available theoretical models. In this context, quarkonium polarization measurements represent a powerful tool to discriminate among the different theoretical predictions. In particular, the study of the anisotropies in the angular distribution of the decay production with respect to a given quantization axis is sensitive to the quarkonium hadronization mechanism, even if the very small values measured at the LHC have been challenging the commonly-used theoretical models. Moreover,  the possibility to investigate effects related to the formation of a strongly interacting medium in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions requires a precise determination of the proton-proton reference cross section and polarization. The ALICE collaboration has measured the $\Upsilon$(1S) cross section and polarization at different center-of-mass energies and in this contribution we will present the recent measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV at forward rapidity  (2.5 < y < 4) in the dimuon channel.

Multi-parton interactions (MPI) influence the production of light quarks and gluons, affecting the total event multiplicity, but also hard processes as charmonium production. Therefore the event-multiplicity dependent production of charmonium has the potential to give new insights on the interplay between the hard and soft mechanisms in charmonium production. Another topic of interest in hadronic collisions is the measurement of the J/$\psi$ production in jets, which can shed light into the mechanisms governing the hadronization of a $c-\bar{c}$ pair into a J/$\psi$. In this contribution the prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ fragmentation functions in charged jets measured at midrapdity are presented and compared with models.

,poster,Quarkonium production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV with ALICE,"Quaglia, Luca",INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"The study of quarkonium production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions allows the investigations of both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Charmonia states, which are bound states of charm and anti-charm quarks, are produced via a process that can be factorized into two distinct stages: the generation of heavy quarks, followed by the formation of the bound state. The initial stage, governed by hard parton-parton scatterings at substantial momentum transfer, is effectively described by perturbative QCD. In contrast, the second stage, which involves large spatial separations and low momentum scales, is intrinsically non-perturbative. Precise measurements of quarkonium production cross sections in pp collisions are essential for enhancing the understanding of charmonium production mechanisms and for testing various theoretical models. Moreover, these measurements provide fundamental benchmarks for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and for evaluating cold nuclear matter effects in proton-nucleus collisions. In this contribution, preliminary results on the double ratio of $\psi(2S)$-to-J/$\psi$ as well as on the inclusive quarkonium yields in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV, measured by the ALICE Collaboration, will be presented and compared with current theoretical model predictions.

,poster,Associated production of quarkonia and open heavy-flavour hadrons in pp collisions with ALICE,"Diab, Batoul",Université Paris-Saclay (FR),Unknown,"In high-energy hadron-hadron collisions at the LHC, Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI), where multiple hard-parton scatterings occur in a single collision, play a significant role. Among these, Double Parton Scattering (DPS) represents the simplest case, where two independent scatterings take place simultaneously. The DPS contribution to processes involving two final states, A and B, can be described as the product of the cross-sections for the independent production of A and B, divided by an effective cross section. This effective cross section is a phenomenological parameter linked to the transverse spatial overlap between partons in the proton. Studying DPS helps to improve our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), particularly in the context of multi-parton distribution functions and potential correlations in parton color and spin. Heavy quark production arises from hard-parton scatterings due to their significant masses, making these processes ideal for studying DPS. One way to explore DPS is by measuring the production cross sections of charm-hadron pairs. In this contribution, we present the latest results on the production of charm-hadron and quarkonium pairs, specifically $\rm{D}^{0}\rm{D}^{0}$, $\rm{D}^{0}\rm{J}/\psi$, and $\rm{J}/\psi\rm{J}/\psi$, at midrapidity and forward rapidity in proton-proton (pp) collisions. These measurements are based on data collected with the ALICE detector at the LHC during Run 2 at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and Run 3 at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV.

,poster,Investigating the role of strangeness in charm hadronisation with strange charm-meson production in pp collisions with ALICE,"Aglietta, Luca",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Precise measurements of charm-strange hadron production are crucial for validating perturbative QCD calculations based on the factorization approach. In particular, comparing production yields of strange and non-strange charm hadrons is essential for understanding heavy-quark hadronization in hadronic collisions and for constraining models with different quark hadronisation approaches.
In this context, recent advances in charm-meson spectroscopy have led to the discovery of several excited charm-strange states, whose production yields in hadronic collisions remain unmeasured. Quantifying these yields would provide valuable insights into charm quark hadronization, given the significant contribution to the ground-state charm-hadron yields from their decays. Moreover, the production of short-lived resonances allows us to obtain information on the hadronic phase of the system created in heavy-ion collisions, and potentially present also in smaller collision systems.

This contribution presents new production measurements of the orbitally excited charm-strange mesons $\mathrm{D_{s1}}(2536)^+$ and $\mathrm{D_{s2}}^{*}(2573)^+$ in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. Their production-yield ratios relative to ground-state D mesons are reported, complementing and extending recent final results from proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Production yield ratios of $\mathrm{D_s}^+$ to $\mathrm{D}^+$ mesons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV will also be reported and compared to state-of-the-art model predictions.

Exploration of this phenomenon is most controlled in the heavy-flavour sector, where the large mass of charm or beauty quarks allows us to experimentally relate a heavy-flavour parton to the resulting hadron. This allows for well defined measurements of heavy-flavour jet fragmentation, enabling us to take steps beyond the traditional hadronic measurements in order to unveil the microscopic details of this non-universality. In this talk we present the first measurement of the fraction of the longitudinal momentum of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets carried by the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons, as a function of both the jet and event multiplicities in pp collisions. We also present corresponding first measurements of these quantities for jets containing $\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons, where comparisons to the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$-tagged jets test the impact of local colour density on the modification of the baryon fragmentation functions. Using the new high statistics Run 3 data sample will allow for differential measurements not only in multiplicity, but also in jet transverse momentum, probing the partonic scales at which non-universal behaviour emerges. Additionally, we report the first measurements of the energy energy correlators (EECs) of jets containing $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons compared to those containing $\rm{D}^{0}$-mesons.

This smooth evolution connects different collision systems almost independently of the collision energy. This extends to the strangeness sector, where the enhanced production of strange hadrons in high-multiplicity pp events is reminiscent of heavy-ion phenomenology in the case of quark-gluon plasma formation. With the wealth of data collected in Run 2 and Run 3 with the ALICE experiment, it is possible to bridge the gap in multiplicity between small and large systems, exploring for the first time the systems size dependence of light-flavour particle production at the same multiplicity values for pp and AA.

At the same time, exploiting the large statistics sample of Pb-Pb collisions collected in Run 3, the production of (multi-)strange hadrons is studied in low-multiplicity heavy-ion collisions, accessing for the first time with good sensitivity peripheral collision events. Moreover, for the first time at the LHC, the system size dependence is explored down to values smaller than in pp collisions using ultra-peripheral $\gamma$--Pb reactions. The system size dependence in light-flavour production is probed from the smallest system ($\gamma$--Pb) to the largest one (Pb--Pb) at the LHC, enabling testing the statistical hadronization picture at its limits.

,poster,ALICE explores the dependence of strangeness production on global and local properties of the pp collision,"Jacazio, Nicolò","Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",Italy,"The ALICE Collaboration observed that the production of light-flavoured hadrons relative to pions increases with the charged-particle multiplicity evolving smoothly across interaction systems and energies, from pp collisions to nucleus-nucleus collisions. Notably, this observation extends to the strange hadron sector, where an enhanced production in heavy-ion collisions with respect to minimum bias pp collisions is expected in the case of Quark-Gluon Plasma formation. Concurrent models attempt to explain such an increase. Some invoke the thermalisation of the system with a gradual release of the local conservation of the quantum charges; others describe the microscopic mechanism of hadronisation. In both cases, models are asking experiments to disentangle the effect of local and global properties of the system with more differential measurements. This contribution presents new results on the production of light-flavour hadrons using the pp data samples collected by ALICE during LHC Run 2 and Run 3. Strange particle production is correlated to global properties of the event exploiting the concept of effective available energy, estimated through the anti-correlated energy deposited in the ALICE Zero Degree Calorimeters. The production of (multi-)strange hadrons is further correlated to local properties of the collision, exploring the association with the production inside of jets and in the underlying event as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity. This can be done using event shape observables such as spherocity or exploiting a full jet reconstruction. Both cases will be discussed in this contribution, presenting new results. Additionally, the production of strange hadrons is further studied by exploiting a new event classifier based on the charged particle flattenicity, which proves to be more sensitive to multiple parton interactions (MPI) while being less sensitive to final-state hard processes compared to traditional event shape methods.

Novel observables are proposed to distinguish between the EPOS4 model, based on core-corona separation between a vacuum phase and a thermalised QGP phase with global strangeness conservation, and the PYTHIA 8.3 implementation, based on microscopic interactions between Lund strings that conserve strangeness locally.

,poster,Exploring the baryon production mechanism using angular correlations with the ALICE experiment,"Monira, Shirajum",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Angular (ΔηΔφ) correlations of identified particles in ultrarelativistic proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions exhibit features dependent on collision systems and particle types. These characteristics stem from mechanisms such as (mini-)jets, elliptic flow, resonance decays, and conservation laws, with quantum statistics and final-state interactions influencing each particle pair’s unique correlation function.
ALICE [1] and STAR [2] measurements of ΔηΔφ correlations show distinctions in baryon versus meson production. While meson correlation functions display an expected near-side peak attributed to mini-jet fragmentation, which is well reproduced by general-purpose Monte Carlo (MC) models, baryon-baryon correlations reveal a surprising near-side anti-correlation structure. This effect has not been reproduced by the MC models until recently [3, 4, 5, 6], posing fundamental questions about the production mechanism of baryons.
This talk presents new insights into this “baryon correlation puzzle”. Using Run 2 data from ALICE, a comprehensive study of multiplicity centrality dependent angular correlation functions for pairs of pions, kaons, and protons in pp, p–Pb, and Pb–Pb collisions, along with new Run 3 results for pp collisions at 13.6 TeV, are provided. These include correlation functions for baryon pairs and a new analysis of strange and charm sectors, featuring multi-strange baryons (pΞ, pΩ), pϕ, and pD correlations, allowing for tests of mass dependence and baryon number conservation.

,poster,Clocking the particle production and tracking quantum numbers balance and radial flow effects across pp and Pb–Pb collisions at top LHC energies with ALICE,"Gonzalez, Victor",Wayne State University (US),United States,"Balance functions have been used extensively to elucidate the time evolution of quark production in heavy-ion collisions. Early models predicted two stages of quark production: one for light quarks and another for the heavier strange quark, separated by a period of isentropic expansion. This led to the notion of clocking particle production and tracking radial flow effects that drive the expansion of the system.

In this talk, the balance functions of identified particles in different multiplicity classes of pp and Pb–Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and $ \sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV, respectively, are reported, as recorded by ALICE in Run 3. The results are compared with different models, as well as with previously published results on pp and Pb–Pb collisions at various energies. The results track the balancing of electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness by measuring how the widths and integrals of the charge, baryon number, and strangeness balance functions evolve across multiplicity classes. Results from pp collisions provide a reference for the Pb–Pb results, while the evolution with multiplicity allows us to glimpse the behavior toward high multiplicity scenarios in small systems. Comparisons with models constrain particle production mechanisms as well as the dynamics of system evolution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Victor', 'last_name': 'Gonzalez', 'fullName': 'Gonzalez, Victor', 'id': '9385621', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University (US)', 'emailHash': '38e26b6ef1cf3ba78457aa1eedad06b6', 'db_id': 9385621, 'person_id': 8880433}"

Recent observations suggest that collectivity exists in pp collisions, although signatures of jet quenching would provide stronger evidence. This study examines jet quenching in pp collisions at two different beam energies: $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV (LHC Run 2) and $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV (LHC Run 3) using di-hadron correlations. Correlations are measured for various $p_\mathrm{T}$ intervals as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. High-multiplicity (HM) events show azimuthal narrowing of jets compared to minimum bias (MB) events, though this difference diminishes at higher $p_\mathrm{T}$. These findings suggest a potential bias in the commonly used low-multiplicity template method of flow extraction.

The measurements are compared with various model calculations, including PYTHIA8, PYTHIA String shoving, EPOS, AMPT, and JETSCAPE, with jet quenching on and off. This presentation offers final results on jet fragmentation functions in HM and MB events from LHC Run 2 as well as preliminary results from the larger statistics LHC Run 3 pp collisions.

However, accessing these interactions is hampered by the short lived nature of the vector mesons, making traditional scattering experiments unfeasible. In recent years the ALICE Collaboration performed femtoscopy studies with particle pairs produced in nucleus nucleus collisions to investigate the interactions on challenging systems like ϕ—p.
Leveraging the excellent PID capabilities of the ALICE experiment, coupled with the copious production of $\rho^0$ mesons and protons at the LHC in pp collisions, ALICE presents the first-ever measurement of the $\rho^0$–p correlation function as a function of the relative momentum. The data are interpreted employing calculations within the framework of unitarised chiral perturbation theory in a coupled-channel ansatz. This measurement represents an unprecedented opportunity to study the nature of the excited N, in particular N(1700) and N(1900), unveiling if these states are molecular in nature and shedding light on possible signatures of CSR at LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maximilian', 'last_name': 'Korwieser', 'fullName': 'Korwieser, Maximilian', 'id': '9385617', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '93ef264937a7d877ecf5d7a906f31de7', 'db_id': 9385617, 'person_id': 9129418}"

A common source size dependence on $m_{\rm T}$ , typically attributed to collective phenomena, was previously measured by ALICE in Run 2 using various baryon–baryon, baryon–meson, and meson meson pairs in highmultiplicity pp collisions. Now, with Run 3 data, the study is extended, reaching the low multiplicity regime. The resonance source model, which accounts for the effects of strong decaying resonances, allows comparison of source size dependence on multiplicity in pp collisions with results from larger systems.
These results provide a new framework for exploring radial flow effects on source scaling and offer a benchmark for theoretical models on collective phenomena in small colliding systems.

In this analysis, we measure femtoscopic correlations within jets produced in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, using the full LHC Run-2 dataset collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The correlation function, $C_2$, is evaluated as a function of relative momentum, $q_{\text{inv}}$, for different ranges of average transverse momentum and transverse mass of constituent pairs, categorized by the average number of charged particles within the jet. The analysis is performed in the ""jet frame"", where particle kinematics are defined relative to the jet axis. By modeling the source distribution with a Gaussian function, we aim to extract $R_{\text{inv}}$ and $\lambda$, which characterize the particle-emitting source within jets.

,poster,EPJ Featured Poster: Heavy quarks in the pre-equilibrium stage of relativistic nuclear collisions,"Pooja, Pooja",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We investigate the dynamics of heavy quarks during the initial stages of relativistic nuclear collisions. The initial pre-equilibrium stage of heavy-ion collisions, commonly known as Glasma, evolves according to the classical Yang-Mills (CYM) equations. Heavy quarks are coupled to the evolving Glasma fields via relativistic kinetic theory. We compute the momentum broadening as well as the angular momentum fluctuations of charm and beauty quarks in the early stage, which turn out to be anisotropic due to the anisotropy of the background gluon fields. We observe that transverse momentum broadening for heavy quarks evolves as  $\sigma_p \propto t^2$  in the presence of background Glasma fields. This non-Markovian diffusion of heavy quarks in the early stages is explained by the memory effect present in the gluon fields. Furthermore, we also estimate the HQ spatial diffusion coefficient  $2 \pi T D_x$  in the pre-equilibrium phase.    The    $D_x$  obtained in the pre-equilibrium phase is quite close to the value obtained within pQCD in the QGP phase. Notably,  $D_x$   follows a continuous evolution from the pre-equilibrium phase to the QGP phase.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pooja', 'last_name': 'Pooja', 'fullName': 'Pooja, Pooja', 'id': '9292568', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyväskylä', 'emailHash': '28b5a34d9964ee0ff5907960da4a5b37', 'db_id': 9292568, 'person_id': 8899139}"

Observables such as the transverse momentum fraction ($j_\mathrm{T}$) and longitudinal momentum fraction ($z$) of jet constituents, provide valuable information on these processes. The ALICE collaboration has recently reported measurements of the $j_\mathrm{T}$ distributions for jet fragments in inclusive and differential $z$ in proton-proton and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, with quantitative comparisons to various theoretical models. In this poster, we present a new measurement of jet fragmentation in pp collisions, extending the precision of the previous measurement using the new high statistics data samples from Run 3. The results will also be presented differentially in event multiplicity, investigating potential medium effects in high multiplicity pp collisions. The $j_\mathrm{T}$ distributions are characterized through fits that separately constrain the perturbative and hadronization components, providing a basis to probe modifications at early times in the evolution of the jet.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jaehyeok', 'last_name': 'Ryu', 'fullName': 'Ryu, Jaehyeok', 'id': '9336348', 'affiliation': 'Pusan National University (KR)', 'emailHash': '44363462ebe30b4cc2c53895f7c18b01', 'db_id': 9336348, 'person_id': 8930488}"
,poster,EPJ Featured Poster: Superconductivity in confining models,"Sampaio Santos, João Paulo",UERJ,Unknown,"For cold, ultra-dense matter, color superconductivity is characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs of quarks through gluon exchange, yielding a frequency-dependent superconducting gap on the order of 100 MeV. Conversely, the phenomenon of confinement is characterized by the fundamental particles confined within hadrons at low to intermediate energies. In this regime, lattice QCD has shown that gluon two-point correlation functions in Landau gauge display a finite zero-momentum value, suggesting the dynamical generation of an infrared mass scale for the gluon and a nontrivial spectral structure.
In this work, we investigate how an infrared massive gluon might affect color superconductivity and use this phenomenon as a testing ground for confining models. In particular, we analyze superconductivity using a Yukawa model in which we replace the conventional bosonic propagator of the mediator with a confining propagator. This propagator has a structure similar to those found in Gribov-Zwanziger (GZ), Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ), and Curci-Ferrari models. In these models, the gluon includes an explicit mass parameter linked to nonperturbative effects and may exhibit nonstandard analytical structures, such as complex-conjugated poles. Considering low temperature and high chemical potentials, we derive the superconducting gap with frequency dependence. Our results reveal two phases in the system concerning the mass parameter: one phase exhibits superconductivity with a low-frequency peak, consistent with literature on color superconductivity (low-mass regime), while the other phase without superconductivity, displaying a ""plateau"" characteristic of BCS superconductivity in the point-like approximation (high-mass regime). Solving the integral gap equation we further observe a reduction in the superconducting gap across all confining models as the mass parameter increases. We also obtain results with renormalization group improvement in an infrared-safe scheme specifically for a massive Curci-Ferrari version of the gluon. Finally, we discuss the extension of this analysis to the gauge theory case.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'João Paulo', 'last_name': 'Sampaio Santos', 'fullName': 'Sampaio Santos, João Paulo', 'id': '9289163', 'affiliation': 'UERJ', 'emailHash': '4c525c2a33b57f719db1f9df95466175', 'db_id': 9289163, 'person_id': 8939629}"
Parallel session 21,parallel,EPJ Featured Talk: First direct measurement of radial flow in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Saha, Swati",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (NISER) (IN),India,"The observation of long-range correlations is a crucial indicator of collectivity in heavy-ion collisions and has been instrumental in establishing the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at RHIC and LHC. In this study, the first direct measurement of radial flow is presented using a new observable, $ v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T}) $, formulated to capture the long-range correlations in the transverse momentum $ p_{\rm T} $ spectrum. Unlike anisotropic flow coefficients $ v_{\rm n}(p_{\rm T}) $, which are influenced by both shear and bulk viscosity, $v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T}) $ is sensitive solely to the bulk properties of the QGP medium, making it a valuable probe for studying bulk viscosity and the hydrodynamic evolution of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions.

The measurement of $ v_{\rm 0}(p_{\rm T})$ is reported across various centrality classes for inclusive charged particles and identified particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons, in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector. To minimize short-range non-flow correlations, a rapidity gap technique similar to that used in anisotropic flow measurements is employed. At low $p_{\rm T}$, characteristic mass ordering, typically associated with collective flow in $v_{\rm n}(p_{\rm T})$, is observed. At higher $ p_{\rm T} $, where hydrodynamic descriptions fail, a baryon-meson splitting indicative of quark coalescence is observed. Measurements are compared with the hydrodynamic model MUSIC under varied initial conditions, as well as non-hydrodynamic models like HIJING and EPOS.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Swati', 'last_name': 'Saha', 'fullName': 'Saha, Swati', 'id': '9385539', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (NISER) (IN)', 'emailHash': 'eb001b2c53e8766c9291029bcfe856fa', 'db_id': 9385539, 'person_id': 8899579}"

[1] to describe the dissipative dynamics occurring in accretion disks in presence of large magnetic fields. For this purpose we consider a relativistic dilute gas composed of electrons and ions described by the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation and simplify it using the 14-moment approximation. This procedure leads to an extended version of the MHD theory traditionally employed in astrophysics simulations [2,3] which typically considers only the parallel component of the shear-stress tensor aligned with magnetic field, B. In our framework, we consider all three distinct, non-degenerate components of the shear-stress tensor relative to B, each governed by unique dynamical equations. We demonstrate that this novel framework exhibits oscillatory behavior in strong magnetic fields that cannot be captured by the conventional MHD formulation, similar to what was observed in Ref. [1]. We finally compare both frameworks in the linear and nonlinear regimes. In particular, we analyze the equations in conditions that lead to firehose instability [4], which is usually observed in simulation-based frameworks.

Initial studies that tested this proposal using the PYTHIA 8 event generator with the Monash tune, incorporating multiparton interactions (MPI) and the MPI-based colour reconnection (CR) model, did not reveal any strangeness enhancement, nor provide conclusive evidence for the presence of radial flow. In this contribution, we expand upon the proposed Monte Carlo study by eliminating selection biases associated with triggering on charged particle multiplicities. We disable MPI to focus exclusively on jet fragments. We analyse pp collisions at √s=13 TeV simulated with PYTHIA 8, exploring different implementations of the generator: thermodynamical string fragmentation and the standard Lund fragmentation model, considering various CR models. Surprisingly, the thermodynamical string fragmentation model predicts a hint of strangeness enhancement in jets. Additionally, the light-flavor baryon-to-meson ratios as a function of $j_T$ exhibit similarities across all PYTHIA 8 implementations, and hint at radial flow-like effects. In contrast, the ratio of heavy-flavor hadrons (Λ$^+_c$/D$^0$) at low $j_T$ as a function of $N_{j,ch}$ shows a similar trend to that observed as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in soft data, suggesting that colour string junctions may play an important role in jet development [2].

,poster,Viscous effects of a hot QGP medium in time dependent magnetic field and their phenomenological significance,"K K, Gowthama",Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,Unknown,"Momentum transport in a medium is characterized quantitatively by its shear and bulk viscosities. The shear viscous coefficient ($\eta$) governs the momentum transport transverse to the hydrodynamic flow while its bulk counterpart ($\zeta$) does the same along the flow. In the context of quark gluon plasma (QGP), both $\eta$ and $\zeta$ are very important transport coefficients, controlling phenomenologically important quantities such as the QGP thermalization time, sound attenuation length, elliptic flow, etc.

It is now well known that large initial magnetic fields (which subsequently decay) are produced in the heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC, which have been shown to influence the evolution of the QGP medium. However, most studies in the literature are made with the assumption of a constant magnetic field.

In this work, we have studied, for the first time, the impact of a realistic picture of a time dependent electric and magnetic field on the shear and bulk viscosities of the medium. Both the electric and magnetic fields are considered to be exponentially decaying with time, and the study is valid in the regime where the magnetic field strength is weak ($eB\ll T^2$). The evaluation has been done in the kinetic theory framework wherein we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation type collision kernel. We have shown that the constant weak field results as well as the $B=0$ results in the literature can be obtained as special cases of our general results. We have observed that the shear and bulk viscosities increase with time and conversely decrease with the strength of the magnetic field.  To connect these observations with the experiment we have obtained the thermalization time, the sound attenuation length and other various phenomenologically significant quantities, using our results of $\eta$ and $\zeta$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gowthama', 'last_name': 'K K', 'fullName': 'K K, Gowthama', 'id': '9365322', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay', 'emailHash': '1087e7c176b8c32881dcb82a72ab3b15', 'db_id': 9365322, 'person_id': 8889738}"

It is being installed at the Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt, Germany, and will use a beam from the new SIS-100 accelerator. The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the core tracking detector of CBM, tasked with achieving high-precision measurements of particle tracks and momentum. Currently, a prototype system, comprising several detector subsystems, including a scaled version of the STS called mSTS is undergoing extensive testing and data taking in the miniCBM (mCBM) experiment using the existing SIS-18 accelerator of the GSI, Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt. This testing initiative is critical for validating hardware and software in realistic experimental conditions and ensures their performance in online data read-out, processing, and analysis of complex event topologies detected by the mCBM's subsystems.

We will present our comprehensive study of data rates achievable with the mSTS detector system, emphasizing results from simulations and experimental runs taken during the year 2024. Using UrQMD-based minimum bias events for Ni-Ni collisions at a beam momentum of 1.93 AGeV/c, we simulate the expected detector performance in a realistic free-streaming readout with an additional beam background simulated with GEANT4. We will present in a poster a comparative analysis of the simulations with data collected during the experimental campaign in 2024. The study will provide insights into the scaling and optimization required for full-scale implementation in CBM.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'MEHULKUMAR', 'last_name': 'SHIROYA', 'fullName': 'SHIROYA, MEHULKUMAR', 'id': '9361615', 'affiliation': 'GSI Helmholtzzentrum für Schwerionenforschung GmbH', 'emailHash': '9782235aa09e120bb26a82d63f6eab89', 'db_id': 9361615, 'person_id': 8932035}"

with high spatial, temporal and momentum resolution. A scaled down version of CBM is installed at the SIS18
accelerator and it serves as a full-system test-setup for the capabilities of the future experiment. The m(ini)CBM
experiment has outgrown its diminutive prefix by showing promising results in the operational and scientific realms.
At the core of mCBM resides mSTS, with 3 stations and a total of 12 sensors is able to contribute to the global
track reconstruction. The goal of this work is to explore the particle identification (PID) capabilities of mSTS by
measuring the collected charge from traversing ionizing particles, which is related to energy loss; this task relies on
a correct charge calibration and noise suppression of mSTS data. In the absence of a magnetic field, momentum
measurements are not possible, but using the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector of mCBM we can extract the particle
velocity and correlate it with dE
dx data from mSTS to show the behavior of multiple particle species. The data for

,poster,The mirror system of the CBM RICH detector,"Ahrens, Luca Jonas",Justus Liebig University Gießen,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will be installed at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It aims to explore the phase structure of strongly interacting (QCD) matter at large net-baryon densities and moderate temperatures by means of heavy-ion collisions in the energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9$ GeV. A key observable for the anticipated first order phase transition or even critical point is electromagnetic radiation from the dense system. 

Electron identification will be performed with a large ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector followed by a transition radiation detector (TRD). The RICH detector will use CO$_2$ as radiator gas allowing for electron-pion separation of up to 6-8 GeV/c. The RICH detector design is at an advanced stage with construction of first elements already ongoing. Key elements for the RICH detector are the mirror system and the photon detector. 

This poster presentation will focus on the aspects important for the mirror system which has to ensure high quality, high efficiency Cherenkov photon reflection with low material budget. This requires thin, high reflectivity mirrors featuring a homogeneous surface. These mirrors then have to be fixed in a low weight but stable holding structure allowing for precise alignment and alignment control. Prototypes of all elements have been investigated and constructed allowing for a complete design of the full mirror wall. Start of construction is planned for early spring 2025.

Due to a short lifetime of about $4 fm/c$, $K^{*0}$ will primarily decay inside the fireball formed after the collision. Their decay daughters may undergo various in-medium effects, such as rescattering and regeneration. The resonance to non-resonance yield ratio, $K^{*0}$/K, can help shed light on these in-medium effects. Study of the properties of $K^{*0}$ can help us understand the lifetime and particle interactions during the hadronic phase.

  In this poster, we will present measurements of $K^{*0}$ production in Au+Au collisions at  = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR BES-II experiment.

,poster,Probing gluon structure with J/ψ photoproduction in isobaric  ultra-peripheral collisions at 200 GeV with the STAR,"Li, Zengzhi",South China Normal University,Unknown,"In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction has been recognized as one of the most sensitive probes of the gluon structure in nucleons and nuclei. Recently, STAR published differential measurements on photoproduced J/$\psi$ in ultra-peripheral d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. These results provide important constraints on gluon distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations in both light and heavy nuclei. Compared to d+Au and Au+Au collisions, the collision system size in isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}Ru$ + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}Zr$ + $^{96}_{40}Zr$) lies in between. Therefore, the measurement of coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction in isobaric UPCs offers a unique opportunity to study the system size dependence of gluon evolution.

 In this poster, we present the differential cross sections of photoproduced coherent J/$\psi$ as a function of rapidity (y) in $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) + $^{96}_{44}Ru$ ($^{96}_{40}Zr$) UPCs at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The results will also be shown for different combinations of neutron emission, where neutrons are detected by zero degree calorimeters, which help resolve the photon-gluon emitter ambiguity. More importantly, these data provide crucial constraints on the system size dependence of the gluon structure within nuclei in the kinematic range x$_{parton}$, the momentum fraction carried by the gluon, $\sim 0.015-0.03 $.

Precise measurements of $\rm {}^{3}_{\Lambda}H$ and $\rm {}^{4}_{\Lambda}H$ yields in heavy ion collisions provide important guidance on the understanding of hypernuclei production mechanisms as well as the role of the hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interaction in hypernuclei formation.

,poster,Search for Collectivity in Photo-nuclear Processes at RHIC using STAR Detector,"Paul, Souvik",Stony Brook University,USA,"Investigating collective behavior due to the formation of a fluid-like medium in small collision systems has been a significant focus in the field. A tell-tale signature of this would be the medium's response to the initial state in small collision systems, as predicted by fluid-dynamic models.

Recent RHIC studies of small systems have shown a hierarchy of elliptic anisotropy coefficients ($v_2$($^{3}$He+Au) $\sim$ $v_2$(d+Au) $>$ $v_2$($p$+Au)) suggesting fluid-dynamic behavior even in the smallest systems. This raises the question: could a photo-nuclear collision, such as $\gamma$+Au also exhibit signatures of collectivity? Notably, signatures of collectivity have been investigated in high-multiplicity, high energy $\gamma$+$p$/Pb collisions at the LHC.

This poster explores anisotropic flow in $\gamma$+Au processes at RHIC by triggering ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. At this collision energy, the maximum photon-nucleon center of mass energy $W_{\gamma N}^{\rm max}$ $\approx$ 34.7 GeV [1], an energy between d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19 GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 GeV, previously performed at RHIC. For both $\gamma$+Au and d+Au, the exact multiplicity range is accessible at STAR, making d+Au a suitable baseline system for comparison. Furthermore, the STAR detector’s extended rapidity coverage, with mid and forward rapidity upgrades ($|\eta| < 1.5$ and $2.1 < |\eta| < 5.1$) enables the triggering and analysis of photo-nuclear processes. Preliminary results will present $v_2$ and $v_3$ in $\gamma$+Au collisions at multiplicities and energy comparable to those of d+Au, where collectivity has already been observed. These results will provide new insights into collectivity in small collision systems, emphasizing the role of initial-state effects and collective behavior in understanding the evolution of the fluid-like medium created in various collision systems at RHIC.

The UE are defined as those aspects of p−p collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest

Study of the interference in peripheral collisions provides novel information on the impact parameter dependence, the entanglement criteria, and wavefunction decoherence. On one hand, the medium created in such collisions can act as a semi-opaque screen and decohere or weaken the interference effect. On the other hand, the interference is expected to be stronger as the impact parameter decreases. Furthermore,  it remains unclear whether the coherence of the photon/pomeron emitters can be preserved, despite the breakup of nuclei in hadronic interactions.

The former, however, induces a bias on the hardness of the proton-nucleon collisions, resulting in deviations from the binary nucleon-nucleon scaling of hard processes. In contrast, the energy deposited at zero degrees, i.e. at forward rapidities, by slow nucleons is shown to be insensitive to such a multiplicity bias.

In this contribution, an alternative centrality estimator based on a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, is proposed to study proton-lead collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision 5.02 TeV using PYTHIA 8 Angantyr. According to studies performed in pp collisions with PYTHIA 8, the flattenicity classifier shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions. It is less affected by selection biases towards larger transverse momenta than the multiplicity-based estimators. The results are compared with those obtained using other centrality estimators based on charged-particle multiplicity, at both mid and forward pseudorapidity.

These novel observables are particularly suitable for Bayesian studies, after it was demonstrated that they exhibit a better sensitivity to model parameters than the previously used observables.


Of particular interest is a differential measurement of SC and AC observables as a function of transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$, because this enables the separation of the contribution to $v_n$ harmonics from collective flow at low $p_{\rm T}$ and jet quenching at large $p_{\rm T}$.

This work presents a Bayesian unfolding data-driven measurements of the open beauty hadron production, utilizing ALICE and LHCb data to recover full kinematic information from the measured non-prompt $\rm D^{0}$ and non-prompt $\rm J/\psi$. The beauty hadron production cross sections are found to be perfectly consistent across different decay channels and from two Collaborations. The precision of new results significantly improves upon worldwide measurements. This method has been validated in pp collision at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV [1].

It is suggested that in peripheral heavy ion collisions, the initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) manifests the vorticity, which primarily accounts for the spin polarization of the hyperon. Apart from the OAM, there are several other potential sources of vorticity, such as the shear viscosity, magnetic field, inhomogeneous transverse expansion, etc. In the present study, we couple the vorticity, viscosity, and magnetic field within the ambit of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics and estimate the lifetime of the vortical quark-gluon plasma (QGP) fluid. We observe that the coupling of vorticity and viscosity significantly decreases the QGP evolution rate, and the inclusion of the magnetic field makes the evolution further slower. We observed that the medium evolution becomes highly nonlinear if we consider a coupling between vorticity, viscosity and magnetic field. Using the vortical QGP evolution, we obtain the global spin polarization of $\Lambda$-hyperon. Further, we investigate viscosity and magnetic field impact on the polarization of  $\Lambda$-hyperon. This study provides a qualitative understanding of the QGP medium evolution and spin-polarization of hyperon in heavy-ion collisions.

Such transverse collective expansion results in the appearance of long-range azimuthal correlation and is quantified via the coefficients, $v_{\rm n}$, of Fourier expansion of the azimuthal momentum distribution of the final-state particles. These flow coefficients serve as the medium response to the initial spatial anisotropy and are sensitive to the density profile of the colliding nuclei. Light nuclei such as $^{12}\rm C$ and $^{16}\rm O$ are theorized to possess extra stability due to the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered arrangement of its nucleons. In this context, studies on ultra-relativistic p--A collisions involving $^{12}\rm C$ or $^{16}\rm O$ nuclei can serve a dual purpose: exploring small system collectivity along with investigating the effects of a clustered nuclear geometry on the medium anisotropy. With this motivation, for the first time, we study p--O and p--C collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 9.9 TeV through a multi phase transport model (AMPT) simulations. We attempt to explore how an initial $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure of $^{16}\rm O$ and $^{12}\rm C$ influences the production yield, initial eccentricities and flow coefficients in the final state, in comparison to an unclustered density profile, Sum-Of-Gaussians (SOG). The flow coefficients are estimated via a two-particle Q-cumulant method. 


The results show that $\langle\epsilon_{2}\rangle$ varies with centrality in a unique manner for $\alpha$-clustered p--O and p--C collisions, similar to O--O collisions. However, the centrality dependence of $\langle\epsilon_{2}\rangle$ and $\langle\epsilon_{3}\rangle$ is not effectively carried forward to the final state $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$, owing to lesser participants. We also see that the dependence of $v_{2}$ on centrality is much less in comparison to $v_{3}$, which is reflected in the $v_{3}$/$v_{2}$, $v_{2}$/$\langle\epsilon_{2}\rangle$ and $v_{3}$/$\langle\epsilon_{3}\rangle$ ratios studied in our work. We notice that the $\alpha$-clustered case shows almost a flatter trend of $v_{3}$ with centrality than the corresponding collisions with a SOG profile, possibly indicating the discretized internal structure of an $\alpha$-clustered nucleus. Thus, by probing the effects of the nuclear structure employing ultra-relativistic collisions, this work serves as a transport-model-based prediction for the upcoming p--O collisions in the LHC Run$~$3.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Aswathy', 'last_name': 'Menon K R', 'fullName': 'Menon K R, Aswathy', 'id': '9360885', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': 'ee7ecace37af6faff41c99d05ad4bb95', 'db_id': 9360885, 'person_id': 8900418}"

The best agreement with the experimentally known deuteron yield is obtained if the freeze-out temperature is relatively high and, accordingly, the system size at freeze-out is rather small. In addition, the standard Gaussian distribution of the relative distance between nucleons is replaced by the distribution resulting from their independent and approximately uniform production inside the initial thermal system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nikodem ', 'last_name': 'Witkowski ', 'fullName': 'Witkowski , Nikodem ', 'id': '9360883', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'd510e2bc93787c567cea961d808ba658', 'db_id': 9360883, 'person_id': 8926865}"
,poster,How far can we see back in time in high-energy collisions using charm hadrons?,"Gyulai, Laszlo",HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics (HU),Unknown,"We use open charm production to estimate how far we can see back in time in high-energy hadron-hadron collisions. We analyze the transverse momentum distributions of the identified D mesons from pp, p–-Pb and A–-A collisions at the ALICE and STAR experiments covering the energy range from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV up to 7 TeV. While the low-momentum part of the spectra can be associated with particles stemming from a thermal equilibrium, the high-momentum regime follows a power-law-like distribution, resulting from perturbative QCD hadron production. Recent non-extensive thermodynamical models, however, are able to successfully describe the spectra within a unified framework [1]. We discuss the consistency of the resulting Tsallis temperature and non-extensivity parameter, and compare them to the ones of light-flavour hadrons. These results allow us to estimate the production time of D mesons in relation to the light-flavour hadrons [2]. We also explore the species-dependent timescales of formation of particle spectra, as well as provide constrains to the heat capacity of investigated systems [3].

,poster,Probing Dense Nuclear Matter with Strangeness and Hypernuclei at the CBM Experiment,"Vassiliev, Iouri",GSI,Germany,"The CBM experiment at FAIR aims to study the properties of dense nuclear matter at the edge of the quark-gluon plasma phase transition. This extreme environment offers a unique opportunity to study hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions through the production and decay of multi-strange particles and hypernuclei. Understanding these interactions is critical for describing the nuclear equation of state at high densities and the structure of neutron stars.
CBM's exceptional capabilities, including the world's highest interaction rate coupled with high-precision tracking and particle identification, enable comprehensive measurements of rare multi-strange particles and double-lambda hypernuclei. This extends to two- and three-body decays with neutral daughters, significantly expanding the accessible decay channels and providing stringent constraints on theoretical models.
The KFParticle Finder package will be employed to identify the complex topologies of multi-strange particle and double-lambda hypernuclei decays, enabling precise measurements and analysis.
Results of multi-strange particles like $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ reconstruction in the Au+Au collision at FAIR energies will be presented. The possibility of discovering rare double-lambda hypernuclei like ${}^4_{\Lambda\Lambda}$H, ${}^4_{\Lambda\Lambda}$n and ${}^6_{\Lambda\Lambda}$He also will be discussed.
Extensive feasibility studies demonstrate CBM's ability to measure these rare probes with high precision and statistics. The sophisticated analysis of this data will shed light on hyperon-hyperon interactions, paving the way for a comprehensive investigation of hypernuclei at FAIR. These measurements will provide crucial insights into the properties of dense nuclear matter under extreme conditions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Iouri', 'last_name': 'Vassiliev', 'fullName': 'Vassiliev, Iouri', 'id': '9360880', 'affiliation': 'GSI', 'emailHash': 'a5e4b6e791e51e4a2ac5431cfe766435', 'db_id': 9360880, 'person_id': 8926866}"

It is observed that local density fluctuations are directly related to the critical behaviour in QCD. As the system approaches phase transition, there is a divergence of the correlation length. The system becomes scale-invariant with particle correlation function having power-law with increasing bin resolution. The correlation function, within the contours of intermittency, used to study these spatial fluctuations is the normalized factorial moments (NFM) derived for the density of particles in the phase space bins. NFMs have essential properties of Poisson noise suppression and sensitivity to high density fluctuations. A two dimensional intermittency analysis is performed for the charged particles generated using EPOS4 in the (η, ϕ) phase space within the acceptance region of central barrel detector of the ALICE experiment at LHC, CERN. Scaling of NFM with number of bins, termed as intermittency, has been observed for the charged particles produced in the recent collider experiments.

Pala, Kevin ",Unknown,Unknown,"The beam energy scan probes the QCD phase diagram from high temperatures, low densities (high energies) to low temperatures and high densities (low energies). At high energies the system is boost-invariant such that 2+1D simulations using hyperbolic coordinates can reasonably capture most of the dynamical behavior for symmetric collisions, but as one lowers the beam energies the Lorentz contraction decreases (the radius along the beam is comparable to the transverse radius) such that the system requires 3+1D simulations and a later start time to wait for the two nuclei to pass through each other. If one applies hyperbolic coordinates at low energies, the initialization time for hydrodynamics is either extremely late or one needs to dynamically initialize the hydrodynamics using source terms. However, using cartesian coordinates rather than the traditional hyperbolic coordinates would avoid this issue. In this work, we rewrite the 3+1 relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code CCAKE with a generic coordinate system such that we can compare hyperbolic to cartesian coordinates across beam energies. For each beam energy, we identify the optimal coordinate system for simulations (comparing numerical error and code run time).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kevin ', 'last_name': 'P.

,poster,Deep Learning for Studying Collective Flow and Chiral Magnetic Effect,"Guo, Shuang",Fudan university,Unknown,"Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for advancing our understanding of high-energy nuclear physics. We employ DL methods to probe two crucial phenomena: collective flow in small colliding systems and the chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions. 

Collective flow is similar between small colliding systems ($p$ $+$ $p$ and $p$ $+$ A collisions) and large colliding systems (peripheral A+A collisions) at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC)  for events with similar multiplicity. To study the differences in collective flow generation mechanism between small and large colliding systems, we employ a point cloud network to identify $p$ $+$ Pb collisions and peripheral Pb $+$ Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV generated from a multiphase transport model (AMPT). After removing the discrepancies in the pseudorapidity distribution and the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra, we capture the discrepancy in collective flow, revealing an increased distinction with higher final hadron multiplicity and parton scattering cross sections.

On the other hand, the search for chiral magnetic effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions has attracted long-term attention. Multiple observables are proposed, but all suffer large background contaminations, especially from collective flow, generating with quark gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. We design a U-Net architecture based on deep convolutional neural networks to reconstruct the CME signal by reversing the evolution of the CME signal inside the QGP. Trained on AMPT-generated datasets, our model effectively reconstructs the charge separation in phase space, providing a strong AI technique for future experimental search for the CME.

Recent experiments have suggested that this phenomenon also appears in heavy-ion collisions. However, the theoretical background is not yet well understood. In high-energy collisions of heavy nuclei, the strongly interacting Quark Gluon Plasma is created, which, similarly to the early Universe, undergoes a rapid expansion and transition back to normal hadronic matter. In the subsequent expanding hadron gas, particles interact until kinetic freeze-out, when their momenta become fixed, and they freely transition toward the detectors. Measuring spatial freeze-out distributions is a crucial tool in understanding the dynamics of the created matter as well as the interactions among its constituents. In this talk, we present a novel three-dimensional analysis of the spatial freeze-out distribution of pions (the most abundant particles in such collisions). Utilizing Monte-Carlo simulations of high-energy collisions, we show that the chain of processes ending in a final state pion has a step length distribution leading to Lévy-stable distributions. Subsequently, we show that pion freeze-out distributions indeed exhibit heavy tails and can be described by a three-dimensional elliptically contoured symmetric Lévy-stable distribution.

This is in very good agreement with the pseudo-critical temperature estimated after performing a careful continuum extrapolation of different chiral observables using highly improved staggered quarks [1]. More remarkably the continuum extrapolated data for $\chi_{disc}$ obtained using highly improved staggered quarks are in excellent agreement with those obtained with MDWF on a finite lattice, highlighting the importance of the role of exact chiral symmetry of lattice fermion operators for the study of crossover transition. We also show our new results on the topological susceptibility in 2+1 flavor QCD with MDWF in the temperature range between $T_{pc}$-$1.2~T_{pc}$, and from its temperature dependence and comparison with $\chi_{disc}$ we discuss about the effective restoration of the singlet $U_A(1)$ and the non-singlet parts of chiral symmetry corresponding to the two light quark flavors [2].

In sharp contrast to weakly-coupled theories, whose spectral functions consist of discontinuous zero-dimensional (singularities) and one-dimensional (branch cuts) non-analytic contributions from real energy, the derived spectral function for strongly coupled quarks features continuous but non-analytic contributions from complex energy. In light of the novel sum rules, we uncover an intrinsic QCD transition between a three-mode phase at small coupling and a one-mode phase at large coupling.

,poster,Going against the flow: Revealing the QCD degrees of freedom in hadronic collisions,"Törnkvist, ROBIN",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela - IGFAE,Unknown,"In this talk, we demonstrate that in smaller systems, such as proton–proton and peripheral ion–ion collisions, microscopic models for final state interactions, can produce anisotropies where the elliptic flow is *negative* — that is, the momentum is largest along the major axis, contrary to hydrodynamic predictions [1].

We present results from two distinct microscopic models: one based on repulsion between string-like fields and another based on effective kinetic theory. For both models, we first study the elliptic flow response to initial geometrical deformations in a simplified setup using toy models. This allows us to examine the dynamical origin of the negative sign of elliptic flow through its dependence on the ratio of system size to interaction length. We then proceed to look at more realistic scenarios, using the Angantyr model [2] in PYTHIA [3] for the case of string shoving, as well as the parton cascade ALPACA [4] based on the effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe [5]. Both models show a clear transition between negative and positive elliptic flow as a function of system size for the examined small collision systems.

The negative sign of elliptic flow is a solid prediction of the string interaction model while in the model based on kinetic theory it is linked to a finite interaction range. Consequently, an experimental determination of the sign of elliptic flow, will provide novel insights into the degrees of freedom governing strong nuclear interactions in high-energy collisions and the way in which they interact.

,poster,Combinants and correlation functions in nuclear collisions: some intriguing properties of multiplicity distributions,"Rybczynski, Maciej",Jan Kochanowski University (PL),Poland,"Multiplicity distributions in e+e- and proton-proton collisions analyzed via the combinants method exhibit oscillatory behavior of the modified combinants. The possible sources of these oscillations and their impact on our understanding of the multiparticle production mechanism were discussed [1-5]. The set of combinants, Cj provides a similar measure of fluctuations as the set of cumulant factorial moments, Kq, which are very sensitive to the details of the multiplicity distribution and were frequently used in phenomenological analyses of data. However, while cumulants are best suited to the study of the densely populated region of phase space, combinants are better suited for the study of sparsely populated regions because the calculation of Cj requires only a finite number of probabilities P(N<j). The observed oscillations of the modified combinants are of physical origin and are not experimental artifacts. Modified combinants evaluated from models exhibit oscillatory behavior, though the oscillation period differs from experimental data [6].
In this presentation, we discuss how this approach can be used in nuclear collisions. We demonstrate how correlation functions can be related to combinants and illustrate how the information about just the sign of these correlation functions can be used in analyses of multiplicity distributions in nuclear collisions. It is argued that measuring couplings of the genuine multi-particle correlation functions could provide cleaner information on possible non-trivial dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.

,poster,Mapping the longitudinal structure of QGP via nuclear deformations in heavy ion collisions,"Lumeng, Liu",Fudan University,Unknown,"The initial longitudinal structure of QGP is essential for understanding its formation, evolution, and properties in heavy-ion collisions. However, current flow decorrelation methods are limited by non-flow contamination, restricting access to the QGP's full longitudinal profile. By comparing collisions involving nuclei of similar masses but different deformations, we introduce a new approach that varies the initial conditions independent of non-flow. This method enabled us to uncover multiple components of the longitudinal structure of elliptic flow ($v_2$) [1] and to develop a novel technique for extracting flow decorrelations across the entire rapidity range [2]. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach using full 3D hydrodynamic and transport models. We reveal that while deformation enhances the overall magnitude of $v_2$, it leaves the long-range component of its longitudinal profile unchanged. Additionally, we discovered two distinct components of the longitudinal structure: a global twisted geometry and localized rapidity fluctuations contributing to short- and medium-range flow decorrelations. This study presents a new way to disentangle long- and short-range flow decorrelations from non-flow backgrounds, providing a concrete example of how leveraging the structure differences between isobar nuclei can help us gain new insights into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.

Color glass condensation (CGC) is a strong candidate for the mechanism by which this occurs, but experimental verification has not yet been successful. In the ALICE experiment, with the aim of experimentally confirming CGC, we are developing Forward Calorimeter (FoCal), which consists of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a hadron calorimeter, to precisely measure the position and energy of direct photons and photons from $\pi^0$ decay, which can be the signals of CGC, in the forward region with small x. The FoCal electromagnetic calorimeter consists of low-granularity pad types and high-granularity pixel types, and we are developing a pad type electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E pad). Since FoCal will be installed at forward region of the beam axis where many neutrons will be irradiated, a p-type silicon sensor which has high neutron tolerance is used. To evaluate the performance of the sensor, a neutron irradiation test was conducted at RIKEN-RANS and a beam test experiment was conducted at TOHOKU-ELPH with positrons of various energies injected. In the ALICE experiment, a maximum neutron irradiation amount of about $10^{14} n_{eq}/cm^2$ is expected at the location where FoCal will be installed. In the RANS test, the dose to the silicon sensor was estimated by analyzing the indium foil dose, which has high sensitivity to neutron irradiation, placing around the silicon sensor. The results of the estimation indicate that the neutron dose to the sensor was about $6 × 10^{13} n_{eq}/cm$. The MIP (Minimum Ionizing Particle) signal of neutron-irradiated and of non-irradiated sensors were detected in the beam test data to evaluate the performance change of the sensors.

Due to their large masses, heavy quarks ($c, b$) are predominantly produced in the initial hard scattering process before the hot QCD medium forms. Their final-state dynamics, therefore, encode information about the evolution of the system, making them effective probes to the properties of the hot QCD medium. Charmonia, bound states of a charm and an anti-charm quark, are of particular interest. In high-energy hadronic collisions, inclusive $J/\psi$ production consists of both prompt and non-prompt components. The prompt component includes $J/\psi$ produced directly or from the decays of higher-mass charmonium states (e.g., $\psi$(2S) or $\chi_c$), while the non-prompt component originates from the weak decays of bottom hadrons. Therefore, the study of the production and properties of non-prompt $J/\psi$ would provide valuable insights into those of the beauty hadrons.

Some of these signatures, such as strangeness enhancement and collective flow, suggest that light-flavor hadron production arises from complex mechanisms whose relative contributions evolve smoothly from low to high multiplicity collisions. In this context, pp collisions cannot only be seen as a simple incoherent sum of parton-parton scatterings, contrary to the modelization in most Monte Carlo event generators, such as PYTHIA. Moreover, these signatures have historically been attributed to the strongly interacting medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. However, creating a medium in smaller collision systems challenges the current theoretical frameworks.

Studies on multi-differential strange particle production in small systems can be utilized to disentangle the various final state effects at play and represent an essential baseline for heavy-ion studies.

However, it is difficult to obtain large statistics with such experiments and the interpretation is model dependent, because of the involvement of many-body forces in the system.

Angular correlations between trigger hadrons, which serve as proxies for the jets, and their associated photons are extracted from ALICE simulations.

Since direct photons cannot be distinguished individually, their spectra are derived using a statistical approach. The decay photon spectra are derived from neutral hadron measurements, and subtracted from the inclusive measurements to extract the direct photon spectra. In this analysis, proton-proton collisions are simulated in Monte Carlo, using stand-alone PYTHIA at leading order (LO), and PYTHIA in combination with POWHEG at next-to-leading order (NLO), and compared with each other.

The MOST readout is based on global high-speed lines spanning the entire approximately $25~\mathrm{cm}$ long chip, which have successfully been operated. Procedures have been designed to select detector-grade ITS3 chips on wafer level using impedance measurements, powering tests, and functional tests. For MOSS, above $95\%$ of the chip area can be operated.

Due to their short lifespan, comparable with the duration of the hadronic phase, resonances can be affected by the competing re-scattering and regeneration mechanisms. In particular, their decay daughters interact elastically with other hadrons, altering their transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) distributions and affecting the measured resonance yields. Measurements of the ratio of yields of hadronic resonances to their ground state particles across various charged-particle multiplicities provide time information between chemical and kinetic freezeout. The ALICE experiment in the LHC Run 3 is best suited for resonance measurements because of its excellent tracking and PID capabilities over a broad momentum range.

However, in recent years, an enhanced production of charm baryons relative to mesons was observed compared to $\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}$ collisions, challenging the assumption of independent fragmentation adopted in pQCD calculations via the factorization theorem.
The observation has initiated a review of theory frameworks to explain the measurements by considering different process with respect to $\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}$ collisions. 
In particular, the measurements of charm baryons containing strangeness, such as $\Xi_{\mathrm{c}}^{0,+}$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{c}}^{0}$, might have good constraint power for the theory calculations, as their predictions undershoot the measurements even though they include different hadronization scenarios to describe the measurements.

Theoretical models like non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD), which include a color octet contribution, remain quite successful in explaining the charmonium production cross section at large transverse momenta and obtained in the past years a fair agreement with the data provided by experimental measurements on quarkonium polarization. Due to its higher mass, bottomonia satisfy better a non-relativistic theoretical treatment. Therefore, the corresponding polarization measurements in pp collisions provide a good testing ground for NRQCD. In particular, the large feed-down contribution to the observed bottomonia yield may dilute the expected polarization. This contribution can be further understood with more precise and differential measurements of $\Upsilon$ (nS) polarization. Finally, this measurement in pp will be an important baseline for a similar measurement in heavy-ion collisions. Indeed, in PbPb collisions, the presence of a strong magnetic field in the initial stage or a modification of the relative contribution between direct and feed-down bottomonium production may lead to a different measured polarization.

This geometrical shape results in different QGP path lengths for partons emitted at different angles, resulting in an azimuthal anisotropy of the energy loss. This anisotropy alters the $p_{\rm{T}}$ differential yield of jets and is quantified by the second-order flow coefficient, $v_2$, of the jets.

As a consequence, performance studies of the operating conditions of ALICE 3 that employ full simulation chains are very computationally demanding, especially in what concerns particle transport and detector response simulation. In this context, finding alternative representations of certain steps of full simulations is extremely useful. Such techniques are called `fast simulations' and reduce computing requirements by at least one order of magnitude.

In this work, we will present the current status of fast simulations of the ALICE 3 detector, including studies in which different tracker and particle identification setups are considered. We also elaborate on how current fast simulations make efficient use of resources by running entirely in physical memory and not storing anything except for the desired physics performance quantities.

On the other hand, it is pointed out that the \mbox{autocorrelation} between particles produced in association with the measured hadrons and the charged-particle multiplicity plays a role in the observed yield enhancement. Since W$^{\pm}$ bosons are insensitive to strong interaction, their production is expected to be less sensitive to CR effects than hadron production. Additionally, they are less correlated with the charged-particle multiplicity because they are mainly produced in isolation, i.e. without additional associated charged particles, reducing the impact of autocorrelation effects. Therefore, their measurements give insight into the multiplicity dependence of particle production in pp collisions.

Rescattering can alter the momentum of the resonance decay products, limiting their reconstruction through the invariant-mass technique, while pseudo-elastic scattering can regenerate them. An important final state observable for understanding these late-stage effects is the measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), which originates from the anisotropic expansion of the system driven by the initial spatial asymmetry in the collision geometry. Late-stage hadronic rescattering can alter the momentum distributions of resonances, thereby influencing their elliptic flow.

,poster,Multiplicity dependence of $D^{*\pm}$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6 $ TeV with ALICE at LHC,"Sharma, Deependra",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),India,"Heavy flavour hadrons are key probes for the investigation of the initial stage as well as the evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions. In fact, the heavy quarks possess masses larger than the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) scale parameters and therefore are mainly produced in hard scattering processes with large momentum transfer $Q^2$. For the same reason, their production in proton-proton (pp) collisions can be described by perturbative QCD calculations. In addition, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadrons as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions provides insights in the interplay between soft and hard processes and multi-parton interactions.

In this contribution, the first measurement of $D^{*\pm}$ production in different multiplicity classes using the large data sample of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV collected by the ALICE experiment during the LHC Run3, are presented. This includes the measurement of the $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section as well as the yield in different charged-particle multiplicity classes.

However, these phenomena alone do not conclusively indicate the formation of thermalized QCD matter. Higher-order cumulants ($\kappa_n$) of net-baryon distributions provide a more sensitive probe for the nature of thermalization in such collisions. Lattice QCD calculations, which consider a thermalized system of quarks and gluons, predict negative values for higher-order cumulants, $\kappa_5$ and $\kappa_6$, of the net-baryon number in the crossover regime at small baryon chemical potential ($\mu_\mathrm{B} \leq 110$ MeV). At LHC energies, pp collisions can achieve the highest multiplicities, allowing for tests of these lattice QCD predictions. We present the multiplicity dependence of cumulants of the net-proton number distributions up to the 6th order in pp collisions at top LHC energies, where the net-proton number serves as a proxy for the net-baryon number. The results are compared with corresponding results at lower collision energies from the STAR experiment at RHIC and with theoretical predictions from lattice QCD, the Thermal-FIST model, and the PYTHIA event generator.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Swati', 'last_name': 'Saha', 'fullName': 'Saha, Swati', 'id': '9294100', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (NISER) (IN)', 'emailHash': 'eb001b2c53e8766c9291029bcfe856fa', 'db_id': 9294100, 'person_id': 8899579}"

Balance functions of strange baryons are sensitive to production and transport of strange quarks and their hadronization to baryons during the evolution of hot QCD matter formed in heavy-ion collisions. They are also sensitive to the diffusion of up, down and strange quarks produced in QCD matter as well as strangeness and baryon susceptibilities.

In this work, the balance function of $\Lambda$ baryons is measured for different multiplicity classes in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV. The evolution of the widths of the near-side peak and integral of the balance function from low to high multiplicity classes are susceptible to production of $\mathrm{s}\bar{\mathrm{s}}$ quark pairs and their hadronization to hadrons. They could also, possibly, be sensitive to the presence of the QGP phase in very high multiplicity pp collisions at top LHC energies.

In recent years, measurements of charm-baryon production at the LHC have raised  questions on the modeling of heavy-quark hadronization. The relative abundances of charm baryons and mesons, assessed via measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios, represent an important tool to understand the charm hadronization process from pp to heavy-ion collisions. While qualitatively in agreement with recent measurements of $\Xi_{c}^{0,+}$/D$^0$ production ratio performed in pp collisions, models based on string fragmentation beyond leading colour approximation, statistical hadronization, or hadronization via coalescence are not able to quantitatively describe the data. Moreover, the comparison of measurements of charm baryon-to-meson production-yield ratios performed at midrapidity by ALICE and forward rapidity by LHCb seems to suggest a rapidity dependence, not predicted by model calculations or Monte Carlo generators. However, the significant uncertainties in the branching ratios of the various decay channels employed, particularly the $\Xi_{c}^+ \rightarrow {\rm p K}^- \pi^+$ channel used by LHCb, prevent drawing definitive conclusions.

In this contribution, the production mechanisms of light (anti)nuclei are investigated exploring nuclei-proton azimuthal correlations. ALICE measures, for baryon–baryon and anti-baryon–anti-baryon pairs, a near-side anti-correlation structure, which is not reproduced by commonly used Monte Carlo models like PYTHIA or EPOS, indicating a fundamental flaw in the production mechanism of baryons in these models.

,poster,First measurement of the Upsilon(1S) elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN = 5.36 TeV with ALICE,"Cerri, Rebecca",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"Quarkonia, which are bound states of heavy-flavor quark-antiquark pairs, have long been considered crucial probes for studying the quark–gluon plasma (QGP). In a simplified picture, the production of quarkonium is suppressed due to color screening within the QGP, formed during nucleus–nucleus collisions. A key observable in this context is the azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonia, providing valuable insights into the collective dynamics of particles in a strongly interacting medium. The measurement of this anisotropy is achieved through harmonic coefficients derived from the Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal particle distribution. In non-central collisions, the coefficient $v_2$ of the second harmonic measures the strength of the so-called elliptic flow and is the most important source of information on the degree of thermalization of the medium.
Due to the large mass of the beauty quark that may prevent its thermalization, the $\Upsilon(\mathrm{1S})$, a bound $b\overline{b}$ state, is expected to exhibit a lower $v_2$ with respect to the $J/\psi$, a $c\overline{c}$ bound state.
For these reasons, a study of the $\Upsilon(\mathrm{1S})$ flow with the latest data collected in ALICE from the recent LHC data-taking period may provide interesting insights on the degree of thermalization of the beauty quark.

The study is motivated by the idea that non-monotonic changes in $p_{\rm T}$ correlations with varying energy, if observed, may be taken as an indicator for the QGP formation. The mean $p_{\rm T}$ fluctuations are studied in terms of the two-particle correlator, $\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\rm T})_m$, which measures the strength of such fluctuations in units of mean $p_{\rm T}$. The dependence of $\sqrt{C_m}/M(p_{\rm T})_m$ on particle multiplicity in varying $p_{\rm T}$ window widths and positions has been analyzed. A study of soft, intermediate and hard $p_{\rm T}$ would significantly impact on understanding of equilibrium and thermal (radial flow), as well as non-thermal (jets/minijets) sources for $p_{\rm T}$ fluctuations.

A decreasing trend in correlator values with increasing charged particle multiplicity has been observed, following a power-law pattern. The dependence of the power--law coefficient on different $p_{\rm T}$ ranges has also been analyzed. To further investigate collective effects, within a common multiplicity range, correlators have been studied across different collision systems, such as p--Pb and Pb--Pb at $\sqrt{\it s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV and Xe--Xe at $\sqrt{\it s_{\rm NN}}=5.44$ TeV.

,poster,Studying the exotic hadron X(3872) in pp collisions at \sqrt{s} = 13.6 TeV with ALICE,"Abranches De Carvalho, Leopoldo",Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR),Unknown,"Exotic hadrons, such as tetraquarks, fall outside the traditional classification of mesons and baryons. Their production mechanisms remain poorly understood, although statistical, hydrodynamical, and coalescence models have attempted to predict their behavior. The first observation of such a particle was made by the Belle Collaboration in 2003, with the discovery of the X(3872). This study aims to measure the X(3872) exotic hadron in pp collisions using Run 3 data collected by the ALICE Experiment. During Long Shutdown 2, the ALICE Collaboration upgraded its sub-detectors to enhance data rate, resolution, track reconstruction, and particle identification. The current data-taking period, called Run 3, features much higher statistics in its measurements. The analysis focuses on the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ decay channel, where the J/ψ decays into electron-positron pairs. To improve the significance of the X(3872) signal, machine learning techniques have been applied, specifically through a boosted decision tree (BDT) classifier. This poster presents the invariant mass spectrum of the J/ψπ⁺π⁻ channel, along with the distribution of key kinematic variables, using both real data and Monte Carlo simulations generated with Pythia and EvtGen. Measuring the X(3872) with the ALICE Experiment is particularly valuable because it provides access to data at low transverse momentum, a region that other experiments have not extensively explored. This low-momentum analysis is crucial, as it may help determine whether the X(3872) is a compact tetraquark state or a loosely bound molecule of mesons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leopoldo', 'last_name': 'Abranches De Carvalho', 'fullName': 'Abranches De Carvalho, Leopoldo', 'id': '9294077', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR)', 'emailHash': '5c80142eabbf1ac1d9304622e4ab728e', 'db_id': 9294077, 'person_id': 8893441}"

By measuring the azimuthal-angle distribution between the direction of the tagged $\text{D}_{\text{s}}^{+}$ meson and those of the other charm hadronization products, it is possible to perform a multi-differential characterization of the charm hadronization process and obtain ininsight into the charm-jet structure. Compared to studies involving non-strange D mesons, the measurement of the $\text{D}_{\text{s}}^{+}$ meson allows us to explore a potential influence of strangeness on the charm hadronization process. Additionally, measurements in pp collisions serve as a reference for interpreting results from proton-nucleus (p--Pb) and nucleus-nucleus (Pb--Pb) collisions.
In Pb--Pb collisions, a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state is produced. Since charm quarks are produced in the early stages of the collision, before the QGP formation, they interact with the medium constituents through radiative and collisional processes, resulting in energy loss and modification of their original direction. As a result, sizable modifications to azimuthal correlation distributions are expected.

Charmonia are bound states consisting of a charm and an anti-charm quark. Their production process can be divided into two stages: the creation of the heavy quarks and the formation of the bound state. The first stage occurs during initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfer, which can be accurately described using perturbative QCD. The second stage, involving long-distance interactions and soft momentum scales, is a non-perturbative process. Studying the production of $\psi$(2S) in Pb-Pb collisions is important for understanding how quarkonium states are modified in the quark-gluon plasma. The $\psi$(2S) is more loosely bound than the J/$\psi$, and its amount of  suppression in the medium can provide insight into the effects of the deconfined medium. The double ratio of $\psi$(2S) to J/$\psi$ in Pb-Pb relative to pp collisions helps to quantify the differential suppression of these two states, offering a clearer picture of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and its impact on different charmonium states.

Among the aforementioned upgrades, the installation of the new muon forward tracker (MFT) enriches the study of quarkonium production previously carried out with the ALICE muon spectrometer at forward rapidity (2.5 < y < 4). In particular, thanks to its high spatial resolution, the MFT allows to identify the quarkonia directly produced at the collision (prompt) from those coming from beauty hadron decays (non-prompt). This separation is critical to enlarge our knowledge of heavy-quark production both in pp and heavy-ion collisions, including access to charmonia decaying from b-hadrons and clearer analysis of the quarkonia regeneration mechanism. Experimentally, the prompt/non-prompt separation performance relies on highly efficient track matching between the MFT and the muon spectrometer, together with the precise determination of the secondary vertex.

Exploring the dynamics of the hadronic phase reveals the roles of rescattering and regeneration in resonance production.

By analyzing the ratios of resonance yields to those of long-lived particles across various charged-particle multiplicities, valuable insights into hadronic interactions and system evolution are obtained.  Recent results from high-multiplicity pp and p–Pb collisions exhibit QGP-like signatures, including strangeness enhancement and collective expansion, closely resembling those in Pb–Pb collisions.

Moreover, the new ITS with its higher granularity and closer location to the interaction point improves the pointing resolution by a factor of 2 compared to that in Run 2, leading to a better topological separation of prompt thermal radiation and e$^{+}$e$^{-}$-pairs from HF hadron decays, and to smaller background from photon conversions in the detector material.

SiPMs are usually coupled to scintillators or Cherenkov radiators. Nonetheless, in recent studies it has been shown that SiPMs can directly detect charged particles due to the emission of Cherenkov light in the standard protection layer placed on top of the SiPM.

NUV-HD-LFv2 SiPMs, produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler with 3.20 x 3.12 mm$^2$ area and with different thickness of protection layers, have been tested in a beam-test setup at CERN PS.  The telescope is made of four sensors: two SiPMs under test and two LGAD detectors (1x1 mm$^2$ 25 um and 35 um thick sensors). The latter are used as timing reference and the coincidence of the two defines the trigger for the beam particles. The main results, obtained with a 4 GHz digital oscilloscope, confirm a very high efficiency above 99% and a noise below 1% for a threshold over 6-10 photoelectrons.

In addition, the performances after irradiation in terms of timing response and Dark Count Rate will be presented. They have been evaluated for NUV-HD-RH SiPMs of 1 x 1 mm$^2$ area, proving the possibility to maintain excellent timing performance close to 20 ps and low level of dark counts once an appropriate threshold is applied to the signal.

In the last beam test, SiPMs were also studied in a new and complete front-end and readout electronics chain made by a LIROC discriminator and a picoTDC with 3.05 ps bin size. In this poster, the efficiency with this setup will be reported for matrices made of 9 SiPMs, confirming to be above 95% at the lowest threshold achievable.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bianca', 'last_name': 'Sabiu', 'fullName': 'Sabiu, Bianca', 'id': '9294057', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)', 'emailHash': 'e80ece6e06465e863f83a4bde2f96a53', 'db_id': 9294057, 'person_id': 8872411}"

The first approach is dynamical fluidization, where the fluid is generated from a transport approach (SMASH) based on sufficient local energy density in the hadronic state by fluidizing hadrons, realizing a dynamic core-corona scenario. The fireball fluid is in this case generated with both energy and baryon currents, thus is not baryon-free.

The second approach is represented by MUlti Fluid simulation for Fast IoN collisions (MUFFIN) model, that treats the colliding nuclei as two cold baryon-rich fluids with the third fireball fluid emerging from their friction baryon-less (in the current implementation).

First the friction terms in the multifluid model and their counterparts, source terms in the dynamical fluidization approach are compared, exploring how the transport approach can inform the friction term formulation.

Lattice QCD calculations have shown that there is no critical point for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B \le $ 450 MeV and a few phenomenology models calculations have shown that the critical point could be at temperature of T ∼ 100 MeV and $\mu_B$ ∼ 600 $-$ 650 MeV [2–6]. 

Rapidity dependence of the higher order cumulant ratios have been argued to be sensitive to the QCD critical point [7]. In this talk, we will report rapidity dependence of both higher order cumulants and factorial cumulants of proton multiplicity distribution, up to $6^{th}$ order from Au+Au collisions, at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.2, 3.5 and 3.9 GeV (699 $\ge \mu_B \ge$ 633 MeV) from the STAR experiment at RHIC. Collision centrality dependence of these rapidity distributions and relevant ratios will be discussed. In addition, the results will be compared with the calculations from transport model UrQMD.

,poster,Measurement of dielectron production in Au+Au and U+U ultraperipheral collisions at STAR,"Jindal, Nicholas",Ohio State University (US),USA,"Dielectron production can occur in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions via the Breit-Wheeler process, in which the linearly polarized photons from the heavy ion fields interact to produce low transverse momentum dielectron pairs. This production is sensitive to the electromagnetic field distributions from the heavily Lorentz-contracted nuclei, which are directly dependent on the charge radius and shape of the atomic nucleus sourcing the photons. This can result in a non-isotropic azimuthal production, as well as shifts in the momentum-dependent production cross sections between different sourcing nuclei. Additionally, Sudakov radiation can result in an azimuthal modulation at higher pair momentum, so nuclear shape effects and constraints on the angular effects of soft photon radiation can both be measured for the first time.

In this talk, results will be presented of the first Breit-Wheeler measurement in U+U ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV, with comparisons to Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, to explore both nuclear shape effects on the cross sections, and the effects of both nuclear shape and Sudakov radiation on the azimuthal modulation strengths. Comparisons between gold and uranium show a sensitivity to nuclear shape differences at pair $p_{T}$ less than 60 MeV/c in both the cross sections and the angular modulations. Similarly, by measuring these modulations at pair $p_{T}$ above 60 MeV/c, qualitative results are observed that are in agreement with theory predictions for the effects of Sudakov radiation (Shao, et al. 2023).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nicholas', 'last_name': 'Jindal', 'fullName': 'Jindal, Nicholas', 'id': '9414259', 'affiliation': 'Ohio State University (US)', 'emailHash': '2bd03d071159dcfdb2c4dd9537c7a8a3', 'db_id': 9414259, 'person_id': 9157210}"

The $\phi$ mesons are reconstructed through their decay into $K^+ K^-$ pairs, enabled for the first time by the extended low transverse momentum ($p_T$) coverage provided by the STAR inner TPC upgrade. The $\phi$ meson measurements complement previous vector meson studies ($\rho^0$, $J/\psi$), allowing for investigations into the mass dependence of photoproduction processes and providing new insights into the nuclear gluon distribution.

In this presentation, we report coherent $\phi$ photoproduction differential cross sections as functions of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y$). Our comparative analysis with the previous STAR measurements shows that the $\phi$ meson photoproduction cross section falls between those of $\rho^0$ and $J/\psi$, highlighting the transition from soft to hard photoproduction regimes.

The resonance and continuum  $\pi^+ \pi^-$  production originate from distinct  $\gamma A$  and  $\gamma \gamma$  processes offering unique opportunities to investigate production mechanisms and interference dynamics. The continuum $\pi^+ \pi^-$  production is dominated by single virtual $\pi^+ / \pi^-$  nucleus scattering in the Drell-Söding process, which has never been precisely measured. Due to the absence of the intermediate $\rho^0$  and its unique production mechanism, the Drell-Söding measurement could provide a new and unprecedented insight into the entanglement purity and interference dynamics. The $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^-$ process also contributes to the continuum  $\pi^+ \pi^-$  production. EESI between the $\gamma \gamma $ and $\gamma A$ pathways produces a clean  $A_{1\Delta \phi}$ signal that can be used to isolate the hadronic light-by-light process from the dominant Drell-Söding process for the first time: a result that may provide new theoretical constraints on the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In addition, the measurement of  $\pi^+ \pi^-$  photoproduction in peripheral collisions could investigate the possible decoherence caused by interactions with the created medium and the impact parameter dependence of EESI as well as decoherence due to breakup of the nucleus.

,poster,Studying non-perturbative QCD with jet substructure measurements in 200 GeV $pp$ collisions at STAR,"Song, Youqi",Unknown,Unknown,"Non-perturbative QCD processes have significant effects on jet evolution but remain poorly understood. To study these effects, we measure two novel jet observables, the CollinearDrop (CD) jet mass and the charge correlation ratio ($r_c$), with jets reconstructed in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV at the STAR experiment.

In this talk, we present measurements of the CD jet mass, which is related to the  difference of the jet mass and the SoftDrop groomed mass, and so is by construction sensitive to soft radiation within jets. We compare the measurements with predictions from the NLL SCET calculations and event generator simulations. A multi-dimensional unfolding technique, MultiFold, allows us to further access the fully corrected correlations among the CD jet mass and the SoftDrop jet observables to probe the interplay between different stages of the parton shower. Our measurement indicates that there is a correlation between the amount of early-stage non-perturbative radiation and the time at which the first hard splitting happens. 

We also present the $r_c$ measurement that probes the contributions of string-like hadronization, by distinguishing the charge signs of leading and subleading charged particles within jets. Compared with event generator predictions, our measurement shows that both PYTHIA and HERWIG over-predict the string-like correlation between the leading hadrons.

Two- and three-point energy correlators have been shown experimentally in proton-proton collisions to describe both the perturbative and non-perturbative evolution of a jet, with a transition between the two at a fixed energy scale. In heavy-ion collisions, the medium has been seen to quench jets and modify their substructure. Energy correlators can potentially isolate these modifications to identifiable angular scales, including the onset of effects such as color coherence and the medium wake.

In this talk, the first measurement of N-point energy correlators in isobar collisions (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) at RHIC at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be shown.

,poster,Studying path-length dependent energy loss using jet $v_1$ and event shape engineered high momentum probes in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR,"Mooney, Isaac",Yale University,Unknown,"Studying its path-length dependence is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of parton energy loss in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. A path-length asymmetry along impact parameter direction ($x$) exists for hard probes in heavy-ion collisions at finite rapidity, as the QGP bulk is tilted in reaction plane, while the hard scattering profile is not [2]. Previous measurements of $v_1$ (= $\langle p_x/p_T \rangle$) of $D^0$-mesons have demonstrated sensitivity of hard produced partons to this path-length asymmetry [2,3]. Measurements of jet $v_1$ will provide access to path-length dependent energy loss of partons in the QGP. The jet $v_1$ measurements do not get contributions from event-by-event geometry fluctuations, unlike measurements relative to the second order event plane. Measurements therefore of in- and out-of-plane yield ratios of hard probes in events with different second-order eccentricities offer complementary information on this effect in the QGP. 

In this talk we present the first measurement of inclusive charged jet and high-$p_T$ charged hadron $v_1$ in Au+Au and Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr (isobar) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by STAR. Jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and radius dependence of jet $v_1$ will be shown. We will also present an evaluation of the initial path-length asymmetry from the tilted bulk, utilizing models describing the measured pseudorapidity dependence of particle production in asymmetric collisions and discuss future opportunities with event shape engineering (ESE) for the first order anisotropy.

Affecting positively and negatively charged quarks differently, the fleeting EM field contributes to the splitting between their directed flows ($v_1$) and eventually between particles and anti-particles. Features of initial baryon configuration may also impact the $v_1$ splitting between baryons and anti-baryons. In this talk, we present measurements of $v_1(y)$ and $\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ for $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $p$($\bar{p}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7-19.6 GeV and in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$193 GeV, as well as of $\Lambda^0$($\bar{\Lambda}^0$) and $\Xi^-$($\bar{\Xi}^+$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$7.7-27 GeV. 

With the exception of $\pi^{\pm}$ at top RHIC energies, negative values of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$ and $p$($\bar{p}$) $\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ are observed in peripheral collisions in both Au+Au and U+U collisions. Clear system-size dependence can be observed for $p$($\bar{p}$) $\Delta (dv_1/dy)$ with an ordering of U+U $>$ Au+Au $>$ isobar but not for $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$.

,poster,System size dependence of strange hadron production  at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV at STAR,"Fang, Yi",Tsinghua University,Unknown,"Strangeness production serves as a sensitive probe of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, it is proposed that the $\Omega/\phi$ ratios in different colliding systems may reveal the minimum colliding system size required to produce the QGP. In Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV significant $\Omega$ enhancement over $\phi$ has been observed at intermediate transverse momentum ($p_T$) in central collisions, which can be explained by their production through the coalescence of strange quarks in the QGP. In addition, an intriguingly smooth increase in (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity was first reported at LHC energies, and it is critical to investigate this ratio at RHIC energies. Finally, strange hadron to strange anti-hadron ratio can be used to constrain the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at chemical freeze-out temperature. The versatility of RHIC to change the size of the colliding ions provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate strangeness production as a function of system size. In 2021, STAR collected a large O+O dataset at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. O+O is a unique symmetric small system allowing for a more straightforward geometry mapping with centrality than with asymmetric small systems. In addition, the high-quality O+O dataset will allow us to precisely map the (multi)strange hadron to pion yield versus multiplicity.

Of these symmetries, the universal symmetry of CPT is one of the most fundamental, underpinning both Quantum Field Theory and the General Theory of Relativity. CPT symmetry requires that all systems are invariant under a simultaneous reversal of charge, parity and time direction. This symmetry further requires that the mass of every type of matter be exactly the same as its anti-matter counterpart. 

Using the data of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV collected by the STAR experiment in 2018, we report the mass difference between three nuclei and their anti-matter counterparts -  $^{3}H$, $^{3}He$, and $^{4}He$ - to test CPT symmetry.

,poster,"Probing isospin violation under strong B-fields via production   of $K^{*0,\pm}$ mesons in Au+Au, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, O+O and p+p collisions at RHIC","Singha, Subhash",Institute of Modern Physics CAS,Unknown,"In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the initial strong magnetic (B) field can give rise to a broad range of phenomena, such as the splitting of Landau levels under strong B-fields, which has significant implications in QCD [1]. The neutral ($K^{*0}$) and charged ($K^{*\pm}$) vector mesons have similar masses and isospin; however, their quark magnetic moments differ by a factor of five, making them ideal probes for studying Landau level splitting and potential isospin symmetry breaking in the presence of B-fields [2]. The recent observation of isospin violation in neutral and charged kaons by NA61/SHINE challenges the assumption of isospin symmetry in QCD, though the cause remains unknown [3]. A difference in $K^{*0,\pm}$ yields due to B-field can feeddown  ($K^{*0} \rightarrow K^{\pm} + \pi^{\mp}$, $K^{*\pm} \rightarrow K_{S}^{0} +\pi^{\pm}$) into the inclusive neutral and charged kaon yields, and contribute to the above apparent isospin violation.

In this talk, we will present the invariant mass peak position and its width, transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra, yields ($dN/dy$), and $\langle p_{T} \rangle$ of $K^{*0,\pm}$ mesons near mid-rapidity, utilizing collisions involving isospin-asymmetric nuclei (Au+Au, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and isospin-symmetric nuclei (O+O), as well as p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We report on particle ratios, including $K^{*\pm}/K^{*0}$ and $K^{\pm}/K_{S}^{0}$, as a function of $p_{T}$ and centrality in various heavy-ion collision systems. Results from p+p collisions, which are expected to have no B-field effect,  serve as a good baseline. Additionally, results from BES-II Au+Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 - 19.6$ GeV) will be presented to study the energy dependence of the above ratios.

,poster,"$\phi$-meson Local, Global, and Helicity Frame Spin Alignment at STAR","Robertson III, Charles",Purdue University,USA,"In non-central heavy-ion collisions, large orbital angular momentum and strong vorticity fields are produced and predicted to polarize quark spins. Unexpectedly large global spin alignment ($\rho_{00}$) values for ${\phi}$(1020) mesons have been reported in the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) in Au+Au collisions [1]. These values exceed conventional expectations based on global hyperon polarization induced by orbital angular momentum, suggesting the possible presence of a strong force field for $\phi$ mesons [2].

Previous $\rho_{00}$ measurements use a 1D angular distribution in $\theta^*$ (polar angle of a daughter kaon in the $\phi$ meson's rest frame with respect to the orthogonal of the harmonic event plane). We will use both angular dimensions $\theta^*$ and $\beta$ of a daughter kaon in the $\phi$ meson's rest frame, where $\beta$ is the azimuthal angle within the harmonic event plane, measured relative to the positive beam axis. This technique enables off-diagonal element extraction with fewer assumptions regarding the decay daughter distributions. We will present differential measurements of $\phi$-meson $\rho_{00}$ and off-diagonal spin density matrix elements, using data from the second phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-19.6$ GeV collected by STAR. Results will be shown as functions of rapidity (y), centrality, and transverse momentum ($p_{T}$). Additionally, we will present differential helicity frame spin alignment results to test their predicted relation with global spin alignment [3].

We will also present $\rho_{00}$ results using two alternative extraction methods: (i) $\langle\cos^2\theta^*\rangle$ and (ii) $\langle\cos2\phi^* \rangle$ (where $\phi^*$ is the projection of $\theta^*$ onto the transverse plane) as a function of the kaon pair invariant mass. For these approaches, we explore data-driven methods to correct for detector acceptance and efficiency. We further investigate the $\phi$ meson local spin alignment in Au+Au as well as d+Au collisions at 200 GeV, where the quantization axis lies along the beam axis.

The results presented in this talk can help clarify the possible link of global spin alignment to vector meson fields and their contributions to the evolution of nuclear matter.

,poster,Addressing theoretical uncertainties in Bayesian inference for heavy-ion physics,"Jaiswal, Sunil",Ohio State University,USA,"Bayesian inference in heavy-ion physics often produces varying estimates of model parameters when varying the physics model and/or the prior assumptions, reflecting a lack of accounting for theoretical uncertainties. Traditionally, a good model-to-data fit is seen as success, with inferred parameters assumed to reflect underlying physics. However, theories have limitations and extending a theory beyond its scope without including model uncertainties not only leads to incorrect parameter estimates, rendering them as mere fitting variables, but also reduces the utility of the data. To address this we propose a statistical framework that accounts for theoretical uncertainties in multistage heavy-ion models. We test this framework using ""measurements"" of $p_T$-differential observables obtained from a ""true"" theory - a $2+1$d hydrodynamic simulation with a known fixed value for the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ that employs a Grad 14-moment particlization prescription. We use these observables to calibrate via Bayesian inference a different hydrodynamic simulation model that uses a parametrization of $(\eta/s)(T)$ as a function of the temperature and applies a different particlization ansatz. Our Bayesian inference framework allows for theoretical uncertainties by including model discrepancy in its statistical modeling. We compare the inferred values for the specific shear viscosity with and without the uncertainty model, demonstrating its impact on posterior inference of $\eta/s$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sunil', 'last_name': 'Jaiswal', 'fullName': 'Jaiswal, Sunil', 'id': '9294022', 'affiliation': 'Ohio State University', 'emailHash': 'c02fa19eb68a93d0ef95599df70101c7', 'db_id': 9294022, 'person_id': 8925655}"

The physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (RHIC's), but this approach could be of interest also for astrophysical and cosmological problems, since our formulation is valid for a general coordinate system with a non-trivial metric tensor. Our method is based on a generalization of the well-known Müller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory to explicitly include electromagnetic effects in the constitutive relations, by requiring that the new contributions to the entropy current locally satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. The latter condition allows us to retrieve some of the terms appearing in the evolution equations for the dissipative fields derived from more microscopic methods, which rely on kinetic theory, such as the relaxation-time (RTA) or the 14-moment approximations for a single quark flavour. Finally, we extend our treatment to the more general situation of multiple conserved charges, which in RHIC's can be identified with the baryon number, the electric charge and the strangeness of the system and which arise from the independent conservation of the three light-quark flavours $u$, $d$ and $s$.

By leveraging fuzzy logic, this approach addresses the uncertainties inherent in overlapping detector signals, thereby enhancing the reliability of the measurements. The mathematical framework developed here is shown to be effective across various simulation models, demonstrating its versatility.

The nuclear  matter  produced  in  such  collisions  reaches  extreme  densities  and  temperatures  [2,  3,  4], comparable to those found in neutron stars, especially during their mergers [5].  By measuring the kinematic distributions of emitted particles and comparing them to transport model calculations – many aspects of the nuclear matter can be understood.

Particles  containing  the  (anti)strange  quark  are  of  particular  interest,  as  they  are  produced sparsely in this energy regime and act as good probes of their interaction with the medium.  For charged K mesons it is predicted that due to their interaction in nuclear matter, their effective mass and decay constant should change [6].  This phenomenon was investigated by other experiments, but so far without a definitive conclusion [7].  Another interesting particle species is the Λ baryon, due to its predicted role in the so-called hyperon puzzle [8], where its interaction potential with nucleonic matter is an important piece of the “puzzle”.

It is predicted that the transverse flow – anisotropies in particle emission in the azimuthal angle (around the beam axis) – of strange hadrons should be sensitive to their interaction with the nuclear medium surrounding them during the collision [7, 9].  As such, studying the transverse flow of these particles may bring a significant advantage in our understanding of hadronic matter in the studied energy range.

This contribution will contain preliminary maps of $v_n$ coefficients in the momentum phase space of strange hadrons – K$^\pm$ mesons and Λ baryons – emitted from Ag+Ag collisions at a beam energy of 1.58 GeV/nucleon. The work is in progress, however, the results may already provide insight into the kaon-nucleon interaction.  The transverse flow of Λ baryons is the first such result in this energy regime.

By measuring changes in particle yields as a function of energy, one can explore the properties of matter at the phase transition. The NA61/SHINE experiment, a fixed-target project at the SPS facility at CERN, conducted a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter by varying both the beam momentum (from 13 to 150/158 GeV/c) and the size of the colliding ions (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This approach offers a unique opportunity to deepen our understanding of the phase transition.
A key objective of the NA61/SHINE program is to investigate the properties at the onset of deconfinement (specifically, the energy threshold for the transition from a hadron gas to quark-gluon plasma) by measuring the strangeness-to-entropy ratio in the produced system. This presentation will discuss the latest results on charged hadron production, focusing on kaons, pions, and their ratios in Pb+Pb interactions. The NA61/SHINE results will be compared with available world data, providing a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the phase transition.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Syed Uzair Ahmed', 'last_name': 'Shah', 'fullName': 'Shah, Syed Uzair Ahmed', 'id': '9293998', 'affiliation': 'Jan Kochanowski University (PL)', 'emailHash': '4874e83b34ed5c1c9cdcfe06d516fd9e', 'db_id': 9293998, 'person_id': 8911629}"

Due to differences in mass and color charge, heavy-flavor jets are expected to fragment differently from jets originating from light partons.

One key initial condition is the presence of a strong electromagnetic field, which induces charge splitting between particles and antiparticles and has important implications for the QCD phase transition and the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) [1]. Another crucial aspect of the initial state is the deposition of baryon charge, which can be specifically probed through the directed flow of baryons, offering insights into baryon transport within the QGP [2].

In this poster, we shall present measurements of directed flow $(v_1)$ for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and $p(\bar{p})$ in Au+Au, isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, and U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV, as recorded by the STAR experiment at RHIC. For the first time, we observe a clear system size dependence in the slope, $dv_1/dy$, for $p (\bar{p})$ and the difference in slope between particle and antiparticle, $\Delta(dv_1/dy)$, while the sum of the slopes for baryons ($p+\bar{p}$) shows no such dependence. In contrast, neither the difference nor the sum of the $v_1$ slopes for mesons ($\pi^\pm$ and $K^\pm$) shows system size dependence [3]. This behavior is qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic model, providing insights into baryon deposition and transport. Additionally, the observed $\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ pattern across different systems may also help constrain the strength of electromagnetic fields and the conductivity of the medium.

,poster,Exploring the interplay of global and helicity-frame spin density matrix elements,"Ye, Zhenyu",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Conventional physics mechanisms such as $s(\bar{s})$ spin polarization fail to accommodate this $\rho_{00}$ signal, motivating further exploration into its origin. Recently, studies from a general framework using the gauge/gravity duality predict that in heavy ion collisions, there could be non-zero helicity-frame spin alignment generated by the relative motion of $s\bar{s}$ pairs to the thermal background. This helicity frame spin alignment could lead to significant global $\rho_{00}$ [2]. It has also been shown that both the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of a vector meson's spin density matrix are sensitive to local spin correlations between the quark and anti-quark [3]. In this talk, we explore the relationships between $\phi$-meson global and helicity-frame spin density matrix elements through Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a new method to extract $\rho_{00}$ simultaneously with the off-diagonal elements from the 2-dimensional angular dimensions, i.e., the polar and azimuthal angles of the direction of a daughter kaon's momentum in the $\phi$-meson's rest frame with respect to the chosen spin-quantization axis. This 2-dimensional method allows us to consider possible effects from finite geometric acceptance and detector efficiencies, which could couple to the spin density matrix elements and non-trivially influence the extraction of these elements. The effects of finite elliptic flow and various kinematic selections are also examined. The studies discussed in this talk follow our recent work in [4].

,poster,Many-observable analysis of jet quenching using Bayesian inference,"Jonas, Florian",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"The JETSCAPE Collaboration presents a new, many-observable Bayesian inference analysis of the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$, now incorporating jet substructure and coincidence measurements in addition to inclusive hadron and inclusive jet RAA that were used in a recently-reported calibration [1]. This study continues the JETSCAPE program of expanding Bayesian inference analysis to incorporate a broad range of jet quenching data. The analysis utilizes a multi-stage theoretical model of virtuality-dependent jet-medium interactions based on MATTER and LBT, and detailed hydrodynamic modeling of the QGP from a previous Bayesian calibration. Correlations and tension of constraints on $\hat{q}$ due to the different probes and different kinematic ranges are explored to elucidate the information carried by various observables. This study tests the theoretical description of jet quenching in various ways, and enables quantitative comparison of different model formulations of jet quenching. identifying those aspects of the formulation which are not consistent with data. Observable sensitivity is explored, providing insight into which measurements are most discriminative of model parameters. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of jet interactions in matter and their theoretical description, and point to next steps in the field for comprehensive understanding of jet quenching as a probe of the QGP.

This emphasizes the significance of initial nuclear geometry and raises questions about the applicability of hydrodynamic evolution in this regime. Investigating collective signals in these small systems can provide critical insights into the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma.
To explore this, we compare several models: the hadronic transport model SMASH, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid approach, and Angantyr, which serves as a baseline without collective effects. Our setup allows to compare calculations with and without hydrodynamic evolution on equal footing. We calculate the elliptic and triangular flow coefficients as a function of centrality and multiplicity in O-O collisions at sqrt(s)=7TeV, using both Woods-Saxon and alpha-clustered nuclear configurations.

We investigate two mechanisms of final-state interaction that may become significant when the phase-space density of partons in a jet reaches high levels: (1) two-to-two partonic rescattering and (2) two-to-one merging of parton pairs with small invariant mass. These processes are implemented approximately after the PYTHIA8 shower, with careful modeling of spacetime structure and tracking of color flow in the final-state interactions.

,poster,Abrupt switching from hadron resonance gas to quark-gluon plasma at smooth chiral crossover,"Ivanytskyi, Oleksii",University of Wroclaw,Unknown,"Based on a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach to thermodynamics of QCD we explain why the abundances of hadrons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are well described by the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model with a sudden chemical freeze-out at a well-defined hadronization temperature despite the fact that state of the art results of lattice QCD indicate a smooth chiral crossover. The hadrons are treated as color singlet multiquark clusters in medium with a background gluon field in the Polyakov gauge coupled to the underlying chiral quark dynamics. The confining aspect of QCD is accounted for by a large vacuum quark mass motivated by a confining density functional approach. At low temperatures the HRG phase appears as a statistical ensemble of the multiquark clusters. Restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperatures triggers their Mott dissociation and deconfinement of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). While perfectly reproducing the smooth behavior of entropy density [1] and chiral condensate of lattice QCD [2], the approach indicates an abrupt switching between the hadrons and partons. This is manifested by a rapid change of the ratio of baryon number susceptibilities $\chi^B_4/\chi^B_2$ from the value of HRG to the one of QGP [2]. We report for the first time that $\chi^B_4/\chi^B_2$ shall not be mistaken for a measure of the fraction of hadrons in the system. Its deviation from unity below the chiral restoration temperature can actually quantify a repulsive residual interactions in the HRG. We associate it with the effects of Pauli blocking and model by a temperature dependent correction to the phase shift of baryons, in accordance with lattice QCD results on $\chi^B_4/\chi^B_2$ [2].

The photodetector will cover $\sim$ 3 m$^{2}$ with 3$\times$3 mm$^{2}$ pixels, for a total of more than 300k readout channels. This will be the first application of SiPMs for single-photon detection in a HEP experiment. SiPMs are chosen for their low cost and immunity to high magnetic fields ($\sim$ 1 T at the dRICH location). However, they are not radiation hard, demanding careful testing and attention to preserve single-photon counting capabilities and to maintain the dark count rates (DCR) under control over the years of running of the ePIC experiment. DCR control is achieved with operation at low temperature and recovery of the radiation damage via high-temperature annealing cycles. The exploitation of the SiPM precise timing with fast TDC electronics helps to reduce further the effect of DCR as background signal.

In this talk we present an overview of the ePIC-dRICH detector system, designed to provide continuous hadron identification in a broad momentum range from $\sim$ 3 GeV/c to $\sim$ 50 GeV/c in the forward region (1.5 < $\eta$ < 3.5).

,poster,Quarkonium medium response with dynamical hydro simulation from small to large systems,"Park, Jaebeom",Korea University (KR),KR,"Quarkonia are golden probes for studying the properties of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. Various measurements for different quarkonium species at RHIC and the LHC indicate that their suppression levels follow the ordering of their binding energies. Additionally, recombination effects are substantial in nucleus-nucleus collisions, particularly charmonium states. However, questions still remain about disentangling the various in-medium effects and how they contribute to the final observables.
On the other hand, quarkonium production in small systems is another complex topic, with recent unexpected experimental results. 
SHINCHON (Simulation for Heavy IoN Collision with Heavy-quark and ONia) is a simulation framework that tries to address these challenges with tracking the quarkonium survival probabilities during the space-time evolution of the medium. The interaction mechanisms are based on theoretical calculations of gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering. These effects are embedded within a hydrodynamical event generator (superSONIC) that uses initial geometry information from Glauber MC. The hydrodynamical setup reproduces observed event multiplicity and flow harmonics in data. SHINCHON qualitatively describes the modification of bottomonium states in Pb–Pb and Au-Au collisions found in data, including nuclear absorption effects at RHIC energies [1,2]. 
For small systems, we present the modifications in p-Pb collisions in comparison with data and provide predictions for p-O and O-O collisions [1]. Lastly, we discuss the factors affecting the relative modifications of excited and ground states for both charmonia and bottomonia, motivated by recent experimental results.

As the primary tracking detector of the CBM experiment, the Silicon Tracking System (STS) is engineered to efficiently reconstruct trajectories of charged particles, achieving a momentum resolution better than 2% within a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to be capable of identifying complex decay topologies. The STS consists of 876 modules arranged in eight tracking stations, keeping a low material budget of less than 10% X₀. The core component of STS is the detector module, which integrates double-sided, double-metal silicon microstrip sensors connected via low-mass microcables to custom-developed readout ASICs mounted on two front-end electronics boards.
Currently, the STS project is focused on the series production of modules and ladders for the final detector. This phase involves precise assembly and rigorous quality control procedures at every fabrication step. Comprehensive functional and thermal stress testing is conducted on fully assembled modules to ensure their reliability before integration onto carbon-fiber ladders. Simultaneously, the operational capabilities of the STS modules are assessed in various application scenarios, including high-intensity nucleus-nucleus collisions at GSI facilities and the E16 experiment at J-PARC, which serve as platforms for performance evaluation.

,poster,Energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations in Au–Au collisions from a multiphase transport model,"Zhang, Liuyao",Fudan University (CN),Unknown,"We extensively investigate the mean transverse momentum fluctuations concerning centrality and energy dependences in Au–Au collisions at 3.0–19.6 GeV using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. Inspired by prior research, we have adjusted the key parameter, the Lund string fragmentation parameter bL, to manifest an approximately linear dependence on the impact parameter. Consequently, the mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩ appropriately demonstrates a dependence on centrality classes. In addition, the dependence of bL on the impact parameter systematically increases with rising beam energy. This adjustment enables the AMPT model to reasonably describe the energy dependence of mean transverse momentum ⟨pT⟩. The improved AMPT provides a reliable platform to calculate pT fluctuations by qualitatively describing the data production of pion^± in 0–5% centrality around midrapidity (|y|< 0.1) at available incident energies. In line with previous findings, power-law dependences of pT cumulants of all orders on collision centrality N_{part} are observed at higher energies. Furthermore, the scaled cumulants normalized by the mean ⟨pT⟩ are computed, and the corresponding variances align well with the trends observed in experimental measurements. Then, the scaled cumulants also are applied using two subevent methods, where the component of short-range correlation is suppressed compared to the calculations performed using the standard method.

State-of-the-art inputs from multi-disciplinary physics (like the chiral effective field theory, astrophysical observations, and perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)) can constrain QM in NSs. We show this by imposing new constraints on the widely accepted phenomenological MIT Bag model for QM, allowing for a mixed phase, and further using them to comment on the phase of matter in NS cores. We also find that the pQCD constraint is crucial in constraining the strong interaction coupling at NS energies. If the deconfined QM is more stable than ordinary nuclear matter, such a phase transition is known to form exotic compact objects known as Strange Stars (SSs) made of strange quark matter. We discuss various observational signatures and how the future gravitational wave detectors and the upcoming electromagnetic telescopes can be used to probe quark matter in neutron stars.

,poster,Visualizing How the Structure of Jets Shapes the Structure of Their Wakes,"Kudinoor, Arjun Srinivasan",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"We begin by using Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce experimental results published by ATLAS in 2023 on $R_{AA}$ for $R=1$ jets in Pb+Pb collisions. These jets are identified by first reconstructing anti-$k_t$ $R=0.2$ subjets and then re-clustering them. Following ATLAS, we investigate how $R_{AA}$ for these large-radius jets depends on the angle between the two subjets involved in the final clustering step of the $R=1$ jet. We also study the dependence of $R_{AA}$ for these jets on the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), defined such that the medium can only resolve partons in the jet shower that are separated by more than this length scale. Our investigation suggests that measurements like those pioneered by ATLAS can constrain the resolution length of QGP.

We also use this setup to analyze the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two $R=0.2$ subjets, produced in gamma-jet events, and identified as above. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in the droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when two hard subjets are 0.8 to 1.0 radians apart, a single broad wake is produced. When the two subjets are even farther apart, the presence of two sub-wakes is revealed. In our Monte Carlo study, the new observables that we introduce allow us to visualize how jet structure shapes jet wakes unambiguously. We close by showing that similar clarity may be achieved experimentally by measuring the jet shape observables we have introduced using only those hadrons with low transverse momenta.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arjun Srinivasan', 'last_name': 'Kudinoor', 'fullName': 'Kudinoor, Arjun Srinivasan', 'id': '9292843', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': 'a69a95883be750112891691c4bada5d2', 'db_id': 9292843, 'person_id': 8899135}"
,poster,New angles on energy correlators,"Budhraja, Ankita",Nikhef,Unknown,"Energy correlators have come to the forefront for studying high energy particle collisions. Their natural separation of physical effects at different scales have made them very attractive for studying a wide range of phenomena in high energy particle physics. E.g. the most precise measurement of the strong coupling from jet substructure has been obtained using energy correlators. Recently, we introduced a new parameterization that features a simpler phase space and preserves the information on orientation of the particles. Concretely, our new parameterization reduces the computational cost of computing an N-point correlator on a jet with M particles to M^2 log(M), independent of the value of N. This computational speed up would be very beneficial in aiding the ongoing studies of energy correlators in the medium where M is typically very large. Finally, I will also introduce resolved N-point energy correlators that encode angular correlations between greater number of particles and demonstrate the superior visualization our approach offers in this regard.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ankita', 'last_name': 'Budhraja', 'fullName': 'Budhraja, Ankita', 'id': '9292839', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef', 'emailHash': 'e5d3cfc9637b3375d79999f5db2c706b', 'db_id': 9292839, 'person_id': 8937168}"
,poster,Probing dynamical magnetic field lifetime and chiral symmetry restoration with beam energy dependence of CME observables,"Akridge, Zachary",Indiana University,USA,"The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a novel transport phenomenon that offers the unique opportunity for experimental observation of transitions between different vacuum topological sectors of QCD. A measurement of the CME signal also helps probe the dynamical magnetic field as well as chiral symmetry restoration, which are key ingredients of the phenomenon. Significant efforts have been made to search for the CME in heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC. Very recently (2024) the STAR Collaboration reported interesting new measurements from Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) data and extracted CME signals over a broad energy range. The results show a strong signal (~3 sigma) around the intermediate energy range which approaches zero at both low and high energy. Such a highly nontrivial pattern calls for theoretical understanding. This talk presents much-needed calculations aimed at deciphering the interpretations of these new data, based on an improved event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics (EBE-AVFD) framework that is suitable for BES-II energies and well-calibrated with experimental data on bulk properties. At each specific beam energy, we then generate a large sample of EBE-AVFD simulation events and compute the inclusive correlation observables as well as the background-removed signal contributions. We further utilize Bayesian analysis to extract the key parameters, such as magnetic field lifetime and initial axial charge, from the latest experimental measurements. This allows us to map out the beam energy dependence of those key parameters. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for how the dynamical magnetic field lifetime as well as the chiral symmetry restoration evolve with beam energy in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Akridge', 'fullName': 'Akridge, Zachary', 'id': '9292836', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University', 'emailHash': 'bdb4e5c81f529fcbe01d558777b94839', 'db_id': 9292836, 'person_id': 8925230}"
,poster,Shear and bulk viscosities of gluon plasma across the transition temperature,"Zhang, Cheng",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Shear and bulk viscosities are two key transport coefficients that characterize the fundamental properties of quark-gluon plasma. They quantify the response of the energy-momentum tensor to the shear flow and divergent flow, serving as crucial input parameters for the phenomenological and transport models that interpret experimental data, e.g. the elliptic flow $v_2$. 

  However, calculating these inherently non-perturbative viscosities within lattice QCD presents challenges due to strong ultraviolet fluctuations in the relevant operators. The traditional approach using the multi-level algorithm has the limitation that it applies only in the quenched approximation, as done in [1, 2]. Recently, the gradient flow method was introduced to address this issue [3], opening the path to studies in full QCD. However, [3] examined only a single temperature, $1.5T_c$. 

  In this talk, we present results extending [3] to a wide temperature range from $0.76T_c $ to $2.25T_c $,  with particular focus on the phase transition region and high-temperature regime. The former helps us to understand how the system behaves under the critical change, a topic of wide concern in the community. The latter allows us to compare against the NLO perturbative estimate, which becomes more reliable at high temperature.  The methodology developed in this study positions us well for a full QCD calculation in the near future.

,poster,Novel ways for accessing the spatial structure of polarized light ions,"Schenke, Bjoern",Brookhaven National Lab,USA,"We present new opportunities to explore the structure of light nuclei leveraging the ability of future facilities to perform collisions with polarized deuterons and other light ions. First, we study diffractive vector meson production at small-x in the collision of electrons and polarized deuterons as anticipated at the Electron Ion Collider. We consider the polarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which results in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when the deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from the azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section exhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized deuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius provides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave function at small-x. We further study anisotropic flow with respect to the polarization axis in Pb+d collisions which will be possible at SMOGII at the LHC. This measurement is sensitive to the spatial structure of the deuteron via the conversion of initial geometry to observable momentum distributions by final state effects. Both measurements will provide new independent insight into the spatial structure of polarized deuterons. The same methods can be applied to other light ions, such as $^3$He, $^7$Li, or $^{7,9}$Be.

Taylor expansion around $μ_i = 0$ with $i = B, Q, S$ enables to cover with confidence the region up to $\frac{μ_i}{T} < 2.5$, and is usually limited at 450 MeV in any chemical potential. Thanks to a new method based on a T'-expansion scheme, it was however possible to extend the reach of the extrapolation in the $(T, μ_B)$ plane, up to a baryo-chemical potential around $\frac{μ_B}{T} = 3.5$. We present here a generalization of this scheme in which all three chemical potentials can be varied independently. We base our construction on continuum-estimated susceptibilities, obtained with the 4stout action on lattices with up to Nτ = 16, 20 and 24 time slices, depending on the quantity considered.

,poster,Spin alignment of quarkonium in the hot medium? Dynamics and phenomenology,"Torrieri, Giorgio",Unicamp,Unknown,"We use a potential model to investigate the phenomenology of quarkonium in a thermal rotating medium, where vorticity and spin density are not necessarily in equilibrium. We find that the quarkonium spin density matrix, as well as the binding energy and melting temperature, are sensitive to both the vorticity and the lack of equilibrium between vorticity and spin. This means that quarkonium spin alignment is a sensitive probe for vorticity and spin within the hydrodynamic phase.
Furthermore the melting temperature dependence provides a potential new mechanism, ``distillation``, to polarize specifically quarkonium states (including the phi, if it can be considered as such) and potentially explain the dependence of quarkonium suppression in rapidity.
Information unequivocably pointing to spin-orbit non-equilibrium dynamics can be obtained from a combined study of quarkonium relative abundance and spin alignment, as well as experimentally obtainable off-diagonal density matrix elements.

,poster,Transverse momentum fluctuations and the QCD speed of sound in small systems,"Mu, Yushan",Fudan University,Unknown,"It has recently been realized that in the ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, mean transverse momentum of hadrons contains the information of the fundamental thermodynamic properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In particular, in nucleus-nucleus collisions the linear correlation between the mean transverse momentum and the charged multiplicity is attributed to the QCD speed of sound,  which promotes theoretical and experimental investigations. However, these studies suffer from the contamination of fluctuations, either physical or non-physical. 

In this talk we focus on the ultra-central collisions of small colliding system, such as proton-lead, where effects of fluctuations are more pronounced in comparison to the nucleus-nucleus collision systems. Following the standard strategy, via event-by-event hydrodynamical simulations, we investigate the QCD speed of sound by analyzing the variation of the mean transverse momentum with particle multiplicity in the mid-rapidity region. Although a linear correlations is realized in our results, between the mean transverse momentum and the effective temperature as well as between the charged particle multiplicity and the total entropy, the extracted speed of sound is significantly suppressed due to the presence of fluctuations. To remove such suppression from fluctuations, we propose a systematic subtraction scheme via the corrections captured by the measured variance of the mean transverse momentum (or the effective temperature), etc. 

Given the consistent extraction of the speed of sound in small colliding systems, our results support the correlation between mean transverse momentum and charged multiplicity from QCD thermodynamics, which further provides an alternative and direct signature of QGP thermalization.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yushan', 'last_name': 'Mu', 'fullName': 'Mu, Yushan', 'id': '9292807', 'affiliation': 'Fudan University', 'emailHash': '92a72c8da5b86549cad39660b1ff8d12', 'db_id': 9292807, 'person_id': 8889116}"

Due to time-reversal symmetry, the leading contribution to spin alignment—defined as the 00-component of tensor polarization—appears at second order in MVSD, for which we provide an analytic formula. We analyze the physical implications of the various contributions to vector and tensor polarization, identifying that spin alignment can arise from the curl of the rotational component of thermal vorticity and the gradient of the acceleration component, contributions previously unexplored.

,poster,Searching for the QCD Critical Endpoint from Lattice QCD Simulations at a Low Temperature,"Gu, Jin-Biao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Significant efforts have been made within the heavy-ion collision community to locate the QCD critical endpoint (CEP).  Recent lattice QCD studies using imaginary chemical potentials, based on simulations at temperatures above 120 MeV and utilizing Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, suggest that the critical temperature at the CEP, $ T_c^{CEP}$, should be around 110 MeV [\[1\]][1]. Predictions from effective theories, such as AdS/CFT [\[2\]][2], the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) [\[3\]][3], and Dyson-Schwinger Equations (DSE) [\[4\]][4], align with this lattice result.

In our study, we conduct direct lattice QCD simulations with imaginary chemical potential at a low temperature of 107 MeV, using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) at the physical pion mass on $N_t=10$ lattices. We obtain up to 4th order baryon number fluctuations for each of the 24 values of imaginary baryon chemical potentials ranging from zero to $i\pi$. This enables us to apply multi-point Padé approximants and compute Fourier coefficients of the baryon number density in the complex chemical potential plane. Through these analyses, we examine indications of CEP through the prospective Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane at this low temperature.

,poster,Unveiling Critical Behavior in Rapidity Scans Using Cross-Cumulants for intermediate energy collision,"Li, Jianing",Tsinghua University,Unknown,"Recent heavy-ion collision experiments at intermediate energies are intensively focused on probing the QCD phase diagram to reveal critical behavior associated with the possible critical point. In these collisions, the produced fireball exhibits significant inhomogeneity along the rapidity direction, covering a broad region of the QCD phase diagram. This spatial variation offers a unique opportunity to study critical phenomena in greater detail. **To capitalize on this opportunity, we focus on studying higher-order cumulants of conserved charges beyond mid-rapidity region—the rapidity scan method that complements the traditional beam energy scan approach.**

However, to accurately identify critical signals, it is essential to establish a complete baseline that accounts for non-critical background effects. **In this talk, we present our work on establishing such a baseline for rapidity scans.** Our studies reveal that conservation effects of baryon number can cause cumulant measurements to mimic critical behavior, potentially leading to false positives [1]. To overcome this challenge, **we introduce a novel observable—the cross-cumulant—for rapidity scans, designed to be sensitive to critical fluctuations while being less affected by conservation effects.** Using hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate how cross-cumulants can effectively distinguish genuine critical signals from background effects. Our results indicate that cross-cumulants provide a powerful tool for future experiments aiming to explore the QCD critical point through rapidity scans. We discuss the implications of our findings for ongoing and upcoming heavy-ion collision programs, and outline how this method can enhance the search for critical phenomena in the QCD phase diagram.

The primary experimental approach to locating the CEP is measuring the baryon number fluctuations. In the energy region currently being studied, the baryon number is primarily carried by protons and neutrons. Due to experimental limitations, we cannot measure the uncharged neutrons directly. Thus, in experiments, baryon number fluctuations are approximated by measuring proton number fluctuations. We have discovered a method to extract the missing neutron information from the bound states of protons and neutrons, i.e., from light nuclei. This allows us to accurately reconstruct baryon number fluctuations by measuring light nuclei and protons.

VAH is a form of relativistic fluid dynamics specifically designed to handle the large pressure anisotropies that occur during the early evolution stage at high collision energies. We explore its applicability across the entire spectrum of available collision systems, including p+p, p+Pb, p+Au, d+Au, $^3$He+Au, O+O, Xe+Xe, Au+Au, and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and/or the LHC. We show that for systems smaller than O+O the pressure anisotropy never becomes small enough to be reliably described by standard viscous fluid dynamics. In the second part of the talk [2] we use VAH to study a number of flow observables in p+p and p+Pb collisions at the LHC, with a particular focus on solving the sign problem of $c_2\{4\}$ that has plagued traditional viscous hydrodynamic simulations.

The NA61/SHINE experiment at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) has been upgraded with a high-spatial-resolution Vertex Detector (VD) [2]. This upgrade was motivated by the importance and the possibility of the first direct measurements of open charm mesons in heavy ion collisions at the SPS energies.

Large statistic data were collected for Xe+La collision at the beam momentum of 150 *A* GeV/*c*. Minimum bias and 0-20$\%$ centrality online trigger selection were applied.  The D$^0$ and $\overline{\text{D}}^0$ mesons were reconstructed through their hadronic decay channels ($\text{D/}\overline{\text{D}}^{0} \rightarrow \text{K}^{-/+} + \pi^{+/-}$).

CBM will study the phase diagram of baryonic matter in regions of moderate temperature and large baryonic chemical potential, reaching net baryon densities several times larger than ordinary nuclear matter. Some primary objectives of the experiment are the experimental validation of a 1$^{st}$ order phase transition and the search for signs of possible chiral symmetry restoration.
Dileptons are one key observable for the CBM physics program, giving access to the early, high density phase of the evolution of the fireball created in heavy ion collisions with centre of mass energies $\sqrt{S_{NN}}$ ranging from 2.9 GeV to 4.9 GeV.
A large focusing ring imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is part of the CBM day-1 detector setup for efficient identification of electrons and suppression of pion background up to 6-8 GeV/c momentum range. The RICH will be using a CO2 gas radiator (pion threshold 4.65 GeV/c) and a 13 m$^2$ segmented spherical mirror. Hamamatsu H12700 multianode photomultipliers will be used for Cherenkov photon detection in combination with the newly developed FPGA-TDC based DIRICH readout chain, which aims for exceptional timing precision limited only by a transient time spread of 350 ps of the MAPMTs.
The mechanical design of the detector is currently being finalized and construction of several key detector components has already started. The two photon cameras have been assembled and are currently being tested in conjunction with the closed-loop air cooling system. A large prototype of the mirror system has been built, and major parts of the readout electronic components were produced already. The fully free streaming readout has been successfully demonstrated in the miniCBM campaigns at GSI. All 1100 MAPMTs were individually characterized, providing the largest database of series measurements for this type of MAPMT.

,poster,Lighting up the Photon Wigner Distribution via Dilepton Productions,"Shi, Yu",Ecole Polytechnique,Unknown,"We present a systematic investigation of lepton pair production through photon-photon fusion processes in heavy-ion collisions. It is demonstrated that the dilepton production at a given impact parameter ($b_\perp$) with a fixed transverse momentum imbalance ($q_\perp$) can be factorized into a unified formula in terms of the Wigner photon distribution of heavy nuclei. We show that this framework provides a comprehensive description of all the relevant data from RHIC to the LHC, with a strong evidence that the quasi-real photon can be radiated not only from the nucleus as a whole, standing for the coherent contribution, but also from the sub-structures inside the nucleus, representing the incoherent contribution. Further predictions are made for the anisotropies in the correlations between $q_\perp$, $b_\perp$, and the dilepton transverse momentum ($P_\perp$). This will help us to constrain the photon Wigner distribution which plays a crucial role to study the gluonic matter of nucleus at small- $x$ through the diffractive photoproduction processes in heavy ion collision.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'Shi', 'fullName': 'Shi, Yu', 'id': '9292759', 'affiliation': 'Ecole Polytechnique', 'emailHash': '907b0d2184181d820eeeb21158fcaccc', 'db_id': 9292759, 'person_id': 8934660}"
,poster,Resolving the $C_{4}${4} Sign Change Puzzle in Pb-Pb Collisions,"Dimri, Aman",Stony Brook University (US),USA,"The fourth-order cumulant of quadrangular flow ($\bf{v}_4$), $C_4\{4\}$, exhibits a distinct trend in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energy [1]: negative for 0-20% centrality, changes sign and becomes positive around 20-30% centrality, and remains positive throughout the remaining centrality range. This measurement, made over half a decade ago, remains unexplained. We attribute the observed sign change to a complex interplay between the linear and non-linear components of $\bf{v}_4$. We discover that the linear component has a significant reaction plane component, a novel insight that successfully reproduces the striking trend of $C_4\{4\}$ using a Gaussian model of eccentricity fluctuations. Finally, we discuss the potential for similar sign-changing behavior across different collision systems.

,poster,Momentum broadening and kinetic equilibration of heavy quarks in strongly coupled N=4 Yang-Mills theory,"Scheihing, Bruno","KITP, University of California, Santa Barbara",USA,"We study the dynamics of a heavy quark propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma. Concretely, we calculate the complete momentum broadening probability distribution due to interactions with the plasma. This calculation includes and goes beyond the classic results for the drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$, $\kappa_L$, and also allows one to read off the value of $\hat{q}$ for light-like particles. We use this probability distribution to derive the Kolmogorov equation (a generalized Fokker-Planck equation) that determines how the momentum distribution of heavy quarks evolves as they propagate through a thermal plasma. Our results display previously unquantified features about the dynamics of heavy quarks, such as the correlation between momentum broadening and energy loss, along with all of the higher order moments of the momentum broadening distribution. Most strikingly, we show that even though $\kappa_L$ and $\eta_D$ do not satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation relation, the stationary solution to the aforementioned Kolmogorov equation is, in fact, a Boltzmann distribution. All of the higher order moments of the broadening distribution contribute in an essential fashion to achieving kinetic equilibrium.

In the light of the many similarities between QCD at temperatures around $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, not least in the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\kappa$ as evidenced by recent lattice QCD calculations, we expect that this calculation in strongly coupled SYM plasma will serve as a useful reference point from which to gain intuition into the strongly coupled dynamics of QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bruno', 'last_name': 'Scheihing', 'fullName': 'Scheihing, Bruno', 'id': '9292752', 'affiliation': 'KITP, University of California, Santa Barbara', 'emailHash': '38c400d5373980c35418104546a15cfc', 'db_id': 9292752, 'person_id': 8929997}"
,poster,"Insights into the interplay of momentum, multiplicity and the speed of sound in heavy-ion collisions","Paquet, Jean-Francois",Vanderbilt University,USA,"There have been recent proposals that the speed of sound of the quark-gluon plasma can be measured from multiplicity and mean transverse momentum ($p_T$) measurements in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions, based on thermodynamics arguments and numerical simulations [1]. The CMS Collaboration has used this approach to extract values of the speed of sound remarkably consistent with lattice QCD calculations [2]. We use a minimal model of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions based inviscid relativistic hydrodynamics to study the relation between the speed of sound and the hadronic multiplicity and average energy.  We derive an analytical expression for the speed of sound in terms of the total particle multiplicity and average energy, which we relate to the original proposal. We discuss the role of rapidity and $p_T$ cuts in breaking the relation between the true speed of sound and the one obtained from multiplicity and $p_T$ measurements, finding corrections that depends on the system's lifetime and initial conditions [3].

,poster,Thermodynamic geometry of the QCD phase transition,"Murgana, Fabrizio","Università degli studi di Catania, Goethe Universitat Frankfurt",Unknown,"We explore the thermodynamic geometry in the context of the chiral phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics. In particular the thermodynamic curvature, $R$, provides insights into the system's fluctuations and critical behavior and thus can be considered as an alternative way to approach the study of critical phenomena. Building upon previous studies, we incorporate bosonic fluctuations through the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique, a non-perturbative approach suitable for investigating critical phenomena, reformulating the flow equation into an advection-diffusion type equation within the local potential approximation for the effective average action.
We study how the sign of $R$ changes near the chiral crossover and the critical point, providing insights into the underlying dynamics of the phase transition. The results indicate that $R$ exhibits a peak close to the chiral crossover and that the inclusion of fluctuations generally lowers the  magnitude peak these peaks. At low chemical potential, $R$ remains negative, showing that the inclusion of bosonic fluctuations prevents the system from overcoming the  fermionic repulsion among quarks. We further explore the low-Chemical potential regime by artificially lowering the pion mass, approaching the chiral limit where the crossover transitions to a second-order phase change.
As the baryion Chemical potential increases towards the critical point, R develops shaprer peaks and undergoes a sign change, consistent with findings from mean-field theory. Thus, our analysis supports the idea that the thermodynamic curvature R is sensitive to the chiral crossovers and chiral phase transition, providing valuable insights into the system's behavior near criticality.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Fabrizio', 'last_name': 'Murgana', 'fullName': 'Murgana, Fabrizio', 'id': '9292746', 'affiliation': 'Università degli studi di Catania, Goethe Universitat Frankfurt', 'emailHash': '2c8e98a9c058bf9a3a324f5e0c358aa6', 'db_id': 9292746, 'person_id': 8935831}"
,poster,Heavy Hadrons production by coalescence along a system size scan from AA down to pp collisions,"Minissale, Vincenzo",Unknown,Unknown,"Measurements of heavy baryon production in pp, pA and AA collisions from RHIC to top LHC energies have recently attracted more and more attention, currently representing a challenge for the heavy-quark hadronization theoretical understanding. 
An hybrid coalescence plus fragmentation approach has been able to correctly predict the large baryon over meson ratio $\Lambda_c/D^0\sim O(1)$ 
observed in both AA collisions at RHIC and LHC [2] as well as in pp collisions at $5.02$ and $13 \rm \;TeV$. The ratio obtained is, in general, quite larger than the one measured and expected in $e^+e^-$, $ep$ collisions.
Furthermore, with the same approach, also a quite large $\Xi_c/D^0\sim 0.15$ and $\Omega_c/D^0\sim 0.05$ has been predicted in $pp$ collisions at $5.02 \rm \;TeV$, and appears to be in quite good agreement with the early ALICE measurements [3]. 
Given such successful predictions, we present here a critical assessment of the elements of the hadronization modeling that are mainly driving heavy baryon enhancement, moreover we discuss the extensions of the approach applied in order to supply the prediction for the multi-charmed baryon production, i.e. $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Omega_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{ccc}$, over a wide system size scan from $PbPb$ to $KrKr$, $ArAr$ and $OO$ [4], and the bottomed hadron production in $pp$ and $PbPb$ collisions [5][6]. Furthermore we present a new extension of the same approach for charm and bottom quarkonia in $pp$ collisions, i.e. $J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(2S)$[7]. 
We can compare the coalescence prediction with the SHM one and on the other hand we can  investigate the impact on the production coming from non-equilibrium features in the heavy quark distribution.
In fact, the model can acquire the heavy quark distribution from a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach or from a Langevin one with a space transport coefficient $D_s$ in agreement with lattice QCD data.

,poster,"Exploring proton correlations: femtoscopy across baryon numbers B=1,2,3","Torres-Rincon, Juan",Universitat de Barcelona,Unknown,"In this presentation, we investigate femtoscopy correlation functions to access the interactions of protons across various hadrons with different baryon numbers. Beginning with the proton-pion system, we apply the results of the unitarized chiral effective theory into the TROY (T-matrix-based Routine for HAdrOn FemtoscopY) framework to predict measurable correlation functions in high-multiplicity p+p collisions. Next, we explore the proton-omega baryon correlation (B=2) employing an effective theory that incorporates both the baryon octet and decuplet in combination with the Schrödinger equation. In this case we incorporate the $^3S_1$ channel, not included in the recent ALICE analysis, and leading to a potential impact of additional inelastic channels. Finally, we address the proton-deuteron (B=3) correlation function using an effective potential in higher partial waves to model correlation functions for both p+p (ALICE) and Au+Au (STAR) collisions. We obtain a reasonable description of the experimental data with a two-body dynamics challenging previous claims in the literature about the nature of the proton-deuteron interaction at low energies.

,poster,How inelastic scatterings affect the adiabatic picture of prehydrodynamic attractors,"Scheihing, Bruno","KITP, University of California, Santa Barbara",USA,"The early far-from equilibrium dynamics of the pre-hydrodynamic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in heavy ion collisions can be characterized by distinct stages, during each of which the system loses some memory of its initial condition, until only the hydrodynamic modes remain. In QCD kinetic theory, this attractor behavior has been described in terms of self-similar scaling solutions for the particle distribution function during each stage, even at times well before hydrodynamization. Studying a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit in terms of an effective Hamiltonian evolution, we have shown that, after an appropriate coordinate rescaling, the pre-hydrodynamic plasma can be described by the adiabatic evolution of a time-dependent ground state, which is the attractor. This adiabatic formulation yields a unified description of both early- and late-time attractors, including the evolution from one attractor to another. Furthermore, it provides an intuitive physical explanation for the emergence of the attractor behavior itself. The first explicit construction realizing all of these goals employed a kinetic theory including only elastic scatterings, leading to unrealistically long hydrodynamization times. In this talk I will present the unified adiabatic description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors, introduce inelastic scatterings, show that their inclusion dramatically reduces the hydrodynamization time, and discuss their further consequences.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bruno', 'last_name': 'Scheihing', 'fullName': 'Scheihing, Bruno', 'id': '9292737', 'affiliation': 'KITP, University of California, Santa Barbara', 'emailHash': '38c400d5373980c35418104546a15cfc', 'db_id': 9292737, 'person_id': 8929997}"
,poster,No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions,"Gebhard, Jannis",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.

,poster,Jet substructure induced anisotropic flow,"Takacs, Adam",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, jets deposit energy into the quark-gluon plasma, shaping its dynamics and driving it out of equilibrium. This interplay, known as the medium response, is a tool for understanding QCD thermalization. Current studies on medium response mainly examine energy distribution around jets and modifications to jet substructure.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach by focusing on the medium response of jets with a distinct 2-prong structure. In contrast to initial state anisotropy, 2-prong jets generate both spacial and momentum space anisotropy in the plasma. We show that in weak coupling models, the original 2-prong jet structure remains largely intact resulting in large elliptic flow within jets. In contrast, in strong-coupling scenarios, the spacial anisotropy induced azimuthal inversion reduces the flow. Jet substructure-induced flow therefore serves as a tool to constrain the nature of medium response, giving a complementary way to constrain QGP transport properties creating synergy between the jet and collective dynamics community.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adam', 'last_name': 'Takacs', 'fullName': 'Takacs, Adam', 'id': '9292730', 'affiliation': 'Heidelberg University', 'emailHash': '79f069d431f14998f000df4a4ec1fc2f', 'db_id': 9292730, 'person_id': 8926710}"

,poster,Gluon to $q\bar q$ antenna in anisotropic QCD matter,"Martins da Silva, João",LIP - Lisboa / ULisboa - IST,Unknown,"The states of matter produced in the early stage of heavy ion collisions can be highly anisotropic. If such a feature is sufficiently pronounced, one should expect the final particle distribution inside jets to reflect it in the form of non-trivial angle correlations. In this talk, we discuss a first step in exploring such correlations by studying how a $q\bar q$ state branching from an initial unpolarized gluon couples to the anisotropies of an underlying static QCD medium. The medium anisotropy is captured by allowing the jet quenching parameter to take different magnitudes in two orthogonal directions in the plane transverse to the jet axis. 
We find that the final particle distribution is sensitive to the medium anisotropy in the form of an azimuthal angle modulation, and more importantly, that this effect couples directly to the helicity/spin of the final states, offering a novel way to extract the details of the underlying matter which is not accessible with standard jet observables. We show how such features can be extracted from the Fourier decomposition of the particle distribution, from azimuthally dependent energy-energy correlators and from final state transverse spin polarization measures.

Aside from experimentally motivated assumptions such as Bjorken flow, ignoring the presence of spatial gradients has often been helpful to facilitate theoretical calculations. We challenge this simplification by introducing spatial transverse gradients in the system, thereby extending the approach of [1], and show how these facilitate the thermalisation of the system by coupling different spherical harmonic modes in momentum space on a new timescale inversely related to the strength of the gradients.

,poster,Studying saturation dynamics and hotspot fluctuations in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions with neural networks,"Niemi, Harri",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We investigate the interplay between saturation dynamics and fluctuating hotspots on midrapidity flow observables in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies using the new Monte Carlo EKRT (MC-EKRT) initial-state event generator [1,2]. We demonstrate that this type of analysis can be efficiently and accurately performed using pre-trained neural networks [3] to predict flow observables directly from the initial energy-density profiles, despite the networks having no prior information about the MC-EKRT initial state, or hotspots, during the training phase. We show that saturation intensity significantly affects the ratio between the flow coefficients $v_3$ and $v_2$. Incorporating fluctuating hotspots into the nucleon structure enhances saturation effects, and improves the agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the collision-energy dependence of the flow coefficients obtained using the MC-EKRT initial states with hotspots is improved in comparison with the earlier event-by-event EKRT model. Additionally, we show that the minijet-multiplicity originating fluctuations of the saturation scale present in MC-EKRT, along with the inclusion of hotspots, are essential for accurately describing the large-multiplicity tail of the measured charged-hadron distributions.

,poster,Quasi-normal modes of non-thermal fixed points,"De Lescluze, Matisse",Unknown,Unknown,"Self similar evolution in time, also known as a nonthermal fixed point, is one of the stages of thermalization in QCD under the assumption of very weak coupling. This arises in models of ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions and cold atomic gases, for the latter this has been experimentally realized. Nonthermal fixed points are characterized by a universal scaling function and power law exponents. Using QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle approximation, we study how these systems approach the universal regime. Simulations of isotropic, homogeneous gluon gases show that perturbations on top of the scaling function decay following power laws while oscillating, i.e. damped oscillations characterized by complex frequencies. Similar to how quasinormal modes in black hole spacetimes dictate thermalization in strongly coupled quantum field theories via AdS/CFT, we refer to these frequencies as the quasinormal modes of a nonthermal fixed point. We calculate the spectrum of quasinormal modes and find qualitative agreements with the results of time evolution in kinetic theory. This research indicates the first evidence of new physical phenomena around nonthermal fixed points. We expect these to appear in weak coupling models of nuclear collisions at very early times and to be observable in existing cold atom experiments.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matisse', 'last_name': 'De Lescluze', 'fullName': 'De Lescluze, Matisse', 'id': '9292683', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '1ff6cd9d0300b185ffd885ce3690962c', 'db_id': 9292683, 'person_id': 8940235}"

One of the quantities of interest to model this evolution and to compare with experimental observations is the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient $\kappa$, which determines how strongly these interact with the medium. We estimate $\kappa$ relevant for the pre-thermalization stage in a highly occupied state of SU(2) gauge fields inspired from the color glass condensate (CGC) effective theory. For this we implement for the the first time, relativistic evolution of heavy quarks in the mass range of charm and bottom quarks in a background of over-populated SU(2) gauge fields which are evolved using classical-statistical real-time lattice techniques. Based on a novel methodology to extract the momentum broadening for relativistic quarks, in out-of-equilibrium conditions, we find that the momentum distribution of heavy quarks exhibit interesting non-perturbative features at initial times eventually going over to a diffusive regime, where we extract the momentum diffusion coefficient [1]. We find a sizeable discrepancy between the results, calculated earlier in the static limit. We further discuss our results to provide an estimate of kinetic equilibration times for charm and bottom quarks relevant for heavy-ion experiments.

,poster,Locating the QCD critical point from the universal scaling of the Lee-Yang edge,"Schmidt, Christian",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"<br>

We discuss a new numerical method for the determination the QCD critical point from first principle lattice QCD calculations. The analysis exploits the universal scaling of the Lee-Yang edge that has been obtained from lattice QCD calculations of cumulants of the baryon number density at imaginary chemical potentials. Using a multi-point Pade approximation [1] we identify the closest pole of the approximation in the complex chemical potential plane, which is identified with the Lee-Yang edge. Compared to our previous analysis [2], we have doubled the number of simulation points in the imaginary chemical potential direction for our Nt=6 calculations and added one new Nt=8 calculation at T=120 MeV. In this talk we discuss the systematic and statistical error budget of the analysis. We also comment on a new strategy to perform the analytic continuation of the baryon number density and higher cumulants to the real domain by using a numerical version of the Cauchy integration formula.

In this work, we employ a linearized approach, allowing us to separately simulate the background energy-momentum evolution of a charge-neutral fluid and the stochastic baryon fluctuation/diffusion processes, which largely reduces computation cost while maintaining sufficient precision.
We implement this linearized stochastic charge evolution in the viscous hydrodynamic code MUSIC, and find that it nicely describes the two-point correlation of 1+1-d analytical solutions for various EoS and transport coefficients. In particular, the hydrodynamic calculations demonstrate how different rapidity separations

,poster,Exploring dense nuclear matter at J-PARC heavy ion project,"Y, Morino",KEK-IPNS,Japan,"Many phenomena are expected, such as the transition to the deconfined phase and color superconductivity(CSC), in ultra-high density matter. Heavy ion collision with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ <$\sim$5 GeV is expected to be most advantageous to generate and study such ultra-high densities($\rho>3\rho_{0}$).
J-PARC Heavy Ion Project(J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project aimed at studying the ultra-high density matter by using a heavy ion beam with the most suitable energy(1-12 AGeV). While the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, the J-PARC HI will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible with only adding the injector. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme at the latter stage of the injector are being studied in detail by the J-PARC facility.
We have the staging plan of the project divided into two stages. The main difference between each stage is whether the booster ring is a reuse of the KEK-Proton Synchrotron or newly constructed. Even in the early stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of 10$^{8}$Hz. In the final stage, the world’s highest intensity heavy ion beam of 10$^{11}$Hz is expected. 
The primary goal of the first stage is considered to observe non-confined phases in high-density regions by temperature measurement via di-electron radiation. To achieve this, we have already proposed an upgrade plan for the J-PARC E16 experiment. As an additional step, we believe it is important to discover an anomalous increase in low-mass electron pairs, which is expected to be a sign of the onset of CSC. To observe this effect, we are considering a detector system with emphasis on wide acceptance and measurement of soft processes. By emphasizing measurement of soft processes with wide acceptance, it becomes possible to access important themes such as fluctuations and multi-particle correlations for not only di-electron, and it will also be complementary to CBM.

In this study, we employ the charge correlation ratio, which evaluates the probability of jet production with same-sign or opposite-sign leading charged particles charges, already shown to be sensitive to hadronization effects. We find that this sensitivity can be enhanced by selections on jet substructure, particularly by analysing the relative placement of splittings that resolve the leading charged particles within the clustering tree.

The equation-of-state (EoS) at high baryon density is crucial for understanding the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The directed flow of protons and $\Lambda$ baryons has long been proposed as a sensitive observable for probing the high-density EoS. Recent data from the STAR experiment in Au+Au collisions at 3 GeV, particularly on the transverse momentum, rapidity distributions, and collective flow of light nuclei and hypernuclei, provide a valuable opportunity to further explore properties of high baryon density matter.

We employ the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics (PHQMD) model to investigate the sensitivity of various observables to different equation-of-state scenarios. We consider two static EoS models, labeled ""soft"" and ""hard"", which differ in compressibility modulus, as well as a momentum-dependent soft EoS model. In PHQMD, (hyper)nuclei are formed dynamically throughout the entire heavy-ion collision by the potential interaction between nucleons, which is sensitive to the EoS. In this talk, by comparing PHQMD simulations with STAR experimental data on particle spectra and flow at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 3 GeV, we find that the production of light nuclei and hypernuclei, as well as their collective flow, are sensitive to the choice of the EoS. By analyzing these observables, we can gain valuable information about the underlying nuclear interactions and the properties of dense matter. Our results demonstrate the potential of hypernuclei as powerful probes of the high-density EoS and provide important insights for future experiments like CBM at FAIR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'yingjie', 'last_name': 'zhou', 'fullName': 'zhou, yingjie', 'id': '9292661', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '513ff4bd25800603f6a233bfebc4b3c6', 'db_id': 9292661, 'person_id': 8939858}"
,poster,Apples to Apples in Jet Quenching: Underlying Event Considerations for Phenomenological Jet Studies in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"A. Gonçalves, João",LIP - IST,Unknown,"Progress in the theoretical understanding of parton branching dynamics within an expanding QGP relies on detailed and fair comparisons with experimental data for reconstructed jets. Such validation is only meaningful when the computed object, whether derived analytically or through event generation, accounts for the complexity of experimentally reconstructed jets. The reconstruction of jets in heavy ion collisions requires an inherently imperfect subtraction, of the large and fluctuating Underlying Event (UE), meaning reconstructed jets inevitably retain some level of UE contamination. To accurately identify jet quenching effects, that is, modifications of the branching dynamics by interaction with QGP leading to changes on jet observables, comparisons should be made against a baseline that incorporates UE contamination in unmodified, vacuum-like jets. In practical terms, jet quenching effects are defined as effects absent in vacuum jet samples embedded within a realistic heavy-ion background, where subtraction is carried out analogously to that in the heavy-ion case and aligned as closely as possible to what is done experimentally. Using the extensively validated JEWEL event generator, we present selected results from a broad survey examining the sensitivity of commonly used jet observables to UE effects in jet quenching studies. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of Machine Learning studies aimed at classifying significantly modified jets against a vacuum-like jet reference, where UE contamination is accounted for. Additionally we present Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) distributions in Pb-Pb jets, first in the signal-only case, and then with medium response and UE contamination effects both separately and combined. Finally, we analyze the EEC observable based on a supervised analysis cut, evaluating whether the model effectively targets jets most distinct from vacuum-like jets, and thus most likely to be quenched.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'João', 'last_name': 'A.

,poster,Toward the Origin of Mass at J-PARC E16 via Density-induced Chiral Mixing in Di-Lepton Production,"Ejima, Ren",Hiroshima University (JP),Unknown,"The spectral functions of chiral partners should become degenerate when the QCD chiral symmetry is restored. The axial-vector spectra are experimentally more challenging to construct than those of vector mesons that directly couple to virtual photons and then to dileptons. Chiral mixing of the vector with axial-vector mesons is thus a key phenomenon to probe in-medium modifications of vector spectrum due to the onset of chiral symmetry restoration carried by the axial-vector counterpart. The mixing effect is expected to be stronger at higher density due to a mechanism driven by chiral anomalies [1, 2], in striking contrast to the vanishing mixing at chiral crossover driven by thermal pions [3]. This feature encourages us to perform the experimental search in the high-density regime, where the recent experimental trend has begun to shift toward.  

We propose that experiments at medium energies with paying attention to the new mixing mechanism, may provide a direct evidence of the chiral symmetry restoration. In this presentation, we focus on the density-induced mixing and the spectral functions of $\phi$ and its chiral partner $f_1(1420)$. We present the invariant mass distribution of dileptons using a transport approach developed in [4, 5] under the conditions of the J-PARC E16 experiment as a prime example.

We find that the $f_1(1420)$ meson is visible with about 2 $\sigma$ credibility in dilepton production in a range of mixing strength in our study when the expected statistics at E16 Run-2 are utilized [6]. We advocate that the E16 experiment at J-PARC has discovery potential for the mass degeneracy of chiral partners at finite density as a signature of chiral symmetry restoration.

,poster,A general framework for causality and stability in perfect relativistic spin fluids,"Abboud, Nick",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"The quark-gluon plasmas produced in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions can have large vorticities, leading to spin polarization in a manner analogous to the Barnett effect. Such spin polarization has been observed in $\Lambda$ hyperons [1], spurring rapid development in the area of spin physics in heavy-ion collisions. However, tension remains between experimental data and theories that assume no dynamics for spin. Building on the success of hydrodynamics in describing the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma, relativistic theories of spin hydrodynamics have been developed to assess whether spin dynamics is relevant to heavy-ion phenomenology. These theories treat spin as a dynamical degree of freedom that evolves through the conservation of total angular momentum. Despite significant progress in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, our understanding of relativistic causality and the stability of thermal equilibria--both of which are crucial for numerical simulations--remains limited. As a step toward addressing this issue in a unified framework, we demonstrate that non-dissipative relativistic spin fluids fit naturally into the framework of so-called divergence-type hydrodynamic theories [2], which have desirable mathematical properties. In particular, a perfect spin fluid can be fully specified by a scalar generating function. This formulation makes it straightforward to assess whether a given theory is compatible with causality and stability. When the generating function is based on a generalized Boltzmann distribution, we show that the theory is both causal and stable and is therefore suitable for numerical implementation. Furthermore, it reproduces existing results when expanded up to second order in $\hbar$. Finally, retaining all orders in $\hbar$, we calculate the relevant components of the stress-energy and spin tensors, such as spin-induced pressure anistropy.

This study shows that their polarization can reveal much about the nature of their production mechanism. We present the results of a comprehensive investigation of dilepton polarization generated  by a quark-gluon plasma produced  in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We compare the polarization results predicted by leading-order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) dilepton emission rate calculated with thermal field theory [1] and highlight the differences. The rates are integrated using a state-of- the-art multi-stage framework which includes IP-Glasma+KøMPøST+MUSIC+URQMD [2], and this end-to-end realistic dynamical approach is used to compute the polarization coefficients, like $\lambda_\theta$, that can be compared to experimental measurements. We observe sizeable differences between LO and NLO results: both in overall sign and in magnitude. On non-perturbative grounds, the NLO results can be confirmed by a new correlator recently studied on the lattice [3]. Furthermore, the behaviour of $\lambda_\theta$ in the limit of small invariant masses indicates that the inclusion of the NLO corrections is mandatory to recover the correct transverse polarization. Our study confirms the important role played by dileptons as probes of early time dynamics.

At large number of colors, the potential is argued to consist in a real part plus a constant imaginary term.  The former is calculated using as input at zero temperature lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. For its extension to finite temperatures, we adapt an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty. In this framework, which can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the X(3872) and to other exotic states, we qualitatively estimate  the temperature range for the formation of the heavy tetraquark and propose a picture for its in-medium dissociation.

,poster,Understanding properties of the Dirac eigenspectrum in QCD and approach to thermalization,"Shanker, Ravi",The Institute of Mathematical Sciences,Unknown,"In this work, we study the localization properties of the eigenstates of non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory both with and without dynamical quark flavors in a gauge invariant manner, using first-principles lattice gauge theory techniques. We use the eigenspectrum of a probe (overlap) Dirac operator to understand the properties of thermal gauge ensembles of 2+1 flavor QCD generated using domain wall fermions as well as pure SU(3) gauge theory. Focusing on the infrared part of eigenspectrum that lie within the non-perturbative magnetic scale, we propose suitable observables that allow us to unambiguously categorize  different regions of the eigenspectrum. While most of these so-called magnetic modes are completely delocalized and chaotic, with nearest-neighbor level spacing fluctuations similar to random matrices of a Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), few eigenmodes with fractal-like properties start to appear at temperatures just near and above the chiral crossover temperature. We show that their fractal dimensions carry information about the universality class of the chiral transition in QCD. 

Having demonstrated that at sufficiently high temperatures, the non-Abelian plasma is gluon dominated with large occupation numbers in the infra-red and exhibits properties similar to a chaotic system, we discuss its consequences for heavy-ion experiments. Starting from a non-equilibrium initial state of SU(3) gluons inspired by the Color 
Glass Condensate effective theory, a real-time classical-statistical evolution leads to a self-similar scaling regime where we show that infrared magnetic modes are also over-occupied and chaotic. Thus by matching the evolving magnetic scale in this non-equilibrium scaling regime with that of a typical thermal state of QCD, we estimate a thermalization time of $\sim  1.44$ fm/c.

,poster,Heavy flavor kinetics in hot QCD,"Mykhaylova, Valeriya",Jagiellonian University in Kraków & University of Wrocław,Unknown,"We investigate the evolution of charm quarks in hot QCD matter within the well-grounded quasiparticle approach [1]. The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is composed of the quasiparticle excitations with dynamically generated masses that are linked to the lattice QCD equation of state. 

Utilizing the kinetic rate equation, we study the thermal production of charm quark pairs $(c\bar{c})$ in hot QCD matter with various quark content and distinct evolution scenarios. The QGP with $N_f=2+1$ quark flavors contains the charm-quark ""impurities"", while in the $N_f=2+1+1$ case, the charm quarks contribute to the QCD equation of state above $T=300$ MeV.

The expansion of the system with $N_f=2+1$ is described by hydrodynamic simulations of viscous fluid in 2+1 dimensions [2], with temperature-dependent shear viscosity computed in the quasiparticle approach [1]. To illustrate how the kinetics of charm quarks depends on the evolution and transport properties of hot QCD matter, we additionally study the production of the $c\bar{c}$  pairs in perfect fluid propagating longitudinally [3].

Our systematic study reveals that within the statistical errors, the number of the $c\bar{c}$ pairs remains unchanged through the entire evolution of perfect QGP propagating in one dimension. This observation agrees with the prediction of the Statistical Hadronization Model [4]. In viscous QGP expanding in 2+1 dimensions, a slight decrease in the number of charm quarks is observed as the system approaches the pseudocritical temperature. This indicates the influence of the dissipative phenomena on the production of heavy flavors in hot QCD [5].

The SIS-100 accelerator ring at FAIR will deliver accelerated ions up to beam kinetic energies 29 GeV for protons and 11 A GeV for heavy-ions. The identification of muon pairs coming from the decay of J/ψ mesons is recognized as a crucial physics observable for analyzing the hot and dense matter formed during collisions. The Muon Chamber (MuCh)[2] detector system is being built to identify the muon pairs in a background mostly populated by muons from weak decay of pions and kaons produced in the collisions.

These results will then be compared with those obtained from traditional di-muon cut-based analysis method. The traditional cut-based approach for distinguishing signal from background relies on track selection criteria such as number of hits associated with a reconstructed global track in the Silicon Tracking System (STS), Muon Chamber (MuCh), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), and Time of Flight (TOF) detector, along with χ² values for the Vertex, STS, and MuCh, and a 2σ TOF mass cut.

Within this unified framework we study the impact of different medium evolution on the dissociation of quarkonia with the aim to identify the main physical characteristics which enhance the quantum decoherence of QCD bound states. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transport coefficients on the Lindblad evolution, with the purpose to merge the state-of-the-art knowledge of heavy quark spatial diffusion coefficient estimated by lattice QCD and phenomenological models to open quantum systems approach for quarkonia [4].

I will present results of a study with the UrQMD transport model supplied with a density dependent equation of state including a first-order phase transition. These results include the time evolution of the cumulants up to third order of the baryon number, proton number, and light nuclei number at $E_{\mathrm{lab}}=2-3A$ GeV. While a significant deviation from Gaussian fluctuations of the baryon number is observed in coordinate space, no significant measurable signal is seen in a finite rapidity window. Relative to the baryon number fluctuations, the proton number fluctuations are always suppressed as they constitute only a small fraction of the total baryon number during the dense phase of the collision. In addition, the coordinate space fluctuations and strong correlations lead to an enhancement of cluster production for a phase transition compared to a crossover scenario. This enhancement, however, is small and limited to the dense stage of the collision before the system actually freezes out.

,poster,Ultracentral p+Pb collision : A nice probe of multiplicity fluctuations and rapidity decorrelations in small systems,"Samanta, Rupam","AGH University of Krakow, Poland",Unknown,"The collision of a proton and a lead nucleus is asymmetric in nature, leading to an asymmetric rapidity distribution (more particles produced in the Pb-going side) of the produced particles at ultrarelativistic energies. We study multiplicity in such collision as a function of pseudorapidity, and centrality defined from the energy deposited in a calorimeter. In particular, we focus on the ultracentral regime (high-multiplicity collisions), where the asymmetry is more pronounced. We show that in this region, fluctuations of the multiplicity and the centrality estimator are predominantly due to quantum fluctuations, with impact parameter fluctuations playing negligible role. The joint probability distribution of multiplicity and the centrality estimator can be well approximated by a correlated gamma distribution. We show that this simple model can reproduce existing ATLAS data, and we make quantitative predictions for two more centrality bins in the ultracentral regime, namely $0-0.1\%$ and $0-0.01\%$, which could be verified experimentally. Predictions for more central events (e.g. $0-0.001\%$) are also possible by the same model. We also argue that by repeating the same analysis with a different centrality estimator, direct information can be obtained about the rapidity decorrelation in particle production.

,poster,Bayesian analysis of a (3+1)D hybrid approach with initial conditions from hadronic transport in the BES energy range,"Götz, Niklas",Goethe University,Unknown,"This study presents the first application of Bayesian inference to a hybrid model that combines hadronic transport as an initial state with a shear and bulk viscosity dependent on both temperature and baryochemical potential. Typically, the extraction of nuclear matter properties, such as viscosities, from experimental data involves Bayesian inference on theoretical models with parametric initial conditions, which leads to high-dimensional priors and reduces the strength of constraints. By integrating the SMASH transport code with the vHLLE hydrodynamic framework and a chiral mean field model equation of state in the (3+1)D SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid \textsuperscript{1} model, applied within the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200, we reduce reliance on parametric assumptions, while leveraging a physically motivated initial state.

Despite the use of hadronic transport for initial conditions, some parametric uncertainty remains. This study offers new insights into the impact of initial state smearing and the lifetime of the pre-equilibrium state on observables. In particular, we provide updated constraints on the temperature and baryochemical potential dependencies of the shear and bulk viscosity. We also investigate the effect of the hydrodynamic phase's lifetime on observables and the role of cross-sections in the final state rescattering. Our analysis covers a diverse range of experimental data, including both midrapidity and rapidity-dependent measurements, to assess the impact of model parameters on the robustness of the inferred results.

,poster,Heavy Quark Energy Loss and Recombination within the Hybrid Model,"Du Plessis, Jean",Unknown,Unknown,"To date, holographic calculations have provided separate descriptions for the rates of energy loss for either ultrarelativistic massless quarks and gluons or infinitely massive quarks in strongly coupled N=4 SYM plasma. We present a unified description of heavy quark energy loss by combining the limits of zero mass $M \to 0$ and infinite mass $M \rightarrow \infty$ in such a way that ensures continuity in both the energy $E(x)$ and its derivative $E'(x)$ with respect to the distance traveled. At early times, when the heavy quark is relativistic, our model aligns with the $ M \to 0 $ limit, while at late times, when the quark is being dragged by the medium, it approaches the $ M \to \infty $ limit. We implement this unified description within the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model and incorporate a local color-neutralization mechanism occurring through the recombination of the heavy quark with a nearby opposite color charge (either a light antiquark or a diquark) from the surrounding flowing medium—a process that contributes significantly to the transverse momentum $p_T$ at low $p_T$. By turning recombination off and on we isolate the effect of transverse flow on the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of B- and D-mesons; we compare these observables as well as the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of b- and c-jets to available experimental data.

Event-by-event fluctuations in nuclear collisions allow us to probe the correlation length ($\xi$) of the system, which captures how variables change together over space and time. Near a critical point, this correlation length becomes significant, even diverging in an infinite system, making fluctuation measurements a powerful tool in the search for the QCD critical point. The non-monotonic dependence of the kurtosis times variance, $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ (or $C_{4}/C_{2}$) of the net-proton (serving as a proxy for net-baryon) distribution on collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) is proposed as an indicator of the QCD critical point, due to its connection with the system's correlation length and susceptibilities. In this work, we present the results on net-proton fluctuations for Au+Au collisions in the range of collision energy 3.5-19.6 GeV using the newly developed Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (PHQMD) model [1]. This study provides novel insights into fluctuation behavior within the CBM energy range. The results have been compared with those obtained using the acceptance of Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment. Additionally, we calculate the cumulant ratios of net-kaon multiplicity distributions, as net-kaon fluctuations serve as effective indicators of net- strangeness fluctuations. PHQMD is a versatile model for studying heavy-ion collisions and cluster formation across diverse energies, integrating Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics (PHSD) for QGP interactions and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) for baryon dynamics.

However, the measured positive deviation from 1/3 of the spin alignment is orders of magnitude larger than contributions of traditional mechanisms like vorticity or magnetic fields. We proposed that the anisotropy of local strong field fluctuation in meson's rest frame is a new mechanism that can incorporate the observed spin alignment. In heavy-ion collisions, such an anisotropy may arise from a faster longitudinal expansion of the QGP than transverse expansion, and from motion of the meson relative to the QGP. Our discussions are based on a relativistic spin kinetic theory derived from Kadanoff-Baym equations, with an effective quark-meson model for the strong interaction. The vector meson in our model is generated from quark-antiquark coalescence, where quark and antiquark are polarized by the local strong field. We calculated the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson and showed its relation to the anisotropy of field fluctuations with respect to the spin quantization direction, while the strength of fluctuation can be extracted from experimental data as functions of collision energies. The transverse momentum dependence of $\phi$ meson's spin alignment is then calculated with our model, which agrees with the STAR's data.

HQ diffusion coefficient is one of the fundamental transport properties of the hot QCD matter. In this work, we have calculated the HQ momentum ($\kappa$) as well as spatial ($D_s$) diffusion coefficients in an ambient background weak magnetic field via evaluating the scattering rate of HQ's with light thermal partons. To that end, we calculate the HQ self-energy in the presence of a weak magnetic field by using the HQ potential as a proxy for the resummed gluon propagator. The information about the magnetic field comes in via the HQ potential, wherein, the light thermal partons are assumed to occupy all Landau levels. In this potential formulation, one can consider a non-perturbative ansatz for the gluon propagator which produces a string-like confining effect in coordinate space, thus allowing for the calculation of non-perturbative contribution to the HQ transport coefficients.  We have computed the heavy quark diffusion coefficients at both zero and finite momentum, observing that non-perturbative effects play a dominant role at low momentum and low temperature. Our spatial diffusion coefficient, $2\pi T D_s$, shows good agreement with recent LQCD results.

In this talk we will present new results that go significantly beyond the state-of-the-art by following a twofold approach. First, we formulate the problem in coordinate space and obtain the splitting function with exact kinematics and finite-$N_c$ corrections by solving a system of Schrödinger-like equations [1]. We also explore a momentum space formulation that results in a set of Dyson-like equations. The latter approach significantly helps to extend the medium description beyond the harmonic oscillator approximation [2]. In both cases, we will present numerical routines that are fast, efficient and flexible.  We establish the size of both kinematic corrections and refinements on the medium description.

This motivates the development of a versatile framework that combines state-of-the-art jet quenching and hydrodynamic models together with a sophisticated analysis framework including background subtraction.

First, we will show that the jet multiplicity, calculated according to the color coherence picture, provides a reasonable description of inclusive jet data up to $p_T \sim 1$ TeV in pp collisions at the LHC. Building on this understanding of the virtuality evolution of vacuum jets, we combine the color coherence picture (angular ordering) with color decoherence in QCD matter at a virtuality determined by the interplay between vacuum evolution and medium-induced momentum broadening. Using radiative energy loss calculated within the BDMPS formalism and modeling QCD bulk matter with the (2+1)-dimensional OSU hydrodynamic code, we perform a detailed calculation of the inclusive jet modification factor $R_{AA}$ in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Our results demonstrate that the observed $R_{AA}$ spectrum at high $p_T$, which requires larger energy loss than at lower $p_T$, is correlated with jet multiplicity as predicted by the virtuality evolution of jets.

To provide smooth initial condition for the hydrodynamic phase from the early stages. To take into account the interaction in the final stage of the evolution, before the chemical and kinetic freeze-out, or directly to replace hydrodynamics in the description of the strongly interacting medium produced in the collision. It has also been used extensively to obtain the transport coefficients of second order hydrodynamics and its generalizations. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is a limiting case for the evolution the Wigner distribution, the quantum precursor of the distribution function. Relativistic kinetic theory is supposed to work for asymptotically weak interactions and small quantum corrections. If the weak interaction assumption is already debatable for a strongly interacting liquid (close to a perfect fluid), more recently it has been shown that the quantum corrections are not small for a free gas[1]. The action scale of the system (compared to the Plank constant) sets the size of these corrections, and a semiclassical expansion is a safe approximation for cold and dilute systems. This is not the case for a hotter and smaller system, like at the beginning of the expansion of the medium. Besides significantly changing the energy density and pressure, hence showing that the quantum corrections are not relevant only for the polarization of spinning particles, the analytic structure of the integrands seem to preclude a semiclassical series to recover the exact results.
These off-shell effects, though, can be taken into account with a generalization of the hydrodynamic expansion [2], recovering second order hydrodynamics (and its transport coefficients), and providing an quantum generalization of the evolution of the non-hydrodynamic modes.

The framework of kinetic theory is used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number, energy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the entropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the perfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually attributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the condition of positive entropy production in non-equilibrium processes. They are responsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular momentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved.

The heavy quarks interact classically via a Coulomb-like screened potential, enabling the formation of charmonium states. These bound states may dissociate due to screening effects of the potential and through scatterings with plasma particles. Using box simulations at fixed temperature and volume, we demonstrate the full equilibration of the system with equilibrium charmonium yields consistent with the Statistical Hadronization Model.

In particular, it is not clear to what degree this *hydrodynamization* process requires proximity to a local equilibrium state. In this contribution, we study this problem in kinetic theory considering an ultrarelativistic gas undergoing strong longitudinal expansion, assuming Bjorken flow. We solve the Boltzmann equation using a relativistic generalization of the method of moments [1], where the single-particle distribution is reconstructed via a moment expansion. We first demonstrate that this traditional moment expansion actually diverges for this system and that this series must be resummed [2]. We then compare the exact resummed solution of the single-particle distribution function with solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the hydrodynamic limit and verify that the system displays considerable deviations from local equilibrium, even though the energy-momentum tensor is well described by fluid dynamics. We further show the 14-moment approximation [3], widely employed in simulations of heavy ion collisions, does not provide a good approximation for the momentum distribution of this system. We quantity this effect computing the emission of photons in the quark-gluon plasma [4] and verify if this deviation from equilibrium can be observed.

,poster,Electromagnetic emission from strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions,"Romero Jorge, Adrian William","FIAS, Frankfurt Univ.",Unknown,"Elecromagnetic probes, such as dileptons, can provide a clear information about the properties of strongly interacting hadronic and partonic matter created in heavy-ion collisions since they are undisturbed by the strong final state  interaction. The dileptons are emitted during the whole evolution of the expanding system from many different sources -  from hadron decays to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) thermal radiation, so the consistent description of dilepton production requires an application of dynamical models. 

In this work we investigate the dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions as well as in proton-proton and proton-nucleus reactions from low invariant energies of a one GeV (SIS) to ultra-relativistic energies of a few TeV (LHC). Our study is based on the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach - a microscopic, non-equilibrium transport approach that incorporates both hadronic and partonic degrees-of-freedom and provides a comprehensive description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, covering the entire process from the initial out-of-equilibrium nucleon-nucleon collisions, through the formation and interactions of the quark-gluon plasma, and extending to the hadronization and final-state off-shell interactions of the produced hadrons. 

The main dilepton sources  in the PHSD are  the hadronic decays and bremstrahlung, thermal QGP radiation (including $q+\bar q \to e^+e^-$,  $q+\bar q \to g+ e^+e^-$,  $q+g \to q+ e^+e^-$ processes), primary Drell-Yan production (computed here dynamically in the PHSD framework)  and semileptonic decays from correlated charm and bottom pairs. We find that the PHSD provides a good description of the dilepton data of the HADES, STAR and ALICE experiments. We investigate the influence of in-medium effects such as a collisional broadening of the vector meson spectral functions  and present the excitation function of the dilepton ""excess"" in invariant mass range $0.4<M<0.75$ GeV  as well as it's centrality dependence for different energies.

For the 1st time we report on the $\mu_B$-dependence of the QGP thermal radiation - calculated in the PHSD within the Dynamical-Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) used for the description of the non-perturbative QGP -  and show that its influence increases with decreasing bombarding energy, where  $\mu_B$ becomes larger. We present the excitation function of dileptons produced from  thermal QGP - including the $\mu_B$ dependence of quasiparticle thermal masses and widths and their interactions - versus correlated charm  that  the QGP overshines the correlated charm at invariant energies $\sqrt{s} \sim 30$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions. This  gives an access to the thermal QGP dileptons at BES-RHIC and future FAIR experiments. Furthermore, we study the contribution of the QGP to the dilepton spectra for p+p reactions at LHC energies and find that it increases with increasing collision energy. Thus, after subtracting the contributions of correlated charm and bottom pairs from dilepton experimental data it might become accessible, too.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adrian William', 'last_name': 'Romero Jorge', 'fullName': 'Romero Jorge, Adrian William', 'id': '9292498', 'affiliation': 'FIAS, Frankfurt Univ.', 'emailHash': '0774c5b83c4e4201c14f9a88a5176fe5', 'db_id': 9292498, 'person_id': 8874256}"

We explain how the coalescence of partially polarized quarks, as well as the transfer of angular momentum from vorticity to the spin of the baryon generically create a partially coherent density matrix.
We argue that spin-vorticity non-equilibrium has the potential to solve the long-standing puzzles within the phenomenology of spin in heavy ion collisions, namely the combined understanding of baryon polarization and meson spin alignment, as well as the azimuthal dependence of baryon longitudinal polarization.   Since in the case of vector mesons, this degree of coherence can be experimentally ascertained by measuring off-diagonal matrix elements,  We suggest that a measurement of azimuthal dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements of the vector meson and quarkonium spin density matrix can falsify and constrain this picture.

,poster,How many interactions does it take to modify a jet?,"Le Roux, Chiara",Unknown,Unknown,"This work aims to shed light on the puzzle of small systems constituted by the absence of jet quenching but the
presence of a non-zero v$_2$ of high pt particles. This is done using the JEWEL event generator with a brick-like medium
definition mimicking a small collision system. We concentrate on two observables: R$_AA$, which measures the energy loss of jets, and v$_2$ of high p$_\perp$ particles, which quantifies the azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles. By extracting R$_{AA}$ and v$_2$ as a function of number of scatterings (N$_{scat}$) in the brick-like medium, we obtain answers that
are largely independent of any assumptions about the medium evolution and expansion.

What we have found is that the observables do not depend only on the number of interactions but also on the screening mass ($m_D$), which controls  how much energy and momentum are transferred at each interaction. In fact, R$_AA$ and v$_2$ scale with $m_D^2 \cdot N_{scat}$. The results also strongly indicate that more interactions
(and thus more energy/momentum transfer) are required to create a visible R$_AA$ signal than a v$_2$ signal. This in turn
helps appease the years long debate on how it is possible that no jet quenching signs have been seen in collisions of
small systems while an azimuthal anisotropy of hard particles is observed and thus allows the community
to move on to study the modification of jets in small systems using more suitable observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chiara', 'last_name': 'Le Roux', 'fullName': 'Le Roux, Chiara', 'id': '9292487', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fecc822f83cca0dab5219559993b7f4c', 'db_id': 9292487, 'person_id': 8929995}"
,poster,Frisco3 - A three-fluid model with continuous freeze-out for intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions,"Reichert, Tom","Institut für Theoretische Physik, Goethe Universität Frankfurt",Unknown,"Heavy-ion collisions in the energy regime of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 2 - 20 GeV, are relevant for the study of dense baryonic matter and the hunt for the critical end point of QCD. In this energy regime the well established hybrids of single-fluid hydrodynamics coupled to transport afterburners are reaching their limitation due to long interpenetration times and an intricate time evolution.

To address this shortcoming we present Frisco3, a novel 3-fluid hydrodynamical simulation model of relativistic heavy-ion reactions with a continuous transition from the fluid phase to the regime of free streaming hadrons, applicable at RHIC-FXT, GSI and FAIR energies. The time evolution of the reaction is consistently described in terms of three coupled ideal fluids, resembling the two nuclei, which couple to the third fluid, the fireball, via a local friction rate, and a continuous drain term, which is determined by the local thermal emissivity and the survival probability of produced hadrons given by their momentum differential, temperature and density dependent scattering rate in the medium. The model thus overcomes the conventional issues of i) single-fluid hydrodynamics loosing applicability at lower energies due to small Lorentz-contraction, long interpenetration times and an intricate geometry. Instead the fireball fluid is continuously generated by friction of the projectile and target fluids, thus capturing the time dependent equilibration of the system. (ii) The model avoids the common Cooper-Frye decoupling. Instead of an ad-hoc freeze-out hyper-surface the freeze-out is dynamically determined by local scattering and expansion rates and thus avoids common issues of Cooper-Frye regarding conservation laws, feedback to the fluid phase or reheating. Frisco3 moreover conserves energy, momenta and charges exactly on an event-by-event basis at any time in the evolution.

We will present first benchmarking results on hadron multiplicities, rapidity and transverse momentum spectra for Au+Au collisions ranging from 2.4 GeV to 20 GeV center of mass energy, in comparison to recently measured data by HADES and STAR.

,poster,Strange resonances shine in NA61/SHINE,"Marcinek, Antoni",Polish Academy of Sciences (PL),Poland,"NA61/SHINE is a multi-purpose, fixed-target hadron spectrometer at the CERN SPS. Its research program includes studies of strong interactions as well as reference measurements for neutrino and cosmic-ray physics. A significant advantage of NA61/SHINE over collider experiments is its extended coverage of phase space available for particle production. This includes the entire projectile hemisphere of the collision, with no low-$p_T$ cut-off.

The energy and system-size dependence of strangeness production plays an essential role in studies of the transition from confined to deconfined matter. At the same time, resonance production is a key observable to study the dynamics of colliding systems at high density. With its zero net strangeness and its valence structure composed predominantly of $s$ and $\bar{s}$ valence quarks, the $\phi$(1020) meson will not be sensitive to strangeness-related effects in a purely hadronic scenario, but will behave like a doubly-strange particle in a partonic system. On the other hand, the $K^*$(892)$^0$ meson brings information on the time evolution of the hadronic phase, with the $K^*$(892)$^0$ to charged kaon production ratio allowing to estimate the time between chemical and kinetic freeze-outs.

This talk presents the first-ever results on $\phi$(1020) and $K^*$(892)$^0$ meson production in *intermediate-size* systems at the CERN SPS, that is, central Ar+Sc collisions at beam momenta of 40$A$, 75$A$, and 150$A$ GeV/$c$ ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 8.8, 11.9, and 16.8 GeV, respectively).

,poster,Transport properties and jet transport coefficients of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma,"Grishmanovskii, Ilia","ITP, Frankfurt",Unknown,"An understanding of the energy loss of fast partons passing through the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is important for the interpretation of experimental data on jet attenuation in the QGP created in heavy-ion collisions, as well as for the study of the modification of the QGP itself. However, gaining this knowledge is a challenging task, since it is related to the non-perturbative regime of QCD, for which only limited information from lattice QCD is currently available.

To work around this issue, we employ the dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM). The DQPM describes the non-perturbative nature of the strongly-interacting QGP at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential based on a propagator representation of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons), whose properties are adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. Using the DQPM propagators, we can explicitly derive the scattering amplitudes for the elastic ($2\to 2$) and inelastic ($2\to 3$) radiative interactions without approximations, allowing us to study both the transport properties of the QGP and jet energy loss in the medium.

We report the following findings:
1. We have obtained energy and temperature dependencies of the total elastic and radiative cross sections. We have found that, while elastic cross sections dominate at low energies and high temperatures, radiative cross sections increase at low temperatures and high energies, becoming comparable or even dominant.
2. We have found that the interaction rate and relaxation time in the QGP are primarily governed by elastic scattering, suggesting that inelastic processes are suppressed in the non-perturbative thermalized thermal medium.
3. We have obtained the jet transport coefficients, such as the transverse momentum transfer squared per unit length $\hat{q}$ and the energy loss per unit length $dE/dx$, and found their strong dependencies on the medium temperature, jet momentum and the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.
4. We have examined the ratio of $\hat{q}$ to shear viscosity $\eta$ and shown that the scaling $\eta/s \approx 1.25 T^3/\hat{q}$ is valid in the weak coupling regime at high temperatures, but is violated in the strong coupling regime at low temperatures.

The anisotropic flow coefficients are sensitive to both the geometrical configuration of the collision overlap region and the transport properties of the medium. Recently, hints of collectivity in small collision systems like pp and p--Pb have been reported, which are traditionally used for baseline measurements to study the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) signatures and cold nuclear matter effects in heavy-ion collisions. This makes O--O and p--O collisions interesting, as they bridge the multiplicity gap between pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions and can provide pivotal information about the observed QGP signatures in small systems. In addition,  $^{16}\rm{O}$ is a doubly magic nucleus and possesses $\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration, where one can imagine four $\alpha$-particles arranging themselves at the corners of a randomly-rotated regular tetrahedron.


In this contribution, we shall present the effect of the presence of the $\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration of $^{16}\rm{O}$ on elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), triangular flow ($v_{3}$) and elliptic flow fluctuations in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid CGC+hydro model based on IPGlasma+MUSIC+iSS+UrQMD framework. The results of  $\alpha$-cluster nuclear configuration of $^{16}\rm{O}$ are also compared with the Woods-Saxon nuclear profile. The results show an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ in the highest multiplicity regions for the $\alpha$-cluster case as compared to the Woods-Saxon profile. Further, a strong increase in the value of  $v_{3}/v_{2}$ is observed when going from the top 10-20% to the top 0-10% multiplicity class for the case with $\alpha$-clusters. Additionally, we find that the elliptic flow fluctuations show opposite trends with a decrease in final state multiplicity for $\alpha$-cluster and Woods-Saxon nuclear density profiles. We conclude that the observables related to fluctuations are more sensitive and suited to study the effects of the $\alpha$-clustered geometry in O--O collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Suraj', 'last_name': 'Prasad', 'fullName': 'Prasad, Suraj', 'id': '9292474', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '2ee76d9d6fe0518337852045b1020ada', 'db_id': 9292474, 'person_id': 8881014}"
,poster,Neural network enhanced Bayesian analysis of heavy-ion observables using EbyE-EKRT model with dynamical freeze-out,"Auvinen, Jussi",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Bayesian statistical analysis is nowadays a well-established method for performing global fits of QCD matter properties and initial conditions to experimental data from ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. However, even when surrogate models such as Gaussian process emulators are used to reduce the number of simulations, the computational costs can still remain prohibitively large for producing sufficient training data for observables, such as rare flow correlators, which require a very large sample of events. These costs can be reduced by orders of magnitude by using neural networks to predict simulated event-by-event observables, whose event averages are then used in the training of the Gaussian process emulators. Here, we present results [1] of a Bayesian global analysis of four collision systems using EbyE-EKRT initial conditions and (2+1)D viscous fluid dynamical model with dynamical freeze-out [2]. The investigated systems are 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb, 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb, and 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC. The statistical analysis is enhanced with deep convolutional neural networks, which are trained to predict the model output event-by-event for a given initial state profile [3], QCD matter properties and freeze-out conditions [4]. This combination of neural networks and Gaussian process emulators allows us to account for the statistics-expensive flow observables that provide further constraints for the temperature dependencies of shear and bulk viscosity, and for Knudsen number and system size -based freeze-out conditions.

To achieve this, it is crucial to identify observables under circumstances that are minimally affected by the process that leads to the initial state of heavy-ion collisions from nuclear wave function. In this talk, we demonstrate that when assuming scale invariance, the effect of this stage on the initial energy or entropy density moments in ultracentral symmetric collisions is negligible for nucleon sizes of approximately 0.7 fm or larger for large nuclei. By borrowing cluster expansion method from statistical physics and using scale-invariance assumption, we calculate the average ellipticity of initial density at the presence of short-range correlation. We compare our calculations to Monte Carlo studies and assess the accuracy of various methods of short-range correlation sampling. Additionally, we find that the isobar ratio can constrain the initial-state parameters, in addition to deformation. Our study indicates that the isobar ratios in ultracentral collisions are especially sensitive to the fluctuation in the weight of the nuclei constituents and the two-body correlation among nucleons. This insight is crucial for drawing conclusions about nuclear deformations based on isobar ratios.

The measurements are based on alpha-stable symmetric Lévy sources, and we discuss the average pair transverse mass dependence of the source parameters. One of the parameters, the Lévy exponent, is of particular importance. The exponent not only describes the shape of the source, but also may be related to the critical point of the phase diagram. Its measurement, hence, may contribute to the search for and characterization of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram and the shape of the particle emitting source.

Moreover, one of the most important goals of NA61/SHINE is to investigate and understand the phase structures of this strongly interacting matter. The investigation of the phase diagram can be achieved by varying the beam momentum (13A-150(8)A GeV/c) or by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Measuring the correlation functions in different systems at different energies enables us to perform a two-dimensional scan of the QCD phase diagram.

As a particular application, we consider dissipative dynamics for the chiral order parameter and study the corresponding effects on static observables such as the phase diagram.

,poster,Transport model study of net-baryon number fluctuations in QCD matter,"Qian  Chen, Qian  Chen",Guangxi Normal University,Unknown,"Higher-order moments of conserved charge fluctuations, such as net-charge, net-baryon, and net-strangeness, are sensitive experimental probes for investigating the critical fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We calculate the cumulants and correlation functions of proton, antiproton, and net-proton multiplicity distributions in Au + Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7 GeV using a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The AMPT model can basically describe the trends of cumulants, cumulant ratios, (normalized) correlation functions of the proton and net-proton measured by the STAR experiment. The multiproton (baryon) correlations in the AMPT model are consistent with the expectation from baryon number conservation.  Since the physics of the QCD critical fluctuations is not included in the AMPT model, our results are expected to only provide a baseline for searching for the possible critical behaviors at the CEP in relativistic heavy-ion collisions[1]. Then, we incorporate critical fluctuations from the functional renormalization group (FRG) into the AMPT model in order to reveal the important effect of hadronic rescatterings on critical fluctuations. We observed apparent influences of hadronic rescatterings on the cumulant ratios of the net-baryon number fluctuations. The results demonstrate that hadronic rescatterings decrease C4/C2 in central collisions and increase C4/C2 in peripheral collisions, thereby bringing the model results with FRG closer to the STAR measurements. The effect of hadronic rescatterings is more significant for critical fluctuations than dynamical fluctuations.  Those study establishes a foundation for incorporating the fundamental dynamics of critical fluctuation into the framework of the AMPT model[2].

,poster,Unlocking QGP Mysteries: Nuclear Clustering and Non-Equilibrium Dynamics in Small-System Collisions,"Zhao, Xinli",University of Shanghai for Science and Technology,Unknown,"Understanding the impact of nuclear structure in high-energy nuclear collisions is critical to advancing our knowledge of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation. In this study, we investigate the role of nuclear clustering, in particular the alpha-cluster structure in $\rm ^{16}O$, using anisotropic flow observations from $\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at RHIC energy. Through systematic simulations with an improved AMPT model, we show that a longer effective parton formation time is essential to match recent STAR experimental data. Importantly, the anisotropic flow coefficients serve as sensitive probes for distinguishing alpha-clustering configurations in $\rm ^{16}O$ nuclei [1].

Additionally, we extend this investigation to $\rm ^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$ and $\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$ collisions at LHC energies, where we compare the results from the AMPT transport model with those from hydrodynamic models. The AMPT model, which accurately simulates non-equilibrium dynamics, shows significant deviations from hydrodynamic predictions, especially in key observables such as elliptic flow $v_{2}$, Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho (v_{2}^{2}\{2\},\left \langle p_{T} \right \rangle)$, and , symmetric cumulants SC(3,2), and four-particle cumulant $c_{2}\{4\}$. These discrepancies underscore the limitations of hydrodynamics, which assumes local thermal equilibrium, in small systems.

The advantage of the transport model lies in its ability to capture the microscopic dynamics of particle collisions, making it more suitable for the study of small and intermediate collision systems such as $\rm ^{20}Ne+^{20}Ne$ and $\rm ^{16}O+^{16}O$, where non-equilibrium effects are significant. Unlike hydrodynamic models that assume local thermal equilibrium, the AMPT model effectively describes partonic interactions in systems with fewer particles, providing a more accurate description of initial state fluctuations and parton escape dynamics. 

These results underscore the importance of transport models in the study of the complex dynamics of small and medium-sized nuclear systems, providing critical insights into the influence of nuclear clustering and improving the understanding of QGP formation at RHIC and the LHC.

,poster,Exploring the QCD phase diagram under the effect of rotation,"Pradhan, Kshitish Kumar",IIT Indore,Unknown,"Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter has become one of the important research areas for both theoretical and experimental high-energy physics community. In the QCD phase diagram, which is characterised by temperature ($T$) and baryochemical potential ($\mu_B$), a first-order phase transition is expected at high $\mu_B$ and low T, which ends at a possible critical point. This is followed by a crossover transition from hadron to quark matter as predicted by lattice QCD calculations. In addition to the magnetic field, a huge amount of vorticity is expected to be produced in a non-central heavy ion collision. This vorticity or rotation ($\omega$) can affect the evolution of the system and, hence, the phase diagram of the QCD matter. In this work, we study the effect of rotation on the phase diagram of hadronic matter. We find that rotation plays a similar role to baryochemical potential on the thermodynamic properties of hadron gas. The rotation adds a new kind of chemical potential called rotational chemical potential. Therefore, the phase transition can occur not only in the $T-\mu_B$ plane but also in the $T-\omega$ plane. We use an interacting hadron resonance gas model with van der Waals kind of attractive and repulsive interaction among the hadrons. We observe a liquid-gas phase transition under the effect of rotation, even at zero baryochemical potential. These results allow us to reinvestigate the QCD matter properties under the effect of rotation and study the phase diagram in the $T-\mu_B-\omega$ plane.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kshitish Kumar', 'last_name': 'Pradhan', 'fullName': 'Pradhan, Kshitish Kumar', 'id': '9292443', 'affiliation': 'IIT Indore', 'emailHash': '281c26de010f50e43e1224d78d5f61ec', 'db_id': 9292443, 'person_id': 8881685}"

Understanding the production mechanisms across different system sizes remains a significant challenge in this field. Hybrid approaches, particularly those based on transport theory and hydrodynamics, such as the core-corona picture, have been successfully applied in previous studies.

Current and ongoing research utilizing the Lund string model within the Pythia8/Angantyr framework has taken a different approach to describe plasma-like signals, such as strangeness enhancement, through string interactions. This string framework does not assume a thermalized quark-gluon plasma and therefore serves as a valuable tool for investigating observables sensitive to collective behavior.

Inspired by the direction of string interactions, we employ the SMASH transport approach to examine whether a system size-dependent string tension can adequately describe experimental data on strangeness production. Additionally, we will explore potential methods for integrating medium-dependent string tension into SMASH.

While past efforts have incorporated a constant in-medium string tension in transport models, this study is the first to evaluate string tension dynamically based on local conditions.

In contrast, a condensed matter physics-based many-body system is expected within meV-eV temperature scales and Fermi energy(chemical potential). Though metals, having Fermi energy from 2eV to 10 eV, follow the WF law but graphene can reach the WF law violation domain by lowering its Fermi energy via the doping reduction technique. By drawing a parallel between graphene's Dirac fluid and hot quark matter, we aim to explore the transport behavior that emerges in strongly interacting, relativistic fluids across vastly different energy scales. We employed the Boltzmann transport theory to determine the thermal and electrical conductivities in graphene and ultra-relativistic quark matter. We observed a striking violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in both systems.

Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. The chiral effective model, based on the principles of chiral symmetry breaking and broken scale invariance, is employed to incorporate the in-medium effects of constituent quarks within hadrons. The classical and quantized versions of electrical conductivity and resistivity are studied in the relaxation time approximation framework of kinetic theory. Anisotropic electrical conductivity and resistivity tensors are investigated by considering cyclotron motion and Landau quantization. In the presence of strong magnetic fields, the Landau quantization of perpendicular momenta results in quantized anisotropic transport coefficients of the system. Two interesting macroscopic manifestations of Landau quantization are the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) [1]. In this work, we explore the possibility of SdH/QHE type oscillations in low temperature and high magnetic field conditions present in the interior of the dense neutron stars, as well as in future facilities of CBM/NICA experiments. Finally, we also present a quantitative estimate of the same in the interior of a neutron star where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density.

,poster,Probing nuclear shape coexistence using heavy ion isobar collisions,"Mehrabpour, Hadi",Peking Univresity,Unknown,"This study is the first investigation of the intricate phenomenon of shape coexistence in atomic nuclei, particularly within ultra-relativistic ion collisions. Recent findings challenge the traditional view of nuclei as fixed configurations, revealing that nuclear deformation—characterized by shape parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$—can lead to multiple configurations. We distinguish between three scenarios: type A, where two distinct separate shapes correspond to specific states, and type B, where differently deformed shapes mix into a given state, and other extreme cases (EC) where the potential well is low such that we cannot distinguish between type A and B. Utilizing a two-state mixing model and observables such as electric quadrupole $B(E2)$ and monopole $\rho(E0)$ transitions, we analyze the relationship between low- and high-energy nuclear structure transitions. For this means, we use a mixture distribution highlighting the role of shape coexistence in nuclear dynamics. We show that shape coexistence observables are a linear combination of canonical observables  $\alpha_i\mathcal{O}(\beta_2^{(i)})$, with $\alpha_i$ being the different state level possibilities measured by two mixing model. We find that the mixing interaction of bound states leads to an enhancement in the observables such that $\mathcal{O}_{A}<\mathcal{O}_{EC}<\mathcal{O}_{B}$. Furthermore, we show that the shape fluctuation is a spacial case where we either have only one minimum or a maximally mixing of bound states. Consequently, this work enhances our understanding of nuclear structure and its evolution across energy regimes, providing a coherent framework for interpreting experimental results in high-energy nuclear physics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hadi', 'last_name': 'Mehrabpour', 'fullName': 'Mehrabpour, Hadi', 'id': '9292426', 'affiliation': 'Peking Univresity', 'emailHash': '2ead99029d4f019c71c9df2543ab7396', 'db_id': 9292426, 'person_id': 8918048}"

,poster,The effect of acausality on Bayesian analyses,"Siqueira Domingues, Thiago",Unknown,Unknown,"Despite the success of hydrodynamic models in describing relativistic heavy-ion collisions, questions persist about their regime of validity. Non-linear causality conditions provide a clear criterion for assessing the applicability of models. If the evolution of a system violates causality, it cannot reliably represent the underlying relativistic theory. It is now known that state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations enter an acausal regime, at least sometimes. Here we explore the phenomenological consequences of enforcing causality constraints in modern Bayesian parameter estimations of heavy-ion collisions. We find that, while only a small fraction of the system’s energy typically enters an acausal regime at the onset of hydrodynamic evolution, strictly limiting this fraction impacts the inferred initial conditions of the system. This leads to notable shifts in the preferred parameters for QGP properties, including a substantial reduction in the favored values of bulk viscosity. These results underscore the importance of refining theoretical models of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions to ensure more accurate representations of QGP properties.

,poster,Rapidity scan with DCCI at LHC energy,"Fujii, Shin-ei",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"In recent years, analyses using RHIC-BES data have been actively conducted to explore the high baryon number density region in the QCD phase diagram. Meanwhile, even in high-energy collisions, such as RHIC and LHC energies, the presence of high baryon number density matter in the forward rapidity region has been suggested [1]. This implies that, in addition to the analysis of BES data, a rapidity scan—analyzing data along the collision axis in such high-energy collisions—could serve as complementary ways to explore the high baryon number density region in the phase diagram. However, a model that provides a comprehensive description of the collision, from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ and from midrapidity to forward rapidity, is essential for precise studies of the rapidity scan. Furthermore, since it is not at all trivial whether the produced matter has reached equilibrium in the forward rapidity region, a model capable of describing the dynamical evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components is required.

The state-of-the-art dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI) model [2] is a novel framework that dynamically describes the space-time evolution of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium components including their interactions. Consequently, it has a great success in comprehensively describing experimental data of high-energy collisions from low $p_{T}$ to high $p_{T}$ at midrapidity. Thus, the DCCI model would be a strong candidate for rapidity scan studies. In this study, we extended the DCCI model by including baryon number current within the ideal hydrodynamics and modeled the dynamical deposition of baryon number into the fluid, enabling us to describe a gradual thermalization process of baryon number alongside the fluid formation through the dynamical initialization. Using this model, we aimed to clarify the baryon number distribution of each core (equilibrium) and corona (non-equilibrium) component across the entire system at the LHC energy. Specifically, we determined which regions of the QCD phase diagram are accessible with the rapidity scan at the LHC energy and showed which rapidity regions of high-energy collisions are comparable to the baryon number densities achieved in low-energy collisions. This study strongly supports the existence of high baryon number density as equilibrated matter in the forward rapidity region at the LHC energy.

Intermittency analysis, a statistical tool employed in heavy ion collisions, studies scaled factorial moments (SFMs) of multiplicity distributions in 2D transverse momentum space. This method helps detect power-law fluctuations and probe different aspects of the QCD phase diagram. While proton intermittency has been traditionally used to locate the critical point, recent efforts have extended this analysis to negatively charged hadrons to gain further insights into QCD interactions.

This contribution presents an overview of the results obtained from proton intermittency in Ar+Sc and Pb+Pb interactions and negatively charged hadron intermittency analyses in Xe+La interactions.

The evolution of the spin density matrix of the neutral $\rho$ meson is simulated with different initial conditions. The numerical results show that the interaction of pions and neutral $\rho$ mesons creates very small spin alignment in the central rapidity region if there is no $\rho$ meson in the system at the initial time. Such a small spin alignment in the central rapidity region will decay rapidly toward zero in later time. If there are $\rho$ mesons with a sizable spin alignment at the initial time the spin alignment will also decrease rapidly. We studied the effect on $\rho_{00}$ from the elliptic flow of pions in the blast wave model.

,poster,"""Quark Matter in Neutron Stars?  Bayesian analysis of hybrid EoS constraints from recent observations""","Ayriyan, Alexander",University of Wroclaw & AANL,USA,"We present a Bayesian analysis of equation of state (EOS) constraints using recent observational data for masses, radii and tidal deformability of pulsars and a class of hybrid neutron star EOS with color superconducting quark matter on the basis of a recently developed nonlocal chiral quark model. 
The nuclear matter phase is described within a relativistic density functional model of the DD2 class and the phase transition is obtained by a Maxwell construction. 
We find the region in the two-dimensional parameter space spanned by the vector meson coupling and the scalar diquark coupling, where the observational constraints are fulfilled with the highest  (90% of maximum) probability. 
We present the overlap of this region with those where other properties are fulfilled: 
1) the phase transition is strong ($\Delta\epsilon/\epsilon_{\rm crit}>2/3$),
2) the maximum mass of the hybrid neutron star is larger than that of the purely nucleonic star,
3) the onset mass for quark deconfinement is below $M_{\rm sun}$.
We discuss whether the obtained parameter range of the nonlocal chiral quark model for color superconducting quark matter is compatible with the nucleon and omega meson masses in vacuum and saturation properties of nuclear matter, once the model is developed beyond the mean field level.
We show that the finite temperature extension of the hybrid EOS within the Matsubara formalism leads to thermal twin stars as a characteristic feature shared with hybrid EOS models providing an explosion mechanism for massive blue supergiant stars.

We show that in central collisions the resulting thermal vorticity configuration effectively manifests as the formation of two vortex rings in the forward and backward rapidity regions. As a result, the local polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons exhibits an oscillatory behaviour as a function of the azimuthal angle, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the collision system. In contrast, in non-central collisions, the directed flow significantly alters this pattern, preventing full cancellation of the opposing contributions to the polarization and resulting in a non-zero global polarization, highlighting the polarization sensitivity to the collision geometry and collective flow. We propose the measurement of the azimuthal-angle dependence of local polarization with respect to the reaction plane as a novel probe to investigate the internal structure and evolution of the fireball in central and semi-central heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Oleksandr', 'last_name': 'Vitiuk', 'fullName': 'Vitiuk, Oleksandr', 'id': '9289204', 'affiliation': 'University of Wroclaw (PL)', 'emailHash': '0f49ffe380317f0ca89bbd8a6e26a4c9', 'db_id': 9289204, 'person_id': 8956236}"
,poster,Exploring the QCD EoS with AI: Constraints from Current Data and tools for Future Experiments,"Omana Kuttan, Manjunath",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Various approaches to exploring QCD Equation of State (EoS) using modern machine learning/deep learning techniques are presented. In the first part, various existing experimental measurements are used in a Bayesian framework [1] to constrain the density dependent potentials in UrQMD [2] for densities from 2 to 6 times saturation densities ($n_0$). It is shown that while the observables used in the study tightly constrain the EoS from 2- 4.5 $n_0$, the constraints on the EoS beyond 3 $n_0$ are highly sensitive to the choice of observations, highlighting the importance of future experiments.
The second part discusses novel AI based analysis techniques for next generation experiments. We show that DL based models can accurately identify different types of QCD transitions, directly using experimental information such as hits/tracks of particles in the detectors [3]. These methods outperform conventional methods and can be used in experiments for online event characterisation or analysis. We also present a more robust approach using generative models. A point cloud diffusion model capable of ultra fast generation of event-by-event collision output is presented [4]. The model is able to generate realistic collision events with 26 distinct hadron types. The model can be used as a versatile alternative to conventional surrogate models such as the Gaussian process, for a comprehensive Bayesian inference. By being differentiable, such methods can also be directly used for various inverse problems or parameter estimation tasks in experiments. The point cloud representation also makes the model easily adaptable not only to other model calculations or for detector simulations but also in other fields such as cosmic ray air shower simulations.

,poster,Thermal field fluctuations in a chiral lagrangian with broken scale invariance,"PASSARELLA, LUCA",Unknown,Unknown,"We study the finite temperature equation of state by using an effective lagrangian in which a dilaton field reproduces the breaking of scale symmetry in QCD. 
We start by extending a previous investigation in the pure gauge sector $SU(3)_c$  [1], where the dynamics of the gluon condensate, expressed in terms of a dilaton lagrangian, is dominated below the critical phase transition temperature by the dilaton field, while at greater temperatures the condensate evaporates in the form of quasi-free gluons. 
In this context, we study the role of the thermal fluctuations of the dilaton field, through the  technique proposed in Ref.s  [2,3]. This approach  enables the reproduction of the lattice QCD results for the  thermodynamic quantities such as pressure and energy [4].
Moreover, we have extended the study to the equation of state with additional degrees of freedom, namely the $\sigma$, $\pi$, $\omega$ and $\rho$ mesons and nucleons, at finite chemical potential by means of an effective lagrangian which incorporates broken scale in addition to explicitly broken chiral symmetry [5,6]. 
Beyond the mean-field approximation, we study the relevance of the thermal fluctuations of the scalar glueball, other than the contribution of the $\sigma$ and $\pi$ meson fields, and investigate the thermodynamic nature of the phase transition.

Here we propose to apply the light front framework to explain this phenomenon since the light front form explicitly describes the hadron spin including both the quark spin and the orbital angular momentum. After applying the light front spinor, the spin alignment in the polarization of vector mesons with ρ00 > 1/3 can be naturally manifested and in particular, the obtained spin alignment for ϕ meson is in good agreement with the experimental data. This implies that to explain the spin alignment, it is important to properly include the contribution from the gluon interactions that are presented in terms of the orbital angular momentum of the hadron bound state.

In this work, the quark core in a hybrid star is modeled with a three-flavor NJL-type model that allows for color superconductivity ([arXiv:2408.06704][1]). The rich phase structure of dense quark matter heavily influences neutrino transport.	We calculate the direct Urca  neutrino opacities of quark matter in the unpaired and in the two-flavor superconducting (2SC) phase. At low temperatures, the contribution of the gapped quarks can be neglected and we show how the self-consistently calculated quark masses determine the density-window in which the direct Urca process is kinematically allowed. While the direct Urca window for the process $\nu+d\to u + e^-$ is closed at $T=0$, the process $\nu+s\to u + e^-$ has a direct Urca threshold. To investigate the scenario of neutron star mergers, in which the temperature rises to 50-100 MeV, we take into account pair-breaking effects in the 2SC phase.

A deviation from 1 of the ratio of $\chi_{4,22}$ between U+U and Au+Au collisions would suggest sizeable hexadecapole deformation in Uranium-238.

,poster,Shedding light on quark flavor balancing in nuclear collisions,"Nandi, Basanta Kumar",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),Unknown,"Two-particle correlation functions of hadrons are sensitive to mechanisms of particle production and transport in elementary particle collisions. The production of quarks is determined by coupling terms of the QCD Lagrangian. These nominally conserves  quark flavors in addition to  energy, momentum, and electric charge:  flavor  currents are conserved  at the level of quarks and gluons. The production of quarks with flavor $\rm f$ must then be balanced by the production of anti-quarks with anti-flavor $\rm \bar f$. Given flavor conversion $\rm f\rightarrow f'$ is governed by \emph{weak} interaction processes, one can expect that the hadrons produced in the final state of A-A collisions is also flavor balanced. Indeed, one expects that the breaking of flavor balancing should be approximately limited to weak processes occurring on  a time scale longer than the lifetime of the QGP produced in A--A collisions. That implies that one can study competing processes of particle production and their subsequent transport based flavor correlation functions. Charge and strangeness  balance functions have been measured at SPS, RHIC, and LHC. In  this phenomenological study, the usefulness of flavor balancing measurements based on  two-particle correlation functions is explored based on simulations of  proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV with the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator. Flavor  balancing is studied with a broad  variety of hadron pairs, such as $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$, $\mathrm{K}^{+}-\mathrm{K}^{-}$, $\Lambda-\bar{p}$, $\Lambda-\bar{\Lambda}$, etc, to explore dependencies, in particular, on the number of balanced flavors in produced hadrons. 

PYTHIA describes the phenomenology of particle production in nuclear collisions with   2-to-2 parton scattering, multiple partonic interactions (MPI) and Lund String Fragmentation. Additional processes involving  Color Reconnection and Rope Hadronization have also been incorporated to better explain the experimental data observed in collider experiments. This work explores the effects of the MONASH tune with MPI Color Reconnection  on the the normalized two-particle number cumulant $R_{2}$, computed for several hadron pairs,  as a function of the multiplicity of $\rm pp$ collisions. It is found that the amplitudes of the $R_{2}$ hadron correlation functions   increases monotonically with the number of balanced flavors in both minimum bias and multiplicity dependent analyses.  Mapping Pythia particle production mechanisms to the results of this study will shed light on the actual mechanisms in place in nuclear collision.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Basanta Kumar', 'last_name': 'Nandi', 'fullName': 'Nandi, Basanta Kumar', 'id': '9289166', 'affiliation': 'IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN)', 'emailHash': 'b2d0ed8b81abe0951743742fa4610b55', 'db_id': 9289166, 'person_id': 8921084}"

,poster,An Advanced Framework for Higher Order Cumulants of Transverse Momentum and Azimuthal Angle Correlations,"Nathanson, Nina",University of Copenhagen (DK),Unknown,"When the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) forms during high-energy collisions, the dimensions of the produced droplet are dependent on the overlap region of the colliding nuclei, enabling the QGP to encode information about the initial conditions of nuclear collisions and even the structure of the colliding nuclei. The system of particles produced in the final state exhibit collective behavior, and studying these dynamics can provide unique insight into such initial conditions of the collision. The collective azimuthal flow, quantified as $v_n$, can be used to study the shape of the overlap region. The mean transverse momentum, $\left[ p_T \right]$, additionally provides information about the initial size and energy of the system. The joint analysis of these two observables, characterized by the multi-particle cumulant $C(v_n^m, \left[ p_T^k \right])$, provides further information on the relationship between the initial size and shape, and therefore on the nuclear structure. Thus far, the focus has been on three-particle cumulants of this type, but this has proven limited in recent studies and the need for higher order cumulants has emerged, especially in the case of nuclear isotopes that lie within the region of a potential second-order shape phase transition such as $^{128-132}$Xe. In this poster, the algorithms required to calculate such higher order, multi-particle cumulants between $v_n$ and $\left[ p_T \right]$ are presented explicitly for the first time, formulated using an advanced framework.

,poster,Balance Functions for Charmed and Light Hadron Pair Correlations in PYTHIA,"Pruneau, Claude Andre",Wayne State University (US),United States,"In high energy nuclear collisions, the majority of the charm and beauty quark production occurs via perturbative hard scattering on a short timescales and undergoes transport through a medium (which depends on the system), experiencing drag, diffusion, scattering, or recombination into bound states. Investigating these processes requires methods sensitive to both the production cross section and transport effects. Balance functions, first developed at RHIC and now used at the LHC, are statistical observables that measure correlations between particle pairs,  capturing the final snapshot of accumulated charge-dependent interactions. Early-stage quarks have more time to separate, leading to a broader balance function, while late emission allows less time for separation, resulting in narrower correlations. Shifts in the \( \Delta \phi \) offers insights into the medium's expansion rate relative to particle initial momentum.

Heavy-flavor hadrons can provide insights into pre{-}hadronization effects, while light hadrons tend to have their initial parton-level correlations diluted. We propose exploring the possibility of measuring balance functions for particle pairs, including charm particles, in pp collisions with PYTHIA, with the particle pairs to be studied including $ \mathrm{p}^{\pm} $, $ \mathrm{\Lambda}_c^{\pm} $, $ \mathrm{\Lambda}^0 $, $ \mathrm{\Omega}^{\pm} $, $ \mathrm{D}^{\pm} $, $ \mathrm{\pi}^{\pm} $, and $ \mathrm{K}^{\pm} $, to distinguish baryon number transport from electric charge effects. With Run 3 data, studying these observables in small systems is  feasible. PYTHIA simulates both perturbative and non perturbative QCD effects in pp collisions, including  multiparton interaction, color reconnection, and junction formation, impacting baryon transport through color line rearrangements. Mechanisms like shoving and ropes further modify balance functions by affecting final-state correlations. This study aims to compare the findings with competing models, including those that adopt a thermal approach, to assess their effectiveness in describing these correlations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Claude Andre', 'last_name': 'Pruneau', 'fullName': 'Pruneau, Claude Andre', 'id': '9289132', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University (US)', 'emailHash': '9fb7df76b8e8f49c5f63429cae1aad8b', 'db_id': 9289132, 'person_id': 8880434}"
,poster,Parton Fragmentation Functions in Electron-positron Annihilation extracted via a Physics-Informed Neural Network,"dai, siwei",CENTRAL CHINA NORMAL UNIVERSITY,Unknown,"In high-energy physics, accurately predicting cross sections of reaction processes relies heavily on the parton fragmentation functions (FFs). Conventional methods often require parameterized forms and additional calculations to ensure the FFs conform to the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) evolution equations, which can be cumbersome and may not fully capture the complexity of FFs across varying energy scales. Here, we introduce a novel approach to determining parton fragmentation functions using a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN). Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not require prior parameterized forms and directly integrates the DGLAP evolution equations into the neural network architecture, allowing the FFs to automatically satisfy these equations without additional calculations. We present new sets of parton FFs obtained for hadrons in electron-positron annihilation processes at next-to-leading order (NLO) in pQCD using this innovative technique. To validate our approach, we calculate proton-(anti)proton hadron spectra using the extracted FFs and demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align well with experimental data across various energy scales ($\sqrt{s}$ = 130, 200, 500, 630, 900, 1800, 2760, 5020, 5440, 7000 GeV). Our findings indicate that the PINN method not only simplifies the extraction process but also enhances the universal applicability of FFs across different energy scales.

We benchmark it by comparing our numerical results to the analytic one- and two-body densities. By using this algorithm, quantum correlations in the nucleus are then imprinted into the positions. Additionally, the usage of the NSM permits the extension of this algorithm to large systems, such as Au and Pb, which are still prohibitively expensive for full $\textit{ab-initio}$ computations.

,poster,Impact of the radial profile of atomic nuclei on observables in high-energy collisions,"Yan, Zhengxi",Stony Brook University,United States,"The nucleon density distribution within colliding nuclei is typically modeled using the two-parameter Woods-Saxon (WS) distribution. This conventional approach overlooks the fine radial structures arising from the quantal shell filling patterns of protons and neutrons. In this study, we incorporate these fine radial variations by utilizing density profiles from Skyrme-Hartree-Fock density functional theory. We extensively compare the WS parametrization with detailed radial profiles across nuclei possessing qualitatively different density distributions. Our analysis reveals consistent deviations in heavy-ion observables—such as initial eccentricity and participant distributions—that cannot be captured by simply readjusting WS parameters. These deviations exhibit similar behaviors across different nuclei and depend on collision centrality and specific observables. The exceptional sensitivity of isobar collisions to initial state variations offers a promising avenue to detect these fine radial effects. Our findings complement studies on nuclear deformation effects and highlight the necessity of incorporating realistic nuclear density profiles in advanced hydrodynamic simulations and in the extraction of the quark-gluon plasma's transport properties.

While short-lived $\rho$ mesons predominantly decay within the fireball, radiating thermal dileptons, a substantial fraction of $\omega$ mesons decay outside the fireball due to their longer lifetime. These decays contribute to the freeze-out cocktail with the vacuum line shape of the vector mesons. High-statistics data from Ag+Ag collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.55$ GeV, measured by the HADES collaboration, may allow for the isolation of these two different contributions and enable studies of in-medium modifications of the $\omega$ meson spectral function in the experimental data.

The unexpected observation of significant Lambda hyperon polarization in inclusive p+p and p+A collisions using unpolarized beams triggered theoretical efforts to describe this effect. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the origin of hyperon polarization. Several models have successfully explained the behavior of some hyperons, but none have been able to account for the behavior of the entire hyperon family.

NA61/SHINE is a fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS with large acceptance and high particle identification capabilities. The first feasibility studies have shown that the properties of the magnetic field used by NA61/SHINE, together with high statistics of collected p+p collisions at beam momentum 158 GeV/c, offer possibilities to study Lambda polarization in several bins of pT and xF. Current studies concentrate on the extraction of Lambda yields based on an invariant mass distribution of selected pairs of proton and negatively charged pion. These yields are corrected by the MC simulations using EPOS and Fritiof model and two different methods.

,poster,Global electron identifier for CBM using Machine Learning approach,"Subramani, Pavish",Bergische Universitaet Wuppertal,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is an upcoming fixed target experiment being built at the Facility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (FAIR).
The CBM experiment is designed to characterize the QCD medium at high net baryon densities and moderate temperatures.
Di-electrons interact electromagnetically and are unaffected by strong medium effects.
Hence, they are used as a penetrating probe to understand the QCD medium produced in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. 
The identification of electrons with minimal pion contamination is crucial for these kinds of investigations.
The CBM experiment uses a Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) in combination with a Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) for electron-pion separation, and a Time of Flight 
(TOF) detector for identification of other high-mass hadrons.

The current RICH reconstruction algorithm employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a conventional electron identifier, which utilizes ring and track parameters as inputs.
In a recent upgrade, a new XGBoost model was implemented, adding additional input features, replacing the conventional ANN.
The output of the RICH XGBoost model serves as a probability measure for selecting electrons.
Similarly, TRD and TOF have their own measures for the electron identification.
Currently, a global electron identifier using the information from RICH, TRD, and TOF is developed using tree-based ensemble models.
A momentum independent training strategy is used to train the model, as it is foreseen to work for different collision energies (Au-Au systems up to 11 AGeV beam energy) and centralities.

This contribution will focus on the design aspects and performance analysis of the global electron identifier model with corresponding feature optimization.

,poster,Hypernuclei reconstruction performance with the CBM experiment,"Glassel, Susanne",Unknown,Unknown,"Under the extreme conditions of relativistic heavy-ion-collisions hypernuclei are created with large abundancies. Hypernuclei measurements provide insights into the equation-of-state of hadronic matter at high net-baryon densities, as well as into hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-interactions. The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt offers the ideal conditions to explore the production of hypernuclei. The excitation function of hypernuclei production is predicted to exhibit a maximum in the FAIR energy range. In combination with the foreseen high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz, an exceptionally high statistics of hypernuclei will be collected and even very rare double hypernuclei like ${}^{6}_{\Lambda\Lambda}He$ are expected with sizeable statistics. 

For the evaluation of the CBM performance with respect to hypernuclei measurements their reconstruction in the 3-body decay channels is especially important as, e.g., it is assumed that the rare ${}^{6}_{\Lambda\Lambda}He$ can decay into three daughters. To evaluate performance indicators like efficiency and signal-to-background ratio as well as the systematic uncertainties of this type of decay, $^{3}_{\Lambda}H\rightarrow d+p+\pi^-$, which is abundant enough to provide robust results, was studied in detail. Systematical uncertainties were estimated based on simulations with different transport models (e.g. PHQMD), taking into account the extrapolation of the measurements to the full rapidity and transverse momentum range, as well as possible systematic effects of the reconstruction procedures. The experimental sensitivity to properties of hypernuclei, such as their lifetime, was evaluated. In addition, performance studies on the improvement of the reconstruction of ${}^{5}_{\Lambda}He$ by using information provided by the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) will be shown.

Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm.  This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions.

We compare the dilepton production with the STAR data in Au+Au collision system at 200 GeV and use these results as a baseline for the U+U systems. The difference in multiplicity distributions resulting from the different deformation factor $\beta_2$, leads to a greater suppression of dilepton production in systems with a larger $|\beta_2|$, especially in the most central collisions. It was found that the integrated dilepton yield from the partonic phase is more sensitive to the $|\beta_2|$ than that from the $\rho^0$ decay in the U+U system.

Due to their large masses, HQs evolve over the QGP’s short lifetime while retaining information about their interaction with the medium. Typically, HQ evolution is studied using the Langevin equation under the assumption of normal diffusion, where mean-square displacement (MSD) increases linearly with time [1]. However, this approach fails to fully capture the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) simultaneously—a challenge known as the $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle [2].

In this work, we address heavy flavor $R_{AA}$ - $v_2$ puzzle employing the anomalous (super-) diffusion of HQs in the QGP through a fractional Langevin equation (FLE) approach [3], considering a hydrodynamically expanding medium. Unlike the standard Langevin equation, the FLE replaces integer-order derivatives with Caputo fractional derivatives [4], allowing for a broader range of diffusion behaviours, including super-diffusion, where the MSD of HQs increases faster than linearly with time. This model is highly relevant for heavy particles moving through a complex medium like the QGP, where strong correlations and long-range interactions lead to memory effects in particle motion. Our results demonstrate that due to super-diffusion, the HQ energy loss is significantly enhanced in the QGP medium, captures the $R_{AA}$ correctly and contributes to higher values of elliptic flow as the strong interactions with the medium induce greater momentum anisotropy.

,poster,Induced electric field due to thermoelectric effects in an evolving quark-gluon plasma,"Singh, Kamaljeet",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),Unknown,"We have estimated the induced electric field in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) due to its thermoelectric effects. At present, the relativistic heavy-ion collisions are capable of creating QGP, a locally thermalized medium composed of quarks and gluons. 
During the space-time evolution of the QGP medium, interesting thermoelectric phenomena occur due to the presence of electrically charged particles (quarks) in the QGP medium. These phenomena result in the generation of an electromagnetic (EM) field within the medium, even in central heavy-ion collisions. In peripheral collisions, the presence of a spectator current at the early stage generates a transient magnetic field and disrupts the isotropy of the induced electric field. For numerical estimation of the induced electric field, we used a quasiparticle-based model that incorporates the lattice quantum chromodynamics (lQCD) equation of state (EoS) for QGP. The cooling rates used in our calculations are derived from Gubser hydrodynamic flow, while the thermoelectric coefficients—such as Seebeck, magneto-Seebeck, and Nernst coefficients—are crucial for estimating the induced electric field. Furthermore, we explore the effects of an external time-varying magnetic field on the induced electric field and also consider the quantum effects of Landau quantization. Our findings reveal that the space-time profile of the induced electric field is zero at the center and increases away from the center. During the early stages of QGP evolution, the electric field can reach a maximum value of approximately $eE \approx 1~m_\pi^2$, which gradually weakens over time.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kamaljeet', 'last_name': 'Singh', 'fullName': 'Singh, Kamaljeet', 'id': '9360732', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': 'bde3c5732101c27a6dc4da80ef101d22', 'db_id': 9360732, 'person_id': 8881691}"

Additionally, we explore the jet axis decorrelation, defined as the angle between the standard jet axis and the winner-take-all (WTA) axis, which is expected to be sensitive to interactions between the hardest particle inside a jet and the QGP.

The diffusion coefficients are determined using the relaxation time approximation to the Boltzmann transport equation, showing good agreement with existing model calculations in the hadronic regime. We observe that at low $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, hadrons carrying conserved charges such as baryon number ($B$), electric charge ($Q$), and strangeness ($S$) diffuse more rapidly compared to charmed hadrons. As a result, charm fluctuations generated in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions remain significant until freeze-out. In experiments, the net proton number cumulants are typically used as a proxy for net baryon fluctuations. However, the greater diffusion of baryons could lead to a smearing of the critical point signal. Thus,  we propose using net charm number fluctuations as a new probe to locate the QCD critical point.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kangkan', 'last_name': 'Goswami', 'fullName': 'Goswami, Kangkan', 'id': '9360725', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Indore', 'emailHash': '64b51e2ceb296174050a75a819516f65', 'db_id': 9360725, 'person_id': 8881013}"
,poster,Renormalization Group Consistent treatment of NJL Color Superconductivity,"Gholami, Hosein",TU Darmstadt,Unknown,"The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and specifically its extension to color superconductivity (CSC) is an effective model for investigating dense quark matter. However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cut-off artifacts emerging near cut-off energy scales. In this presentation, I focus on a Renormalization Group (RG) treatment that successfully eliminates these artifacts(arXiv number: [2408.06704][1]). Our study reveals a substantial change in the previously established phase diagram of neutral CSC matter. The RG-consistent treatment not only eliminates cut-off artifacts but also aligns with an earlier Ginzburg-Landau analysis, suggesting the appearance of a so-called dSC phase in the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) melting pattern. The new model offers improved phenomenological aspects of speed of sound, demonstrating reliability at higher densities, which is crucial for investigating potential CSC phases in neutron star mergers.

,poster,Segregating prompt and non-prompt production of charm hadrons in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider using machine learning,"Sahoo, Raghunath",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"The studies of heavy flavor (charm or bottom) hadrons in relativistic collisions provide an undisputed testing ground for the theory of strong interactions, quantum chromodynamics (QCD). As the majority of the heavy flavor particles are produced in the initial stages of the heavy-ion collisions, they experience the whole QCD medium evolution. The lightest open charm meson, $D^{0}$, and hidden charm vector meson, J/$\psi$, are particularly useful as they are abundantly produced as compared to other open and hidden charm hadrons, respectively. The $D^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ mesons that are either directly formed during initial scattering or as the decay products of higher charm stages are referred to as the prompt production, which is essential to probe the QCD medium. On the other hand, the non-prompt $D^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ mesons are usually formed as the decay products of beauty hadrons and can provide a key understanding of beauty hadrons.

In this contribution, we use machine learning (ML) models to segregate the prompt and non-prompt productions of $D^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ mesons in proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the
track-level information of the particles like an experimental environment. We have used the PYTHIA8 event generator to simulate the events for the study, which provides a good qualitative description of experimental measurements. We have considered the $D^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}K^{-}$ and J/$\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay channels for our study. To separate prompt from non-prompt sector of charmonia and open charm mesons, topological production of $D^{0}$ and J/$\psi$ are considered.  We have used XGBoost, CatBoost, and Random Forest models for $D^{0}$ related studies, whereas for  J/$\psi$, we have used XGBoost and LighGBM models. For $D^{0}$, we have used invariant mass ($m_{\pi K}$ ), pseudoproper time ($t_z$ ), pseudoproper decay length ($c_{\tau}$ ), and distance of closest approach ($\rm{DCA}_{D_{0}}$ )  as the training inputs. For J/$\psi$ meson, the input sample is chosen keeping ALICE Run 3 muon forward tracker upgrade in mind, which includes, invariant mass ($m_{\mu\mu}$ ), transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and $c_{\tau}$. The machine learning models provide up to 99\% accuracy to dissect the prompt and non-prompt production of both $D^{0}$ and J/$\psi$. Transverse momentum, rapidity and multiplicity differential comparisons between the true and predicted values are compared to evaluate the performance of the models. Experimental comparisons are also made wherever applicable. The ML methods used in the present study can replace the traditionally used fitting method with the added advantage of track label identification. The present ML-based identification of prompt and non-prompt charm hadrons can be useful in experiments that require precise measurements.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raghunath', 'last_name': 'Sahoo', 'fullName': 'Sahoo, Raghunath', 'id': '9360715', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '5e9ee078c0296b41a7757808274b3c42', 'db_id': 9360715, 'person_id': 8881016}"

Working in a homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density, and angular frequency. We demonstrate that in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results.

,poster,Discerning the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in the novel relaxation time approximation method,"Rath, Shubhalaxmi",Universidad de Tarapacá,Unknown,"This work focuses on the effects of rotation on the transport coefficients and observables of the QGP medium. Since the noncentral heavy ion collisions possess finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, the rotation gets incited in the produced medium. The rotation could significantly alter the transport coefficients and observables, such as the electrical conductivity, the thermal conductivity, the Knudsen number, the elliptic flow, the trace anomaly and the isothermal compressibility. We have determined the transport coefficients using a novel relaxation time approximation method within the kinetic theory approach in association with the finite angular velocity. We have compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation and with their counterparts in the nonrotating medium. It is observed that the introduction of angular velocity enhances the transport of both charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the novel relaxation time approximation estimates smaller values of the electrical and thermal conductivities. Additionally, the aforesaid observables get conspicuously modulated by the rotation of the medium. Our observation shows a decrease in the Knudsen number and an increase in the elliptic flow when rotation is incorporated into the medium. This suggests an enhancement in the interactions among the produced particles in heavy ion collisions, leading to faster thermalization of the medium. Thus, as angular velocity increases, the medium moves closer to equilibrium. Further, we have found an increasing trend of the trace anomaly with the rising angular velocity and its slope decreases as the temperature increases. Thus, at high temperatures, the rotation has a paltry impact on the trace anomaly. Overall, the rotation makes the constituents of the medium more interactive and as a result, the medium gets deviated away from the conformal symmetry. We have further observed that the introduction of rotation into the medium reduces the isothermal compressibility and allows the medium to exhibit nearly perfect fluid behavior. This suggests that, with the increasing angular velocity, it is difficult to compress the system. Consequently, the matter becomes stiffer as the rotation becomes more rapid.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shubhalaxmi', 'last_name': 'Rath', 'fullName': 'Rath, Shubhalaxmi', 'id': '9360668', 'affiliation': 'Universidad de Tarapacá', 'emailHash': '1f01e9099b0e46a4b6e9ae566e8f3fbe', 'db_id': 9360668, 'person_id': 8871207}"
,poster,Impact of Open Heavy-Flavor Production on nCTEQ Nuclear PDFs,"Wissmann, Jan",Universität Münster,Unknown,"In this work, we analyze the impact of open-heavy-flavor-production data in proton-lead collisions on the nCTEQ nuclear PDFs. For the theoretical predictions of this process, we use an existing next-to-leading-order calculation in a general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme (GM-VFNS), which, as a pQCD alternative, we compare to the data-driven approach for open heavy-flavor production used in the most recent nCTEQ global nuclear PDF analyses. The latter uses a ""crystal-ball"" function, an effective hard-scattering matrix element that is fitted to data from proton-proton collisions and then used as the theoretical prediction in the proton-lead case. Since the crystal-ball function is given by an analytical formula, it provides the required performance for PDF fits out of the box.
Conversely, pQCD calculations are usually given as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which can take multiple CPU hours to reach a viable precision. Thus, a significant speedup of the evaluation of the pQCD predictions is required to make the direct MC calculation feasible for global PDF analyses. This is achieved by ""gridding"" the hard-scattering cross sections, i.e., calculating them once and storing their interpolated values in look-up tables (grids). The physical predictions can then be obtained by convolving the grids with a PDF of choice, only taking up a small fraction of the runtime of the full calculation.

Our large-system-constrained results are validated by their consistency with the light-flavor photon-normalized $R_{AB} \sim 0.75$ measured in central $d + \mathrm{Au}$ collisions by PHENIX; however, they are inconsistent with the $R_{AB} \sim 1.2$ measured in central $p + \mathrm{Pb}$ collisions by ATLAS.   We show that, independent of a variety of energy loss models, one expects similar suppression in central $p / d + A$ collisions as for peripheral $A + A$ collisions, underscoring the challenges in interpreting the measured enhancement in central $p+A$ collisions.  To better understand the theory expectation, we account for several theoretical uncertainties, resulting in a 50% uncertainty in the extracted value of the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and highlighting concerns about the reliability of using hard probes to measure quark-gluon plasma properties.

,poster,The Power of the Tsallis-Thermometer as a QGP Indicator For Large And Small Collisional Systems,"Barnafoldi, Gergely Gabor",HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics (HU),HU,"Recent experimental results present collectivity also in small systems with high-multiplicity. Today these phenomena are not completely understood: it is an important question whether the presence of the QGP is necessary for the observed collectivity or not. Moreover, the connection between the experimental observables and theories is not trivial. In our phenomenological study we introduce the ‘Tsallis-thermometer’ as an indicator of quark-gluon plasma, that aims to describe the smooth transition from small to large collisional systems.

The Tsallis-thermometer is an excellent measure for locating collective effects in high-energy collisions from small to large system sizes. Scaling behaviors are inherited both from the QCD nature and from system size effects. Thermodynamical consistency helps us to measure EoS more accurately.

Successful applications of the Tsallis-thermometer cover the fileds: 

(i) analysis of the transverse momentum distribution of identified hadrons within the thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-extensive statistics. A wide range of center-of-mass energies and average event multiplicities are studied for various hadron species. We demonstrate that the average event multiplicity is a key variable in the study of high-energy collisions. For this purpose the non-extensive statistical approach is more than appropriate. [1-4]

(ii) The method also works well with geometry-selection of an event and correlates well with spherocity classified events. Results enable us to qualitatively define the underlying event definition beyond the CDF definition. [5]

(iii) Tsallis-thermometer has also presented its success by determining the formation time of heavy flavour hadrons relative to light ones [6] 

In this contribution a comprehensive summary on the power of Tsallis-thermometer will be presented in the liu of the results from the above studies.

,poster,Constraints on the Equation of State of Nuclear Matter from Systematically Comparing SMASH Calculations to FOPI and HADES Data,"Tarasovicova, Lucia Anna",Pavol Jozef Safarik University (SK),SK,"The equation of state of nuclear matter at 2-4 times nuclear saturation density is not very well determined by first principle methods. Heavy-ion collisions offer the opportunity to reach those high densities and collective flow measurements are sensitive to the properties of the medium. At 1-2 AGeV per nucleon beam energy transport approaches are the best choice for the theoretical description of the dynamic evolution of the system. In this work, we aim to constrain the equation of state of nuclear matter by comparing calculations within the SMASH transport approach to directed and elliptic flow measurements for protons and deuterons performed by the FOPI and HADES collaboration in a systematic way. 

A momentum-dependent term is included in the potential for which we show that it is needed to describe flow data. We further incorporate a simple symmetry potential in the transport model and present constraints on the stiffness of the equation of state of nuclear matter at saturation density and on the symmetry potential. For the FOPI data, Z=1 nuclei are considered and differential directed and elliptic flow measurements are compared with the calculations using a chi-square analysis. For Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV, the HADES measurements, the constraints are obtained by performing a Bayesian analysis such that we can also provide an uncertainty for the estimated parameters. The posterior distribution is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for which we emulate the transport model with a Gaussian process to lower computational costs. We find that a relatively stiff equation of state is favoured in our analysis with a small uncertainty whereas the constraints obtained for the symmetry potential are rather loose. For the lower FOPI energy of Au+Au collisions at 0.4 AGeV a softer equation of state yields a better description of the collective flow data. This potential discrepancy can be attributed to the role of resonance excitations that effectively soften the equation of state of the formed medium in higher energy collisions.

However, at these lower energies, the freeze-out parameters are less constrained compared to higher-energy collisions, due to the rare production of certain hadron states. This imposes stringent requirements on experiments to gather sufficient data.
Furthermore, at lower collision energies, additional parameters beyond temperature ($T$), fireball volume ($V$), and baryo-chemical potential ($\mu_B$) as well as the treatment of light nuclei become increasingly important.

In recent decades, significant attention has been given to the presence of hyperons in NS and their influence on the Equation of State (EoS), which describes the dense nuclear matter, lies at the core of the so-called “hyperon puzzle.” The absence of precise measurements of nucleon-nucleon (NN), nucleon-hyperon (NY), and hyperon-hyperon (YY) interactions has hindered progress in resolving this enigmatic contradiction and constructing the universal EoS.
The femtoscopy technique is a method used to study interparticle interactions. It also provides a way to extract the space-time properties of the expanding fireball created in heavy-ion collisions. The interaction between two particles can be described using the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz equation, which constrains two essential parameters: the scattering length ($f_0$) and the effective range ($d_0$). The definitive knowledge about those parameters for NN, NY, and YY systems may be the missing piece of the “hyperon puzzle.”

This collision system exhibits similar conditions to those during the final stages of a neutron-star merger.

One key aspect of this dilepton flow study is the reconstruction of pure electron pairs.
In HADES, this is achieved by employing a hadron-blind Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. In a dense track multiplicity environment such as the one encountered in Au+Au collisions at this energy, one of the main background sources comes from mismatching RICH rings to incorrect track candidates. Recent advancements in the RICH calibration, using very selective time cuts that fully exploit the detector's excellent timing precision, have significantly improved the electron purity, yielding a more precise dilepton flow reconstruction.

,poster,Effect of Coriolis forces on the transport coefficients of rotating nuclear matter,"Dwibedi, Ashutosh",Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai (IIT Bhilai),Unknown,"In off-central heavy ion collisions (HIC), an appreciable amount of initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) of the colliding heavy nuclei can be transferred to the participants and subsequently to the nuclear medium formed [1]. This transferred OAM can give rise to local vorticity in the created matter. The transport coefficients of the matter formed in HIC give ample information about the medium formed and the underlying interactions. The transport properties, such as electrical conductivity, viscosities, and thermal conductivity of quantum chromodynamic (QCD) medium modifies in a rotating frame. By breaking the rotational symmetry of the medium, transport coefficients become anisotropic in a rotating frame. Similar to the Lorentz force in the presence of magnetic fields, the Coriolis force plays the equivalent role in a system with finite angular momentum. In a non-relativistic formulation, we have to introduce the Coriolis force in the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) as an external force. However, considering the relativistic equation of motion in a rotating frame, Coriolis force comes naturally in BTE at leading order in angular velocity. Here, we discuss how electrical conductivity [2,3] and the shear viscosity [4] of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic gas are modified in a rotating frame due to the influence of Coriolis force. The transport coefficients are evaluated with the help of covariant BTE in the relaxation time approximation (RTA). The QGP is modeled with a massless gas of light quarks and gluons rotating with a constant angular velocity Ω. Similarly, the hadronic gas is modeled by the ideal hadron resonance gas (IHRG) in a rotating frame, with the relaxation time calculated in a hard sphere-type scattering, treating the hard sphere scattering length as a tuning parameter. At first, we tune the relaxation time for electrical conductivity and shear viscosity in the QGP and hadronic phases without rotation (Ω=0). After the calibration of relaxation time, we show the variation of perpendicular, parallel, and Hall-type components of viscosity and conductivity as a function of angular velocity and temperature for both rotating QGP and IHRG.

,poster,OmniFold-HI: Advanced ML unfolding for heavy-ion data,"Takacs, Adam",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"Unfolding, the process of correcting measured data for detector distortions, is essential for comparing collider experiments. As experimental measurements grow increasingly sophisticated, the demand for higher-dimensional unfolding methods has risen. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based unfolding approaches have emerged to address these challenges. In heavy-ion collisions, unfolding becomes particularly complex due to the presence of the underlying event. Traditionally, underlying event subtraction and unfolding are treated in separate steps. In this work, we demonstrate that ML-based unfolding methods not only outperform traditional techniques but can also integrate underlying event subtraction directly into the unfolding step, streamlining the analysis workflow.

We introduce OmniFold-HI, a heavy-ion-tailored version of the popular unfolding algorithm [1]. Our version accounts for detector acceptance, efficiency, combinatorial jets, and uncertainties, making it well-suited for real-world analyses. Furthermore, OmniFold-HI can handle an arbitrary number of observables, offering exceptional versatility. To showcase its capabilities, we apply OmniFold-HI to unfold a 15-dimensional jet substructure observable, with the presence of a high-multiplicity thermal background, and simulated detector effects. The unfolding performance is compared with traditional methods, and uncertainties are rigorously quantified. Our results are done by training and testing using distinct event generators illustrating model-independence. We also demonstrate that OmniFold-HI reproduces the maximum likelihood estimate and provide a mathematical proof of the ML-based unfolding algorithm.

Using variational methods, we numerically investigate matrix-QCD$_{2,1}$ in the limit of ultra-strong Yang-Mills coupling ($g_{YM} =\infty$). The spectrum of the model has superselection sectors labelled by baryon number $B$ and spin $J$. We study sectors with $B=0,1,2$ and $J=0,1$, which may be organised as mesons, (anti-)diquarks and (anti-)tetraquarks. For each of these sectors, we study the properties of the respective ground states in both chiral and heavy quark limits, and uncover a rich quantum phase transition (QPT) structure.  We also investigate the division of the total spin between the glue and the quark and show that glue contribution is significant for several of these sectors.  For the $(B,J)=(0,0)$ sector, we find that the dominant glue contribution to the ground state comes from reducible connections. Finally, in the presence of non-trivial baryon chemical potential $\mu$, we construct the phase diagram of the model. For sufficiently large $\mu$, we find that the ground state of the theory may have non-zero spin, indicating a phase reminiscent of the LOFF phase in two-color QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Prasanjit', 'last_name': 'Aich', 'fullName': 'Aich, Prasanjit', 'id': '9359175', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore', 'emailHash': '2671376ed91830883f796daaffca4852', 'db_id': 9359175, 'person_id': 8938570}"

Probing the QCD phase diagram is a challenging task both from a theoretical and an experimental standpoint. Moreover heavy ion collision experiments have shown, that strong magnetic fields arise, which may have a sizeable impact on the phase diagram. From the lattice QCD perspective the finite-magnetic-field case is unproblematic, while simulations at finite chemical potential suffer from the infamous sign problem. In this work, we investigate the QCD equation of state via lattice simulations at external magnetic field and non-zero chemical potential using analytic continuation from imaginary chemical potential. The computations were done on a 32^3 x 8 lattice using the tree-level-improved Symanzik gauge action and 4-stout-improved staggered fermions with physical quark masses. Moreover, we tune the simulation parameters to an isospin-asymmetric and strangeness-neutral point using various expansion schemes to match experimental conditions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marc-André', 'last_name': 'Petri', 'fullName': 'Petri, Marc-André', 'id': '9359166', 'affiliation': 'Bergische Universität Wuppertal', 'emailHash': '4448bb3d06270b15a764652e5d555de3', 'db_id': 9359166, 'person_id': 8939463}"

The fraction of virtual direct photons in the inclusive virtual photon spectrum is obtained from a fit to the dielectron invariant mass spectrum. In the limit of zero invariant mass, this fraction is equal to the relative contribution of real direct photons in the inclusive real photon spectrum.

The yield of direct photons in inelastic pp collisions is compared to perturbative QCD calculations.

The open quantum system approach has recently emerged as one of the most fruitful schemes to meet such requirements. However, the quantum master equations obtained so far in this approach and currently used to make predictions for the upsilon suppression at RHIC and LHC are derived assuming a strict ordering between the QGP temperature $T$ and the energy gaps ($\Delta E$) of the upsilon bound states. This limits their predictive power as the QGP cooling interpolates between the quantum Brownian regime ($T\gtrsim \Delta E$) and the quantum optical regime ($T\lesssim \Delta E$).

,poster,Dynamical constraints for pseudo-gauge transformation,"Hontarenko, Mykhailo",Jagiellonian University,Unknown,"The concept of pseudo-gauge freedom, which is essential for defining conserved currents in effective field theories like relativistic hydrodynamics, continues to inspire significant debate and re-interpretation. In this talk, I will present recent insights that clarify the role and limitations of pseudo-gauge transformations and pseudo-gauge invariance in hydrodynamic systems.

For pseudo-gauge transformations connecting two symmetric energy-momentum tensors, we identify a necessary condition for the associated super-potential: it must satisfy a specific conservation law, referred to here as the ""STS condition."" Notably, this constraint is challenging to fulfill in hydrodynamic frameworks based on standard variables like temperature, baryon chemical potential, and flow velocity. However, in a particular case—the boost-invariant flow—the STS condition is automatically satisfied. This allows for a non-trivial residual pseudo-gauge transformation characterized by a single scalar field. In this scenario, the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients exhibit pseudo-gauge dependence, yet a specific linear combination within the hydrodynamic equations remains pseudo-gauge invariant.

This finding sheds new light on the role of pseudo-gauge transformations, offering valuable implications for theoretical approaches and practical applications in high-energy physics.

One of the hypotheses to describe this effect suggests the formation of a hot and dense QCD medium within the jet cone, a phenomenon previously thought to occur exclusively in heavy-ion collisions. One notable characteristic of such medium formation is the altered production ratio among different particle species. This is particularly relevant for short-lived, strongly decaying resonances, since their decay products can experience (pseudo-)elastic interactions with the formed hadrons after chemical freeze-out. In turn, this drastically alters the final-state yields of such particles. This contribution investigates this phenomenon by analyzing the yields of K* and Φ mesons within high-multiplicity jets in pp collisions at √s = 13.6 TeV with LHC Run 3 data collected with ALICE. The measurement utilizes charged-particle jets, and per-jet yields of K* and Φ are investigated in and out of such jets.

,poster,The model study of flavor dependence for energy-energy correlation functions in pp collisions.,"Lee, Hyungjun",Sungkyunkwan University (KR),KR,"Jets are collimated bunches of hadrons, and they serve as a useful tool for studying QCD. Jets are generated from the hard scattering processes of quarks and gluons in particle collisions, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These processes can be theoretically described by perturbative QCD (pQCD) and are well-modeled by Monte Carlo simulations such as PYTHIA and HERWIG.



Heavy-flavor quarks are produced in the early stages of collisions, before the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed. These quarks interact with the medium and undergo hadronization. Therefore, heavy-flavor jets, which originate from heavy-flavor quarks, are a unique tool for studying the properties of the QGP. Furthermore, due to the dead-cone effect, heavy-flavor jets are relatively less contaminated by gluons compared to light-flavor jets.



To understand the properties of jets, studying the substructure within jets is essential. The Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) is a correlation function of the energy flow within a jet and is known as a robust observable against soft emissions or collinear splittings. Experimentally, the EEC is defined as the energy-weighted two-particle correlation as a function of the angular distance between pairs of particles.

Antishadowing refers to an enhancement of parton densities in nuclei at moderate momentum fractions. This enhancement significantly influences hard scattering processes in nuclear environments. Specifically, gluon antishadowing plays a crucial role in high-energy nuclear collisions, as gluons are key contributors to high-energy particle and jet production.
The $R_{pA}$ results from our simulations show a slight enhancement in the dijet spectrum, reflecting the contribution from the antishadowing region in the lead nPDF.

,poster,Dirac fermions under imaginary rotation,"Pătuleanu, Tudor",West University of Timișoara,Unknown,"The growing interest in the thermodynamic properties of strongly-interacting systems under rotation, particularly using lattice gauge techniques on the Euclidean manifold and with an imaginary angular velocity $\Omega = i \Omega_I$, has motivated the current study of Dirac fields under imaginary rotation. For $\nu = \beta \Omega_I / 2 \pi$ a rational number, the thermodynamics of free scalar fields ""fractalizes"" in the large volume limit, that is, it depends only on the denominator $q$ of the irreducible fraction $\nu = p / q$. We consider the same problem for free, massless, fermions at finite temperature $T = \beta^{-1}$ and chemical potential $\mu$ and confirm that the thermodynamics fractalizes in the case $\mu = 0$. Curiously, fractalization has no effect on the chemical potential $\mu$, which dominates the thermodynamics at large values of $q$. The fractal behavior is shown analytically for the fermionic condensate, the charge currents and the energy-momentum tensor. For these observables, the values on the rotation axis and the large temperature behaviour are validated by analytic continuation and comparison with the results obtained in the case of real rotation. Enclosing the system in a fictitious cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L_z$ allows constructing averaged thermodynamic quantities that satisfy the Euler relation and also fractalize.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tudor', 'last_name': 'Pătuleanu', 'fullName': 'Pătuleanu, Tudor', 'id': '9336242', 'affiliation': 'West University of Timișoara', 'emailHash': 'd245b03cf2c2e48848896ba4c1e6c179', 'db_id': 9336242, 'person_id': 8937381}"

The transition is achieved when the system reaches a specific critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{ch}}$). Lattice QCD calculations indicate that chiral symmetry (CS) restoration occurs around $T_{\mathrm{ch}}$ as well ($\sim 156$ MeV). CS restoration can be investigated using resonances that are parity partners, i.e. particles that have the same quantum numbers except for parity, such as $\mathrm{K^{*}(892)^0}$ and $\mathrm{K_1(1270)}$. These resonances exhibit different masses, widths, and production yields in the vacuum. However, these discrepancies are expected to diminish at a temperature near those associated with CS restoration, resulting in a $\mathrm{K_1}$ to $\mathrm{K^*}$  production ratio higher than  the one predicted by the statistical hadronization model.
The ALICE experiment has excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities across a wide momentum range. Along with the large data sample collected in Run 3, the ALICE apparatus is perfectly suited for measuring hadronic resonances, including those with high mass and width. In this contribution, results on the $\mathrm{K^{*}(892)^0}$ resonance production using LHC Run 3 data for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.36$ TeV will be presented and compared to state-of-the-art models.

These measurements are conducted with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA8 and HERWIG7, focusing on final-state charged particles with transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in the range $0.15 \leq p_{\rm T}\leq 2.0$ GeV/$c$ and pseudo-rapidity $|\eta| \leq 0.8$. Results show that $\langle \Delta p_{\rm T} \Delta p_{\rm T}\rangle$  displays a distinct declining trend with average charged particle multiplicity ($\langle N_{\rm ch} \rangle$) in both models, with PYTHIA8 and HERWIG showing unique patterns. Positive finite skewness is observed in low-multiplicity events across both models, indicating asymmetry in the $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ distributions.

,poster,Determining proto-neutron stars' minimal mass with a chirally constrained nuclear equation of state,"Kunkel, Selina",Goethe University,Unknown,"We study the minimal masses and radii of proto-neutron stars during different stages of their evolution. The main focus lies on the stages directly after the supernova outward shock wave where neutrinos are captured in the core and the lepton per baryon ratio is approximately $Y_L = 0.4$ and a few seconds afterwards, when all neutrinos have left the star. All equations of state used for this purpose fulfill the binding energy constraints from chiral effective field theory for neutron matter at zero temperature. We find for the neutrino-trapped cases higher minimal masses than for the cases when neutrinos have left the proto-neutron stars. Thermal effects, in this work a given constant entropy per baryon, also increase the minimal mass.  Calculations of core-collapse supernovae impose a lower limit of approximately $1.2M_{\odot}$ for neutron stars. Our determined values for the first evolution stage with $Y_L = 0.4$ and $s = 1$ is $M_{min} \sim 0.62M_{\odot}$ and for the stage after that with $Y_{\nu} = 0$ and $s = 2$ we find $M_{min} \sim 0.22M_{\odot}$. We also study the case of an accretion induced collapse of a white dwarf with a lepton fraction of $Y_L = 0.5$ and find large discrepancies in the results of different nuclear models studied.

Our study uncovers that the local thermodynamic relations, which have been conventionally used as educated guesses in relativistic hydrodynamics with spin based on global thermodynamic equilibrium, are generally inadequate. We will present two specific examples to illustrate this: a system of massless and massive free fermions under rotation and acceleration at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Our findings reveal that the traditional local thermodynamic relations are incomplete when the spin tensor is considered. Notably, we show that the derivative of the pressure function with respect to the spin potential deviates from the spin density, acquiring corrections due to acceleration and rotation.

,poster,Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma,"Li, Ke",Huzhou University,Unknown,"Azimuthal anisotropy is by now a standard observation in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, believed to primarily result from hydrodynamic expansion of the created hot and dense quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Ubiquitous observations of azimuthal anisotropy have also been made in small-system (proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and deuteron/$^{3}$He-nucleus) collisions. These observations, while prompting the exciting possibility of QGP droplet formation in those small systems, provoke skepticism on the belief that those anisotropies must stem from hydrodynamic origins. Unfortunately, the interaction strength cannot be arbitrarily tuned in nuclear collisions, which would elucidate the physics mechanisms of azimuthal anisotropy. We report an experimental research [1] on the anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in a harmonic potential of an elliptic shape, where the interactions can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. We also explore higher-order harmonic anisotropies, such as triangular anisotropy by preparing an initial triangular shape of the harmonic potential. It is found that the expansion anisotropy of cold atoms builds up quickly at small interaction strength, indicating that strong hydrodynamic interactions are not a prerequisite. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy as a function of the interaction strength is observed, quantitatively comparable between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics [1]. This observation suggests a universality in the expansion dynamics in interacting systems, independent of the physics nature of those interactions. The universality potentially unifies a variety of disciplines in nature, spanning from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting QGP of the early universe.

The core of such an object can reach densities up to several $n_0$ which enables the possibility for a transition to quark matter. However the properties of such hybrid stars could be mimicked by dark matter and thus one needs a clear understanding of the properties for each object. To do so we study dark matter-admixed neutron stars and try to classify the differences and similarities. We are including bosonic, self-interacting dark matter with a sufficiently stiff self-interaction potential in the form of $V \propto \phi^n$ and find that these neutron stars become ultra-compact ($C \geq 1/3$).  We furthermore study the stability of these configurations by investigating the onset of unstable radial modes. With their unique properties they could account for unusual mass-radius measurements, however the same is valid for quark stars, i.e. stars made off entirely quark matter.

,poster,In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators,"Huang, Wei-Ping",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Quarkonium production can be used to probe the matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, for theoretical understanding of the experimental results on quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions it is necessary to know if and which quarkonium states exist above the crossover temperature, $T_c$ and what are the in-medium masses and widths of different quarkonium states. In this talk we will focus on the lattice QCD study of in-medium bottomonium properties [1].

In-medium bottomonium properties are encoded in the spectral functions, which are related to the Euclidean time correlators calculable on the lattice. We will present lattice QCD studies of 1S, 2S, 3S, 1P, 2P and 3P bottomonium correlators for $T \simeq 133-250$ MeV [1], where the 3P state is explored for the first time. These calculations are performed with non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) approach for the bottom quark and on (2+1)-flavor gauge backgrounds using highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action near physical point. In our study we use correlators of extended bottomonium operators [2, 3] to gain optimized overlaps with specific states and to be more sensitive to thermal effects. Compared to the previous studies that are based on a single lattice spacing per temperature value and temporal extent $N_{\tau}=12$, we use two lattice spacings and lattices with the temporal extent $N_{\tau}=16-30$.

We find that all bottomonia states below the open beauty threshold exist above $T_c$, including 3P state. We will show the temperature dependence of the thermal widths and in-medium masses extracted from the bottomonium correlators with physically-motivated ansatzes for the spectral function. We find that, within estimated errors, the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration, while non-zero widths for different bottomonium states can be observed. These observations suggest excited bottomonium states still exist above $T_c$ and screening is not the likely source of bottomonium dissociation.

We analyzed how variations in the vector interaction coupling ($\eta_V$) and diquark coupling ($\eta_D$) affect the equation of state (EoS), gap parameters, the 2SC and CFL phases, and the speed of sound. Our results show that stronger diquark and vector couplings stiffen the EoS, leading to higher maximum masses for compact stars, satisfying the 2.0 $M_{\odot}$ constraint from heavy neutron star observations. We found that the CFL phase is stable within our RG-consistent approach and that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal limit for non-vanishing vector couplings. Additionally, our analysis suggests that the mass-radius relationship of quark stars varies from self-bound configurations to gravitationally bound ones, with no absolutely stable configurations across the entire parameter space. Based on the observation that in a possible hybrid construction to our model,  2.0 $M_{\odot}$ can be mostly reached if the pure quark branch can already support  2.0 $M_{\odot}$,  we find the parameter range that satisfies this condition.

,poster,The order of the chiral phase transition in massless many-flavor lattice QCD,"Klinger, Jan Philipp",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"The nature of the QCD phase transition in the chiral limit presents a challenging problem for lattice QCD. However, its study provides constraints on the phase diagram at the physical point. In this work, we investigate how the order of the chiral phase transition depends on the number of massless quark flavors. To approach the lattice chiral limit, we map out the chiral critical surface that separates the first-order region from the crossover region in an extended parameter space, which includes the gauge coupling, the number of quark flavors, their masses, and the lattice spacing. Lattice simulations with standard staggered quarks reveal that for $N_f \lesssim 8$, there exists a tricritical lattice spacing $a^{tric}(N_f)$, at which the chiral transition changes from first order ($a>a_{tric}$) to second order ($a<a_{tric}$). Thus, the first-order region is a lattice artifact, and in the continuum limit, the transition is of second order for all $N_f \lesssim 8$. By determining the associated temperatures  $T(N_f^{tric},a ^{tric})$ at these tricritical points, we confirm the expected decrease in the critical temperature as the number of flavors increases. The location of the tricritical point in the continuum limit $T(N_f^{tric},a=0)$ is still under investigation. Current simulations on finer lattices suggest that in the continuum limit, the transition temperature approaches $T(N_f^*,a=0)=0$ at $N_f^*  \approx 8$. This implies that, on the one hand, $N_f=8$ marks the onset of the conformal window, and, on the other hand, for all $N_f<8$ the chiral transition is of second order.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jan Philipp', 'last_name': 'Klinger', 'fullName': 'Klinger, Jan Philipp', 'id': '9319653', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt', 'emailHash': '003de04699876163beab14da743c5299', 'db_id': 9319653, 'person_id': 8928433}"

,poster,SUBA-Jet: A New Coherent Jet Energy Loss Model for Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Lind, Alexander",LNF INFN,Unknown,"We present a new coherent jet energy loss model for heavy-ion collisions. It is implemented as a Monte Carlo perturbative final-state parton shower followed by elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. The model has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z and GLV predictions for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium, as well as the Improved Opacity Expansion. The realistic case for LHC energy with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. The model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind, and we present implementations within the EPOS4 and Pythia 8 Monte Carlo frameworks. These comes with an interface with full simulations of the quark-gluon-plasma with hydrodynamic evolution, such as vHLLE, along with subsequent hadronisation of the jet partons in order to produce realistic distributions that can be directly compared to LHC and RHIC data.

,poster,Heavy flavor angular correlations as a direct probe of the glasma,"Avramescu, Dana",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We study the impact of the glasma initial pre-equilibrium stage of heavy-ion collisions on heavy quarks spectra and correlations. Our main finding is that the effect of glasma on the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ for the heavy quark transverse momentum spectrum is moderate, while $c\overline{c}$ angular correlations are strongly affected by the glasma [1]. Such correlations are relevant for the experimentally measurable $D\overline{D}$ angular correlations.   

We numerically evaluate the classical transport equations for heavy quarks in the glasma fields, which in turn are obtained from a numerical solution of the classical field equations of motion [2]. Within this approach, we simulate the transport of $Q\overline{Q}$ pairs produced back-to-back in the glasma fields and extract their two particle correlations $\mathcal{C}(\Delta\phi,\Delta\eta)$. We focus on the azimuthal correlations  $\mathcal{C}(\Delta\phi)$ and evaluate the decorrelation width $\sigma_{\Delta\phi}$ as a function of the initial quark $p_T$ and Glasma saturation momentum $Q_s$. We find that pairs with moderate $p_T$ in a glasma with sufficiently large $Q_s$ values exhibit a noticeable decorrelation already during the glasma stage. Further, we investigate how heavy quark $p_T$-spectra, initialized according to the FONLL heavy quark production cross section, are affected by the glasma fields. The strong glasma fields cause a shift in the initial spectra from low to higher $p_T$. Nevertheless, this effect on $R_{AA}$ is moderate in comparison with the nPDF contribution to the input FONLL spectra.

,poster,Azimuthal Asymmetries of the multiple interactions in Ultra-Peripheral heavy ion Collisions,"Wang, Lei",Shandong University,Unknown,"In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the electromagnetic processes underlying dilepton production in two-photon scattering, particularly in the context of Ultra-Peripheral heavy ion Collisions (UPC). Our research delves into this phenomenon by examining the azimuthal asymmetry that arises from the multiple interactions of energetic leptons with the medium in UPC scenarios.

We have calculated the $\cos2\phi$ and $\cos4\phi$ asymmetries and discovered that they are significantly large. These findings could provide valuable insights into the electromagnetic characteristics of the quark-gluon plasma formed during hadronic heavy-ion collisions, thereby enhancing our understanding of this complex state of matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lei', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Lei', 'id': '9316091', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '5cca95b615188ea5acf2d86a970e9e8e', 'db_id': 9316091, 'person_id': 8891081}"

Recent works suggest the possibility of inhomogeneous phases, where key properties of quark matter such as the chiral condensate or number density adopt periodic spatial patterns. Although progress has been made in studying these phases within QCD-inspired models, direct analysis in full QCD remains challenging. In the past few years, we have adapted the standard technique of stability analysis to be used in QCD via Dyson-Schwinger equations [PRD 108 (2023) 11, 114019], [PRD 110 (2024) 7, 074014]. However, in this talk, I will introduce a completely new method for stability analysis, which is based on an extension of the concept of chiral susceptibility to encompass inhomogeneous phases [arXiv:2411.02285]. As opposed to previous approaches, this method does not depend on any external input, providing a more conclusive analysis.

,poster,Uncovering Energy Loss in Small Systems via the Tau-Algorithm,"Apolinario, Liliana",LIP (PT),PT,"The tau-algorithm provides a reliable method for extracting QCD parton formation time within jet algorithms. As demonstrated in [1], it effectively distinguishes between heavily modified jets and those with minimal medium-induced changes, offering a robust measure of energy loss independent of the initial jet scale [2], unlike other jet substructure methods. In this talk, we demonstrate the tau-algorithm’s application in probing energy loss within small systems, including high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions, to address the key question of whether a Quark-Gluon Plasma forms in such systems. Our findings impose stringent limits on the presence of QGP signatures in small systems. Additionally, we reveal how energy loss influences parton formation time, differentiating modifications occurring prior to and following the initial splitting. These insights underscore QCD parton formation time as an effective metric for in-medium path length, advancing new tomographic methods for QGP studies.

In an effective Polyakov loop model, we show the interplay between the imaginary and real Polyakov loop susceptibility ratio and the baryon number kurtosis.   As the quark mass increases, both quantities approach a step-function behaviour. This suggests that the baryon number kurtosis remains an excellent probe of deconfinement even in the large quark mass limit. 

We derive the scaling properties of the baryon number cumulants at the deconfinement critical point at zero and non-zero densities. Using the Landau-type potential we extract the mean-field critical exponents and confirm the results with the explicit numerical calculation.

,poster,Enhancing Bayesian parameter estimation by simultaneously adapting to multiple energy-scales with RHIC and LHC data,"Virta, Maxim",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"The evolution of the strongly interacting medium formed in heavy-ion collison is modelled with multi-stage models. The models are driven by a large number of parameters that quantify the properties of the medium and the initial stage of the heavy-ion collision. The need to find model parameters which give the best description of the experimental data imposes a multidimensional optimization problem. The Bayesian analysis has shown to be successful in constraining the parameter values, and the combined inclusion of LHC Pb$-$Pb 5.02 and 2.76 TeV data with additional flow observables has greatly narrowed down the uncertainties [1].

In this talk, we present our latest study in inferring the transport properties of QGP by including the RHIC Au$-$Au collision data in addition to the LHC data used in the previous studies [1]. Additionally, we now define the centrality separately for all parametrisations instead of using a singular definition for all of them. With the added Au$-$Au data and exclusive centrality calibration, the data now favour smaller values for nucleon width and minimum distance between nucleons. The model calculations with the $\textit{maximum a posteriori}$ (MAP) parameters give notably better agreement with the data for the anisotropic flow and the identified particle yields than the previous results. 

Furthermore, we quantify the sensitivities of newly developed flow observables, Asymmetric Cumulants and Symmetry Plane Correlations, highlighting the importance of measuring independent and sensitive observables. Finally, we explore alternative initial-state models with fewer parameters to improve the estimation and address the current model limitations. This is further studied by comparing the marginal likelihood of the models. These efforts require ongoing advancements in both theoretical frameworks and computational methods.

,poster,"Unlocking ``imprints"" of conserved charges in the initial state of high-energy collisions with dissipative hydrodynamics evolution","Almaalol, Dekrayat",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,USA,"We propose a novel set of flow observables designed to probe event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges in relativistic high-energy collisions. We find that, in $\rm Pb\texttt{+}Pb$ collisions at the LHC $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, our observables are sensitive to local fluctuations in baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q), which in turn lead to measurable effects in the anisotropic flow of identified hadrons when two particles of interest (2POI) are considered. Using a newly developed framework, we demonstrate that the observables reduce to 0 or 1 in the absence of BSQ fluctuations but deviate from these values by up to 10\% when such fluctuations are present. Future high luminosity runs at the LHC will provide the necessary statistics to conduct experimental analyses with multiple particles of interest. Experimental validation of our findings will therefore offer an opportunity to place additional constraints on the charge fluctuations produced in the initial states of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

,poster,A new Poincare covariant N-body transport approach for interacting wave packets,"Jinno, Asanosuke",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We formulate an efficient covariant method for interacting N-body systems with correct density-dependent potential and consistent mass-shell constraints.  We implement it in the Monte-Carlo event generator JAM2 and calculate anisotropic flows for RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies.

Microscopic transport approaches such as Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) and Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) have proven to be effective for simulating the space-time propagation of systems in heavy-ion collisions and for extracting the properties of dense nuclear matter. While BUU is a one-body theory, QMD and its relativistic version, RQMD, approaches evolve an N-body distribution function capable of capturing event-by-event fluctuations and correlations, which are crucial for understanding nuclear cluster formation and fluctuations of conserved charges. However, certain approximations for density-dependent potentials in the conventional QMD and RQMD hinder their accurate reproduction of the equation of state. Explicit three-dimensional integration is needed to obtain the exact density dependence, which is numerically expensive. Furthermore, the traditional RQMD models use mass-shell constraints inconsistent with the underlying theory.

This work addresses these limitations by formulating a covariant approach to interacting Gaussian wave packets that achieves accurate density-dependent potentials under correct mass-shell constraints. Our method introduces a novel approximation scheme for computing the density-dependent potential within the RQMD framework, yielding precise solutions with a reduced computational cost. Starting with an action for interacting wave packets, we derive equations of motion for Gaussian packets consistent with constrained Hamiltonian dynamics.

This new RQMD formulation is implemented in JAM2 together with the covariant collision term [1] and applied to Skyrme-type density-dependent potentials [2], the Walecka model [3], and the parity-doublet model [4]. We present results for anisotropic flows, benchmarked against data from the RHIC-BES energy ranges, and demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in simulating dense nuclear matter.

At the end of the hydrodynamical stage, the continuous fluid degrees of freedom are translated to the discrete components of a hadron resonance gas described by kinetic theory. This process is based on the Cooper-Frye formalism and is typically called particlization. Viscous corrections to the Cooper-Frye formula are encoded in a linear correction to the equilibrium probability distribution function. Such corrections at particlization remain a major source of theoretical uncertainty in Bayesian inference of the QGP properties from heavy-ion data.

We introduce and evaluate viscous corrections based on the recently presented novel relaxation time approximation, designed to uphold conservation laws without relying on specific matching conditions or relaxation time parametrization. This new viscous correction also introduces a phenomenological parameter $\gamma$ related to the microscopic interactions between particles. We investigate the performance of this new correction in the particlization process and systematically compare it to traditional viscous corrections to demonstrate its effects and the $\gamma$ dependence on final state observables. The findings provide insights into the particlization process, advancing our understanding of how viscous corrections impact phenomenological analyses of anisotropic flow and hadronic chemistry and offering a pathway for more systematic models of heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gabriel', 'last_name': 'Soares Rocha', 'fullName': 'Soares Rocha, Gabriel', 'id': '9289047', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '2a5d7a1e93e55e9f61ef28a7ab1516d3', 'db_id': 9289047, 'person_id': 8868581}"
,poster,Tuning of new hadronisation models in PYTHIA 8.311: Rope Hadronisation and Close Packing,"Bernardinis, Lorenzo",Universita e INFN Trieste (IT),Italy,"Hadronisation is the complex process by which hadrons form from partons. Due to its non-perturbative nature, an exact theoretical description is unavailable, making phenomenological assumptions necessary. Currently, various hadronisation models are implemented in the Monte Carlo event generator PYTHIA 8.311. In this poster, we discuss tuning these hadronisation models using Professor [1] to better reproduce data on strange hadron production relative to pions as a function of multiplicity, as measured by the ALICE experiment in proton-proton collisions [2].
The first model considered is the Rope Hadronisation model, based on the idea that in high-density string environments, increased string tension enhances strange hadron production [3]. This model has not previously been tuned with ALICE strangeness data. The second model is the more recent Close Packing model, which modifies string tension similarly but does not require space-time modelling of string breaking [4].
Results using the Rope Hadronisation model reproduce strange mesons and multi-strange baryons as a function of multiplicity with $5-10\%$ precision. This new tuning significantly improves the $\Lambda/K^{0}_{S}$ and $\Lambda/\pi$ ratios, reducing previous discrepancies with ALICE data from $15-40\%$ to more acceptable ranges. However, the $p/\pi$ ratio remains inconsistent with the data despite tuning.
A first complete tuning of the Close Packing model is also presented. This model reproduces nearly all particle ratios as a function of multiplicity within one standard deviation, with improved agreement for the $p/\pi$ ratio compared to the Rope Hadronisation model, though some deviations persist.
These results demonstrate the ongoing challenges of accurately modelling both strange and non-strange light-flavour hadrons, highlighting limitations in current hadronisation models.

The interest in N-point energy correlation functions (ENC) has been revitalized for studying QCD, due to their distinct resolution of scales that helps in exploring QCD from perturbative to non-perturbative regimes. Recently a result has been presented for the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in e+e- collisions spanning from the collinear limit all the way to the back-to-back limit, providing vital input to the study of QCD. In this poster, we will discuss new analyses of N-point correlators from the ALEPH e+e− dataset at LEP as well as future prospects.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yen-Jie', 'last_name': 'Lee', 'fullName': 'Lee, Yen-Jie', 'id': '9289023', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '8037f2f5eb66457d78bbe8b4f5515d4d', 'db_id': 9289023, 'person_id': 8853305}"
,poster,Visualizations of heavy-ion collisions based on a transport and a hybrid approach,"Sattler, Robin",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"In most fields of science, visualizations help to understand concepts and to identify potential issues. For these reasons, animations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions provide interesting visual insights into the simulation software used as well as the time evolution of the collisions. In our work, we produce animations for collisions at several beam energies below 200 GeV for different impact parameters and collision systems. The underlying software for our animations are the relativistic transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) and the SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid approach. SMASH constitutes an effective solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation and is suitable for the dynamical description of collisions at low beam energies. The SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid approach mainly combines SMASH, which is used to describe the non-equilibrium phases of a collision, with vHLLE, a software for the simulation of relativistic hydrodynamics. The latter is employed to describe the fluid phase of the hot and dense fireball. This approach is suitable for collisions at higher beam energies. Each visualization is based on the output of a single event from SMASH or the SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid and is animated using the open-source software ParaView.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robin', 'last_name': 'Sattler', 'fullName': 'Sattler, Robin', 'id': '9289019', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c7e0f8597e45706cc59885aa17b7e4a3', 'db_id': 9289019, 'person_id': 8871272}"
,poster,The Micro Vertex Detector for the CBM Experiment at FAIR,"Matejcek, Franz","Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Institut für Kernphysik",Unknown,"The Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) is the first downstream detector of the fixed-target CBM experiment at the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). It enables high-precision tracking of low-momentum particles in direct proximity of the target, e.g., the first out of four planar stations is placed only 8 cm downstream the interaction point. Thus, minimizing the material budget while operating the dedicated CMOS (MAPS) pixel sensors called MIMOSIS in the moderate target chamber vacuum is challenging. Each detector plane will feature a material budget x/X0 ranging between 0.3 and 0.5%. The harsh radiation environment of up to 7・10^13 n_eq/cm^2 and 5 Mrad per CBM running year poses challenging constraints on the choice of technologies and materials employed, and in particular on the sensors. Stable sub-0° C operation to maintain high detection efficiency and low fake rate is mandatory.
The contribution will highlight the technological challenges w.r.t. the CMOS pixel sensor and its integration in dedicated detector stations featuring full geometrical acceptance and minimum material budget for operation in vacuum. The status of the detector R&D and pre-production will be reviewed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Franz', 'last_name': 'Matejcek', 'fullName': 'Matejcek, Franz', 'id': '9289015', 'affiliation': 'Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, Institut für Kernphysik', 'emailHash': '254b0dbc45a35e716c01f84ff005c46d', 'db_id': 9289015, 'person_id': 8862272}"
