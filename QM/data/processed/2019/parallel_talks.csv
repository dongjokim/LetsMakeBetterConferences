Parallel Session - Initial state  I,parallel,Probing modification of the initial state in small systems via jets detected in PHENIX,"Runchey for the PHENIX Collaboration, Jonathan",Iowa State University,USA,"Previous measurements in small systems indicate that the modifications to jets relative to p+p collisions is small. However, looking at more differential measurements may reveal if any modifications do exist. In particular, we compare $\pi^0$-hadron correlations measured with PHENIX in small systems to those observed in p+p collisions to probe any initial state effects. Several systematic uncertainties cancel when comparing the ratio of the awayside yield to the nearside yield in d+Au and $^3$He+Au systems to p+p revealing a quantifiable modification in these systems. In addition, $p_{out}$ distributions for the p+A collisions is measured. An increasing trend in the width of the $p_{out}$ distributions in p+Al and p+Au compared to p+p is observed as a function of $N_{coll}$. The potential implications of these measurements in conjunction with the PHENIX results for reconstructed jets in small systems will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jonathan', 'last_name': 'Runchey for the PHENIX Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Runchey for the PHENIX Collaboration, Jonathan', 'id': '4596120', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State University', 'emailHash': '5aa33062722a60ca6c4b56d92aa66ddb', 'db_id': 4596120, 'person_id': 4585278}"
Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature I,parallel,Regressive and generative neural networks for scalar field theory,"Zhou, Kai","FIAS, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main",Unknown,"We explore the perspectives of machine learning techniques in the context of quantum field theories. In particular, we discuss two-dimensional complex scalar field theory at nonzero temperature and chemical potential – a theory with a nontrivial phase diagram. A neural network is successfully trained to recognize the different phases of this system and to predict the value of various observables, based on the field configurations. We analyze a broad range of chemical potentials and find that the network is robust and able to recognize patterns far away from the point where it was trained. Aside from the regressive analysis, which belongs to supervised learning, an unsupervised generative network is proposed to produce new quantum field configurations that follow a specific
distribution. An implicit local constraint fulfilled by the physical configurations was found to be automatically captured by our generative model. We elaborate on potential uses of such a generative approach for sampling outside the training region.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kai', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, Kai', 'id': '4556923', 'affiliation': 'FIAS, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main', 'emailHash': '35367f3a1455b215b7094f127ab982e2', 'db_id': 4556923, 'person_id': 4525616}"

We study the Lifshitz Regime using both a large N expansion and using numerical simulations at small N.  Experimentally, we contrast the fluctuations in net proton number when one injects momenta from a condensate at zero momentum, near a CEP, to that at non-zero momentum, in a Lifshitz Regime. This is done using a hydrodynamic code, including especially the effect of the rapid expansion of the local rest frame of the medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robert', 'last_name': 'Pisarski', 'fullName': 'Pisarski, Robert', 'id': '4556926', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Lab.', 'emailHash': '217202798ae2f700f97cccb6b0ff593f', 'db_id': 4556926, 'person_id': 4570517}"

Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature III,parallel,Universality driven analytic structure of QCD crossover: radius of convergence and QCD critical point,"Skokov, Vladimir",Brookhaven national laboratory,USA,"Recent lattice QCD calculations show strong indications that the chiral crossover of QCD at zero baryon chemical potential (µ) is a  remnant of the second order chiral phase transition. Furthermore,  the non-universal parameters needed to map temperature T and µ to the universal properties of the second order chiral phase transition also have been determined by lattice QCD calculations. Motivated by these observations, first, we determine the analytic structure of the partition function - the so-called Lee-Yang edge singularity - in the QCD crossover regime, solely based on universal properties. Then, utilizing the lattice calculated non-universal parameters,  we map this singularity to the real T and complex µ plane, and determine the closest singularity to µ=0 in the QCD crossover regime. These results lead to two important implications: (i) An universality based estimate of the radius of convergence for lattice QCD calculations at µ>0; (ii) Universality and lattice QCD based constraints on the location of the QCD critical point in the T-µ plane.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vladimir', 'last_name': 'Skokov', 'fullName': 'Skokov, Vladimir', 'id': '4556915', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven national laboratory', 'emailHash': '0b6847d1a89cd2638b4238138386bffa', 'db_id': 4556915, 'person_id': 4570514}"

Parallel Session - Initial state  I,parallel,Exploring Longitudinal Observables with 3+1D IP-Glasma,"Jeon, Sangyong",McGill University,Unknown,"We present a formulation of the initial state of heavy ion collisions that generalizes the 2+1D boost invariant IP-Glasma [1] to 3+1D through JIMWLK rapidity evolution of the pre-collision Wilson lines. The rapidity dependence introduced by the JIMWLK evolution means that 1) the system no longer trivially satisfies Gauss’ law at the initial time and 2) the form of the 2+1D initial gauge fields will give rise to nonphysical energy deposition outside of the interaction region of the colliding nuclei. To address these issues, we enforce Gauss’ law locally and modify the form of the initial gauge fields in order to accommodate non-vanishing rapidity derivatives. This makes the initial condition consistent with a non-boost invariant system, and thus allows for temporal evolution on a 3-dimensional lattice.

While the transverse physics of QGP has been studied nearly exhaustively, the effect of longitudinal fluctuations introduced by the JIMWLK evolution has yet to be studied in detail phenomenologically. Hence, we couple our 3+1D IP-Glasma model to MUSIC+UrQMD, for completely 3+1D simulations of heavy ion collisions. Specifically, we consider Pb-Pb collisions at \sqrt{s} = 2.76 TeV and study the rapidity dependence of the charged hadron v_n (η) via the η-dependent flow factorization ratios r_n(ηa,ηb) as measured by CMS [2], as well as the charged hadron multiplicity dN_ch /dη.

In this presentation, the measurements of the neutral Drell-Yan (DY) process and of the W bosons are presented in pPb collision at the center of mass energy of 8.16 TeV with the CMS detector. The rapidity dependence of these processes is particularly sensitive to nPDFs, but further information can be gained by studying the mass dependence of DY production, measured for the first time in pPb collisions at 8.16 TeV, down to 15 GeV. In addition, differential measurements in the dimuon $p_{\text{T}}$ or $\phi^{*}$ (an angular variable correlated with $p_{\text{T}}$ measured for the first time in pPb) provide insights on soft gluon emission at low $p_{\text{T}}$.

Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature III,parallel,Probing thermal nature of matter formed at RHIC via fluctuations,"Mallick, Debasish",National Institute of Science Education and Research,Unknown,"Evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions has dominantly come from the agreement of the measured yield of produced hadrons with those from statistical thermal models. Ideally for a thermalized system, in addition to mean, the higher orders of the moments of the multiplicity distribution of produced particles should also show agreement with thermal models. In this respect, studying the moments of the event-by-event distributions of conserved quantities like net-baryon, net-strangeness and net-charge number is best suited. 

We have carried out a systematic study of comparing the results from a thermal hadron resonance gas model with data on higher moments of net-proton, net-kaon and net-charge distributions measured at RHIC beam energy scan program. The experimental acceptances in terms of rapidity and transverse momentum are used in the model calculations carried out for central Au+Au collisions at the centre of mass energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. For the first time, the hadron resonance gas model results are found to explain the measurements up to third order of moment with a common temperature and baryonic chemical potential. These calculations have tested the thermal nature of produced net-particle distributions up to third order, thereby providing evidence for thermalization of the QCD matter formed in high energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. Implications of the findings on our understanding of the phase structure of QCD matter will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Debasish', 'last_name': 'Mallick', 'fullName': 'Mallick, Debasish', 'id': '4556893', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science Education and Research', 'emailHash': 'fd926e54b9eb9c6b6864bf96ea8151e6', 'db_id': 4556893, 'person_id': 4584581}"
Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature II,parallel,Towards a reliable lower limit on the location of the critical endpoint,"Pasztor, Attila",Eotvos University,Unknown,"There have been various attempts to give lower limits on the location of the QCD critical endpoint via lattice simulations. These mostly rely on expanding the pressure in a Taylor series near zero chemical potential, and use estimators for the radius of convergence, mostly the ratio estimator. If the radius of convergence can be found, it gives a lower limit on the location of a true phase transition. I will give an analytic argument that shows that the ratio estimator will not converge in the generic case and explain how to obtain improved  estimators with guaranteed and faster convergence, as was described in Phys. Rev. D 99, 114510. 
As a next step in this research program, we calculate these estimators for the case of Nf=2+1 flavour QCD with physical quark masses, using a stout improved staggered action, two different lattice spacings, and several volumes. On the roughest lattice spacing, we perform a full finite volume scaling study of the radius of convergence of the Taylor series. We also compare with results using an alternative algorithm that directly looks for the closest singularity of the free energy in the complex chemical potential plane, without relying on Taylor expansion coefficients.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Attila', 'last_name': 'Pasztor', 'fullName': 'Pasztor, Attila', 'id': '4556904', 'affiliation': 'Eotvos University', 'emailHash': '72df1e66b49349350b6c7fd382a0093e', 'db_id': 4556904, 'person_id': 4586187}"

For quantitative predictions and analyses of the experimental data, an equation of state at finite chemical potentials is needed as input to hydrodynamic models.

We construct the QCD equation of state at finite chemical potentials including net baryon (B), electric charge (Q) and strangeness (S) based on the results of state-of-the-art lattice QCD simulations and the hadron resonance gas model [1]. The situation of strangeness neutrality and matter with a fixed electric charge-to-baryon ratio, resembling that of heavy nuclei, is considered for the application to relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This increases the values of baryon chemical potential, modifying the fireball trajectory in the phase diagram. We perform (3+1)D viscous hydrodynamic simulations and demonstrate the importance of finite electric charge and strangeness chemical potentials for identified particle production as well as differences in the $v_n$ coefficients of particles and anti-particles in heavy ion collisions at BES energies.

Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature I,parallel,Spectral functions for hot pions below Tc,"Gupta, Sourendu",TIFR,Unknown,"Long-distance properties of QCD are non-perturbative in nature. Lattice computations provide a reliable tool for extracting such information for correlation functions in the space-like domain of momenta, for example for screening phenomena. However, the approach to equilibrium of QCD matter requires knowledge of correlation functions in the time-like domain.

Analytic continuation of correlation functions from space-like to time-like momenta require knowledge of a spectral function. There are few known constraints on the nature of spectral functions at finite temperature. Computations in the weak-coupling theory, provide constraints at high momenta. Analytic continuations of lattice data otherwise have used ``zero-knowledge schemes'' such as MEM. However, any further information on the nature of spectral functions would help to guard against unknown theoretical biases.

Here we apply an effective field theory (EFT) which was developed recently to examine correlators of axial currents. This is a generalization of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model applied to finite temperatures. This was parametrized to describe lattice data obtained with two flavours of light dynamical Wilson quarks.

We use this effective field theory to examine the analytic continuation of correlation functions of composite pion operators below T_c from the space-like to the time-like domain.

Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature I,parallel,Mesonic Condensation under a Global Rotation,"Hou, Defu",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Recently there have been rapidly growing interests in understanding the properties and phase structures of matter under extreme fields like magnetic field or global rotation. Examples of such physical systems come from a variety of different areas, such as the hot quark-gluon plasma in peripheral heavy ion collisions, dense nuclear matter in rapidly spinning neutron stars, lattice gauge theory in rotating frame, cold atomic gases as well as certain condensed matter materials. In particular rotation has nontrivial interplay with microscopic spin degrees of freedom through the rotational polarization effect and could often induce novel phenomena. For example, there are highly nontrivial anomalous transport effects such as the chiral vortical effect and chiral vortical wave in rotating fluid with chiral fermions. A generic effect is the rotational suppression of  fermion pairing in the zero angular momentum states, which has been demonstrated for e.g. chiral phase transition and color superconductivity in the strong interaction  system (Y.~Jiang & J.~Liao, Phys. Rev. Lett. **117**, no. 19, 192302 (2016)).

We investigate the mesonic condensation in isospin matter under rotation and demonstrate two important effects of the rotation on its phase structure: a rotational suppression of the scalar-channel condensates, in particular the pion condensation region; and a rotational enhancement of the rho condensation region with vector-channel condensate. A new phase diagram for isospin matter under rotation is   mapped out on the $\omega-\mu_I$ plane  where three distinctive phases, corresponding to $\sigma$, $\pi$, $\rho$ dominated regions respectively, are separated by a second-order line at low isospin chemical potential and a first-order line at high rotation which are further connected at  a tri-critical point.

Measurements in small systems, namely pA and proton-proton (pp), are crucial in order to interpret correctly results in heavy-ion collisions. Potential initial-state effects can be constrained through the measurement of the nuclear modification factor in pA collisions ($R_{\rm pA}$), defined as the ratio of quarkonium yields in pA to the reference production in pp collisions, collected at the same center-of-mass energy and scaled by the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Besides serving as reference, results in pp collisions represent a benchmark test of QCD based models in both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. 

The ALICE detector has unique capabilities at the LHC for measuring quarkonia down to zero transverse momentum. Measurements are carried out at both central

Extending these measurements in small systems to high-$p_{T}$ particles, which are predominantly produced in jets, can thus provide crucial information on the origin of these collective phenomena. This talk presents a new measurement by ATLAS of two-particle angular correlations in 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb events with a jet trigger. An additional restriction on the associated particle positions is used to suppress the large non-flow contributions in the jet events.

We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties, as encoded in  other components of the energy-momentum tensor.  We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of large and small systems.   With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when  the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as expected in small systems.

Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state.

Parallel Session - Collective dynamics I,parallel,Longitudinal hydrodynamic response and pseudo-rapidity dependent harmonic flow in  relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Yan, Li",Fudan University,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, it is well-established that geometrical shapes of the initial density distribution in transverse plane are responsible for the observed harmonic flow, through the hydrodynamic response of a set of modes. In particular, elliptic flow $V_2$ is linearly proportional to initial eccentricity $\mathcal{E}_2$. 

In this work, we generalize the framework to study hydrodynamic response along the longitudinal direction. We propose a differential hydrodynamic response relation, $V_2(\eta)=\int d\xi G(\eta-\xi) \mathcal{E}_2(\xi)$, to describe the formation of a pseudo-rapidity dependent elliptic flow, in response to a 3D initial density profile. By analyzing the medium expansion using event-by-event simulations of 3+1D MUSIC, with initial conditions generated via the AMPT model for the Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV, the differential response relation is verified and expansion coefficients to very high orders are identified in the response function $G(\eta-\xi)$.

Our investigations of the hydrodynamic response function have yielded two important insights: 1. The two-point auto-correlation of elliptic flow in pseudo-rapidity (an observable in heavy-ion experiments), can be separated as medium response and two-point correlation of initial $\mathcal{E}_2$. Especially, shear viscosity of the medium reduces the correlation length systematically. 2. Higher order expansion coefficients increase exponentially, which implies a finite radius of convergence of the gradient expansion in the dispersion relation of hydrodynamics. The radius of convergence in the response function results in a minimal length scale that can be used to estimate the applicability of hydrodynamic modeling of heavy-ion collisions, which provides a possible solution to the question of fluidity in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Li', 'last_name': 'Yan', 'fullName': 'Yan, Li', 'id': '4557007', 'affiliation': 'Fudan University', 'emailHash': '995d08201cdc49cbb8230bea56fea991', 'db_id': 4557007, 'person_id': 4585342}"

This EM field, generated by the collision participants and spectators, is predicted to produce a difference in the $v_n$ harmonics for positive- and negative-charged particles, with the magnetic field mainly responsible for a splitting in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$), and the Coulomb electric field leading to a charge-dependent splitting in the $v_2$ and average $p_T$ values of emitted particles. Because of their large mass, charm quarks are expected to be created very early in the collision, and thus have a better chance of interacting with this strong EM field than light flavor hadrons.

In this picture, the vacuum-like parton branchings, as triggered by the parton virtualities, are factorized in time from the medium-induced emissions responsible for the energy loss by the jet. We implement this picture in a Monte Carlo generator that we use to study two phenomenologically important observables: the jet nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the $z_g$ distribution reflecting the jet substructure.  In both cases, the outcome of our Monte Carlo simulations is in good agreement with the LHC measurements. We find that the energy loss by the jet is increasing with the jet transverse momentum, due to a rise in the number of partonic sources via vacuum-like emissions. This is a key element in our description of both $R_{AA}$ and $z_g$. For the latter, we identify two main nuclear effects: incoherent jet energy loss and hard medium-induced emissions. As the jet transverse momentum increases, we predict a qualitative change in the  ratio between the $z_g$ distributions in PbPb and pp collisions: from increasing at small $z_g$, this ratio becomes slightly decreasing.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Paul', 'last_name': 'Caucal', 'fullName': 'Caucal, Paul', 'id': '4557137', 'affiliation': 'IPhT', 'emailHash': '8a6e9ace49ff92569ac79fffdf3b0f41', 'db_id': 4557137, 'person_id': 4585586}"

A causal formulation for the space-time profile of energy-momentum source terms is incorporated with a multi-stage jet evolution and (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamics within the JETSCAPE 2.0 framework. In this work, we employ a causal relativistic diffusion equation to model the evolution of the localized energy and momentum depositions by jet partons before injection into the QGP fluid. This formulation provides the source terms with a space-time profile that naturally preserves causality. The diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time used in this model are directly connected to the transport properties of the QGP, such as its specific shear viscosity, and determine the size and shape of the source-term profile.

Utilizing this new framework, we quantify the effects of the hydrodynamic response of a strongly-coupled medium on jet substructures (e.g. jet shape and jet fragmentation functions), by comparing with results for a weakly-coupled QGP where the medium response is modeled with recoil partons. Furthermore, we explore the dependence on the diffusion coefficient and the relaxation time in the diffusion of the sources to show how the transport properties of the QGP manifest themselves in the medium response to jet propagation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yasuki', 'last_name': 'Tachibana for the JETSCAPE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Tachibana for the JETSCAPE Collaboration, Yasuki', 'id': '4601053', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': 'f2d12d37c7ff2e2f9abd56a9a3ec1725', 'db_id': 4601053, 'person_id': 4574576}"
Parallel Session -  Jet modifications II,parallel,How to infer the shape of the QGP droplet from high pt data,"Djordjevic, Magdalena",Institute of Physics Belgrade,Unknown,"The spatial anisotropy of QGP, formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, is commonly inferred form models of early QGP evolution. These studies (e.g. MC-Glauber, EKRT, IP-Glasma, MC-KLN), based on different methods, lead to notably different predictions, with a notable effect in the resulting predictions for both low and high pt data. On the other hand, energy loss of high-pt particles traversing QCD medium is an excellent probe of QGP properties, particularly since there is a wealth of accumulated high pt experimental data. Therefore, as a novel and complementary approach, we here propose using high pt theory and data to infer the shape of initial QGP droplet. 

To achieve this, we use DREENA framework, which is fully optimized computational procedure based on our state-of-the art dynamical energy loss formalism. Our most recent results show that, when embedded in 3+1D hydro medium model, DREENA provides a very good joint agreement with both $v_2$ and $R_{AA}$ data, contrary to the $v_2$ puzzle faced by models with simpler energy loss mechanisms. This, together with good joint agreement of our model with a wide range of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data (obtained with no fitting parameters used in model testing) shows that DREENA can realistically descibe high pt parton-medium interactions. By using DREENA framework, we show, through analytical arguments, numerical calculations, and comparison with experimental data, that $v_2$/(1−$R_{AA}$) reaches a well-defined saturation value at high pt, which is in turn proportional to the initial anisotropy. We provide first anisotropy estimates from our approach, and compare them with the predictions of early QGP evolution models. With expected future significant reduction of experimental errors, the anisotropy extracted from experimental data will strongly constrain the calculations of initial particle production in heavy-ion collisions, and thus test our understanding of QGP physics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Magdalena', 'last_name': 'Djordjevic', 'fullName': 'Djordjevic, Magdalena', 'id': '4557186', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics Belgrade', 'emailHash': 'cd2431a8a0df4620e2089e22395231b7', 'db_id': 4557186, 'person_id': 4585763}"

We compare the predicted dijet relative azimuthal angle distributions for jets propagating through both perturbative (wQGP/HTL) and nonperturbative (sQGMP) models of the color structure of QCD perfect fluids as described by the VISHNU viscous hydro framework.  Our strategy to discriminate between these pictures of the QGP is based on the different parametric dependence of the jet path energy loss functionals, $\Delta E[x[t]] \propto <\hat{q}L^2>$; and the width of the dijet azimuthal angle distribution, which is proportional the transverse saturation squared path functional, $Q_s^2[x[t]] \propto <\hat{q}L>$. By constraining $\Delta E[x[t]]$ using inclusive hadron and jet suppression data, the medium-induced dijet acoplanarity is predicted by CUJET3 to be approximately twice as large in sQGMP than in wQGP.

The recent reported $D^0$ meson radial profiles in jets measured by CMS collaboration provide new experimental constraints on the mechanisms of heavy flavor production in proton-proton collisions and give new insights into the in-medium interaction mechanisms of heavy quarks inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In this talk, we present the first theoretical calculations of the $D^0$ meson radial distributions relative to the jet axis both in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, which show a nice agreement compared to the experimental data. In our work, the in-medium parton propagations are described by a Monte Carlo transport model which uses the next-to-leading order (NLO) plus parton shower (PS) event generator SHERPA as input and includes elastic (collisional) and inelastic (radiative) interaction for heavy quarks as well as light partons. Our simulated results show that, at low $D^0$ $p_T$, the radial distribution shifts to larger radius indicating a strong diffusion effect of charm quarks due to the in-medium interactions, but no significant modification observed at high $D^0$ $p_T$, which are consistent with the experimental data. In the further study, we estimate the net effect on the charm diffusion from collisional and radiative mechanism, and demonstrate the $p_T$ dependence of this diffusion effect. We find that collisional process has significant effects at low $p_T$, especially dominates at $0-5$ GeV, and the radiative process has a non-zero effect even at high $p_T\sim 50$ GeV. The total diffusion effect decreases with $D^0$ $p_T$ which explains the significant modification at low $D^0$ meson $p_T$ observed in experiment. Besides, for unit energy loss, the collisional interaction shows much stronger angular deviation than radiative interaction indicating an essential difference between these two mechanisms.  For completeness, we also present the calculations of $D^0$ meson radial distribution in jets in p+p and $0-10\%$ Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV, and estimate the nuclear modification factor of charm jet in central Au+Au collisions at $200$ GeV and central Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sa', 'last_name': 'WANG', 'fullName': 'WANG, Sa', 'id': '4557366', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '2b609468aa2ac6ec877a46a4e4d89f67', 'db_id': 4557366, 'person_id': 4581653}"

created in heavy-ion collisions. At low invariant mass, the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the medium related to the chiral symmetry 
restoration. In the intermediate-mass region, the main component of the dielectron continuum is coming from correlated electron pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, which carry information about heavy-quark energy loss and collectivity. In this mass region, thermal 
radiation from the QGP gives insight into the early temperature of the medium. Finally, 
at very low momenta initial photon annihilation and photonuclear processes, triggered by 
the coherent electromagnetic fields of the incoming nuclei, are expected to play a role 
in more peripheral collisions.

To study the dielectron production in heavy-ion collisions, it is crucial to first understand the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum with minimum-bias proton-proton collisions and to disentangle hot from cold-nuclear matter effects with p--Pb collisions. Moreover, observations of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions show surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions, which can be further investigated with the measurement of dielectrons in such collisions.

In this talk, we will give an overview of the latest measurements of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ 
pair production in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions recorded by ALICE at different energies. The results will be shown as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the event, 
or the centrality of the collision. They will be compared to the expected dielectron yield from known hadronic sources and in Pb-Pb collisions with several predictions for the 
thermal radiation from the hadron gas and QGP phases and photo-production of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$. Their implications for the production of heavy quarks and quasi-real 
virtual-photons will be discussed as well.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Horst Sebastian', 'last_name': 'Scheid for the ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Scheid for the ALICE Collaboration, Horst Sebastian', 'id': '4596131', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Parallel Session - EM probes I,parallel,Electrical Cross-Conductivity in the Hadron Gas,"Rose, Jean-Bernard",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Inducing an electric field in the QCD medium generates an electric current which is proportional to the matter’s electric conductivity. Since quarks and hadrons also carry baryon and strange charge, such a field also respectively produces a baryon and strangeness current whose amplitude depends on baryo-electric and strange-electric conductivities. We dub the combination of these 3 properties of matter the cross-conductivity and proceed to calculate it in the hadron gas phase at and below temperatures corresponding to the phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon plasma. We use the newly-released SMASH transport code to simulate the hadron gas and the Green-Kubo formalism to extract the transport coefficients. After validating the approach for a simple system for which analytical results can be calculated (namely, pions, kaons and protons interacting with constant cross-sections), we gradually increase the number of degrees of freedom, up to reaching a state-of-the-art hadronic resonance gas as described by our current knowledge. Our results show that there are significant differences in the temperature dependence of the different components of the cross-conductivity as a function of the number of degrees of freedom. This new observable can in principle be computed on the lattice, and as such could be used to further constrain the properties of the hadron gas in the low temperature region.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jean-Bernard', 'last_name': 'Rose', 'fullName': 'Rose, Jean-Bernard', 'id': '4557449', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '35a8f8d9136b27ee4f540551fb9f3d21', 'db_id': 4557449, 'person_id': 4584514}"
Parallel Session - New theoretical developments I,parallel,Computing real time correlation functions on a hybrid classical/quantum computer,"Mueller, Niklas",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Nuclear structure functions and parton Wigner distributions of protons and nuclei are principal components of QCD phenomenology. Their first principle computation is an outstanding problem in QCD, because they involve non-perturbative nucleon/nuclear matrix elements of electromagnetic currents that are light-like separated in Minkowskian spacetime. Real-time correlation functions are a difficult problem for lattice computations, which are only feasible in Euclidean space time.  To overcome restrictions of classical computing, we outline a strategy to compute nuclear structure functions in the high energy Regge limit of QCD using a hybrid quantum computer [1]. Our approach takes advantage of the representation of the fermion determinant in the QCD path integral as a quantum mechanical path integral over 0+1-dimensional fermionic and bosonic world-lines in background gauge fields [2].  While extremely challenging in general, the problem simplifies in the Regge limit, where the interaction of the world-lines with gauge fields is strongly localized in proper time and the corresponding quantum circuits can be written down.  As a proof principle, we employ the Color Glass Condensate effective theory of high energy QCD to construct the algorithm for a first straightforward application of the framework, specifically, the problem of computing the well-known dipole model result for the structure function $F_2$ [3]. We outline how this computation can be systematically scaled up in complexity and extended in scope to other real-time correlation functions, for example to describe non-equilibrium transport of quarks and gluons in a Quark-Gluon-Plasma, where the restrictions of euclidean lattice computations are evident.

It exhibits two regimes: the one dominated by one single hard scattering at high frequency, and the other by multiple soft scattering at low frequency. A closed analytic formula encompassing both regimes is so far lacking. Some progress in this direction was recently achieved [1,2], where we propose an improved opacity expansion approach in which instead of expanding around vacuum the expansion is performed around the harmonic oscillator providing a better convergence of the series at low frequencies We show that the first two orders account for the two known analytic limits.

In this talk we clarify how quark-hadron continuity can be applied to neutron matter in the realistic neutron star environment.  Our key observation is that neutron matter can be smoothly connected to the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) state mixed with a condensate of $\langle dd\rangle$.  We give three convincing arguments:  The first one is the symmetry-breaking argument, the second one is the argument based on rearrangement of gauge-invariant order parameters, and the last one is the dynamical argument associated with nuclear forces in terms of $d$-quark exchanges.  Interestingly, in the quark sector, we have found a universal dynamical mechanism to favor $^3 P_2$ superfluidity above a certain threshold density, below which the ground state is a $^0 S_1$ superfluid.  Such transitional behavior of the favored ground state has been long known in nuclear physics, and as should be the case if quark-hadron continuity holds for neutron matter, quark matter turns out to share the same properties.
Our finding provides us with an important theoretical foundation for the phenomenological construction of the equation of state (EoS) in the neutron star environment.  We conclude that, even in the presence of a $^3 P_2$ component of superfluidity, a prescription to interpolate the EoS smoothly between the nuclear and quark sides perfectly makes sense.  We also emphasize that such a state of the 2SC with tensorial $\langle dd\rangle$ in accord with $^3 P_2$ superfluidity is an absolutely novel state of quark matter that nobody had ever considered.  We discuss physical properties of this novel color-superconducting state and give an account of possible enhancement of tensorial $\langle dd\rangle$ due to Fierz mixing with the energy-momentum tensor.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuki', 'last_name': 'Fujimoto', 'fullName': 'Fujimoto, Yuki', 'id': '4557767', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '6c38c581f800f3b0d85c424a53021da4', 'db_id': 4557767, 'person_id': 4585270}"

However, the lack of experimental data at low energies, where both the anti-deuteron production and inelastic cross sections are very poorly known, prevents precise predictions of anti-deuteron fluxes near Earth.

In ultra-relativistic collisions of protons and lead ions at the CERN LHC, matter and anti-matter is produced in almost equal abundances. This allows us to study the production cross sections of (anti-)deuterons with high precision as well as to measure the absorption process of produced (anti-)deuterons in the detector material.

For the light-light nuclear collisions, such as 16O-16O reaction considered for the upcoming experimental program at RHIC and the LHC, we make definite predictions based on ratios of cumulants. We also point out very interesting aspects of the light-heavy collisions, where the light nucleus is clustered, thus carries intrinsic deformation. There has been a quest for alpha clustering in nuclei over the last 80 years, but evidence at low energies has usually been rather indirect through theoretical studies of binding energies and nuclear sizes. We present here direct experimental signatures of clusterization of light nuclei in ultra-relativistic collisions of 7,9Be, 12C, and 16O on heavy nuclei. Clustering leads to very specific spatial correlations of the nucleon distributions in the ground state of the light nucleus and in the formed fireball, which via collective evolution become manifest in the harmonic flow coefficients of the produced hadron distributions [1-3]. In particular, the elliptic flow is sensitive to clusterization in 7,9Be, and the triangular flow to clusterization in 12C and 16O.

The experimental observed ""correct"" signs of multi-particle cumulants of $v_n$ coefficient in small collision systems, in particular, the negative sign of $c_{2}\{4\}$, are usually interpreted as the signature of hydrodynamic flow. In this talk, I present the investigations on 2- and multi-particle cumulants in high-multiplicity pp collisions, using iEBE-VISHNU hybrid model with HIJING initial condition. Although the model with tuned parameters could nicely describe almost all experimental measurements of two-particle correlations, however, it could not generate the negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. In addition, I will show that this positive $c_{2}\{4\}$ in hydro is not caused by possible non-flow contributions (resonances decay), multiplicity fluctuations (fake flow) or the multi-particle cumulant method itself (statistical stability). Further investigations by replacing HIJING initial conditions with super-MC and TRENTo initial conditions, and by including pre-equilibrium effects and kinetic theory, can not have the ability to reproduce the observed negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. It is also seen that the hydrodynamic evolution generates an additional non-linear (cubic) response of $v_{2}$ to initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$, which results in a positive $c_{2}\{4\}$ despite the negative $\varepsilon_{2}\{4\}$ obtained in the first place.

Two new questions then appear, whether the success of hydrodynamic calculations in 2-particle correlations and failure of hydrodynamic descriptions of multi-particle cumulants requires a novel understanding of initial conditions or the one fluid may not rule them all. In this talk, together with the new calculations from AMPT transport model with various scenarios and also PYTHIA model (with and without color reconnection, with and without string shoving), I will address that using the well known 2- and multi-particle cumulants we can answer the unknown initial versus final stage effects in small collision systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'You', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, You', 'id': '4556970', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '227dd48b81f94eba8b0641c8d63cb1f5', 'db_id': 4556970, 'person_id': 4588364}"

Parallel Session - Small systems IV,parallel,Unified description from small to large colliding systems within dynamical core--corona initialization,"Kanakubo, Yuuka",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"We investigate whether the quark gluon plasma (QGP) is created in small colliding systems through the analysis of strangeness enhancement using the dynamical core--corona initialization model [1].

The yield ratios of (multi-)strange hadrons to charged pions in various colliding systems exhibit monotonic increase and scale with multiplicity at the LHC energies [2]. Motivated by these data, we develop a unified and a phenomenological description of the QGP formation based on the dynamical initialization model [3].

First we obtain the initially produced partons using PYTHIA8 on an event-by-event basis. From these initial partons, we generate initial conditions of QGP fluids as a dynamical process. Here we assume the core--corona picture: Local equilibrium is likely to be achieved among highly populated partons
due to multi-secondary scatterings, while partons tend to traverse without being QGP components when these are in low density regions.
Next we separate dynamically initial partons into QGP fluids (core: dense/soft components) and surviving partons (corona: dilute/hard components) under this assumption. After hydrodynamic evolution, the QGP fluids (the core) are particlized in the decoupling hypersurface, while surviving partons (the corona) are hadronized through string fragmentation in PYTHIA. The final hadron spectra is a sum of both contributions from the core and the corona in this model.

We show the (multi-)strangeness yield ratios monotonically increase with multiplicity due to the competition between core and corona components and successfully reproduce the tendency of experimental data [2]. We also find that the ratios scale with multiplicity regardless of collision energies or system size, which is consistent with experimental findings [2]. Moreover, we calculate the fraction of fluidized energy as a function of multiplicity from small to large systems and find that initial partons are almost fluidized in mid-rapidity even in $\langle dN/d\eta \rangle > \sim 10$.

Parallel Session - Collective dynamics IV,parallel,Momentum-dependent flow fluctuations as a hydrodynamic response to initial geometry,"Hippert, Mauricio",Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"We propose a new and improved principal component analysis (PCA), which characterizes the fluctuations of anisotropic flow and how these fluctuations are correlated in transverse momentum. Then, using state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, we make an explicit connection between the initial geometry and these principal components. The usual eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow implies only a leading principal component, but by including more terms in a cumulant expansion, we can also describe subleading PCA modes, and explicitly show what properties of the initial state generate these subleading fluctuations.  In particular, subleading elliptic flows are generated by higher order cumulants, and therefore probe small length scales of the initial state.  Conversely, subleading triangular flow is more sensitive to nonlinear, mixed harmonic geometric anisotropies. With this information, it will be possible to put new constraints on properties of the early-time dynamics of a heavy-ion collision, including small-scale structure, as well as properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.

Parallel Session - Collective dynamics IV,parallel,Correlation of flow harmonics and mean transverse momentum in 5.02 TeV $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions and event-plane dependence of HBT radii in high-multiplicity $p$+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector,"Bold, Tomasz","AGH Univ. of Science and Technology, Krakow",Unknown,"To assess the properties of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy ion collisions, correlations between the mean transverse momentum, [$p_{T}$], and the magnitude of the flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, are measured by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.  The analysis uses data samples of lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV and proton-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$~TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 22 $\mu$b$^{-1}$ and 28 nb$^{-1}$, respectively. The correlations are measured using a modified Pearson coefficient that is independent of multiplicity fluctuations. To suppress any short-range correlations, the [$p_{T}$] is measured at mid-rapidity and the flow harmonics are measured at forward rapidity.
In Pb+Pb collisions, significant (non-zero) values of the correlation coefficients are observed for all studied harmonics, which show a strong centrality  dependence but vary only weakly with the charged particle $p_{T}$ range used in the measurement. On the other hand, in $p$+Pb collisions, the correlation coefficient measured for the 2$^{nd}$ harmonic is found to show only a weak centrality dependence. The predictions of a 3+1D viscous-hydrodynamic model are found to be qualitatively consistent with the data, indicating hydrodynamic origin of these correlations in $p$+Pb collisions.
As an independent test for the hydrodynamic description of collectivity observed in $p$+Pb collisions, measurements of two-pion HBT correlations as a function of the angle of the pion pair with respect to the second-order event plane angle are presented. The HBT correlation functions, corrected for event plane resolution, are measured as a function of $q_{out}$, $q_{side}$ and $q_{long}$ in intervals of pair transverse momentum and second-order flow-vector magnitude. The correlation functions are fit using the Bowler-Sinyukov form with the exponential HBT correlation function. The extracted HBT radii, $R_{out}$, $R_{side}$ and $R_{long}$ and a significant out-side cross-term are found to exhibit significant modulation with respect to the second-order event plane, similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions. Results of the measurements and physics implications of the result, will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomasz', 'last_name': 'Bold', 'fullName': 'Bold, Tomasz', 'id': '4557018', 'affiliation': 'AGH Univ. of Science and Technology, Krakow', 'emailHash': 'c86400decf25d81fa6a9e609c133e417', 'db_id': 4557018, 'person_id': 4581317}"

This happens mostly because the derivation of hydrodynamics from microscopic theory often relies on the assumption that the system is sufficiently close to local equilibrium -- something difficult to justify in the rapidly expanding systems created in heavy ion collisions. 

In this contribution we propose a more general derivation of relativistic fluid dynamics from kinetic theory, in which the fluid is assumed to be close to an isotropic non-equilibrium state instead of an equilibrium one. We demonstrate that, for a wide variety of non-equilibrium states, one obtains a hydrodynamic theory described by equations of motion that are identical to those commonly solved in heavy ion collisions. The only difference appears in the form of the transport coefficients that enter the equations of motion. Simulations of the relativistic Boltzmann equation equation in 0+1D Bjorken flow in the ultrarelativistic limit are performed to demonstrate this effect, showing that the time evolution of the energy-momentum tensor appears to be fluid-dynamical even when the momentum distribution of the underlying degrees of freedom differs significantly from an equilibrium distribution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gabriel', 'last_name': 'Denicol', 'fullName': 'Denicol, Gabriel', 'id': '4556995', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Federal Fluminense', 'emailHash': '87093148e17ccf5c700e7fd7c4dd7527', 'db_id': 4556995, 'person_id': 4580920}"

Measurement of these two contributions to $v_{n}$ provides crucial insights to discern initial-state models and to constrain the temperature-dependent specific shear viscosity, $\eta/s(T)$, of the plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we have employed the traditional, two- and three-subevents cumulant techniques to provide the first beam-energy and collision-system dependence of the linear and mode-coupled contributions to the higher-order flow harmonics and the associated correlations between different flow symmetry planes. Our results will be presented and discussed for several transverse momenta selections, particle species, and centrality intervals for U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 193 GeV, Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200, 54.4, 39 and 27 GeV and Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The results are compared with similar studies performed by ALICE/CMS/ATLAS experiments at LHC.

Parallel Session -  Jet modifications II,parallel,Jet quenching in a multi-stage approach,"Kumar, Amit",Wayne State University,United States,"Jets engender physics over a multitude of scales, from the hardest interactions in a heavy-ion collision (up to a TeV at the LHC), down to the scale of the freeze-out temperature. A complete description of jet modification must address the role and interplay of the physics at each of these scales and their effect on a wide variety of integrated and differential jet observables. 

In this talk, we present such a comprehensive study by performing a model-to-data comparison for leading hadrons, inclusive jets, and jet substructure observables [1,2]. Using the JETSCAPE framework [3], we succeed in providing a simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor for single hadrons and jets, jet shape, and jet fragmentation function within a unified multi-stage framework which spans multiple centralities, energies and jet radii. This multi-scale approach includes a high virtuality (radiation dominated) generator (MATTER), followed by an on-shell energy loss generator (LBT/MARTINI) or a strongly coupled drag energy loss (AdS/CFT) stage [4]. Each stage transitions to the next at a parton-by-parton level, depending on local quantities such as the parton’s energy, virtuality, and the local density. Measurements of jet and single hadron $R_{AA}$ set strong constraints on the phase-space available for each stage of the energy-loss. We also incorporate jet-medium response through a weakly-coupled transport description with recoil particles excited from the QCD medium. We highlight the central role played by recoil in the description of both integrated jet observables and the sub-structure of the jet.

This interesting phenomenon is fully investigated in the linear Boltzmann transport(LBT) model for jet propagation combined event-by-event 3+1D hydro backgrounds. We found that the $p_{T}$ dependence of jet $R_{AA}$ is determined by the initial spectrum in $pp$ collisions and jet quenching in which medium response has a significant contribution. Furthermore, the energy loss distribution is extracted directly from experimental data within a Beyesian method, which provides a model-independent approach to understand jet quenching in detail.

The dynamical formation of baryon clusters at a QCD phase transition can be described by numerical fluid dynamics, augmented with a gradient term and an equation of state with a mechanically unstable phase [1]. I will show that
the dynamical description of this phase transition, in nuclear collisions, will lead to the formation of dense baryon clusters at the phase boundary [2]. Using state-of-the-art machine learning methods I will show that the coordinate space clumping leaves characteristic imprints on the spatial net density distribution in almost every event. On the other hand the momentum distributions do not show any clear event-by-event features. In fact only a few events can be systematically differentiated when only the momentum space information is available. In such a scenario conventional observables, like the baryon number cumulants seem to be the best hope at finding signals for the phase transition. Indeed it is shown that the third order cumulant, the skewness, shows a peak at the beam energy where the system, created in the heavy ion collision, reaches the deconfinement phase transition.

To understand and predict these signatures, one must account for the fact that the dynamics of any critical fluctuations must be out-of-equilibrium: because of critical slowing down, the fluctuations cannot stay in equilibrium as the droplet of QGP produced in a collision expands and cools. Furthermore, their out-of-equilibrium dynamics must also influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the cooling droplet. The recently developed Hydro+ formalism allows for a consistent description of both the hydrodynamics and the out-of-equilibrium fluctuations, including the feedback between them. We shall provide the first demonstration of how this works, setting up a Hydro+ simulation in a simplified setting: a rapidity-independent fireball undergoing radial flow with an equation of state in which we imagine a critical point close to the μB = 0 axis of the phase diagram. Within this setup, we show that we can quantitatively capture non-equilibrium phenomena, including critical fluctuations over a range of scales and memory effects. Furthermore,  we show the interplay between the dynamics of the fluctuations and the hydrodynamic flow of the fireball: as the fluid cools and flows, the dynamical fluctuations lag relative to how they would evolve if they stayed in equilibrium; there is then a backreaction on the flow itself due to the  out-of-equilibrium fluctuations; and, in addition, the radial flow transports fluctuations outwards by advection.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yi', 'last_name': 'Yin', 'fullName': 'Yin, Yi', 'id': '4557048', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': 'e4c268fdc8102258d49e049b5bc62e26', 'db_id': 4557048, 'person_id': 4585329}"

fully exclusive hadronic final states in collisions involving heavy

machinery with initial and final state parton showers and multi-parton
interactions, and the combined heavy-ion event is hadronised with the
Lund String Fragmentation model to give a detailed picture of the
hadronic final state.

The Angantyr model, which will be described in this talk, includes an
advanced Glauber model where fluctuations in the nucleon wave function
are taken into account to characterise the nature of each individual
nucleon-nucleon collision. This information is then used to steer the
generation of the corresponding sub-event.

The model successfully describes general features, such as
multiplicity and rapidity distributions, in both AA and pA events at
the LHC and elsewhere. Together with the excellent overall description
of pp data provided by Pythia8 itself, this gives a perfect platform
for studying the the transition from small to large systems.

Currently there are, however, no collective effects included for
heavy-ion collisions in Pythia8, and the program is mainly used as a
baseline for investigating eg. non-flow effects on observables
sensitive to collective effects. However, it can also be used as a

Our quantum kinetic equation is valid for an arbitrary quark mass $m\gg m_D∼gT$, where $m_D$ is the Debye mass, and can be used to study relaxation dynamics of spin polarization of massive quarks in perturbative QCD regime.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shiyong', 'last_name': 'Li', 'fullName': 'Li, Shiyong', 'id': '4557105', 'affiliation': 'University of illinois at chicago', 'emailHash': 'b005ffd278a81432b5f8fc854ef4a7a0', 'db_id': 4557105, 'person_id': 4585301}"
Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature II,parallel,First experimental test of HAL QCD lattice calculations for the multi strange hyperon - nucleon interaction with ALICE,"Mihaylov for the ALICE Collaboration, Dimitar Lubomirov",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"A precise understanding of the Equation of State of dense objects like neutron stars is limited by the knowledge about the hyperon interaction and the precision of the models describing the latter. Traditionally, meson exchange models are used to describe the hyperon sector and are constrained by the scarce scattering and hypernuclei data, almost exclusively available for $\Lambda$ hyperons. Recently the HAL-QCD collaboration conducted calculations without relying on constraints by data and with quarks and gluons as degrees of freedom. Their results converge for the interactions between heavier $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ hyperons and nucleons and in the p-$\Omega$ system they predict a bound state.
Femtoscopy measurements in small systems make it possible to map the core of the potential at small distances and are currently the only viable way to provide a sensitive experimental measurement to test the lattice potentials. In this talk, we present the first precise study of the p$\Xi^-$ and p$\Omega^-$ interactions measured in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. For the first time, clear signatures of the strong attractive interaction can be observed for these particles. The potentials provided by HAL-QCD calculations and meson-exchange are transformed so they can be compared to the measured correlation functions. For the p$\Xi^-$ interaction the HAL-QCD prediction is strongly favoured by the data with respect to the meson-exchange model. For the p$\Omega^-$ channel, strongly bound systems are excluded and the comparison between data and calculations leaves only room for binding energies below 1 MeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dimitar Lubomirov', 'last_name': 'Mihaylov for the ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Mihaylov for the ALICE Collaboration, Dimitar Lubomirov', 'id': '4596126', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '24ede85ee1867884f2b3f164530ef6b6', 'db_id': 4596126, 'person_id': 4692801}"

The ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of nuclear matter, such as the strangeness chemical potential and the chemical freeze-out temperature. The yield ratios $(N_{K}N_{\Xi})/(N_{\phi}N_{\Lambda})$ and $(N_{K}N_{\Omega})/(N_{\phi}N_{\Xi})$  are suggested in [1] to be sensitive to strange quark density fluctuations. Studying these ratios as a function of collision energy may provide a unique probe to the fluctuation of strange quark densities during the phase transition from the QGP to hadronic matter. Furthermore,  the STAR fixed-target program extends the low energy reach from $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 7.7 GeV to 3.0 GeV, corresponding to baryon chemical potential from 420 MeV to about 700 MeV. The comparison between the asymmetric system (Al+Au) and symmetric system (Au+Au) at almost equal number of participating nucleons from most central to mid-central collisions provides useful information on nucleon stopping, which is key to understanding the baryon chemical potential. Moreover, in the asymmetric Al+Au system, the peaks of the rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$) are not aligned with the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass rapidity. The magnitude of the peak shift varies with particle species and also with centrality and can serve as a measure of the baryon stopping. 

In this talk, we will present new measurements of mid-rapidity $K^0_{S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 54.4 and 27 GeV.  We will report their spectra, nuclear modification factors and particle ratios compared with thermal calculations. The identified and strange particle distributions in Al+Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 4.9 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 3.0 GeV from the STAR fixed-target program will also be presented.

Parallel Session - QCD at finite temperature II,parallel,Equation of state for hot QCD and compact stars from a mean field approach,"Motornenko, Anton",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"The thermodynamic properties of high temperature and high density QCD-matter are explored within the Chiral SU(3)-flavor parity-doublet Polyakov-loop quark-hadron mean-field model, CMF. The applications of the CMF model to the lattice QCD data, heavy-ions physics, and static neutron stars are presented. In the CMF-model the transition between hadron-dominated and quark-dominated regimes is performed according to the lattice QCD data at zero net-baryon density. At low temperatures the CMF model reproduces known properties of nuclear matter while quarks become dominant at densities $\approx 7$ times nuclear saturation density. In the scope of the lattice QCD data the CMF model predictions for lines of constant physics as well as the baryon number susceptibilities are discussed. The calculated skewness and kurtosis predict three consecutive transitions in phase diagram, the nuclear first-order liquid-vapor phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration, and the cross-over transition to pure quark matter. The deviations from the free ideal hadron gas baseline at $\mu_B=0$ and $T\approx 100-200$ MeV can be attributed to remnants of the first order phase transition in the nuclear matter. The chiral crossing transition and cross-over to quark matter determine the baryon fluctuations at much higher $\mu_B$. The trajectories of heavy-ion collisions along the phase diagram are calculated. The CMF model also describe well the static properties of neutron stars in agreement with data extracted from GW170817 neutron star merger event.

Parallel Session - Chirality II,parallel,Spin alignment measurements of vector mesons with ALICE at the LHC,"Kundu for the ALICE Collaboration, Sourav",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN),Unknown,"In the presence of the large initial angular momentum occurring in non-central heavy-ion collisions, vector mesons can be polarized due to spin-orbital-angular-momentum interaction or they can be polarized during the hadronization process from polarized quarks. Experimentally, this phenomenon can be studied by measuring the angular distribution of the decay daughters of vector mesons with respect to a quantization axis in the rest frame of vector meson. This quantization axis can be the normal to the production plane (defined by the momentum of vector meson and the beam axis) or normal to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter and the beam axis) of the system. The study of the angular distribution leads to the estimation of the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$. A significant deviation of the value of $\rho_{00}$ from 1/3, which causes a non-uniform angular distribution, would indicate the presence of spin alignment.

We will present recent measurements of spin alignment for K$^{*}(892)^{0}$ and $\phi(1020)$ mesons at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb and pp collisions with the ALICE detector.

The global spin alignment is quantified by the diagonal spin density matrix element ($\rho_{00}$) with respect to the quantization axis, i.e. normal to the reaction plane. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, a large initial global angular momentum is expected to be present. This can induce a non-vanishing polarization for hadrons with non-zero spin reflecting the dynamics of the medium. Furthermore, since the magnetic moment of charged and neutral $K^{*}$ mesons differ by about a factor of seven, the comparison of their  $\rho_{00}$ may offer an additional insight into the rotation of the fireball.

At weak coupling, we demonstrate the emergence of early hydrodynamic behavior--prescaling--around a nonthermal fixed point, which is qualitatively different from the more conventional hydrodynamics around equilibrium. Prescaling is a far-from-equilibrium phenomenon which describes the rapid establishment of a universal scaling form of distributions much before the universal values of their scaling exponents are realized. The dynamics in the prescaling regime is encoded in a few time-dependent scaling exponents, whose slow evolution gives rise to far-from-equilibrium hydrodynamic description.

In this formulation, the transport coefficients of far-from-equilibrium fluid dynamics depend not only on the microscopic properties of the system but also on the nonlinear properties of the underlying state of the fluid itself. In contrast to previous works, no additional assumptions about the symmetries of the flow are necessary. An example of this proposal is constructed using Israel-Stewart theory and, in this case, the resummed transport coefficients decrease with increasing Knudsen number according to formulas that can be readily investigated in current numerical simulations of the quark-gluon plasma. We check numerically the existence of attractor solutions in simulations of AA and pA collisions.

At infinite coupling, past work has shown that after the collision the baryon number ends up around mid-rapidity, which is different from high energy heavy ion collisions. In this talk I will present first results for the flow of baryon number in holographic collisions away from the infinite coupling limit, which also means we study the collisions at a larger shear viscosity over entropy density ratio than 1/4π. I will give an introduction to the holographic set-up, which is interesting since it contains an extra coupling of the gravitational Ricci scalar with the Maxwell field. Remarkably, depending on the value of this extra coupling, we find that the flow of baryon number during the collision can be affected drastically. In particular, we find that at intermediate coupling it is possible for almost no baryon number to end up at mid-rapidity.

A recent study using a high-statistics data set at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV has shown the dependence of $P_{\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}}$ on collision centrality, azimuthal angle ($\varphi$), transverse momentum ($p_T$), pseudorapidity ($\eta$), etcetera [2][3]. Additionally suggested in [1] is an enhanced $P_{\bar{\Lambda}}$ relative to $P_{\Lambda}$ across all beam energies; however, the statistics are too limited to make a significant measurement. No such splitting is observed in the high-statistics $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV data set, but this splitting is expected to increase at lower beam energies. The splitting in polarization would be consistent with the effects of hyperon magnetic-moment coupling with the magnetic field sustained in the QGP; it would have far-reaching consequences important to magnetic-field-dependent observables such as the chiral magnetic effect and would set the scale on the conductivity of the QGP.

Recently, STAR has taken high-statistics data sets at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 27$ and 54.4 GeV. The 27 GeV data set is considered suitable to study the splitting between $P_{\Lambda}$ and $P_{\bar{\Lambda}}$ since it includes the recently installed Event-Plane Detector (EPD), which significantly increases the event-plane resolution. Both data sets are used to study the splitting between $P_{\Lambda}$ and $P_{\bar{\Lambda}}$ as well as the various differential measurements of $P_{\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}}$.

Measurements of heavy-flavour jets give a direct access to the initial parton kinematics and can provide constraints to heavy-quark energy-loss models, in particular adding information on how the radiated energy is dissipated in the medium.
Studies of angular correlations between heavy-flavour particles and charged particles allow us to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and its possible modification in a hot nuclear matter environment.

Measurements in pp collisions provide the necessary reference for the interpretation of heavy-ion collision results, allowing us to characterise the heavy-quark production and fragmentation in vacuum. 
Studies in p--Pb collisions give insight on how the heavy-quark production and hadronisation into jets are affected by the cold nuclear matter effects.

This contribution will focus on the latest studies of heavy-flavour jets and D-meson correlations with charged particles with the ALICE detector.
Measurements of azimuthal D meson-charged particle correlations, jets tagged with D mesons and jet-momentum fraction carried by the D meson will be presented in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$, $7$ and $13$ TeV and compared with expectations from various Monte Carlo event generators. 
Production of heavy-flavour jets in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV will be also addressed with studies of charged jets tagged by heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons and beauty secondary vertices.

to the relative significance of distinct cold and hot nuclear matter effects in the observed attenuation of quarkonia. In the well-defined leading power factorization limit of non-relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) we show conclusively that in spite of certain similarities in the suppression of $J/\psi$s of moderate transverse momenta to the one of light/heavy hadrons, the familiar parton energy loss picture is distinctly incompatible with the hierarchy of the attenuation of ground and excited quarkonium states.  With this in mind, for heavy quarkonia of moderate energy we generalize the relevant successful theory NRQCD to include interactions in nuclear matter. The new resulting theory, NRQCD with Glauber gluons, provides for the first time a universal microscopic description of the interaction of heavy quarkonia with a strongly interacting medium, consistently applicable to a range of phases, such as cold nuclear matter, dense hadron gas, and quark-gluon plasma. The effective field theory we present in this work is derived from first principles and is an important step forward in understanding the common trends in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus data on quarkonium suppression.

We illustrate the formalism by calculating the differential cross section for scattering of a quark (or gluon) on a target proton or nucleus and show that inclusion of both small and large $x$ gluon modes in the target allows one to investigate forward-backward (in rapidity) asymmetries in high energy collisions.

We propose a new approach to study the QGP by using very energetic jets produced in the same collisions which can be utilized as controllable hard probes. Measuring the properties of the QGP such as the temperature or transport coefficients relies on whether it is possible to reliably separate the production of the probe and the formation of the medium. This concept is known as QCD factorization. Starting from an established factorization formalism in proton-proton collisions, we introduce medium modified jet functions to capture the interaction of jets with the QGP. Within a global analysis using a Monte Carlo sampling technique we find that it is indeed possible to describe the data obtained at the LHC. Our results thus support the validity of QCD factorization in the complex heavy-ion environment, and open up a new door to analyze heavy-ion jet data.

For $\pi + \rho \to \pi  + \gamma$  and  $\pi + \pi \to \rho  + \gamma$  processes, these cross sections have been implemented into a novel hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which is suitable for collisions at low and intermediate energies. The implementation is verified by systematically comparing the thermal photon rate to theoretical expectations. The impact of form factors is assessed, and scattering processes mediated by ω mesons are found to contribute significantly to the total photon production. The photon rates we obtain are compared with parametrizations commonly used in hydrodynamic simulations, and also with previous works addressing the production of direct photons from the hadronic stage. Finally, the impact of considering the finite width of the $\rho$ meson is investigated, and a significant enhancement of photon production in the low-energy region is observed. This work is the first step towards a consistent treatment of photon emission in hybrid hydrodynamics+transport approaches, and towards a genuine dynamical description. It will further quantify the importance of the hadronic stage for the resolution of ""the direct photon flow puzzle"" and can be applied to identify equilibrium and non-equilibrium effects in the hadronic afterburner.

Parallel Session - EM probes I,parallel,Probing early time dynamics and QGP transport properties with photons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Gale, Charles",McGill University,Unknown,"We present the first study quantifying the sensitivity of hadron and photon observables to the early-time evolution in heavy-ion collisions which implements a realistic pre-equilibrium stage with effective QCD kinetic theory [1, 2] and a state-of-the-art hybrid (IP-Glasma + MUSIC + UrQMD) framework [3]. We calculate photon emission from the pre-equilibrium phase by folding the system's energy momentum-tensor with thermal photon emission rates including their viscous corrections. By changing switching  time and  coupling parameters inherent to the pre-equilibrium evolution, we study how the non-equilibrium phase influences the hadron and photon flow coefficients in Pb+Pb, Xe+Xe, and O+O collisions at 5 TeV. Because the space-time volume scales differently from the number of binary collisions from O+O to Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions, a systematic system size comparison of photon production can further shed light on the relative contributions from thermal and prompt sources and provide further insight into early time QGP dynamics.

Recent Bayesian extractions of the QGP bulk viscosity using hadronic observables alone [4]  cannot disentangle easily a large narrow peak temperature dependence of bulk viscosity from a broader $\zeta/s(T)$ with a lower maximum value. Utilizing the power of photons as clean and penetrating probes, we demonstrate how thermal photon production and its flow coefficients can improve constraints on QGP bulk viscosity owing to its sensitivity to early stages of the QGP evolution.

The latter process is a notable prediction of QED and was only recently observed by ATLAS using the full 2018 dataset.  In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), characterized by large impact parameter between the nuclei, the outgoing leptons and photons are produced exclusively, and exhibit a strong back-to-back momentum correlation, with long tails induced by higher-order QED effects. This talk presents measurements of dilepton production and light-by-light scattering performed by the ATLAS collaboration.  The angular correlations as well as differential production cross sections in UPCs are measured and compared to theoretical models, including final state QED radiation.  The role of forward neutron production in disentangling pure QED and dissociative processes will also be discussed.  Finally, limits on axion-like particle production, from the observed light-by-light cross sections, will be discussed.  Muon pairs produced the same two-photon scattering process in hadronic Pb+Pb collisions also potentially provide a sensitive probe of the quark gluon plasma.  First measurements by ATLAS and STAR of dileptons produced via two-photon scattering in non-ultra-peripheral (non-UPC) nucleus-nucleus collisions showed an unexpected centrality-dependent broadening of the angular correlation between the two leptons and/or of the two-lepton $p_T$ distribution.

Recently, there has been intense interest in the magnetic fields produced by heavy ion collisions and their possible observational impacts through phenomena like the Chiral Magnetic Effect. The initial strong electromagnetic fields produced in heavy ion collisions have been proposed as a source of linearly-polarized, quasi-real photons [2] that can interact to produce $e^+e^−$ pairs.

In this talk we present STAR measurements of $e^+e^−$ pair production in ultra-peripheral and peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Multi-differential measurements of the pair kinematics are presented to distinguish the $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^−$ process from other possible production mechanisms. These measurements provide an important experimental tool and baseline for the possible measurement of medium effects driven by strong final state magnetic fields or from Coulomb multiple scattering through the QGP.

Furthermore, we present the first observation of a 4th-order azimuthal modulation of $e^+e^−$ pairs produced in heavy ion collisions. The observed 4th-order angular modulation, a result predicted for the collision of linearly-polarized photons [3], has general implications for fermion, anti-fermion pair production in the collision of polarized fields. Specifically, similar angular measurements of heavy quark pairs have been proposed for the study of gluon transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions within nuclei [4,5].

Therefore, baryon density gradients in the above-mentioned high-density collision experiments will generate equalizing currents in all conserved charges. In common fluid dynamic studies of the evolution of the fireball, this coupling of currents was not accounted for. We provide for the first time a fluid dynamical approach including the complete diffusion coefficient matrix describing the evolution of a dense system with multiple conserved charges.

Indeed, such a suppression is clearly present in the latest STAR measurements of $J/\Psi$ production in Au+Au collisions. The suppression is observed to have little dependence on $p_{T}$, although cold nuclear matter effects, such as shadowing, anti-shadowing, nuclear or comover absorption, play a significant role at low $p_{T}$. Measurements of the $J/\Psi$ production in p+A collisions can help us to disentangle the cold nuclear matter effects from the hot medium effects in A+A collisions.

For the strangeness neutral case ($\mu_S=0$) at fixed ratio of electric charge to baryon number density ($\frac{n_Q}{n_B}=0.4$), which is appropriate for a comparison with heavy ion collisions, we present results for $\kappa_X \sigma_X^2$ and  $S_X \sigma_X$ and $S_X \sigma_X^3/M_X, (X=B,Q,S)$ on the crossover line for the chiral transition ($T_{pc}(\mu_B)$). Continuum extrapolations for this pseudo-critical transition line have recently been reported by HotQCD up to baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B\simeq 300$ MeV (arXiv:1812.08235). These cumulant ratios thus are of direct relevance for comparisons with corresponding ratios measured by STAR in the BES-I and II runs at beam energies  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\ge 20$ GeV. In particular, we point out that recent high  statistics results on skewness and kurtosis of net-baryon number distributions obtained by STAR at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4$ GeV put strong constraints on freeze-out parameters and are consistent with predictions from thermal QCD. Additionally, we show that, unlike in the case of net-baryon number  fluctuations, the kurtosis ratios for strangeness and electric charge are  only weakly dependent on $\mu_B$.

Furthermore, we also construct Taylor series for baryon-strangeness and baryon-charge correlations up to $\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^4)$ and present results for these observables on the crossover transition line. We point out that these correlations are dominated by correlations in the baryon sector of QCD, which is consistent with recent findings of the STAR collaboration (arXiv:1903.05370).

In this talk, we focus on the coalescence model calculations for the NCQ scaling of  at intermediate $p_T$ for the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions, which includes thermal-thermal, thermal-jet and jet-jet partons recombinations, using the thermal partons from hydrodynamics and jet partons after the energy loss of the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model. Such coalescence model calculations have also been smoothly connected with the low hydrodynamic calculation and with high jet fragmentation. Within such combined framework, we present a nice description of the spectra and elliptic flow over the $p_T$ range from 0 to 6 GeV, and obtain the approximately NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$ as measured in experiment. We also switch off the coalescence process of partons and find that without such coalescence, one can not describe the differential elliptic flow and related NCQ scaling at intermediate $p_T$.  Such comparison calculations also demonstrate the importance of the partonic degree of freedom and indicate the possible formation of QGP in the high multiplicity p+Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wenbin', 'last_name': 'Zhao', 'fullName': 'Zhao, Wenbin', 'id': '4556856', 'affiliation': 'Peking University', 'emailHash': 'd7c97d9905431bd6fb24238632d469a9', 'db_id': 4556856, 'person_id': 4586066}"

In this talk, we will present correlations of mid-rapidity charged particles to backward-rapidity (Au-going direction) event activity (EA) in 200 GeV p+Au collisions at STAR. They demonstrate an expected positive correlation between high EA at backward-rapidity and the probability of finding a high energy particle at mid-rapidity. Intriguingly, this correlation softens for increasingly energetic triggers. We will also present  semi-inclusive jet spectra at mid-rapidity which, due to self normalization, avoid the difficulties of applying the Glauber model in small systems. The measured high-EA spectrum is distinctly suppressed relative to the low-EA spectrum. We will present comparison of these results to those in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC, respectively. EA-dependent modification of the jet spectrum has been observed at the LHC but only for jets at forward-rapidities and appears to scale with Bjorken-$x$.

For the first time, a non-zero four-particle cumulant is observed for dipolar flow, $v_{1}$. The four-particle cumulants for elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, and triangular flow, $v_{3}$, exhibit a strong centrality dependence and change sign in ultra-central collisions. This sign change is consistent with significant non-Gaussian fluctuations in $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$. The four-particle cumulant for quadrangular flow, $v_{4}$, is found to change sign in mid-central collisions. Correlations between two harmonics are found to decrease in strength towards central collisions and either approach zero or change sign in ultra-central collisions. To investigate the possible flow fluctuations arising from intrinsic centrality or volume fluctuations, the results are compared between two different event classes used for centrality definitions. In peripheral and mid-central collisions where the cumulant signals are large, only small differences are observed. In ultra-central collisions, the differences are much larger and transverse momentum dependent.

Parallel Session - Chirality I,parallel,Search for CME in U+U and Au+Au collisions in STAR with different approaches of handling backgrounds,"Zhao for the STAR Collaboration, Jie",Purdue University,USA,"We present two approaches to handle the dominant elliptic flow ($v_2$) background in the observable, $\Delta\gamma_{112}$  (charge separation across second-order event plane), sensitive to the chiral magnetic effect (CME).

In the first approach, we present the $\Delta\gamma_{112}$ and $\Delta\gamma_{123}$ measurements in U+U and Au+Au collisions. While hydrodynamic simulations including resonance decays and local charge conservation predict that $\Delta\gamma_{112}$ scaled by $N_{\rm part}/v_2$ will be similar in U+U and Au+Au collisions, the projected B-field exhibits a distinct difference between the two systems and with varying $N_{ \rm part}$. Therefore, U+U and Au+Au collisions provide a two-system configuration to contrast signal and background expectations for the CME. The charge separation across third-order event plane $\Delta\gamma_{123}$ scaled by $N_{\rm part}/v_3$ provides necessary system dependence only from backgrounds. Although some features of our data appear to hint CME interpretation driven by B-field, the background expectations capture most of the observed trends at 200 GeV. We repeat our measurements with the recent high statistics Au+Au collisions data at 27 GeV to see if such a trend persists at lower collision energies. The newly installed forward event plane detector helps to suppress non-flow correlations.

In the second approach, we handle the $v_2$ background by measuring $\Delta\gamma_{112}$ with respect to the planes of spectators $\Psi_{ \rm ZDC}$ and elliptic anisotropy $\Psi_2$. These measurements contain different amounts of contributions from CME signal (along B-field, due to spectators) and $v_2$ background (determined by the participant geometry). With the two $\Delta\gamma_{112}$  measurements, the possible CME signal and the background contribution can be determined. Applying this method, we have previously reported the measurements of possible CME signal fraction in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, revealing dominant background contribution. Here, we report our findings in U+U collisions where the spectator-participant plane correlations are expected to differ from those in Au+Au collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jie', 'last_name': 'Zhao for the STAR Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Zhao for the STAR Collaboration, Jie', 'id': '4601103', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'f784c07207f0f8e4a336b0d15d6882f4', 'db_id': 4601103, 'person_id': 4585277}"

similar values, which are close to the lifetime of free $\Lambda$ decays. On the 
experimental side, all results from other heavy-ion experiments show a significantly 
shorter lifetime in comparison with that of the free $\Lambda$ decay.

The mixed-event technique along with the semi-inclusive approach is further developed for the fragmentation measurement, and applied accordingly to isolate contributions from hard-scattered partons.  We attempt to correct for uncorrelated background effects and instrumental effects in the fragmentation functions, and will present preliminary results for central and peripheral collisions. Similarly, the differential jet shapes are constructed by summing the charged particle yields in radial distance from the jet core weighted by $\it{p}_{T}$ of the corresponding charged particles.  The presented results will extend the kinematic range offered at the LHC to lower $\it{p}_{T}$ and demonstrate whether there is a modification and a broadening of the jet profile at RHIC energies.

The masses of possible charmonium states from calculations using constituent quark models are too large, and therefore an explanation of the underlying characteristics of this meson remains a challenge. The similarity of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ mass and the $D-\bar{D}^{*}$ mass threshold inspired the interpretation that $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is a $D-\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” with small binding energy. Another explanation is that this meson is a tetra-quark, consisting of a di-quark and di-antiquark. Relativistic heavy ion collisions produce an extremely hot and strongly interacting medium, which provides a new environment in which to study the nature of multi-quark states. Because of the dramatically different radii of a $D-\bar{D}^{*}$ “molecule” and a tetra-quark, the interactions of these two proposed states are expected to interact differently with the medium. Therefore, the yield of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ in heavy ion collisions can provide insight into its structure.

Parallel Session - New theoretical developments I,parallel,New challenges for the open heavy flavor physics in ultrarelativistic collisions,"Sun, Yifeng",Texas A&M University,USA,"The study of the QCD interaction at high temperature in the heavy quark (HQ) sector has attracted a wide interest in the last decade. The theoretical efforts to build realistic phenomenological models able to predict the main observables for D mesons, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$, has lead to a first estimate of the Ds space diffusion of charm quarks. This has been a successful program that  has allowed to have a general consensus that the charm quark interaction is non-perturbative, the estimated Ds is in agreement with current lattice QCD calculations and its thermalization time is of the order of QGP lifetime [1].
Given the success of this first stage of the study, very recently new important perspectives are emerging. These can lead from one hand to improving the determination of Ds and on the other hand open the way for employing HQ as a novel probe of the initial stage of the ultra-relativistic collisions. 
More directly related to the determination of the HQ diffusion and hadronization are:
- The surprisingly large $\Lambda_c$ production at both RHIC and LHC energies. We will show that this affects the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ also of the D meson and hence the determination of the HQ interaction [2]. We show also that an hadronization by coalescence plus fragmentation can largely account for this new finding and discuss new prediction for $\Lambda_b$/B ratio. 
- The correlation between the $v_n$ anisotropies of the bulk matter and the one of HQs ($v_n(light), v_n(heavy)$) and, in particular, the normalized variance of $\sigma_n/ < v_n >$ constitute a novel and more powerful tool to constraint the Ds transport coefficient [3]. 

HQs have been poorly explored as a probe of the initial vorticity and electromagnetic field. We will show that a large directed flow v1 can be generated by the longitudinal initial tilt along with a splitting between D0 and anti-D0 [3]. The last can be seen also as a probe of the deconfined phase. Predictions in agreement with preliminary STAR data will be presented together with first results compared to ALICE data. A correlation study of the D0 splitting in $v_1$ with the one of muons from Z0 decay can provide a new insight into the determination of the initial magnetic field and its lifetime.
Furthermore, we will show a novel approach that studies the potential impact of a glasma phase on the HQ dynamics and how this can provide a link between pA and AA collisions [4].

The principal components of anisotropic flow reproduce the trends seen in data, but multiplicity fluctuations show an interesting difference in transverse momentum dependence. We checked this is also the case for other hydro models. To investigate this, we construct an analytical toy model and verify that hydrodynamic simulations agree with its predictions. We find that the discrepancy in the momentum trend is likely  due to the fact that hydrodynamic models typically have transverse momentum  fluctuations that are larger than seen experimentally. 

We conclude that the n=0 principal components open a new window on initial fluctuations, which can be used to rule out initial condition models.

Parallel Session - Heavy flavor IV,parallel,LHCb measurements of the exotic tetraquark candidate X(3872) in high multiplicity pp and pPb collisions,"Durham for the LHCb Collaboration, John Matthew",Los Alamos National Laboratory,USA,"The last decade of hadron spectroscopy has unveiled a wealth of states that do not have the properties expected of particles composed of 2 or 3 valence quarks.  Among the most intriguing of these exotics is the X(3872), which various models attempt to describe as a hadronic molecule, a compact tetraquark, an unexpected charmonium state, or their mixtures.  To date, most experimental studies of the X(3872) have focused on its production through B meson decays.  Heavy ion collisions, as well as high multiplicity pp collisions, offer a new window on the properties of this poorly understood hadron.  In these systems, promptly produced X(3872) hadrons can interact with other particles in the nucleus and/or those produced in the collision. The influence of these interactions on the observed X(3872) yields provides information that can help discriminate between the various models of its structure, as well as give insight into the dynamics of the bulk particles produced in these collisions.


With a full range of precision vertexing, tracking, and particle ID capabilities covering 2 to 5 in units of rapidity, the LHCb experiment is especially well suited to measurements of both prompt and non-prompt exotic hadrons.

Parallel Session - EM probes II,parallel,Electromagnetic radiation from the pre-equilibrium/pre-hydro stage of the quark-gluon plasma,"Churchill, Jessica",McGill University,Unknown,"A remarkable achievement of the relativistic heavy-ion program is the realization that relativistic fluid dynamics can describe the evolving system of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) from its early moments to a time when the growing mean-free-paths drive the system out of equilibrium. The effectiveness of this hydrodynamic description is judged by comparing calculated hadronic observables with experimental measurements. Alternatively, electromagnetic radiation could be considered a more distinguishing signal as it is emitted throughout the evolution of the hadronic system. Considerable work has gone into the calculation of photons [1] and dileptons [2] using modern hydrodynamic approaches, however, the calculation of the electromagnetic emissivity of the pre-hydro stage is currently less advanced. 

In this talk, we use a transport approach that models the time-evolution of gluons and fermions by solving coupled Boltzmann transport equations in the diffusion approximation [3]. The transport equations are solved numerically to study how the system relaxes towards equilibrium. The initial state is a gluon distribution of a form inspired by the colour glass picture, where quarks and anti-quarks are then generated through interactions.  The early stage evolution is modeled by a 1D expansion, during which non-equilibrium parton interactions can also produce real and virtual photons. We show how reliably these Glasma photons can report on the initial momentum anisotropy of the early parton distributions and on the presence or absence of a transient Bose-Einstein condensate of gluons. Additionally, we show that the non-equilibrium contribution can leave an imprint on the low $p_T$ spectrum of the measured photons and estimate the effect of the anisotropy on the spectrum measured at RHIC and at the LHC (i.e. the photon $v_2$ puzzle). This opens the exciting possibility that measurements of the electromagnetic signal can access fine details of the partonic distributions as they appear during the very first instants of heavy-ion collisions.

Parallel Session - QM & nuclear astrophysics,parallel,Signatures of quark-hadron phase transitions in general-relativistic neutron-star mergers,"Dexheimer, Verônica",Kent State University,Unknown,"Merging binaries of neutron stars are not only strong sources of gravitational waves, but also have the potential of revealing states of matter at densities and temperatures not accessible in laboratories. A crucial and longstanding question in this context is whether quarks are deconfined as a result of the dramatic increase in density and temperature following the merger. We present the first fully general-relativistic simulations of merging neutron stars including quarks at finite temperatures that can be switched off consistently in the equation of state. Within our approach, we can determine clearly what signatures a quark-hadron phase transition would leave in the gravitational-wave signal. We show that if after the merger the conditions are met for a phase transition to take place at several times nuclear saturation density, they would lead to a post-merger signal considerably different from the one expected from the inspiral, that can only probe the hadronic part of the equations of state, and to an anticipated collapse of the merged object. We also show that the phase transition leads to a very hot and dense quark core that, when it collapses to a black hole, produces a ringdown signal different from the hadronic one. Finally, in analogy with what is done in heavy-ion collisions, we use the evolution of the temperature and density in the merger remnant to illustrate the properties of the phase transition in a QCD phase diagram.

Parallel Session - Initial state  I,parallel,Impact of dijet and D-meson data from 5.02 TeV p+Pb collisions on nuclear PDFs,"Paakkinen, Petja",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Based on Refs. [1] and [2], we discuss the new constraints on gluon parton distribution function (PDF) in lead nucleus, derivable with the Hessian PDF reweighting method from the 5.02 TeV p+Pb measurements of CMS dijet [3] and LHCb $D^0$-meson [4] nuclear modification ratios. The impact is found to be significant, placing stringent constraints in the mid- and previously unconstrained small-$x$ regions. The CMS dijet data confirm the existence of gluon anti-shadowing and onsetting of small-$x$ shadowing, as well as reduce the gluon PDF uncertainties in the larger-$x$ region. The gluon constraints from the LHCb $D^0$ data, reaching down to $x \sim 10^{-5}$ and derived for the first time in a fully NLO perturbative QCD based approach, provide a remarkable reduction in the small-$x$ uncertainties with a strong direct evidence of gluon shadowing. Furthermore, we find a good description of the data even down to zero transverse momentum of the produced $D^0$-meson within a purely DGLAP-based approach without the need of imposing any non-linear effects. Importantly, the constraints obtained from the dijet and $D^0$ data are mutually fully consistent, supporting the universality of nuclear PDFs in hard-scattering processes.

Parallel Session - Collective dynamics II,parallel,Effects of dissipative baryon current in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC-BES energies,"Wu, Xiang-Yu",Central China Normal University.,Unknown,"One of the most important objectives of Beam energy scan (BES) program at the Relativistic Heavy ion collider (RHIC) is to search for the critical point in the QCD matter via performing nucleus-nucleus collisions with wide collision energies (7.7 - 200 GeV). At such energies, the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter has sizable net baryon density at the central rapidity region due to baryon stopping power. Therefore, the dissipation of net-baryon current plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense QCD matter produced in RHIC-BES heavy-ion collisions.

The (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic has been very successful in describing the collective behavior of the QGP fireball at zero chemical potential. In order to study the properties of QGP and the dissipative phenomena of net baryon current at a non-zero baryon environment of the BES energies, we extend the CLVisc [1, 2] hydrodynamic model to include the  equation of net baryon charge conservation and Israel-Stewart-like equations about dissipative baryon current with NEOSB [3] equation of state. Assuming instantaneous smooth energy density and net baryon density distribution at the initial proper time, we study the impact of the net-baryon dissipation on particle yields, pT spectra and anisotropic flows in the final state of BES heavy-ion collisions.

Recently, the Signed Balance Function (SBF), based on the idea of examining the momentum ordering of charged pairs along the in- and out-of-plane directions, has been proposed as a probe of  Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [1].  In this approach a pair of observables are invoked, they are, the out-of-plane to in-plane ratio of fluctuation of the difference between signed balance functions measured in pairs rest frame ($r_{rest}$), and the ratio ($R_{B} = r_{rest}/r_{lab}$) of it to a similar measurement made in the laboratory frame ($r_{lab}$). These two observables give opposite responses to the CME-driven charge separation and background correlations arising from resonance flow and global spin alignment.

Parallel Session - New theoretical developments I,parallel,From Chiral Kinetic Theory to Spin Hydrodynamics,"SHI, Shuzhe",McGill University,Unknown,"As a conserved quantity in the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions, the total angular momentum consists of two sectors: the orbital angular momentum (OAM) caused by kinetic motion, and the intrinsic spin angular momentum of quarks and gluons. In a heavy-ion collision event, the system starts with finite OAM but un-polarized spin density (unless prepared specifically). Microscopic scattering processes allow a coupling between these two components. Therefore, spin polarization can eventually develop that may have a non-trivial influence on the QGP evolution. In the current hydrodynamic frameworks, the stress tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ is assumed to be symmetric, hence OAM and spin are conserved independently, and the spin effect is mostly neglected. A hydrodynamic theory, with the aforementioned spin polarization effect properly taken into account, is required, especially for quantitative studies of the polarization rate of observed hadrons, e.g. $\Lambda$-hyperon. The latter has been observed in RHIC experiment, serving as an evidence of the most vortical fluid in the universe.

In this work, we start with **chiral kinetic theory** and construct the **spin hydrodynamic framework** for a chiral spinor system. We obtain the equations of motion of **second-order dissipative relativistic fluid dynamics with non-trivial spin polarization density**. In a chiral spinor system, the spin alignment effect could be treated in the same framework as for Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE). However, the fluid vorticity induces not only the CVE current but also asymmetric stress tensor as well as spin polarization of final state hadrons, all of which emerge as quantum corrections.

Hard experimental probes like jets and heavy quarks, as well as photons [1], give direct access to these non-equilibrium properties. However, theoretical challenges have hindered calculating their dynamics in a non-equilibrium QGP. Some of these challenges stem from gauge field instabilities that arise in non-equilibrium, weakly-coupled plasma, and lead to exponentially growing gauge fields [2]. 

In this talk we show how to handle the gauge field instabilities consistently. We first derive the time evolution of gluon correlators analytically. Building on the formalism elaborated in [1] then allows for a microscopic calculation of jet-medium interaction in a non-thermal QGP. Specifically, we evaluate how jets radiate gluons when they traverse a non-equilibrium medium and show that the medium effects can be factorized into transverse kicks on the jet [3] and a new Schwinger-like effect in the exponentially growing gauge fields. We solve the resulting equations numerically and comment on phenomenological implications for jets and photons. Our calculations not only apply to jets, but also to the kinetic theory of quarks and gluons. We compare our results to commonly used simplifications of the collision kernel in numerical kinetic theory calculations. Finally, we discuss how to explore the effect of non-equilibrium physics on other probes of the QGP, such as the heavy-quark potential.

Parallel Session - Collective dynamics  III,parallel,Light neutral meson production in heavy ion collisions with ALICE in the era of precision physics at the LHC,"Sas for the ALICE Collaboration, Mike Henry Petrus",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Unknown,"The production of light neutral mesons in AA collisions probes the physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is formed in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. More specifically, the centrality dependent neutral meson production in AA collisions compared to its production in minimum-bias pp collisions, known as nuclear modification factor, provides information on the energy loss of partons traversing the QGP. The measurement allows to test with high precision the predictions of theoretical model calculations. In addition, the decay of the $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons are the dominant backgrounds for all direct photon measurements. Therefore, pushing the limits of the precision of neutral meson production is key to learning about the temperature and space-time evolution of the QGP.

In the ALICE experiment neutral mesons can be detected via their decay to two photons. The latter can be reconstructed using the two calorimeters EMCal and PHOS or via conversions in the detector material. Combining the excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low $p_{T}$ and the high reconstruction efficiency and triggering capability of calorimeters at high $p_{T}$, we are able to measure the light neutral mesons over a wide kinematic range.

Combining state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques with the high statistics delivered by the LHC in Run 2 gives us the opportunity to enhance the precision of our measurements. In this talk, new run 2 results for neutral meson production in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at LHC energies, as measured with the ALICE experiment, will be presented and contrasted with theoretical predictions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mike Henry Petrus', 'last_name': 'Sas for the ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Sas for the ALICE Collaboration, Mike Henry Petrus', 'id': '4596135', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': '981f787a435e5c09106b8225c495d3ca', 'db_id': 4596135, 'person_id': 4692809}"

However, it is widely understood that all flow measurements are affected by non-flow correlations.

We have also measured 4-particle cumulants in p+Au and d+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with subevents, which kinematically suppress non-flow via removal of short-range correlations. As found in heavy ion collisions, the quark mass dependence of the flow will further provide an evidence of collective effects. PHENIX has measured $v_2$ vs $p_T$ of muons at forward rapidity originating from heavy quark decays in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

Parallel Session - Heavy flavor III,parallel,Multi-stage evolution of heavy quarks in the Quark Gluon Plasma,"Vujanovic for the JETSCAPE Collaboration , Gojko",Wayne State University,Unknown,"High energy jets, evolving from a single parton, produced with transverse momentum up to a TeV, have a variety of scale dependent interactions with the QGP. The mass of heavy-quarks introduce another scale within this evolution. Modeling both the heavy quark shower and the fluid dynamical medium event by event, we demonstrate that in the high virtuality portion of a jet, where the dead-cone effect can be ignored, light and heavy-flavor evolution are indeed similar. However, in the later lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momenta of the parton, heavy quarks radiate differently. Recently, it has been suggested that longitudinal drag and diffusion can stimulate radiation from heavy-quarks. The effect of this new channel is shown to partially compensate for the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. All these factors result in a different nuclear modification factor for heavy flavors (and heavy-flavor tagged jets).

We present an extensive, comparative study that explores the importance of differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms with a realistically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in a multi-stage calculation within the JETSCAPE Framework [2]. The highly virtual and very energetic portion of the shower inside the QGP is modeled using the MATTER generator, while the LBT generator models the energetic and close-to-on-shell heavy quark’s showering inside with the QGP. The shower transitions from one stage to the other at a parton-by-parton level depending on the energy and virtuality of the parton, and the local density. The boundary between these stages can be extracted from a comparison with data. This allows us to explore the effect and interplay between the different regimes of energy loss on the propagation and radiation from hard heavy quarks in a dense medium. Energy momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, is carried out using a weak coupling recoil approach.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gojko', 'last_name': 'Vujanovic for the JETSCAPE Collaboration ', 'fullName': 'Vujanovic for the JETSCAPE Collaboration , Gojko', 'id': '4601050', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': '1ad2354574212f4eb22ec01904a4fed1', 'db_id': 4601050, 'person_id': 4584967}"

Parallel Session - Heavy flavor II,parallel,Flavor hierarchy of jet quenching in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Xing, Wen-Jing",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Relativistic heavy-ion experiments have observed similar quenching effects for (prompt) $D$ mesons compared to charged hadrons for transverse momenta larger than 6-8 GeV, which remains a mystery since heavy quarks typically lose less energies in quark-gluon plasma than light quarks and gluons. Recent measurements of the nuclear modification factors of $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons by the CMS Collaboration provide a unique opportunity to study the flavor hierarchy of jet quenching. Using a linear Boltzmann transport model combined with hydrodynamics simulation, we study the energy loss and nuclear modification for heavy and light flavor jets in high-energy nuclear collisions. By consistently taking into account both quark and gluon contributions to light and heavy flavor hadron productions within a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD framework, we obtain, for the first time, a satisfactory description of the experimental data on the nuclear modification factors for charged hadrons, $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons and $B$-decayed $D$ mesons simultaneously over a wide range of transverse momenta (8-300 GeV). This presents a solid solution to the flavor puzzle of jet quenching and constitutes a significant step towards the precision study of jet-medium interaction. Our study predicts that at transverse momenta larger than 30-40 GeV, $B$ mesons also exhibit similar suppression effects to charged hadrons and $D$ mesons, which may be tested by future measurements.

Parallel Session - Heavy flavor III,parallel,Quarkonium Production in Heavy Ion Collisions: from Open Quantum System to Transport Equation,"Yao, Xiaojun",Duke University,USA,"The production of heavy quarkonium in heavy ion collisions has been used as an important probe of the quark-gluon plasma. The initial insight was that due to the plasma screening effect, the color attraction between the heavy quark-antiquark pair is significantly suppressed at high temperature and thus no bound states can exist, i.e., they “melt”. In addition to the screening of the color attraction, quarkonium dissociates when enough energy is transferred to it in a dynamical process. The inverse process of dissociation, recombination, can also happen inside the medium when the plasma temperature allows quarkonium formation and is as crucial as dissociation. To explain experimental results on quarkonium production, we have to account for static screening, dissociation and recombination in a consistent way. One traditional approach is to use a transport equation through which the phase space distribution of quarkonium is evolved. In recent years, another approach based on the open quantum system formalism started being used. It is learnt that dissociation can be understood as a decoherence of the wavefunction of the heavy quark-antiquark pair. Recombination is automatically included in this framework.

In this talk, I will present a connection between the open quantum system formalism and the transport equation. I will discuss new insights about the quarkonium dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of quantum information. I will show that under the weak coupling and Markovian approximations, the evolution equation of the open system, the Lindblad equation, turns to a Boltzmann transport equation after a Wigner transform is applied to the system density matrix. I will demonstrate how the separation of physical scales justifies the approximations, by using effective field theory of QCD. Finally, by coupling the transport equations of quarkonia and open heavy flavors, I will study how the system of open and hidden heavy flavors reaches thermal equilibrium inside a quark-gluon plasma box. Phenomenological results on the nuclear modification factor and the azimuthal angular anisotropy of quarkonium, based on the coupled transport equations will also be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaojun', 'last_name': 'Yao', 'fullName': 'Yao, Xiaojun', 'id': '4557339', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '48b8c36abd8c27edd366e973357f1347', 'db_id': 4557339, 'person_id': 4557625}"
Parallel Session - Heavy flavor III,parallel,Quantifying heavy quark transport coefficients within an improved transport model LIDO,"Ke, Weiyao",Duke University,USA,"The heavy-flavor transport coefficients contain important information on the strong interaction at finite temperatures. Extraction of these numbers from experimental data requires dynamical modeling of heavy-flavor transport that is coupled to a realistic medium evolution. Furthermore, meaningful extractions necessitate both a faithful implementation of the physical inputs to be tested and the quantification of model uncertainty. For these purposes, we have developed a partonic transport model LIDO. It has improved treatment of in-medium parton bremsstrahlung, which has been calibrated to analytical theoretical baselines in a simple medium to reduce modeling uncertainty. Regarding the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium, few-body perturbative scatterings are applied to large-momentum transfer (Q) processes, while a diffusion equation models the dynamics of small-Q processes. Such a separation restricts the explicit use of medium quasi-particles to large-Q processes only. Another advantage is that deviations from the leading-order probe-medium coupling can be parameterized as an additional contribution to the diffusion coefficient.

The heavy quark transport coefficients are then extracted with uncertainty quantification from a Bayesian analysis including both RHIC and LHC data. The results are found to be consistent with earlier extractions of the light-quark transport coefficients at high momentum and are comparable to lattice calculations of the heavy-flavor diffusion coefficient in the static limit at low momentum.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Weiyao', 'last_name': 'Ke', 'fullName': 'Ke, Weiyao', 'id': '4557354', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '1240602cf275b01cbc3a4cc9b6afb783', 'db_id': 4557354, 'person_id': 4557624}"
Parallel Session - Jet Modification III,parallel,Modification of jet substructure in heavy ion collisions as a probe of the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma,"Pablos, Daniel",McGill,Unknown,"In this work we present an analysis of the role that the quark-gluon plasma resolution length, the minimal distance by which two nearby colored charges in a jet must be separated such that they engage with the plasma independently, plays in the understanding of modifications of jet substructure modification due to interaction with QGP. The shorter the resolution length of QGP is the better the resolving power of this medium. We identify a set of observables that are very sensitive to whether jets are quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the medium has the ability to resolve the internal structure of the jet instead. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose because it is very sensitive to effects of the particles coming from medium response, groomed observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings, the momentum sharing fraction, or the groomed mass are particularly well suited to discriminate the degree to which the medium resolves substructure within the jet. In order to find the optimal grooming configuration, we explore different cuts on the Lund plane that allow for a clear identification of the regions of phase space that enhance the difference in jet substructure between vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present data seems to disfavor an “infinite resolution length”, which is to say it disfavors the hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it were a single energetic colored object.  Our analysis indicates that as the precision of experimental measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over uncertainties in their calculation improves, it will become possible to use comparisons like this to constrain the value of the resolution length of quark-gluon plasma as well as to see how the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Pablos', 'fullName': 'Pablos, Daniel', 'id': '4557131', 'affiliation': 'McGill', 'emailHash': '7dd4ea1921dfff9f9a0373d20692786b', 'db_id': 4557131, 'person_id': 4588622}"

Understanding this phenomenon of jet quenching is a requirement for extracting the microscopic properties of the QGP via jet-tomography.

With JGE, we are able to control the extent of energy loss ranging from quenched/imbalanced to recovered/balanced recoil jets. Since jet quenching is also expected to be dependent on the resolution/transverse-length scales with which the jet probes the medium, it is necessary to perform differential measurements with a handle on both momentum and angular scales. With the large 2014 Au+Au data sample at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV we are able to quantitatively constrain parton energy loss via JGE and measure it differentially as a function of both the jet $p_{T}$ and opening angle between the two leading sub-jets ($\theta_{sj}$). We probe the medium response to jets at varying resolution scales by measuring the recoil jet yield and the di-jet asymmetry and search for significant differences between wide and narrow $\theta_{sj}$ jets.

the overall azimuthal correlation, and possible Moliere scatterings off quasi-particles in the medium broadening the tail of the correlation with respect to pp collisions. A search 
for these phenemona in Run-1 data using hadron-jet acoplanarity showed no evidence of 
large-angle jet broadening with respect to vacuum expectation within experimental 
uncertainties. However, recent theoretical work has highlighted that low hadron trigger $p_\mathrm{T}$ and low recoiling jet $p_\mathrm{T}$ configurations show more sensitivity to in-medium modifications to the acoplanarity. We present a new measurement of hadron-jet acoplanarity using high-statistics Run-2 data, with emphasis on the region of low recoil jet $p_\mathrm{T}$.

To study the jet profile, jet-hadron correlations will also be discussed. Jet-hadron correlations are measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using ALICE data. The radial distribution of charged-hadrons is studied with respect to the jet axis. The associated charged hadron yields and peak widths are extracted from two-dimensional angular correlations as a function of associated hadron transverse momentum and event plane orientation and compared in different centrality intervals. The measurements are also compared to model predictions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yaxian', 'last_name': 'Mao for the ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Mao for the ALICE Collaboration, Yaxian', 'id': '4596148', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN)', 'emailHash': '05fd654b513b2c94f716a51789da7afa', 'db_id': 4596148, 'person_id': 4692818}"
Parallel Session - Heavy flavor II,parallel,Quarkonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions with ALICE,"Bai for ALICE Collaboration, Xiaozhi ",GSI,Germany,"Heavy quarks are produced at the first instant of a nucleus-nucleus collision and therefore 
are an important tool to study the subsequent high energy-density medium formed in 
relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Over the last few decades major efforts have been 
undertaken in order to understand the properties of the  Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using 
quarkonia. The extent of medium modification for heavy-quark production in heavy-ion 
collisions is measured in terms of a nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as 
the quarkonium yield in heavy-ion collisions with respect to the pp cross sections scaled 
by the nuclear overlap function. A possible path-length dependent quarkonium dissociation 
probability as well as a contribution of (re)combined quarkonia from flowing heavy quarks 
would lead to an azimuthal anisotropy of quarkonium production relative to the reaction plane.

Recent ALICE J/$\psi$ $R_{\rm AA}$ results for Pb-Pb collisions at 
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented for mid and forward rapidity. 
The individual contribution of prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production will be 
discussed for the $R_{\rm AA}$ measurement at mid-rapidity. At forward rapidity, 
the centrality, $p_{\rm T}$ and rapidity dependence of J/$\psi$ and $\psi({\rm 2S})$  
$R_{\rm AA}$ will be discussed. The $\Upsilon$ $R_{\rm AA}$ will also be shown. 
The ${\rm J}/\psi$ elliptic and triangular flow, as well as event-shape-engineering 
studies and the first measurement of the $\Upsilon$ elliptic flow will be reported.
The ALICE results will be compared with those by other LHC experiments and the current 
theoretical interpretation of the results will be also discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaozhi ', 'last_name': 'Bai for ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Bai for ALICE Collaboration, Xiaozhi ', 'id': '4596132', 'affiliation': 'GSI', 'emailHash': 'ec48eaac52badbcb87cef21b4a7100b0', 'db_id': 4596132, 'person_id': 4585717}"
Parallel Session - Collective dynamics  III,parallel,Latest results on the production of hadronic resonances in ALICE at the LHC,"Khuntia for the ALICE Collaboration, Arvind",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),Unknown,"Short-lived hadronic resonances are used to study different aspects of particle production 
and collision dynamics in pp, p—A and relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The yields of 
resonances are sensitive to the competing processes of hadron rescattering and regeneration, 
thus making these particles unique probes of the properties of the late hadronic phase. 
Measurements of resonances with different masses and quantum numbers also provide insight 
into strangeness production and processes that determine the shapes of particle momentum 
spectra at intermediate transverse momenta, as well as the species dependence of hadron 
suppression at high momentum.

Thanks to a campaign of precise measurements, the ALICE experiment now has a comprehensive 
set of results with unprecedented precision for $\rho(770)^{0}$, K$^{*}(892)$, $f_{0}(980)$, 
$\phi(1020)$, $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$, $\Lambda(1520)$, and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ production in pp, 
p—Pb, Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions in the energy range $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76-13 TeV, 
including the latest measurements from LHC Run 2. The obtained results are used to study 
the system-size and collision-energy evolution of transverse momentum spectra, particle

Parallel Session - Future facilities,parallel,Upgrading the Inner Tracking System and the Time Projection Chamber of ALICE,"Reidt for the ALICE Collaboration, Felix",CERN,Switzerland,"The ALICE experiment at CERN is undergoing a major upgrade during the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2) of the LHC during 2019-2020. The key elements regarding the central barrel are the installation of a new Inner Tracking System (ITS) and the upgrade of the large Time Projection Chamber (TPC).

The TPC, the main tracking and PID device of ALICE, is currently being upgraded with a new readout system, including new GEM-based Readout Chambers and new front-end electronics. This will enable to operate the TPC in continuous mode, recording the full minimum-bias interaction rate of 50 kHz in Pb-Pb, as anticipated at the LHC in Run 3 and beyond.

The new ITS based on CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors, will significantly improve the impact parameter resolution and the tracking efficiency, especially for particles with low transverse momenta, as well as the readout rate capability. The ITS will cover a total surface area of 10 m$^{2}$ containing 12.5 billion pixels of about $29 \times 27$ $\mu$m$^{2}$ achieving a material budget of $0.35$ $\%$ $X_{0}$ for the three innermost layers.

This talk will summarize the motivation and concept of these upgrades as well as report on the status of the assembly and commissioning at the surface.

 Furthermore, an outlook 
will be given on plans for the installation and the upgrade of the ITS foreseen for the third long shutdown of the LHC in 2024-2026. For the following upgrade, the three innermost 
layers will be replaced by cylindrical detector layers, made of curved wafer-scale-sized CMOS sensors, to even further lower the material budget and to improve the pointing 
resolution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Felix', 'last_name': 'Reidt for the ALICE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Reidt for the ALICE Collaboration, Felix', 'id': '4596155', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '6ba9834c9f101a2c311a9a029d446348', 'db_id': 4596155, 'person_id': 4692823}"
Parallel Session - Collective dynamics II,parallel,"Directed and elliptic ﬂow of high-pT charged hadrons, identiﬁed hadrons and light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at STAR","Nayak for the STAR Collaboration, Kishora","Central China Normal University, China",Unknown,"The thermalized QCD matter formed in heavy-ion collisions is tilted in the reaction plane as a function of rapidity, while the production proﬁle of partons from hard scatterings is symmetric in rapidity [1]. This leads to a rapidity-odd directed ﬂow (v1) for high-pT hadrons and can provide valuable constraints on the initial longitudinal distribution of the ﬁreball as well as the path length-dependent energy loss of partons. Hydrodynamic models suggest that the double sign change of v1 slope (dv1/dy) at midrapidity for net baryon as a function of beam energy is a signature of the ﬁrst-order phase transition [2]. The light nuclei and strange hadrons might be more sensitive to the early EoS because of their heavy masses and smaller hadronic interaction cross section, respectively. Due to the diﬀerent sensitivity of strange particles to hadronic phases, the mass ordering of elliptic ﬂow (v2) is expected to be violated between proton and φ meson in the low-pT range (pT <1.5 GeV/c) [3].

In this talk, we will present the new precise v1 measurement of π, K, p and φ in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 27, 54.4 GeV and deuteron at sNN = 7.7 to 39 GeV. The ﬁrst measurement of pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the v1 of high-pT (>5 GeV/c) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 54.4 and 200 GeV will be presented. The v2 of identiﬁed hadrons (π, K, p, φ, KS0 , Λ, Ξ, Ω) in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 54.4 GeV will also be presented. These results will be compared to model calculations and the physics implications will be discussed.

Parallel Session - Initial state II,parallel,Adiabatic hydrodynamization in rapidly-expanding quark-gluon plasma,"Brewer, Jasmine",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"We propose a new scenario characterizing the transition of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions from a highly non-equilibrium state at early times toward a fluid described by hydrodynamics at late times. In this scenario, the bulk evolution is governed by a set of slow modes, after an emergent time scale τ_{Redu} when the number of modes that govern the bulk evolution of the system is reduced. These slow modes are ""pre-hydrodynamic"" in the sense that they are initially distinct from, but evolve continuously into, hydrodynamic modes in hydrodynamic limit. This picture is analogous to the evolution of a quantum mechanical system that is governed by the instantaneous ground states under adiabatic evolution, and will be referred to as ""adiabatic hydrodynamization"". We shall illustrate adiabatic hydrodynamization using a kinetic description of weakly-coupled Bjorken expanding plasma. We first show the emergence of τRedu due to the longitudinal expansion. We explicitly identify the pre-hydrodynamic modes for a class of collision integrals and find that they represent the angular distribution (in momentum space) of those gluons that carry most of the energy. We use the relaxation time approximation for the collision integral to show quantitatively that the full kinetic theory evolution is indeed dominated by pre-hydrodynamic modes. We elaborate on the criterion for the dominance of pre-hydrodynamic modes and argue that the rapidly-expanding QGP could meet this criterion. Based on this discussion, we speculate that adiabatic hydrodynamization may describe the pre-equilibrium behavior of the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jasmine', 'last_name': 'Brewer', 'fullName': 'Brewer, Jasmine', 'id': '4569909', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': 'b413e511afa6bcfa0c3dbc36d9267f5e', 'db_id': 4569909, 'person_id': 4586064}"

Single electrons from semi-leptonic decays are an excellent channel to study open heavy ﬂavor due to their large branching fractions and triggering possibilities. Additionally, semi-leptonic c-hadron decays can provide a complimentary measurement of charm hadron directed ﬂow (v1).
In this talk we will present the analyses of single electrons from semi-leptonic b- and c- hadron decays at mid-rapidity in sNN = 200, 54.4, and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions. The data at sNN = 200 GeV incorporate the Heavy Flavor Tracker which enables the topological separation of electrons originating from b- and c-hadron decays. We will report the ﬁrst STAR measurements at sNN = 200 GeV of v2 for bottom-decayed electrons as a function of pT and v1 for charm-decayed electrons as a function of electron rapidity. Additionally, improved measurements of RAA and a new measurement of the double ratio of RCP between bottom- and charm-decayed electrons will be presented as a function of pT and centrality. We will also present the measurement of non-photonic electron v2 in sNN = 54.4 and 27 GeV data, collected during the 2017 and 2018 RHIC runs.

Thus, the production of light nuclei can be used to study the QCD phase transition, at which the baryon density fluctuation will be enhanced. For example, the ratio of proton ($N(p)$) and triton ($N(t)$) to deuteron ($N(d)$) yields, which is defined as $N(t)$$\cdot$$N(p)$/$N^2(d)$, could be used as a sensitive observable to search for the signature of the 1st order phase transition and/or QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions [1][2].

In this talk, we will present the energy and centrality dependence of (anti-)deuteron and triton production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$  =  7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 54.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV measured by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

Parallel Session - Heavy flavor III,parallel,Recent results on azimuthal anysotropies of open heavy-flavour particles with ALICE at the LHC,"Tang for the ALICE Collaboration , Siyu",Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN),Unknown,"Heavy quarks are unique tools to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to the large masses, heavy quarks 
are produced in hard scattering processes on timescales shorter than the QGP formation time, thus they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents.

The hot QCD matter is produced within an unprecedented strong magnetic field, which properties and effects can be probed by charm quarks via investigating the charm-particle 
directed flow $v_{1}$, because the charm quark formation time scale is comparable to the time scale when the magnetic field attains its maximum value. The charm interaction with the medium constituents and its degree of thermalisation can be investigated via the measurement of the second coefficient of the D-meson azimuthal anisotropy, the elliptic flow $v_{2}$, that allows one to study whether low-momentum charm quarks participate in the collective expansion of the system. 
Furthermore, the role of the recombination mechanism 
can be studied for charm via the comparison of non-strange D meson $v_{\rm 2}$ with the $\rm D_s$ meson $v_{\rm 2}$. The dynamics of heavy quarks in the QGP can be further 
investigated through the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) analysis. Measuring the D-meson $v_{2}$ in classes of events defined on the basis of the average flow in a given centrality class allows to evaluate the correlation between the elliptic flow of soft hadrons and D mesons.

The interest in heavy-flavour measurements in small systems, like p-Pb and pp, have been for a long time limited to the possibility of providing tests of perturbative QCD, measurements of cold-matter effects in the nuclear medium, and the baseline for observations of hot-medium effects in heavy-ion collisions. However, such measurements have recently gained additional interest due to the possibility of observing final-state like effects typically attributed, in Pb-Pb collisions, to the presence of QGP. The orgin of such effects 
is still debated. In this contribution, the measurement of the ${\rm D}^{0}$ $v_{1}$ together with strange and non-strange D meson $v_{2}$ and the $v_{2}$ ESE analysis in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV will be presented.

Just a few of easily tabulated scalar functions then determine the Lorentz invariant decay spectrum from each space-time point, and simple integrals of these scalar functions over the freeze-out surface determine the final decay products.
