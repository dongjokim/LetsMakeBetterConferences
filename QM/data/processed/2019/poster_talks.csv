Poster Session,poster,Dijet invariant mass in pp and p--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Saarimaki, Oskari Antti Matti",Helsinki Institute of Physics (FI),FI,"Oskari Saarimäki for the ALICE collaboration

We present the dijet invariant mass distribution in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured by ALICE. We study the dependence of the dijet invariant mass on event multiplicity in both collision systems, to explore cold nuclear matter effects or possible medium modifications in small collision systems. We measure charged jets using central tracking detectors in ALICE and correct the results for detector effects using unfolding procedure. Previous two-particle correlation studies from RHIC and the dijet asymmetry studies from LHC indicate that the dijet invariant mass can be sensitive to modifications caused by the QGP medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Oskari Antti Matti', 'last_name': 'Saarimaki', 'fullName': 'Saarimaki, Oskari Antti Matti', 'id': '4554431', 'affiliation': 'Helsinki Institute of Physics (FI)', 'emailHash': '27bee4fcbf8218ed1ff7de494e99faff', 'db_id': 4554431, 'person_id': 4585944}"
Poster Session,poster,Chiral soliton lattice in dense matter under rotation,"Nishimura, Kentaro",Keio University,Unknown,"We study the anomaly-induced effects of dense matter under rotation. We show that the chiral perturbation theory under rotation has the topological term that accounts for the chiral vortical effect. We find that, due to the presence of this new term, the ground state of QCD under rotation is the chiral soliton lattice (CSL) of the neutral pion or $\eta^{\prime}$ meson. This state is a periodic array of topological solitons which spontaneously breaks parity and continuous translational symmetries. In particular, at high density, the CSL of the $\eta^{\prime}$ meson is energetically more favorable than the color-flavor locked color superconducting phase and its critical angular velocity is proportional to the QCD anomaly in the flavor symmetric case.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kentaro', 'last_name': 'Nishimura', 'fullName': 'Nishimura, Kentaro', 'id': '4554350', 'affiliation': 'Keio University', 'emailHash': 'c994e89be6c3c4fa438b5b63236e9c77', 'db_id': 4554350, 'person_id': 4587998}"

is to major the Upsilon states with 100MeV mass resolution. In order to
achieve this resolution, a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was proposed
for momentum measurements of electrons and hadrons. The TPC does
not have a gating grid similarly to the ALICE TPC case and therefore
capable for handing the collision rate of up to a few hundreds KHz.
In turn, the charge has to be readout continuously. The readout
electronics was newly designed to meet this requirement. The signal is
readout by 624 Frontend cards that have 8 SAMPA v5 chips, the new
version of the one employed for ALICE TPC, and sent to a backend
electronics, FELIX PCI card, designed for ATLAS experiment. The data
rate from the whole TPC may reach as much as 1.4Tbps. We will show
the readout scheme for the TPC and the performance from the prototype
boards as well as the data reduction scheme.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': '', 'last_name': 'sPHENIX Collaboration', 'fullName': 'sPHENIX Collaboration', 'id': '4554122', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': None, 'db_id': 4554122, 'person_id': 4586105}"

Poster Session,poster,Factorization breaking in transverse momentum from hydrodynamic fluctuations,"Gogun, Yuki",Sophia University,Unknown,"In recent years, factorization breaking of flow coefficients in transverse momentum has been measured by CMS Collaboration [1] to understand the transport properties of QGP. The factorization ratio $r_n$ measured in Pb + Pb collisions at LHC represents the decorrelation of the event plane angle in different transverse momentum regions. When $r_n = 1$, which implies the coincidence of the event-plane angles along transverse momentum direction, $r_n$ can be factorized into the anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$ in the individual transverse momentum regions. However, $r_n < 1$ means the event-plane angles differ from each other and consequently this factorization is broken. Hydrodynamic fluctuations are expected to break the factorization because they disturb the event plane. 

In this study, we analyze the factorization ratio $r_n$ in the direction of transverse momentum by using an integrated dynamical model [2] that incorporates thermal fluctuations into the relativistic hydrodynamic model. The QGP produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions expands rapidly, cools down and becomes a hadron gas in a short time period. Thus, the QGP cannot be measured directly. Therefore, the transport properties of QGP are explored through analysis of the hadron momentum distribution measured by the detector. Since the final state hadron observables carry the information on the whole history of the space-time evolution of the system, it is important to construct an integrated dynamical model that describes the whole reaction. Using this integrated dynamic model incorporating hydrodynamic fluctuations, we compare the analysis results of the factorization ratio in the transverse momentum direction with the experimental results and discuss the influence of the hydrodynamic fluctuations on the factorization ratio in the transverse momentum direction.

Poster Session,poster,High transverse momentum direct photons in p+Au collisions in PHENIX at RHIC,"Sun, Zhandong",University of Debrecen,Unknown,"The primary source of high transverse momentum (>4-5GeV/c) direct photons is the initial hard scattering of partons, specifically the quark-gluon Compton scattering process.  This has been validated not only in hadron-hadron, but also in heavy ion collisions (see for instance PRL 109 (2012) 152302), where the observed yields were proportional, as expected,  to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions as calculated from the Glauber model for various collision centralities.  This observation supports that the collision geometry is well defined by the centrality measure we have been using, at least in the case when the colliding ions are large. The definition, however, is not obvious in very asymmetric collisions,
like p+Au. We assume that high transverse momentum direct photons are a ""standard candle"" for initial hard scattering, and, per extension, for collision geometry not only for p+p and A+A, but also for small-on-large collisions.  If true, comparing the centrality dependence of direct photon and hadron production in p+Au is a robust test of the applicability of the Glauber model in such systems. In this poster we will report on the status of the analysis of high transverse momentum direct photons in p+Au collisions at various centralities as well as of the direct photon / hadron ratios and its comparison with hadron production.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhandong', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, Zhandong', 'id': '4554130', 'affiliation': 'University of Debrecen', 'emailHash': 'a4c6f73466a9cbbaf210e6a89fd1cced', 'db_id': 4554130, 'person_id': 4586143}"

In this poster, in order to distinguish these mechanisms, we explore the dependence of $r_2$ on the $\eta$ coverage of the event plane, $p_T$ of particles of interest, and event shape as a function of centrality based on the STAR data of Au+Au collisions at 27 and 200 GeV. Observation on $\eta$, $p_T$ and beam energy dependence implies possible non-flow contribution. An alternative observable, correlating the forward, backward and midrapidity event planes, $\langle\sin(2(\Psi_{f} -\Psi_{mid,1})) \sin(2(\Psi_{b} -\Psi_{mid,2}))\rangle$, will be carried out to further probe the genuine flow decorrelation. We also compare the STAR measurement with simulation from AMPT, where the model results seem to overpredict the magnitude of $r_2$, presumably arising from the difference in the initial geometry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gang', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Gang', 'id': '4666718', 'affiliation': 'UCLA', 'emailHash': '31ea6a476b94d59636639178b87d486a', 'db_id': 4666718, 'person_id': 4557466}"

However, the latest innovations in the silicon imaging technology allow for the construction of large, ultra thin silicon wafers which can further improve the capabilities of the ALICE tracker. A proposal for a further upgrade of the ALICE ITS, regarding the construction of a novel vertex detector, is under consideration. The installation of the new ITS, ITS3,  is planned for the third LHC shutdown (LS3) during which the three innermost layers of ITS2 will be replaced by three cylindrical layers of large curved CMOS wafers. The next ITS upgrade (ITS3) will improve further the impact parameter resolution and the tracking efficiency of low momentum particles. The innermost ITS layer will be positioned closer to the interaction point and the material budget will be reduced down to 0.05$\%$$~$$X_0$ per layer.

Monte Carlo simulations of a simplified ITS3 geometry within the ITS2 design indicate an improvement in the impact parameter resolution and the tracking efficiency.  Based on these MC simulations the significance of measuring the $\Lambda_b$ particle with the ITS3 was calculated and compared to the value obtained for the ITS2.

There have been extensive researches regarding the production of charm mesons, such as $\rm D^{0}$, $\rm D^{+}$, $\rm D^{*+}$, $\rm D^{+}_{s}$, in order to investigate the interactions of charm quarks with the QGP constituents and the transport properties of the medium. The measurement of charm-baryon production, and in particular the baryon-to-meson ratios, provides unique information on hadronisation mechanisms, constraining the role of coalescence and testing the predicted presence of diquark states in the QGP.

Measurements of charm-baryon production in pp collisions are important to set up a benchmark for Pb-Pb collisions and provide essential tests of pQCD calculations and models of charm hadronisation process.

As the $\rm{K}^{*}$ has a lifetime comparable to the lifetime of the hadronic phase, one would expect to observe the effects of re-scattering and regeneration processes in the measured $\rm{K}^{*}$ production yield. In contrast, the $\phi$ meson has a longer lifetime compared to other resonances. Thus, it is expected that its yields will not be affected by regeneration and re-scattering. So far, most of the measurements of hadronic resonances in pp collisions have been used as baselines for heavy-ion collisions. However, recent indications of the possible formation of QGP droplets and the presence of a hadronic phase in small systems makes the study of hadronic resonance production in small systems more important. Event shape observables like transverse spherocity, along with charged-particle multiplicity, can serve as an important tool to separate isotropic and jetty events, which can help in understanding the recently observed phenomena in small systems in a more differential manner. 

We report measurements of $\rm{K}^{*\pm}$ and $\phi$ meson production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse spherocity, reconstructed in their hadronic decay channels of $\rm{K}_{\rm S}^{0}\pi^{\pm}$ and $\rm{K}^{+}\rm{K}^{-}$, respectively.

In Pb--Pb collisions at LHC and Au--Au collisions at RHIC, even higher values of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}/{\rm D^{0}}$ ratios were observed, described within large uncertainties by models that foresee that $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ can form via coalescence of charm quarks with light quarks from the medium. These results indicate that charm baryon production in hadronic collisions is not fully understood and suggest that heavy-quark hadronisation can be sensitive to the presence of a surrounding hadronic environment.

Models that better reproduce the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}/{\rm D^{0}}$ ratio in pp collisions expect a significant contribution to $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ yield from decays of heavier charm-baryon states, among which $\Sigma_{\rm c}$ states.

In pp collisions, the measurement of charm and beauty hadron production cross-sections can be used to test our understanding of the Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) in the perturbative regime. In addition, pp collisions provide the required reference for measurements in nuclear collisions such as the measurement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays.

In this contribution, the $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross-section of electrons from heavy-flavour and beauty-hadron decays in pp collisions at different center of mass energies from $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 to 13 TeV measured by ALICE at mid-rapidity are reported. The analysis procedures employed will be discussed. Comparisons of these results with the FONLL (Fixed-Order and Next-to-Leading Logarithms) model calculations will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sudhir Pandurang', 'last_name': 'Rode', 'fullName': 'Rode, Sudhir Pandurang', 'id': '4554300', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '677639ea446274ac4636e1e20bc76142', 'db_id': 4554300, 'person_id': 4580170}"
Poster Session,poster,Effect of longitudinal asymmetry on pseudorapidity distributions in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Raniwala, Rashmi","University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, India",India,"In a collision of two identical heavy-ions, the participant zone formed from the overlapping region of the two colliding nuclei contains unequal number of nucleons from each nucleus due to fluctuations. Consequently, the participant zone has a non-zero momentum in the centre of mass frame of the colliding nuclei, causing a longitudinal asymmetry. Using data in Pb-Pb collisions at centre of mass energy 2.76 TeV, the ALICE experiment had demonstrated that the longitudinal asymmetry manifests itself in the measured pseudorapidity distributions.  In the present work, the results on the pseudorapidity distributions and the estimated shift in the rapidity will be presented using data from Pb-Pb collisions at centre of mass energy 5.02 TeV. The shift in rapidity of the participant zone due to the longitudinal asymmetry is estimated using the unequal energy deposited in the forward zero- degree calorimeters on either side of the interaction vertex.  The results show the relation between the shift in rapidity and the centre of mass energy. In addition, results will be presented for pseudorapidity distributions for charged particles in different transverse momentum intervals.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rashmi', 'last_name': 'Raniwala', 'fullName': 'Raniwala, Rashmi', 'id': '4554328', 'affiliation': 'University of Rajasthan, Jaipur, India', 'emailHash': '0778047751528009268f3e8ea55d8c26', 'db_id': 4554328, 'person_id': 4588154}"

Both experiments are complementary to each other in terms of detector setup and measureable energy range making it interesting to study one system at both experiments for comparison and verification of the CBM results. Currently Ag+Ag collisions at 4.5A GeV is favored. A major component for electron identification in both experiments is a RICH detector.

In the intermediate-mass region, the measurement of thermal dielectrons from the QGP is nevertheless very challenging at the LHC due to the dominant contribution of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs from open-charm and -beauty hadron decays. To single out the interesting signal characteristics of the QGP, the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum needs to be first understood. It can be studied in minimum-bias proton-proton collisions. Dielectron measurements in elementary collision systems serve not only as a reference for the heavy-ion analysis but provide also a test for Monte-Carlo event generators, aiming to reproduce the heavy-flavour production mechanisms.

In this poster, we will present the status of the dielectron analysis in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE. The dielectron yield is studied as a function of invariant mass, pair transverse momentum, and pair transverse impact parameter (DCA$_{\rm ee}$).

One of the core detectors of CBM is the Silicon Tracking System (STS). The STS is the key detector for measuring the momentum and tracks of up to 1000 charged particles produced in Au+Au collisions which happen at interaction rates up to 10 MHz on a fixed target. Due to the required momentum resolution for the STS of Δp/p ~ 1.5%, the material budget of STS has to be minimized as much as possible. In order to keep the read-out electronics, cooling and mechanical infrastructure out of the detector acceptance, the sensors are connected to the self-triggering front-end electronics by means of low-mass flexible microcables with a length up to 50 cm. In combination with the large double-sided sensors with a size up to 124 mm x 62 mm, the detector module becomes a highly complex structure, which in turn leads to a challenging module assembly procedure.
To mitigate risk, two high-density interconnection technologies have been developed for the STS modules, based on ultra-thin aluminium and copper mircocables, respectively. Capacitance simulations and measurements of the microcables and full detector material budget simulations have been performed. Next to the individual steps involved in the respective interconnection technologies, the electrical performance of the assembled modules, including a thorough noise analysis, will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Patrick', 'last_name': 'Pfistner', 'fullName': 'Pfistner, Patrick', 'id': '4554295', 'affiliation': 'KIT', 'emailHash': '0186aa7985ae1edbf1069d6b39926905', 'db_id': 4554295, 'person_id': 4588623}"

Investigating the modification of the jet shape in terms of the event multiplicity can provide us with deeper insights on the nature of these effects.

In this contribution, we report on the latest results concerning the jet-shape measurements of the jet radial profile and first radial moment (or girth) and their multiplicity dependence in pp collisions at $\sqrt{\textit{s}}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE. The jet radial profile describes the energy distribution inside the jet cone while the first radial moment provides complementary information on the jet fragmentation properties.

The QGP signatures studied in BES-I became insensitive or disappeared at energies below $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 GeV. The fluctuations in the event-by-event net-proton multiplicities exhibited a dip at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ ≈ 19.6 GeV and a rise at 7.7 GeV. Motivated by the findings of BES-I, STAR has initiated a phase II of the BES program (BES-II). The BES-II program improves upon the earlier BES-I program with detector upgrades to extend the acceptance, higher luminosity to provide $10-20$ times better statistics at each energy, and a Fixed-Target program to extend the range of BES-II below the expected critical point. In this poster, results from the first dedicated fixed-target physics run at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV will be presented. The run used a 250 $\mu$m thick gold target and accumulated 335 million Au+Au events. We present proton (and anti-proton) yields and multiplicities. These measurements will be compared with results from AGS experiments E866 and E895. We will discuss the implications of the observed multiplicities and efficiency corrections to the study of cumulants of event-by-event net-proton multiplicities up to the fourth order as a function of rapidity. It is expected that this collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV should fall below the transition to QGP, therefore measurements at this energy will test for the return of the critical fluctuations to the expected baseline. Results at this energy will help understand the trends observed in the previous results from the BES program and preliminary results from HADES.

Poster Session,poster,When Jet Quenching meets Machine Learning,"Liu, Lihan",Vanderbilt University (US),USA,"It’s believed that the properties of quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) can be studied through measurements of the jet quenching phenomenon. More specifically, observation of jet substructure variables may reveal the microscopic properties of the QGP.

Recently the modification of groomed jet observables was studied in heavy-ion collisions [1]. In addition, the Lund radiation plane was introduced to investigate parton shower modifications in the QGP [2].

In this poster I am going to show how machine learning techniques can help evaluate how quenched a jet is. The first approach is to use a convolution neural network (CNN) which is a technique heavily used in computer vision. The second approach uses a technique based on long and short-term memory (LSTM). The LSTM model is an artificial recursive neural network and is capable of processing sequential data. This design makes it well-suited for making predictions on jets considering that the way of calculating substructure variables implies sequential information of how branchings occur.

Simulations are made with monte-carlo event generators such as PYTHIA8 and JEWEL which simulates jet showering in vacuum and in medium respectively. Classifiers are trained in order to evaluate how quenched a jet is. In addition, experience from the perspective of hardware will also be shared.

In this poster, we will present results from the STAR experiment on invariant yields of $D_{s}^{\pm}$ mesons as a function of transverse momentum for different centrality classes of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The measurements utilize the data with the Heavy Flavor Tracker from 2014 and 2016. The ratio between strange ($D_{s}^{\pm}$) and non-strange ($D^{0}$) open charm mesons will also be shown, and compared to PYTHIA and model calculations. A clear enhancement relative to the PYTHIA calculation is seen in the ratio, while model calculations incorporating strangeness enhancement and charm quark coalescence hadronization are closer to data. These results suggest that recombination of charm quarks with equilibrated strange quarks in the QGP plays an important role in charm quark hadronization.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chuan', 'last_name': 'Fu', 'fullName': 'Fu, Chuan', 'id': '4672559', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': None, 'db_id': 4672559, 'person_id': 4761752}"

One of the promising diagnostic probes for these new states is the enhanced production of multi-strange (anti-)particles. The CBM detector is designed to measure such rare diagnostic probes multi-differentially with unprecedented precision and statistics. Important key observables are the production of hypernuclei and dibaryons. Theoretical models predict that single and even doubly-strange hypernuclei are produced in heavy-ion collisions with the maximum yield in the region of SIS100 energies. The discovery and investigation of new (doubly strange-)hypernuclei and of hyper-matter will shed light on the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.

Studying this ratio as a function of collision energy may provide a unique probe to explore the vicinity of the critical endpoint in heavy ion collisions via the fluctuation of strange quark densities.

Poster Session,poster,Time evolution of chirality imbalance of the massive fermions under parallel electric and magnetic fields,"Aoi, Hayato","Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science",Unknown,"In the past several years there has been increasing interest in the chirality imbalance $n_5$, which is the difference between right- and left-handed fermions. The chirality imbalance is expected to be produced from the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly(ABJ-anomaly) and plays a key role to understand anomalous transport phenomena in the hot/dense quark matter or the Dirac/Weyl semimetals under the magnetic field. One of interesting transport phenomena in the presence of chirality imbalance is the chiral magnetic effect(CME), appearance of electric current in direction of the external magnetic field.

The ABJ-anomaly relation implies that the electric field gives a crucial contribution to the emergence of the chirality imbalance in addition to the magnetic field. In the previous work, we have studied the chirality imbalance and the CME using the solution of the Dirac equation in the constant magnetic and general time-dependent electric fields, and found that the time-dependence of the gauge field is essentially important for the production of $n_5$. In particular, we found that $n_5$ and CME at $t \to \infty$ are solely determined by the probability distributions of the fermion created non-perturbatively by the electric field.  

In this talk, we study the emergence of the chirality imbalance and the electric current under spatially-uniform and parallel electromagnetic field in the vacuum of massive fermion. For the time-dependence, we assume the constant magnetic field, but do not impose any specific form for the electric field with boundary conditions $E(t \to \pm \infty) \to 0$.  We solve the Dirac equation and calculate vacuum expectation values of the currents with the gauge invariant regularization.  

As a result, asymptotic forms of $n_5$ and CME consists of a constant part and an oscillating part independent of details of intermediate time-dependence of the gauge potential. The non-zero constant term is proportional to a relativistic velocity and the momentum distribution of the created particle, and understood as a classical analogue of the electric current. We discuss how the chirality imbalance arises by the time-dependent electric field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hayato', 'last_name': 'Aoi', 'fullName': 'Aoi, Hayato', 'id': '4554378', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Tokyo University of Science', 'emailHash': '186990978a48f68210395826b4a001db', 'db_id': 4554378, 'person_id': 4587439}"

As discussed in Ref [3], one can, however, remove the model dependence, by carefully constructing mixed cumulants and their ratios using the protons and pions produced in heavy-ion collisions. Five constructed ratios such as: $\kappa_{3p}\kappa_{2\pi}^{3/2}$/$\kappa_{3\pi}\kappa_{2p}^{3/2}$, $\kappa_{4p}\kappa_{2\pi}^{2}$/$\kappa_{4\pi}\kappa_{2p}^{2}$, $\kappa_{4p}^{3}\kappa_{3\pi}^{4}$/$\kappa_{4\pi}^{3}\kappa_{3p}^{4}$, $\kappa_{2p2\pi}^{2}$/$\kappa_{4\pi}\kappa_{4p}$ and $\kappa_{2p1\pi}^{3}$/$\kappa_{3p}^{2}\kappa_{3\pi}$ (where $\kappa_{ipj\pi}$ is mixed cumulant of $i^{th}$ order in proton and $j^{th}$ order in pion) are expected to become unity near the presence of the QCD critical point [3].

Poster Session,poster,Performance studies of scintillator tiles for the sPHENIX hadronic calorimeter,sPHENIX Collaboration,Unknown,Unknown,"The sPHENIX detector at BNL’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) will begin taking data in 2023, providing detailed measurements of jets and Upsilons in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.  To make precision jet energy measurements, sPHENIX will be equipped with a Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal) located outside a 1.4T superconducting solenoidal magnet. The HCal is composed of 7,680 plastic scintillating tiles sandwiched between layers of steel absorber plates. Light produced by particles striking the tile is captured by a wavelength shifting fiber that routes the light to Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) at one end of the tile.  The geometry of the mid-rapidity calorimeter is novel, tilted in azimuth such that particles coming from the interaction region traverse a number of scintillating tiles.  The scintillator tiles come in different shapes based on their location in pseudorapidity.  Tiles of the same shape are grouped together azimuthally in sets of five forming a “tower,” and the readout from a tower is the aggregate of the signals of each tile within a tower.  Results of beam tests carried out at Fermilab have shown that the detector has the required energy resolution to accomplish sPHENIX’s physics goals; additionally, in order to optimize the performance of the calorimeter, towers will be constructed out of tiles with similar behavior.  Testing has begun at Georgia State University to characterize the performance of each individual tile relative to a baseline reference by analyzing their response to cosmic rays. This poster will detail the design of the test setup, the analysis procedure, and the current results of the performance characterization studies of the sPHENIX HCal tiles.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': '', 'last_name': 'sPHENIX Collaboration', 'fullName': 'sPHENIX Collaboration', 'id': '4554434', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': None, 'db_id': 4554434, 'person_id': 4585947}"

Poster Session,poster,The STAR measurements on off-diagonal cumulants of net-particle multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV,"Chatterjee, Arghya",CCNU/ VECC,Unknown,"We present measurements of the second-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton, and net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7-200 GeV. We focus on the pseudorapidity window and centrality dependence of these cumulants. We compare our results with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) and UrQMD calculations. The energy dependence of the second order off-diagonal over diagonal cumulant ratios cannot be fully described by different model calculations [1]. We extend such measurements to the third-order off-diagonal cumulants. These measurements provide important insights on the correlations between different conserved charges from the QGP and hadronic phase, as well as their dependence with temperature and baryon chemical potential. We also study correlations between net-pion with net-proton as well as net-pion and net-kaon that have recently been shown to constrain frameworks of local charge conservation during hadronization [2].

Poster Session,poster,Hard symmetry breaking effects in effective theories of the QCD phase diagram,"Sharma, Rishi",TIFR,Unknown,"Effective Field Theories (EFTs) provide a systematic framework in which all terms consistent with the symmetries up to a specific mass dimension are written down in the lagrangian. We explore the consequence of the assumption that a fermionic EFT describes the QCD crossover. 

This EFT was analyzed for zero quark number chemical potential ($\mu=0$) in Ref. [1] considering all chirally symmetric terms up to dimension $6$. Following previous literature [3,4] the only explicit chiral symmetry breaking term considered was the quark mass $m_q\bar{\psi}\psi$. The independent coupling constants of the theory were fit to Euclidean $\pi$ velocity and the $\pi$ screening mass measured on the lattice [2] at $T=0.84T_{co}$ ($T_{co}$ is the crossover temperature) and yielded an independent prediction: $\pi$ decay constant $f$ which agreed with the lattice data. The theory describes the variations of these $\pi$ properties near the crossover temperature at $\mu=0$.

In this work we analyze the implications of the effective theory for finite $\mu$. From the symmetry point of view a finite quark mass $m_q\bar{\psi}\psi$ breaks chiral symmetry, $\mu\bar{\psi}\gamma^4\psi$ breaks CP symmetry. Usually, analysis is simplified by assuming that only soft symmetry breaking terms (dimension less than $4$) appear which means that these two are the only explicit symmetry breaking terms in the lagrangian. In an effective theory with a cutoff however, a softly broken symmetry will inevitably lead to terms of dimension greater than $4$, which break the symmetry under consideration -- also known as hard symmetry breaking.

We study the consequences of adding hard breaking of symmetries in fermionic effective theory models for QCD. We focus on the behaviour of two mean fields, the chiral condensate $\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ and the number density $\langle\bar{\psi}\gamma^4\psi\rangle$ in the QCD phase diagram. In the absence of hard breaking terms, the two condensates are connected by mean field definitions of the mass and the chemical potential.    

At $\mu=0$ the impact of hard chiral symmetry breaking is simply a redefinition of the four Fermi coupling constant and is inconsequential. For finite chemical potential in the chiral limit no new terms appear but we show using an analysis with two mean fields that the curvature of the critical line changes. This depends on a new linear combination of the coupling constants of the dimension $6$ operators and this combination can be chosen to match the value of the curvature calculated on the lattice [5]. This resolves the discrepancy of our previous calculation [1] of the curvature of the critical line and the lattice.

Finally, when $m_q$ and $\mu$ are both finite, hard breaking induces a direct coupling between the two condensates. This additional coupling affects the location of the crossover temperature (defined as the maximum of chiral  susceptibility) as a function of the chemical potential. The curvature of the crossover line can be used to match this additional constant and this fixes the phase diagram in this framework. This constrains the location of the QCD critical point.

Poster Session,poster,Forward-backward centrality fluctuation and its influence on experimental observables in heavy-ion collisions,"Zhang, Chunjian",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics,Unknown,"In heavy ion collisions, the transverse size or centrality of the QGP is not a boost-invariant concept. Due to forward-backward multiplicity fluctuations, the centrality of the system, defined as $N_{\mathrm{ch}}$ in a given $\eta$ range, also fluctuates in the longitudinal direction. This longitudinal fluctuation leads to decorrelation of centrality along $\eta$, analogous to the decorrelation of harmonic flow $v_n$ along $\eta$. In this work, we quantify the strength of centrality decorrelation using multi-particle cumulants (mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) using a sub-nucleon Glauber model as well as dynamical event generators HIJING and AMPT. We found the behaviors of multiplicity cumulants in ultra-central collisions (UCC) are extremely sensitive to the particle production implemented in the models, and therefore can be used to quantify the centrality resolution and constrain the particle production mechanism. We further studied the influence of centrality fluctuation and decorrelations on $v_n$ and mean transverse momentum $\langle p_{\mathrm {T}}\rangle$ in each event. We show that the event-by-event probability distribution of these quantities such as $p(v_n)$, $p(v_n, v_m)$, $p(\langle p_{\mathrm {T}}\rangle)$ and $p(v_n,\langle p_{\mathrm {T}}\rangle)$, accessible via mixed-observable multi-particle cumulants, are sensitive to the strength of the fluctuation and longitudinal decorrelations of centrality. We laid out an experimental strategy on how to constrain the centrality dependence of particle production, based on measurements of these mixed-observable cumulants in UCC for systems of different sizes.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chunjian', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Chunjian', 'id': '4578733', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics', 'emailHash': 'adbf8d5019c6ca8f68119c5cf449661c', 'db_id': 4578733, 'person_id': 4585729}"
Poster Session,poster,Nuclear modification of jet shape for inclusive jets and γ-jets at the LHC energies,"Chang, NingBo",Xinyang Normal University,Unknown,"With our coupled jet-fluid model, we study the nuclear modifications of full jets and jet structures for single inclusive jets and $\gamma$-jets in Pb+Pb collisions at $5.02$ ATeV and $2.76$ ATeV. The in-medium evolution of full jet shower is described by a set of coupled transport equations including the effects of collisional energy loss, transverse momentum broadening and medium-induced splitting process. The dynamical evolution of bulk medium is simulated by solving relativistic hydrodynamic equation with source term which accounts for the energy and momentum deposited by hard jet shower to soft medium. Our study demonstrates that the hydrodynamic medium response to jet propagation significantly enhances the broadening of jet shape at large angles and is essential for the cone-size dependence of jet energy loss and nuclear modification factor of inclusive jet production. It is also found that the nuclear modification pattern of jet shape is sensitive to jet energy but has weak dependence on the flavor of the parton that initiates the jet.

Poster Session,poster,Non-static properties of the chiral magnetic conductivity,"Horváth, Miklós","CCNU IoPP, Wuhan",Unknown,"In this talk we investigate the response of the medium of chiral fermions to time and space dependent external electromagnetic fields and chiral imbalance. The axial-vector--vector--vector (AVV) three-point function is studied in a real-time approach at finite temperature in the linear response approximation.
The different orders of limits lead to different results as the external fields reach to the constant configuration in both space and time. We classify these different scenarios, involving the well-known case dictated by the chiral anomaly and even the case of vanishing chiral magnetic conductivity. The physical interpretation of these different scenarios is discussed through the anomalous conservation of the chiral charge. The result emphasizes the importance of whether or not the assumption of thermal equilibrium is justified for a system with chiral imbalance.
Two non-static examples are discussed in details: we analyze the AVV response function for i.) arbitrary space-time dependent chiral chemical potential when the magnetic field is constant and ii.) for arbitrary magnetic field with constant chiral imbalance. In the non-interacting limit the response function can be given even analytically, revealing a relatively simple form in both cases. 
We also discuss the phenomenological implications on the electric charge polarization in a high-energy nuclear collision scenario. The effects of quenches and inhomogeneities of the chiral charge are especially explored, assuming the majority of the chiral charge is of QCD origin and that its generation can be described by a stochastic process.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Miklós', 'last_name': 'Horváth', 'fullName': 'Horváth, Miklós', 'id': '4578739', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'd9b241ad5eaabc434076ad30b2aeabf7', 'db_id': 4578739, 'person_id': 4585652}"
Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium dynamics with colorful stochastic potential,"Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"In heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC, quarkonium yields have been measured at various collision energies. The experimental findings reveal different characteristic behavior: sequential suppression dominates for bottomonium and recombination for charmonium. A comprehensive understanding of this phenomenology requires a genuine quantum mechanical treatment, in particular to capture the phenomenon of decoherence central to a unified description of suppression and recombination.

Recently progress has been made in understanding the in-medium dynamics of a quarkonium based on the framework of open quantum system. It allows us to derive the dynamics of quarkonium in the quark-gluon-plasma systematically from QCD and already has helped improve our understanding of the complex in-medium potential. In a previous study, based on the stochastic potential approximation [1], we have elucidated the role of decoherence on the stability of in-medium heavy quarkonium, identifying it as a novel mechanism for quarkonium dissociation via scattering with the medium [2], in addition to the well-known Debye screening.

In this talk we present results [3], where for the first time color degrees of freedom are taken into account in fully quantum mechanical fashion without invoking a semi-classical approximation. I.e. we simulate a genuine color SU(3) stochastic Schrödinger equation. We discuss how SU(3) color degrees of freedom affect the real-time evolution of quarkonium color singlet and octet states. We find the preservation of quarkonium parity in the colorful stochastic potential. We also show how the decoherence proceeds in the color octet states and discuss the availability of classical description for the gluo-dissociation process.

Such results serve as a necessary baseline for the identification of any critical phenomena in the collision energy dependence of the cumulants. The PCE scenario is relevant for scenarios of the nuclear collisions where chemical freeze-out coincides with hadronisation, but the fireball cools down further until kinetic freeze-out is reached. As a consequence, each stable hadronic species acquires its own chemical potential which depends on the temperature. Since proton number is not a conserved quantity, it may additionally fluctuate due to random nature of the resonance decays. We calculate the first four cumulants of the net-proton number distribution as functions of temperature for different chemical freeze-outs, which correspond to different collision energies. Interestingly, their temperature dependence is rather flat. Hence, this proves that the results obtained for the cumulants at the chemical freeze-out can still be regarded as relevant.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Paula', 'last_name': 'Hillmann', 'fullName': 'Hillmann, Paula', 'id': '4578765', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'adde5e1bdc2ee1d8fad6ad5713ad8979', 'db_id': 4578765, 'person_id': 4585514}"

Although hydrodynamics is one of the most powerful theoretical frameworks to describe bulk quantities, its extension to a spinful fluid has not been developed well, especially for relativistic systems.  

In this presentation, we formulate relativistic spin hydrodynamics with first-order dissipative corrections for the first time [1].  Our formulation is based on the phenomenological entropy-current analysis, in which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are utilized to constrain constitutive relations.  We also clarify that spin should be a non-hydrodynamic (diffusive) mode by explicitly solving the obtained hydrodynamic equations within the linear-mode analysis on top of a global thermal equilibrium configuration.  This diffusive behavior is a consequence of the mutual convertibility between spin and orbital angular momentum.

Heavier light anti-nuclei to light nuclei ratios are more sensitive to the focusing effect in the vicinity of critical point.

However, the related model calculations depends on various parameters and inputs. In this talk, I will focus on the universal behavior of the dynamical evolving systems near the critical point, which is insensitive to various parameters and input in the model calculations.

 

In [1,2], we have investigated the Kibble-Zurek scaling within the framework Langevin dynamics of the order parameter field and net-protons, and within the framework of stochastic diffusion dynamics of conserved charges. We constructed universal functions which are insensitive to various parameters through rescaling the traditional correlation function and cumulant with the properly determined characteristic scales $\tau_{kz}$ ,$\theta_{kz}$ and $l_{kz}$.

 

In more details, for the dynamic of non-conserved order parameter, the constructed universal functions are insensitive to the magnitude of relaxation time and the evolving trajectory on phase diagram. And coupling with the net-proton, the oscillating behavior is suppressed for the constructed universal function, comparing with the original cumulants which strongly oscillate in terms of relaxation time and trajectory. For the dynamics of conserved charge, we also construct the universal functions, which are insensitive to the different initial temperature and a parameter in the equation of state.

Experimental observation of CME would provide a tantalizing evidence for the chiral symmetry restoration as well as QCD topological fluctuations. Measurements at RHIC and LHC so far show intriguing hints but remain inconclusive, due to strong background contamination and relatively small CME signal. To address these challenges and to understand sensitivity of various proposed observables, it is crucial to have a sophisticated modeling framework that realistically quantify both the CME signal and background correlations. In this talk, we present such a new tool, the **Event-By-Event Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics** (EBE-AVFD) framework. The EBE-AVFD starts with event-wise fluctuating initial conditions for the bulk+axial charge+magnetic fields, simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the data-validated bulk fluid evolution from either VISHNU or MUSIC, samples freeze-out particles with local charge conservation implemented, to be followed by URQMD hadron scattering stage that includes resonance decay contributions. We use this tool to characterize the various features of CME signal and related backgrounds, to validate the simulation parameters with existing experimental data, and to investigate the sensitivity of several different observables with respect to signal and backgrounds. Finally, we present the state-of-the-art quantitative predictions for the **CME signatures in isobaric collisions** (RuRu v.s.

The $\hat{q}$ increases with the increasing of jet energy for both partonic phase and hadronic phase. The energy and path length dependences of $\hat{q}$ in full heavy-ion evolution are consistent with the expectations of jet quenching. The correlation between jet transport parameter  $\hat{q}$ and dijet transverse momentum asymmetry $A_{J}$ is mainly investigated, which discloses that a larger $\hat{q}$ corresponds to a larger $A_{J}$.

Poster Session,poster,Medium modifications of event shape in high-energy nuclear collisions,"Chen, Shi-Yong",CCNU,Unknown,"Event shape observables, such as transverse sphericity $S_{\perp}$, have long been proposed to study geometrical properties and patterns of the energy flow, and provide a probe of multi-jet topologies  in an interaction. For example, the event is pencile-like when transverse sphericity $S_{\perp}\rightarrow 0$, whereas the event is sphere-like when $S_{\perp}\rightarrow 1$.  It is well-known that jet quenching in the QGP may lead to the suppression of hadron and jet spectra in heavy-ion collisions, but how jet quenching effect modifies the global geometrical proporties of jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions is still an unexplored problem. In this talk, we show the first theoretical results of the medium modification of transverse sphericity distribution due to jet quenching effect in heavy-ion collisions. In our investigation, POWHEG+PYTHIA is employed to provide the p+p baseline up to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy with rusummation by the matched parton shower. The Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model of the parton energy loss is implemented to simulate the in-medium evolution of jets. We calculate the event normalized medium modification factor as a function of transverse sphericity distributions in the overall region. An enhancement at small transverse sphericity region and a suppression at large transverse sphericity region are observed in A+A collisions compared to their p+p references, which implies that the event in heavy-ion collisions becomes more pencile-like relative to that in p+p.


We further explore the underlying reasons of the medium alteration of transverse sphericity distribution $S_{\perp}$.  Our numerical results show that the parton energy loss effect on multiple jet events ($n_{jet}\geq 3$) may cause the event more pencil-like, because  in this kind of process jets usually have relatively smaller energies and may fall off the jet selection kinematic cut after their energy loss in the medium. Furthermore, we plot the event normalized azimuth angle correlation factor ($\Delta \phi_{j1,j2}$) between the two leading jets for the full events both in p+p and A+A collisions. We demonstrate that jet quenching effect will enhance the fraction of events in back-to-back region ($\Delta \phi_{j1,j2}\sim \pi$) and naturally lead the full events to be more ""jetty"".  Therefore, even though medium-induced gluon radiation may lead to a more isotropic event, the disappearing of less energetic jets and the enhanced fraction of back-to-back  ($\Delta \phi_{j1,j2}\sim \pi$) reaction are more pronounced and thus give rise to an overall more pencil-like event in high-energy nuclear collisions with respect to that in p+p.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shi-Yong', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Shi-Yong', 'id': '4578911', 'affiliation': 'CCNU', 'emailHash': '43efbb72d1e9ee7feb7cc6c3b1667211', 'db_id': 4578911, 'person_id': 4586417}"

However, if there is a critical point in the QCD phase diagram then all characteristic temperatures should converge  and, depending on the universality class, some of the hydrodynamic transport coefficients themselves may diverge.  In order to explore out-of-equilibrium effects in the QCD phase diagram we use 1+0D (Bjorken flow) viscous hydrodynamics to study the hydrodynamical lifetime, cavitation, and attractor physics in a simple cross-over phase transition versus one with a critical point (where we expect all characteristic temperatures to converge).

These investigations are of direct relevance for the HADES experiment at GSI that has recently presented first data on the flow of light clusters in Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV. To address the deuteron flow, UrQMD has been extended to include deuteron formation by coalescence. We find that this ansatz provides a very good description of the measured deuteron flow data, if a hard equation of state is used for the simulation. In addition we show that light cluster formation has a sizable impact on the proton flow and has to be taken into account to obtain reliable results in the forward/backward region. Based on the observed scaling of the flow, which is a natural result of coalescence, we conclude that deuteron production at GSI energies is a final state recombination effect. Finally, we also discuss the scaling relations of the higher order flow components up to $v_4$. We show that $v_3 \sim v_1v_2$ and $v_4 \sim v_2^2$ as function of transverse momentum and that the integrated $v_2^2 \sim v_4$ over the investigated energy range from $E_{lab}$=0.1 AGeV to 40 AGeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Paula', 'last_name': 'Hillmann', 'fullName': 'Hillmann, Paula', 'id': '4578983', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'adde5e1bdc2ee1d8fad6ad5713ad8979', 'db_id': 4578983, 'person_id': 4585514}"

This problem can be overcome with an appropriate choice of the polarization measure.

We derive the kinetic equation and spin evolution equation for massive fermions, and calculate the spin polarization induced by vorticity and magnetic field via kinetic theory.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu-Chen', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Yu-Chen', 'id': '4579082', 'affiliation': 'Fudan University', 'emailHash': '3ac9e27d9116fb77c45efabf0116c101', 'db_id': 4579082, 'person_id': 4584668}"

In particular, charm quark elliptic ﬂow (v2) is a valuable tool for study of charm transport in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recent results from the STAR experiment show that in 10-40% central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy the D0-meson v2 follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark(NCQ) scaling similarly as light-ﬂavor hadrons. To gain more insight into the charm quark dynamics it is of interest to study their ﬂow in events with different initial conditions.

In this poster,  we will present D0-meson v2 measurement with the event-shape-engineering technique applied in Au+Au collisions at sNN = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The measurement utilizes the STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker and the combined datasets recorded during RHIC 2014 + 2016 runs. D0 v2 will be reported as a function of the reduced ﬂow vector q2 and compared to that of light-ﬂavor and strange hadrons. Furthermore, we utilize the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) detector covering the range of 2.5 < η < 4. The large η-gap helps to reduce the non-ﬂow contribution in the D0 v2 measurement.

This leads to a rapidity-odd asymmetry in the medium path length traversed by the hard partons and results in a rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$). Measurements of high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ hadron $v_1$ can provide valuable constraints on the initial longitudinal distribution of the fireball as well as the path length-dependent momentum loss of the partons. A similar effect, producing significantly large directed flow for heavy flavor mesons, was predicted [2] and has been observed for $D^0$ mesons (at 3$\sigma$ significance) by STAR recently.

In this poster, we will present the first measurement of pseudorapidity and centrality dependence of the $v_1$ of high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ($>$ 5 GeV/c) charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 54.4 and 200 GeV. The $v_1$ of charged hadrons is found to change sign twice as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and show large negative slope at high-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$, similarly to $D^0$ mesons.

Electrons reach the detector without significant final state interactions. In addition, the low-mass dielectron spectrum comes from various sources, i.e. Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, as well as the radiation from the thermalised system, which are produced at all stages of the collision.  Therefore, dielectron pairs can be used to study the space-time evolution of the system.

While pp collisions provide an important baseline measurement in vacuum for heavy-ion studies, p-Pb collisions can be used to disentangle cold from hot nuclear matter effects. Moreover, recent studies in small colliding systems (pp and p-Pb) showed intriguing collective behaviours similar to observations previously done in heavy-ion collisions. They require further investigations in particular as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity. Searching for the thermal signatures through dielectrons is also important in small systems to disentangle the initial and final state effects.

Dielectrons can be produced at different evolution stages of the collision system. Different invariant mass ranges are sensitive to different physics processes. In the low mass region ($M_{ee}$<$M_{\phi}$), dielectron production is sensitive to the in-medium modifications of vector mesons which could provide an access to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region ($M_{\phi}$<$M_{ee}$<$M_{J/\psi}$), the dielectron production from the medium thermal radiation is sensitive to the medium temperature, thus can serve as a thermometer of the medium. However, the dominant source in this mass region, semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons, makes the extraction of the thermal radiation contribution very challenging.

In this poster, we will present the results from the $1.5$ B minimum-bias events taken in 2018 Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=$ 27 GeV. This data sample is more than 10 times larger than that from the STAR Beam Energy Scan phase I program and allows a much more precise measurement of the in-medium modification of $\rho$ mesons. The much lower open charm production rate at this energy compared to RHIC top energies greatly reduces their contributions to the dielectron spectrum at the intermediate mass region, providing a better opportunity to extract the medium temperature.

Poster Session,poster,"System size scan of D meson $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_n$ using PbPb, XeXe, ArAr, and OO collisions at LHC","Prado, Caio",Central China Normal University (CN),Brazil,"Recent results at LHC and RHIC involving small collision systems have found evidence of collective flow behavior consistent with relativistic hydrodynamic expectations, which suggests the formation of tiny specks of quark-gluon plasma in these reactions. However, questions still remain about the nature of the matter formed in these minute systems. One of the main signatures of the quark-gluon plasma, i.e. the suppression of hard probes, has not yet been seen in small systems data. In fact, current experimental measurements indicate no suppression (e.g. $R_{\rm pPb} \sim 1$) in small systems. On the other hand, a surprisingly large D meson flow (though still suppressed compared to lighter hadrons) was measured in pPb collisions by the CMS collaboration. In order to reconcile these results we use Trento+v-USPhydro+DAB-MOD [1] to make predictions and propose a system size scan at the LHC involving $^{208}$PbPb, $^{129}$XeXe, $^{40}$ArAr, and $^{16}$OO collisions [2,3]. We find that the nuclear modification factor approaches unity as the system size is decreased, but nonetheless, in the 0--10% most central collisions $v_2\{2\}$ is roughly equivalent regardless of system size. Additionally we find that unlike in PbPb collisions the $v_3\{2\}$ gets a centrality dependence in smaller systems. These results arise from a rather non-trivial interplay between the shrinking path length in small systems and the enhancement of eccentricities in small systems at high multiplicity. Finally we also find a surprising sensitivity of D mesons $ v_2\{2\}$ in 0--10% at $p_T =$ 2--5 GeV to the slight deformation of $^{129}$Xe recently found at LHC.

The yields of resonances with short lifetimes are sensitive to regeneration and re-scattering processes in the hadronic phase between chemical and kinetic freeze out. It is therefore interesting to study these resonances in pp collisions as a function of multiplicity to see if we can observe signs of a hadron-gas phase even in small collision systems. In this poster, the strange hyperon resonances $\Sigma(1385)^{\pm}$ ($c\tau=5-5.5$ fm/$c$) and $\Xi(1530)^{0}$ ($c\tau=21.8$ fm/$c$) are studied as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV.

Poster Session,poster,Dynamical initialization at RHIC-BES energies,"OTSUKA, RURI",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"The quark gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nuclear collisions is known to behave like a perfect fluid. In hydrodynamic simulations at RHIC and the LHC energies, space-time evolution of the QGP is usually described in expanding coordinates. On the other hand, in SPS and RHIC-BES energies, Cartesian coordinates are used for effective description of hydrodynamic expansion. However, the difference of the coordinates  makes it difficult to describe the reactions in broad range of collision energy in a unified manner.
In this study, we propose to use the Milne coordinates even at lower collision energies by introducing a dynamic initialization model [1] towards unified description of the reactions at various collision energies. We first generate the initially produced particles by using an event generator, JAM [2]. Instead of putting initial conditions at fixed (proper-)time, fluids are gradually created during the colliding nuclei overlap with each other: We put energy, momentum, and baryon number of the particles into fluids through source terms in hydrodynamic equations at which these are produced. By solving hydrodynamic equations in one-dimensionally expanding coordinates, we describe space-time evolution of thermodynamic variables at RHIC-BES energies. By employing the first-order phase transition model as an equation of state, we describe the trajectories of the system in the energy density-baryon density plane and show the maximum baryon density gradually decreases with increasing collision energy.

Therefore, measurements of heavy-flavour production provide relevant information on the properties of the QGP. The QCD predicts that partons lose energy via collisions with the plasma constituents and via gluon radiation, and the magnitude of the energy loss depends on the mass and the color charge of the parton. In Pb--Pb collisions, a strong suppression of heavy-flavour yields has been observed at high $p_{T}$ with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions which is attributed to energy loss of heavy quarks in the QCD medium. Further information about the heavy-quark energy loss mechanism can be obtained by measuring the production of jets containing open charm and beauty particles.

Recently, a positive elliptic flow of open heavy-flavour particles has been observed in pA collisions and the possible formation of the QGP is under scrutiny.
In this poster, we show the measurements of jets with electrons from open heavy-flavour hadron decays in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=$5.02 TeV.

Poster Session,poster,Charm baryon production measurements in small systems with the ALICE experiment at the LHC,"Terrevoli, Cristina",University of Houston (US),United States,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are an effective tool to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Due to their large mass, they are produced during the early stages of the collisions in hard-scattering processes, on a time interval shorter than the QGP formation time. Thus, they experience the whole evolution of the system. The baryon-to-meson ratio is sensitive to the hadronisation mechanism. In particular, it is expected to be enhanced with respect to the proton-proton baseline if charm quarks hadronise via recombination with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. Measurements of charm-baryon production in small systems (pp and p--Pb collisions) provide the reference necessary for interpreting results in Pb--Pb collisions. In addition, in pp collisions, they allow to study the hadronisation of charm quarks, and allow testing QCD calculations. Measurements in p--Pb collisions are fundamental to disentangle cold nuclear matter effects from those deriving from the presence of the QGP.

We present here continuum extrapolated results for all second order and some of the fourth order cumulants of net baryon-number, strangeness  and electric charge fluctuations as well as their cross-correlations obtained by the HotQCD collaboration. As the chemical freeze-out temperature  at LHC is found to be close to the pseudo-critical temperature for the QCD chiral transition these cumulants potentially probe remnants of critical behavior in the crossover region.

The combination of the Ring-Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH) and the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) provide a good electron identification over the whole momentum range and especially for the study of thermal radiation into dielectrons at intermediate masses the electron identification capabilities of the TRD are crucial.

Such measurements are challenging, however, due to the presence of complex, uncorrelated background to the jet signal, and the need to minimize biases in the selected jet population imposed by background suppression techniques.

In this contribution, we present an approach to measure jets using the semi-inclusive distribution of charged jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\rm T}$ charged hadron trigger in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02 TeV, with emphasis on the region of low recoil jet $p_{\rm T}$ by taking the advantages of the high statistics collected with ALICE. The semi-inclusive recoil jet measurement provides precise, data-driven suppression of the large uncorrelated background and uniquely enables the exploration of medium-induced modification of jet production over wide phase space, including low $p_{\rm T}$ for large jet resolution parameter $R$.

Poster Session,poster,Photons associated with jets in p-p and A-A collisions,"Sirimanna for JETSCAPE Collaboration, Chathuranga",Wayne State University,Unknown,"Jet modification is now understood to be a multistage effect: a parton produced in a high virtuality initial state, radiates a multitude of partons, giving way to a variety of lower virtuality stages. In the lower virtuality stage, higher energy partons are weakly coupled with the medium and continue to scatter and radiate whereas lower energy partons are strongly coupled with the medium and will eventually thermalize. Hadrons produced in the fragmentation from these partons are clustered within jets. Modeling of these multistage effects involves several parameters: The coupling in the medium, the scales where the shower transitions from one stage to the next, and the parameters of hadronization. 


We consider a set of these parameters which have been tuned to successfully describe a variety of jet based data, such as the nuclear modification factors of leading hadrons and jets, the intra-jet fragmentation function and the jet shape, and subject this model to a parameter free validation by calculating the photon production from these in-medium jets. Quarks inside jets can radiate photons along with gluons. Photons are also produced in the hard scattering, via the quark-gluon Compton scattering process. In this work, we study the correlation of photons with jets in p-p and A-A collisions. Photon radiation from the hard scattering, from both the large and small virtuality phases, along with radiation from a PYTHIA based hadronization model are included in this analysis. We focus on the photon jet transverse momentum and angular balance. The calculations of photon production from each stage are calculated in close analogy to gluon radiation, with the exact same approximations, i.e., no new parameters are introduced or tuned either in the p-p or A-A collisions. The level of agreement with experimental data provides an independent verification of the multi-stage theory of jet modification.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chathuranga', 'last_name': 'Sirimanna for JETSCAPE Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Sirimanna for JETSCAPE Collaboration, Chathuranga', 'id': '4603192', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': 'eb37a4a5725575160bf9e716f4bac0fe', 'db_id': 4603192, 'person_id': 4588908}"
Poster Session,poster,Separating quark and gluon jet distributions in heavy ions,"Turner, Andrew",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Current measurements of the modification of jets in the quark–gluon plasma necessarily average over the quark–gluon composition of the jets in the sample. This introduces substantial complications in measuring differences of energy loss and modification between quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets. Additionally, even in the absence of jet modification, a modified quark–gluon fraction of jets in heavy-ion collisions could give rise to a substantial apparent modification arising just from differences between the production properties of quark- and gluon-initiated jets. We demonstrate a fully data-driven method for separating contributions to jet observables coming from quark- and gluon-initiated jets using a statistical technique called topic modeling. Assuming that jet observable distributions are a mixture of underlying quark and gluon distributions enables us to extract those distributions and their relative fractions from dijet and photon+jet samples. As a proof of concept, we extract the fractions of quark- and gluon-initiated jets as a function of $p_T$ and separately compute $R_{A A}$ for quark and gluon jets. We furthermore use this method to distinguish between modification of an observable that arises from modification of the quark–gluon fraction versus modification of that observable individually for either quark or gluon jets. We show that this distinction is of central importance to even qualitative interpretations of jet modification observables in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Turner', 'fullName': 'Turner, Andrew', 'id': '4578807', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': '10eed43fd5908f8e0bbe0fc913b405e9', 'db_id': 4578807, 'person_id': 4586073}"

Previous measurements in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions by STAR indicated a positive $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$ slope and, in central and peripheral collisions, a negative triangular flow $\Delta v_{3}(A_{\rm ch})$ slope. Since only backgrounds contribute to the latter, the results disfavor a pure background scenario for the $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$ slope.

We show in this poster, however, that including all charged particles as reference in the Q-cumulant flow method automatically introduces a trivial linear term in $v_{n}(A_{\rm ch})$ if non-flow correlations differ between same-sign and opposite-sign particle pairs. This contributed artificial slopes to the previous $\Delta v_{n} (A_{\rm ch})$ measurements. After eliminating this non-flow artifact, the $\Delta v_{2}(A_{\rm ch})$ and $\Delta v_{3}(A_{\rm ch})$ slopes, normalized by the respective $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ magnitudes, are consistent with each other within errors. The present error on the $\Delta v_{3}(A_{\rm ch})$ slope is relatively large: the average normalized $\Delta v_{3}(A_{\rm ch})$ slope in $0-80\%$ centrality is about 2.2$\sigma$ above zero, and that in $20-60\%$ is about 1.5$\sigma$ above zero.

Poster Session,poster,Kinetics  and hydrodynamics close to the chiral limit,"Teaney, Derek",Stony Brook University,USA,"First, we recall that close to the chiral limit, and below the critical temperature, the long wavelength effective theory of QCD is not ordinary hydrodynamics, but SU(2)xSU(2) superfluid hydrodynamics (Son 2000). In this theory the usual hydrodynamic variables such as energy are momentum are augmented by long wavelength pions.  When the pion is massive, the effective theory reduces to normal hydrodynamics at large distances, but is described by the superfluid theory at short distances. Using techniques developed by Akamatsu et al (Akamatsu 2017), we integrate out the superfluid modes to determine how the transport coefficients of QCD such as the bulk viscosity depend on the pion mass below the critical temperature. These expressions are given by the dissipative parameters  in the superfluid theory.  We show how to compute these parameters in chiral perturbation theory using the associated chiral kinetic theory.

Poster Session,poster,Sensitivity to detect ultra-intense magnetic field in Pb-Pb collisions via dimuon polarization measurement at the ALICE experiment,"Osako, Takumi",Hiroshima University (JP),Japan,"In non-central nucleus-nucleus collisions, an ultra-intense magnetic field reaching 10^15 [Tesla] is generated. Many interesting phenomena such as non-linear QED and Chiral Magnetic Effect are expected to be induced under the field. Nucleus-nucleus collisions are the only one way to generate such a field and to study the field-induced phenomena experimentally.
 Di-leptons from virtual photons are a unique tool for probing such an ultra-intense magnetic field because virtual photons should decay into di-leptons with nonuniform decay planes with respect to the field due to the field-induced birefringence in vacuum. 
 To get more precise data, ALICE will install a new detector “Muon Forward Tracker (MFT)” in front of hadron absorber of Muon Spectrometer. MFT allows us to approach more accurate information about vertex of dimuons. This is expected to reduce  background muons mainly from charged pions or kaons.

We show that for both deformed and spherical colliding species, there are large fluctuations in the deformation that emerge event by event. We characterize these deformations with the ratio of the largest and smallest eigenvalues ($\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_3$) of the covariance matrix for the coordinates of the colliding nucleons. The second order initial-state eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$, shows a strong correlation with  fluctuations of the ratio $\lambda_1/\lambda_3$ for ultra central collisions; the conditional mean $E(\varepsilon_2|(\lambda_1/\lambda_3)_1+(\lambda_1/\lambda_3)_2)$ varies by O(100\%) for 0-1\% Pb+Pb collisions. However, the number of participants, as well as the higher-order eccentricities, are unmodified. We further show, via acoustic scaling, that for constrained values of $\lambda_1/\lambda_3$, $v_n/\varepsilon_n$ for ultra-central collisions, scale in the same way as for mid-central and peripheral collisions for the wealth of differential $v_n$ measurements in ultra-central collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peifeng', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Peifeng', 'id': '4578909', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': 'c1605ae2abd9a90b40e6ad1a7917abea', 'db_id': 4578909, 'person_id': 4586500}"
Poster Session,poster,Production of $J/\psi$ meson in jets at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE,"Wu, Yitao",University of Science and  Technology of China (CN),China,"The production of quarkonia in hadron-hadron collisions occurs at the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of QCD, resulting in a rich phenomenology that remains far from being fully understood. $J/\psi$ hadronization dynamics can be studied by measuring the $p_{T}$ fraction, $z \equiv p_{T,J/\psi} / p_{T,jet}$, carried by the $J/\psi$ meson detected inside a jet. The distribution of this quantity, also called fragmentation function, gives us an opportunity to investigate the dominant subprocesses responsible for $J/\psi$ production. In addition, the production of non-prompt $J/\psi$, coming from b hadron decays, inside a jet should be sensitive to the fragmentation functions of quarks and gluons into b hadrons. The fragmentation of high $p_{T}$ jets containing a $J/\psi$ meson was measured in pp collisions by LHCb and CMS Collaborations, respectively. The results surprisingly show that non-prompt $J/\psi$ in jets are well described by models, but that prompt $J/\psi$ tend to be produced at much lower $z$ than the model predicted.

In this contribution, we present the measurements of the fragmentation of jets into $J/\psi$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the data collected by ALICE，with the $J/\psi$ being measured at mid-rapidity in the di-electron decay channel by the central barrel detectors. Prompt and non-prompt components will be separated using the pseudo-proper decay length.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yitao', 'last_name': 'Wu', 'fullName': 'Wu, Yitao', 'id': '4554211', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and  Technology of China (CN)', 'emailHash': '72ab3a6f3f3621097593f6c0d827cf45', 'db_id': 4554211, 'person_id': 4586497}"

Poster Session,poster,Smallest QCD Droplet for Hydrodynamic Response via Gubser Flow,"Taghavi, Seyed Farid",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Germany,"Over the past years, the observed features in the collisions of small systems which resemble collective flow patterns, are under intense debates. A relevant question is to what extent these observations are related to the real collective evolution of the medium, and if this is the case, the related question is what is the smallest system size which can still accommodate collective behaviour. The present talk attempts to shed new light on these non-trivial questions. Specifically, we address the following problem: what is the smallest system consistent with hydrodynamic equations and with hydrodynamization time $\tau_\text{hyd} \, T \sim 1$? In order to solve, we employ the Gubser solution as a toy model to perceive the consistency between the hydrodynamization time and the system size. We show that, up to a factor of the order of unity, the rms radius of the system, $\sigma_\text{rms}$, cannot be smaller than the inverse of the square root of the total energy in the transverse plane, $\epsilon_\text{tot}^{1/2}$. According to our simple model, we find that hydrodynamic is applicable for the core of the systems with size $\sigma_\text{rms}\sim 0.5\;$ fm corresponds to the  multiplicity around two particles per unit  rapidity. However, a large fraction of particles are emitted from the corona part (hadron gas at the tail of the fireball) for such system. On the other hand, for a system with the same size, the events with multiplicity per unit rapidity above 20 are dominated with particles from the core with strong flow signal. Using perturbation on top of Gubser flow, we  discuss about the hydrodynamic response of an elliptic initial energy density in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Seyed Farid', 'last_name': 'Taghavi', 'fullName': 'Taghavi, Seyed Farid', 'id': '4578917', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '02781c1501ef04b6ae1188523b7565af', 'db_id': 4578917, 'person_id': 4583987}"

Poster Session,poster,Thermal production of Sexaquarks in Heavy Ion Collisions,"Kabana, Sonja",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),France,"Sexaquarks are a hypothetical low mass, small radius uuddss dibaryon which has been proposed recently and especially as a candidate for Dark Matter [1]. The low mass region below 2 GeV escapes upper limits set from experiments which have searched for the uuddss dibaryon and did not find it [1].

Depending on its mass, such state may be absolutely stable or almost stable with decay rate of the order of the lifetime of the Universe therefore making it a possible DarK Matter candidate [1].

Even though not everyone agrees [2] its possible cosmological implications as DM candidate cannot be excluded and it has been recently searched in the BaBar experiment [3[. 

Its production in heavy ion collisions is expected to have a larger rate as compared to its production via the decay $\Upsilon \rightarrow S \overline{\Lambda} \overline{\Lambda}  $ which is assumed in [3], due to new production modes that open up in heavy ion collisions at high energies namely through parton coalescence and/or thermal production, and the avoidance of requiring a low multiplicity exclusive final state.


We use a model which has very successfully described hadron and nuclei production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC [4], in order to estimate the thermal production rate of Sexaquarks with characteristics such as discussed previously rendering them DM candidates. The model has been extended by new calculations [5] allowing solid estimates for 6 quark states. 

We show first results on a study of the variation of the Sexaquark production rates with mass, radius and temperature and chemical potentials assumed and their ratio to hadrons and nuclei and discuss the 

interdependences and their consequences.

These estimates are important for future experimental searches and enrich theoretical estimates in the multiquark sector.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation dynamics near the QCD critical point,"Du, Lipei",The Ohio State University,USA,"Near the QCD critical point (CP), critically slow processes can invalidate the conventional (dissipative) hydrodynamic description, which simply integrates out all non-hydrodynamic modes. We explore the critical dynamics near the QCD CP with the novel Hydro+ framework [1] which extends the conventional hydrodynamic description by coupling it to additional explicitly evolving slow modes. Their slow relaxation is controlled by the correlation length in the critical region, which is independent from the density inhomogeneities of the QCD matter that control the evolution of the hydrodynamic quantities. In this presentation we study the evolution of a single critical slow mode on top of a simplified matter background with non-zero net baryon density undergoing Gubser flow [2], as a function of the slow mode's wave number and the correlation length. We also discuss how the non-equilibrium slow mode affects the bulk properties of the matter, such as the pressure and entropy density. We find that over a wide range of wave numbers the non-equilibrium effects of the slow mode are dominatingly driven by the fluid expansion rather than by critical slowing-down. Last but not least we explore the critical fluctuation dynamics in systems of various sizes and at different collision energies. As one of the first studies based on Hydro+, this work provides guidance to future more realistic, fully (3+1)-dimensional simulations aiming at locating the QCD CP.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ directed flow using KFParticle in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV from STAR,"Ju, Xinyue",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Charm quarks, owing to their large mass, are predominantly created through initial hard scatterings in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and thus are ideal probes to study early time dynamics of these collisions. Recent results from STAR show that the slope of $D^{0}$ mesons directed flow ($v_{1}$) versus rapidity is about 25 times larger than that of charged kaons, providing important constraints on the initial geometry and charm quark transport in the QGP. It has also been predicted that the transient electromagnetic field generated at early time can induce a difference between the $v_{1}$ of charm and anti-charm quarks, and the magnitude of this difference can be much larger than those of light-flavor hadrons due to the early formation of charm quarks.

In this poster, we will present a new measurement of the directed flow for $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using data collected with the HeavyFlavor Tracker during the 2014 RHIC run. The $D^{0}$ ($\overline{D^{0}}$) mesons are reconstructed by an algorithm based on the Kalman Filter (KF Particle Finder package), which provides estimation of not only the tracking parameters themselves but also the corresponding covariance matrix as well. By using such additional information in the $D^{0}$ reconstruction, the signal significance is improved considerably. The $D^{0}$ and $\overline{D^{0}}$ meson $v_{1}$ and their difference will be presented as a function of rapidity and $p_{T}$, and compared with the results for light-flavor hadrons.

Poster Session,poster,DREENA framework as a multipurpose tool for QGP tomography,"Zigic, Dusan",Institute of Physics Belgrade,Unknown,"DREENA framework is based on our dynamical energy loss formalism, which takes into account ﬁnite size, ﬁnite temperature QCD medium consisting of dynamical (moving) partons. Both radiative and collisional energy losses are calculated under the same theoretical framework in the dynamical energy loss formalism, which is applicable to both light and heavy ﬂavor observables. We generalized the formalism to the case of ﬁnite magnetic mass, running coupling, and towards removing widely used soft-gluon approximation. Importantly, DREENA provides a natural framework where temperature profile from any medium evolution can be straightforwardly implemented. We exploit this by implementing different state-of-the-art medium evolutions (both event-by-event hydrodynamics and kinetic transport theory) within DREENA framework. DREENA does not use free parameters, i.e. its only input is the temperature profile that comes directly from various hydrodynamic and kinetic theory models. This opens possibility to use DREENA on both light and heavy flavor to test and differentiate between different available QGP evolution models, including both large and smaller systems, making DREENA a multipurpose QGP tomography tool. Our results on these tests will be presented, which enables us to gain a better understanding of the bulk QGP medium created at RHIC and LHC. As a highlight, contrary to the existing models, which for full hydro evolution models lead to $v_2$ puzzle, with DREENA we surprisingly obtain a very good joint agreement between $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data. This well known puzzle therefore appears to be a consequence of a simplified energy loss commonly used by other models once a proper description of parton-medium interactions is used, $v_2$ puzzle is abolished. While a widely accepted paradigm is that proper medium evolution description dominates in explaining high $p_{\perp}$ data, this result strongly suggests that proper description of parton-medium interactions is much more important.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dusan', 'last_name': 'Zigic', 'fullName': 'Zigic, Dusan', 'id': '4578950', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics Belgrade', 'emailHash': '2b09c285d440328ce6359c7fb6415168', 'db_id': 4578950, 'person_id': 4586110}"
Poster Session,poster,Production of identified light flavour hadrons as a function of underlying event activity in pp collisions using the ALICE detector,"Matonoha, Oliver",Lund University (SE),SE,"Various recent measurements of high-multiplicity pp and p-A collisions at the LHC center-of-mass energies have revealed, surprisingly, that these small collision systems exhibit some of the quark-gluon plasma features, e.g. collective behaviour and strangeness enhancement, formerly thought to be achievable only in heavy-ion collisions. A promising method to narrow down the origin of this behaviour is to study the effect of Multi-Parton Interactions (MPIs). The underlying event (UE), which is the collection of particles not originating from the primary hard parton-parton scattering or the related fragmentation, is thought to be highly sensitive to the MPIs. To access the mean number of MPIs experimentally, it has been proposed to use the self-normalised charged particle density in the region transverse to a jet, $R_\mathrm{T} = N_\mathrm{ch}^\mathrm{trans} / \langle N_\mathrm{ch}^\mathrm{trans} \rangle$, as it effectively disentangles the soft processes of interest from the hard component.

In this contribution, we report on the $\pi$, $p$, $K$, $\phi$, $\Lambda$, and $\Xi$ transverse momentum spectra—covering both mesons and baryons, as well as non-strange and strange hadrons—as a function of $R_\mathrm{T}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$TeV measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC.

Poster Session,poster,Background study of the CME-related correlations in heavy-ion collisions within a multiphase transport mode,"Choudhury, Subikash",Fudan University,Unknown,"The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) manifests itself via a separation of electric charge along the direction of the magnetic field, produced by spectator protons in heavy-ion collisions. The experimental searches for the CME, based on the charge-dependent angular correlations [1] have, however, remained inconclusive till date, because the observed features of charge separation in data are also compatible with non-CME background sources. Recently, the CMS collaboration attempted to disambiguate the origin of charge separation by measuring charge-dependent angular correlations or $\gamma$-correlators with respect to second-order ($\Psi_{2}$) and third-order ($\Psi_{3}$) symmetry planes defined as $\gamma_{112}$ and $\gamma_{123}$ respectively, in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions [2]. The idea is that an equality is expected in $\frac{\Delta\gamma_{112}}{\Delta\delta \times v_{2}}$ ($\kappa_{112}$) and $\frac{\Delta\gamma_{123}}{\Delta\delta \times v_{3}}$ ($\kappa_{123}$), if the charge separations are dominated by non-CME backgrounds \cite{CMS_3p}. The CMS measurements indeed reveal such equality across light-ion and heavy-ion collision systems, suggesting the observed charge separation in data arises from non-CME background contributions to a large extent. However, the signals and backgrounds in data are so entangled that such an interpretation may be naive. Instead, non-CME background models could provide a testing ground to verify or falsify such relations. In this poster, we will present  results of different harmonics of $\gamma$-correlators calculated from a charge-conserved version of a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. In contrary to the CMS expectation, the AMPT model calculations show $(\kappa_{132} \approx 1) < (\kappa_{112} \approx 1.3) < (\kappa_{123} \approx 2)$.

Poster Session,poster,System size dependence of direct photon production in large and small system collisions from PHENIX,"Novitzky, Norbert",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"The PHENIX experiment recently found a remarkably simple scaling law for the number of photons emitted in relativistic heavy ion collisions. When the direct-photon invariant yields are divided by $(dN_{ch}/d\eta)^{1.25}$, data from large systems falls onto a single curve in the low transverse momentum (""thermal"") region. What is remarkable is that this is true if $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ is varied by collision energy from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 to 200 GeV up to 2.76 TeV, by collision centrality, or size of the colliding ions down to about $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ of 20. Data from small systems suggests a rapid turn on of the scaling behavior over a rather narrow range in $dN_{ch}/d\eta$ between 5 to 20. While these findings could have many explanations, perhaps the most intriguing is that the bulk of the thermal photons are produced near the transition from QGP to hadron gas combined with an onset of QGP formation at low $dN_{ch}/d\eta$.

On the other hand, recently acquired wealth of high-$p_{\perp}$ experimental data paves the way to utilize the high-$p_{\perp}$ particles energy loss in exploring the initial stages. However, the results of such explorations are up to now either inconclusive or questionable. We here concentrate on high-$p_{\perp}$ $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ observables, and study the effects of four different commonly considered initial stages scenarios, which have the same temperature profile after - but differ in the temperature profiles before - thermalization. For the study, we use our recently developed DREENA framework, which is a fully optimized computational procedure in which our state-of-the-art dynamical energy loss is employed. Contrary to the common expectations, we surprisingly obtain that high-$p_{\perp}$ $v_2$ is insensitive to the initial stages of medium evolution, being unable to discriminate between different scenarios. On the other hand, $R_{AA}$ is notably sensitive to these conditions, strongly preferring later thermalization times and free streaming during the initial stages of QGP formation. Moreover, we also reconsider the validity of widely-used procedure of fitting the energy loss parameters for different initial-stage cases to reproduce the experimentally observed $R_{AA}$. We here find that the reported sensitivity of $v_2$ to different initial-stage scenarios is mainly an artifact of the $R_{AA}$ fitting, with no real physical process to support it. Therefore, such a procedure may lead to erroneous conclusions, masking the underlying nature of jet-medium interactions. Consequently, the simultaneous study of high-$p_{\perp}$ $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ is necessary for imposing reliable constraints on the initial stages.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bojana', 'last_name': 'Ilic (Blagojevic)', 'fullName': 'Ilic (Blagojevic), Bojana', 'id': '4578961', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics Belgrade', 'emailHash': '9858e8d1f6ee7b9d22b8329425b2a92c', 'db_id': 4578961, 'person_id': 4586111}"

\maketitle

ALICE has been designed to study the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions at LHC. Extensive efforts in the ALICE upgrade projects are currently being  made toward LHC-Run3 (2021-2024). The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), one of the new detectors, will be installed upstream of the hadron absorber in front of the Muon Spectrometer (MUON). The vertex information is smeared out with the present MUON setup due to multiple scattering occurring in this absorber. This prevents us from precisely measuring the track direction which plays a crucial role in determining the mass resolution especially in the low transverse momentum region. The chiral nature of the phase transition can be investigated via low mass vector meson measurements with superior mass resolution provided by MFT. The present uncertainty in the vertex region prevents us from distinguishing between charm and beauty, and between prompt and displaced J/$\psi$.\par
 The matching performance between MFT and MUON is therefore crucial to improve the dimuon mass resolution and reject muons from hadron decays in the hadron absorber. The matching efficiency is calculated including multiple scatterings in the hadron absorber simulated by Geant4. The measured charged particle multiplicity and a quality of muon tracks are carefully taken into account in the calculation. In this poster, we present the results of the evaluation of the muon track matching efficiency.

Poster Session,poster,Limitations of Principal Component Analysis in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Liu, Ziming",Peking University,Unknown,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a mathematical tool that can capture the most important information (variance) in data. Recently, CMS collaboration applied the PCA technique to analyze the data in Pb+Pb collisions, and a non-zero subleading mode has been extracted and interpreted as arising from subleading eccentricity [1][2]. In this talk, we study the performance of PCA method in the study of the factorization breaking effects of harmonic flow in two-particle correlation analysis [3]. We show that the choice of weighting factor in the orthogonality criteria, and $p_T$ range of the analysis, and even the statistical uncertainty of the input data could lead to significantly different results in the extracted single-particle flow modes. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the sensitivity of PCA procedure to these issues before one could attach any physics interpretation of the subleading flow modes obtained.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the sixth-order cumulant of net-proton multiplicity distributions from the STAR experiment,"Nonaka, Toshihiro",Univ. Tsukuba,UK,"Cumulants of conserved quantities are the powerful tools to study the QCD phase structure. According to the Lattice Gauge Theory calculations, at vanishing baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$) a ""smooth crossover"" for the transition from quark-gluon plasma to hadronic system occurs in heavy-ion collisions [1]. One of the possible experimental ways to search for the evidence is to analyze the higher-order cumulant ratios of net-baryon distributions from high-energy nuclear collisions. The sixth-order ($C_{6}$) to second-order ($C_{2}$) cumulant ratio of baryon number fluctuations is predicted to be negative at the freeze-out temperature if it is close to the chiral transition temperature [2]. Net-proton multiplicity distributions can be studied as a reasonable proxy for net-baryon distributions [3,4]. In this poster, we present the centrality dependence of net-proton $C_{6}/C_{2}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 54.4 and 200 GeV from a high statistics Au+Au collisions data set in the STAR experiment. The transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of $C_{6}/C_{2}$ for net-proton distributions will be also discussed.

Conversely, the three tracking detectors are read out in streaming mode, where data are pushed from the front-end and captured continuously.  Only streaming data overlapping with RHIC beam crossings that were triggered for the calorimeter readout are permanently stored.
Streaming readout is widely believed to be the readout method best suited for the detectors at a future Electron-Ion Collider.  A sPHENIX TPC prototype has successfully been read out with near-final readout electronics at the Fermilab test beam in streaming mode. The analysis of the streaming data is under way.

Poster Session,poster,Systematic Searches of CMW from Heavy-Ion Collisions at STAR,"Sergeeva, Maria",UCLA,USA,"The Chiral Magnetic Wave (CMW) was predicted to arise from the interplay of the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral separation effect, which can lead to the formation of electric quadrupole moment in heavy-ion collisions.

 In this poster, we will present the STAR measurements of the slope parameter ($r_{2}$) from different colliding systems: Au+Au at 200, 54.4 and 27 GeV, Cu+Cu and Cu+Au at 200 GeV. Two approaches, Q-Cumulant ($v_2 \{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$) and event-plane ($v_2(EP)$) methods, are used to measure $v_2$ of $\pi^{\pm}$ at low transverse momenta in order to evaluate the non-flow contributions in the $v_2$ measurement. $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2(EP)$ with pseudorapidity gaps can reduce the short-range non-flow contributions. $v_2\{4\}$ can suppress non-flow contributions and is believed to be more sensitive to the reaction plane (and hence the magnetic field).

Poster Session,poster,Viscous fluid dynamics for binary neutron-star mergers,"Noronha, Jorge",University of Sao Paulo,United States,"The recent detection of a binary neutron star merger using gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals marked the dawn of the multi-messenger astronomy era. Such events are expected to provide key information about the properties of matter at extreme densities and temperatures and, for many years, it was assumed that this system could be reasonably described as an ideal (i.e. inviscid) fluid coupled to Einstein’s equations. This was recently revisited by Alford et al. in [1] using state-of-the-art merger simulations which showed that damping of high-amplitude oscillations due to bulk viscosity is expected to play an important role in gravitational wave emission and, as such, this should be taken into account and thoroughly investigated in realistic merger simulations. However, viscous effects have not yet been included in merger simulations because this requires a formulation of relativistic fluid dynamics, including bulk viscosity, that is causal in the strong nonlinear regime probed by the mergers. This has been an open problem in the field since Israel and Stewart's seminal work in 1979. In this work we solve this problem and prove [2] that the Einstein-Israel-Stewart equations, describing the dynamics of a relativistic fluid with bulk viscosity and nonzero baryon charge dynamically coupled to gravity, are causal in the full nonlinear regime. We use an arbitrary equation of state and do not make any simplifying symmetry or near-equilibrium assumption, requiring only physically natural conditions on the fields. These results pave the way for the inclusion of bulk viscosity effects in simulations of gravitational-wave signals coming from neutron star mergers, which will provide key information about the novel out-of-equilibrium properties of highly dense QCD matter in neutron stars.

Poster Session,poster,The $J/\psi$ suppressions and chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Ahammed, Zubayer",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),India,"The charm quarks are mainly produced by primordial hard scatterings in the early stage of the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The produced charm quarks propagate through the dense QGP medium formed in such collisions and lose energy during their entire path of travel. The QGP is a statistical system of dynamic colour charges, it can also be characterised by stochastic chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations. These chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations in the QGP cause an energy gain of charm quarks of all momentum, significantly at the lower momentum limit. The motion of these charm quarks can be described by Langevin transport equations and the underlying evolving medium can be modeled by the (3 + 1)-D relativistic viscous hydrodynamics.

  In this contribution, we have studied the effect of the chromo-electromagnetic field fluctuations on $J/\psi$ suppression at RHIC and LHC energies. The nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) of $J/\psi$ have been calculated at RHIC and LHC energies by considering the effect of the field fluctuations. The results are compared with the experimentally measured $R_{AA}$ of $J/\psi$ by ALICE and CMS experiments at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} = 2.76 $ TeV and by PHENIX experiment at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} =  200$ GeV.

Poster Session,poster,Study of the charm quark production mechanisms through angular correlation of dielectrons in pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Franz Degenhardt, Hermann",Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR),Unknown,"The aim of relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created at high-enough temperatures and/or densities. For this purpose, heavy-quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are very useful probes for the characterization of the QGP. They are produced at the early stages of the collisions via initial hard scatterings and, therefore, they experience the full evolution of the system. However, to quantify the QGP effects it is first needed to understand the heavy-quark production in proton-proton collisions as a reference system and further in p-Pb collisions to subtract cold nuclear matter effects. In particular, the production mechanisms of heavy flavours can be studied through their angular correlations which is inherited by their decay products, such as electrons.

At leading order the heavy-flavour pair is created back to back through flavour creation. On the other hand, PYTHIA creates pairs also via higher order processes like flavour excitation and gluon splitting with different angular correlation functions. While gluon splitting produces pairs with small angles, flavour excitation processes produce pairs without preferred angular correlation. In this poster we present the current analysis of angular distribution functions between correlated heavy-flavour electron-positron pairs in proton-proton collisions at a centre of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV measured with the ALICE detector and the comparison with simulated mechanisms processes obtained by PYTHIA and POWHEG generators.

Poster Session,poster,Application of Principal Component Analysis on Collective Flow,"Song, Huichao",Peking U,Unknown,"Various flow observables, defined based on the Fourier decomposition, have provided valuable information on the initial state fluctuations, final state correlations and the QGP properties. In spite of the success of the flow measurements and the hydrodynamic descriptions, one essential question is why the Fourier expansion is a natural way to analyze the flow data. In this talk, I will address this question with one of the machine learning techniques, called the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In more details, we will investigate if a machine (unsupervised learning technique) could directly discover flow from the huge amount of data of the relativistic fluid systems without explicit instructions from human beings. 

After apply PCA to the raw data of hydrodynamic simulations, we found that the obtained PCA eigenvectors are similar to but not identical with the traditional Fourier bases. Correspondingly, the PCA defined flow harmonics vn are also similar to the traditional vn for n = 2 and 3, but largely deviated from the Fourier ones with n≥4 . A further study on the symmetric cumulants and the Pearson coefficients indicates that mode-coupling effects are reduced for these flow harmonics defined by PCA. Our work also demonstrated the hydrodynamic system is not highly non-linear as generally believed before, which should be reevaluated with such PCA bases for the flow definition.

Poster Session,poster,(Non-)Strange particle production at RHIC and LHC energies using HYDJET++,"Singh, Arpit",Banaras Hindu University,Unknown,"Recent experimental and theoretical obsevations suggest that production of (multi-)strange hadrons and charged hadrons in (non-)deformed nuclei is a complex physical process. The properties of charged hadrons produced in deformed nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC energies contradict many of the theoretical models result including two-component Monte Carlo Glauber model. Unlike light hadrons, the production mechanism of (multi-)strange hadrons is quite involved as they do not simply produce according to their statistical weights as described in grand canonical ensemble. In recent past, several efforts have been made to provide a mechanism for (non-)strange hadron production in symmetric and asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments. However, an unified theoretical or simulation model which reproduce the multiplicity distribution of (multi-)strange hadrons alongwith multiplicity of charged hadrons is still lacking. In this article, we have used HYDJET++ model to calculate multiplicity distribution of (non-)strange hadrons with various control parameter in symmetric collision of (non-)deformed nuclei at RHIC and LHC energies. We have calculated the pseudorapidity distribution, transverse momentum distribution and elliptic flow distribution of charged hadrons with different control parameters.We observed that HYDJET++ along with certain parameters can adequately provide a unified model for light as well as strange hadron production in various type of collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arpit', 'last_name': 'Singh', 'fullName': 'Singh, Arpit', 'id': '4554382', 'affiliation': 'Banaras Hindu University', 'emailHash': '712b2d160a5f1d340c290daffb4183a8', 'db_id': 4554382, 'person_id': 4587335}"

The energy scan program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in BNL or at CERNs' Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) have presented evidence that are typical of the enhanced strangeness production via their measurements of kaon to pion ratios which exhibit a non-monotonic energy dependence. Similar indication was also observed in the baryon sector based on the measurements of anti-lambda to anti-proton ratio as a function of beam energy. Later it was thought to be a cleaner probe because their quark compositions have only anti-quarks, which are produced in the reaction and not transported. More-over their high mass resonance contributions are less. However, the final yields of both anti-lambda and anti-proton are sensitive to the baryon-antibaryon (B$\bar{B}$) annihilation in hadronic rescatterings phase. In this work, we present an investigation of the beam energy dependence of $\bar\Lambda$ over $\bar{p}$ ratio within a hadronic transport model, UrQMD and observe that the final state yields of $\bar\Lambda$ and $\bar{p}$ are strongly influenced by B$\bar{B}$ annihilation channel and has a significant impact of on the $\bar\Lambda$ to $\bar{p}$ ratio. In fact, the trend of $\bar\Lambda$ to $\bar{p}$ ratio enhancement in data can be qualitatively described within the UrQMD model because the spectral shapes of $\bar\Lambda$ and $\bar{p}$ are modified differently due to different annihilation cross sections of these two species. This suggests that the observed features of beam energy dependence of $\bar\Lambda$ to $\bar{p}$ ratio enhancement may not relate to the strangeness enhancement unambiguously.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ekata', 'last_name': 'Nandy', 'fullName': 'Nandy, Ekata', 'id': '4554359', 'affiliation': 'Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,VECC,Kolkata', 'emailHash': '8731bc96da5e3f80f2ecb6e7d86b6ca9', 'db_id': 4554359, 'person_id': 4587425}"

Jet observables are a particularly useful probe of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions since the hard scatted partons that fragment into final state jets are strongly “quenched”, losing energy to the medium as they traverse it.  To answer fundamental questions about the physics of this process, we need to characterize the medium induced modification of the jet fragmentation pattern and the correlation of the lost energy with the jet axis.

Poster Session,poster,Azimuthal anisotropy of heavy-flavour decay electrons in p-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Correia Zanoli, Henrique Jose",Utrecht University (NL),Unknown,"Two-particle angular correlations are used to investigate properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They are sensitive to different effects of the evolution of the collision, such as collective effects, initial conditions and jet properties.


In small systems (such as pp or p--A collisions), an unexpected double-ridge structure has been observed in the two-particle angular correlations of charged hadrons. The double-ridge is similar to the one observed in A--A collisions, where the physical origin is usually credited to collective behaviour. This structure can be quantified using a Fourier decomposition of the $\Delta \varphi$ distribution. These Fourier coefficients can be factorized to single-particle $v_n$ coefficients, related to the azimuthal distribution of the particles. The interpretation of this phenomena in small system is still in debate, especially concerning the role of hydrodynamics and initial conditions. Extending this measurement to heavy-flavour particles could provide further insight on the initial and final-state origin of the anisotropies in these collision systems.


In this poster, the results of the heavy-flavour hadron decay electron $v_2$ in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented. The measurement was performed with ALICE at mid-rapidity ($|\eta| < 0.8$). The $v_2$ was obtained by calculating two-particle correlations between heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons and unidentified charged particles in high-multiplicity collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation-dissipation relation and fluctuation theorem for causal hydrodynamic fluctuations,"Murase, Koichi",Sophia University,Unknown,"Recently physics of thermal fluctuations of hydrodynamic fields, namely the hydrodynamic fluctuations, in high-energy nuclear collisions are actively discussed. In this talk I will discuss new modification terms [1] in fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), which determines the power of hydrodynamic noise fields, and also discuss its importance in the point of view the fluctuation theorem [2], which is a relation of the entropy production probability known in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

The effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on heavy-ion observables such as flow coefficients and longitudinal decorrelation $r_n(\eta_a, \eta_b)$ are recently analyzed in event-by-event simulations by dynamical models [3-6]. Also the thermal fluctuations near the critical point also play an important role in the critical dynamics. In this sense the hydrodynamic fluctuations in dynamical models are becoming more and more important. The FDR used in dynamical models is normally obtained in the global equilibrium. However, in expanding systems such as matter created in the nuclear collisions, the FDR is non-trivial. I obtain new modification terms to the FDR in the second-order causal dissipative hydrodynamics by considering the linear-response in non-static and inhomogeneous backgrounds. I discuss its relation to the steady-state fluctuation theorem. Also, by performing the numerical simulations of non-linear relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics assuming the Bjorken flow, I investigate the non-linear fluctuation effects to the fluctuation theorem.

Poster Session,poster,Local Lambda polarization and feed-down effect in heavy-ion collisions,"Xia, Xiao-Liang",Fudan University,Unknown,"Spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperon has been observed by STAR in non-central heavy-ion collisions [1,2,3]. Among these measurements, the global polarization reflects the bulk-averaged value of the vorticity, while the local polarization probes more detailed structure of the vorticity field.

We have studied the $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. The results show that:

1. The value of global polarization decreases with increasing collision energy [4]. This is in agreement with the measurement [1,2].
2. Because of the non-uniform transverse expansion of the fireball, it can produce transverse vorticity circling the beam direction and further generate transverse local polarization [5].
3. The result for the longitudinal local polarization [5] is consistent with the hydrodynamic calculation. However, these calculations have an opposite sign comparing to the experiment measurement [3].

To resolve this sign puzzle, we further study the effect of feed-down decay on local $\Lambda$ polarization [6]. We develop a theoretical framework to study how spin polarization is transferred from parent to daughter particle in two-body decay. After Monte-Carlo simulation, we find that the feed-down effect suppresses the primordial $\Lambda$ polarization, but can not flip the sign.

Poster Session,poster,Study on QGP bulk property in small system,"Nakamura, Kouki",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Utilizing our developed relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code [1] to analysis of proton-lead and lead-lead collisions at the LHC [2], we investigate applicability of hydrodynamics, QGP bulk property and viscosities effects at hadronization process. Here we focus on one-particle distributions such as rapidity distributions and particle identified transverse momentum spectra and elliptic flows. 
 We show that relativistic viscous hydrodynamics works for explanation of experimental data of central and mid-central proton-lead collisions. Furthermore, we find that modification of particle distribution due to bulk viscosity at hadronization process affects determination of value of bulk viscosity of QGP. For example, extracted values of bulk viscosities of QGP are much smaller than those of our previous study where bulk viscosity effect at hadronization process is neglected [3]. 
 According to our results of mean transverse momentum, effect of final state interactions in the small system is smaller than that in the large system. It indicates that produced particles in the small system keep information of the QGP fluid in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We also discuss thermalizeation of systems from comparison between small and large systems.

Poster Session,poster,Towards understanding the origin of collectivity in small systems: a study of the interplay between initial-state momentum anisotropy and final-state geometry response,"Nie, Maowu",Shandong University (SDU),Unknown,"The origin of long-range collective azimuthal correlations in small-system collisions is an area of intense research in the heavy ion community. To disentangle between collectivity associated with initial-state intrinsic momentum anisotropy and the collectivity arising as a final-state response to the collision geometry, we studied the development of collectivity in 5.02 TeV and 0.2 TeV $p$+Pb collisions with both initial-state and final-state effects included in a transport model AMPT. We find that the initial momentum anisotropy may not be fully isotropized through parton interactions, and the final-state partonic harmonic flow $v_n$ in general are correlated with both the initial momentum anisotropy and the shape of the collision geometry. The initial momentum anisotropy also influences the event by event fluctuation of $v_n$. Therefore the mere evidence of geometry response of the collective flow does not rule out the presence of large contributions from the initial state[1].

We also compared the results between 5.02 TeV and 0.2 TeV[2], which have the same Glauber geometry but different parton densities (each nucleon produces three times more particles at 5.02 TeV than 0.2 TeV). We found that results are NOT the same for the same $N_{part}$ nor for the same $N_{ch}$, suggesting a non-trivial influence of different particle production at the two energies. We discuss the prospect of disentangling the non-equilibrium transport or near-equilibrium hydrodynamics in future small system run ($p$+A and O+O) at RHIC and the LHC.

Measurements from STAR at 7.7 and 11.5 GeV have seen $\phi$ $v_2$ at highest transverse momentum close to zero [5] and $\phi$ directed flow, $v_1$, is consistent with zero [6] with conclusions limited by statistics. On the other hand, the closeness of $\phi$ mass to the nucleon and its $s$ $\bar{s}$ constituent quarks makes them suitable to test the deviation of net-nucleon and net-meson $v_1$ at energies below 7.7 GeV where could be a breakdown of the assumption that $s$ and $\bar{s}$ quarks have the same flow [6].

It makes possible to estimate the muon pass length in each longitudinal section with the subsequent correction of energy depositions in the scintillators. The developed method takes into account more accurately the muon energy deposition and improves the precision of the energy calibration.
The short (about 40 nsec) PSD analog signals from photodetectors in each longitudinal section will be digitized by 125 MS/s sampling ADCs. To improve the precision of the PSD energy calibration, the procedure of signal waveform fitting based on the Prony least squares method was developed. This method represents the waveform as a linear combination of exponential functions and allows the measurement of signal amplitude with high accuracy. The fit of the signals with a predefined function permits to discriminate the small muon signals from the electronic noises of comparable amplitudes.

Poster Session,poster,Sensitivity analysis of the chiral magnetic effect observables using a multiphase transport model,"Huang, Ling",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics,Unknown,"The chiral magnetic effect is a good observable to investigate the topological and electromagnetic properties of the QGP. But the $\gamma$ correlator, a common observable used to detect the CME, contains both contribution from the CME and its background. This observable can not identify the CME from its background. Recently, a new observable of $R_{\Psi_{m}}$ has been proposed[1-4], which is expected to distinguish the CME from the background. We apply mixing particles method and shuffling particles method to calculate $R_{\Psi_{m}}$ using a multiphase transport model without or with a percentage of CME-induced charge separation[5,6]. From the results, we found that the shape of final $R_{\Psi_{2}}$ distribution is flat for the case without CME[7], but concave for that with some amount of the CME. By comparing the responses of $R_{\Psi_{2}}$ and $\gamma$ to the strength of the CME, we found that the CME signal can survive only when the initial charge separation percentage is large enough (more than $5\%$), which indicates a nonlinear sensitivity of these observables to the CME due to strong final state interactions.

Poster Session,poster,Quark-hadron continuity beyond Ginzburg-Landau paradigm,"Hirono, Yuji",Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics,United States,"Quark-hadron continuity [1] is a scenario that the hadronic matter is continuously connected to a color superconducting phase without phase transitions as the baryon chemical potential increases. This scenario is based on the fact that the two phases have the same symmetry breaking pattern, in the spirit of Landau's classification of phases. When we consider quantum phases of matter, it is known that the classification based on symmetry is insufficient: it fails to detect so-called topological orders. We address the question whether this continuity is true as quantum phases of matter, which requires the treatment beyond Ginzburg-Landau description [2,3]. 
To examine the topological nature of color superconductor, we study the low-energy theory describing U(1) Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons and vortices of the color-flavor locked phase, and discuss the fate of emergent higher-form symmetries. The theory has the form of a topological BF theory coupled to NG bosons, and fractional statistics of test quarks and vortices arises as a result of an emergent Z3 two-form symmetry. We find that the two-form symmetry is not spontaneously broken, indicating that quark-hadron continuity is still a consistent scenario.

Poster Session,poster,GLISSANDO 3: the known software tool with new possibilities,"Stefanek, Grzegorz",Jan Kochanowski University (PL),Poland,"Fluctuations in physics observables and flow effects in heavy-ion collisions have been topics of particularly interest in recent years as they may provide important signals regarding the formation of quark-gluon plasma, the existence  of a critical point and the evolution of the system. Moreover, the fluctuations and correlations measured in the final stage have their sources at least partly  in the initial fluctuations and the initial-state geometry provided the initial effects are not largely altered by the intermediate evolution of the system.   GLISSANDO is a versatile Monte-Carlo generator for Glauber-like models of the initial stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  The current version incorporates the wounded parton model and, within this model, one can study nucleon substructure fluctuation effects. The code also includes the possibility of investigating collisions of light nuclei as 3He and 3H, or the alpha-clustered 7Be,9Be,12C,16O, where the deformation of the intrisic wave function influences the transverse shape of the initial state. The code can provide output in the format containing the event-by-event source location, which may be further used in modeling the intermediate evolution phase with hydrodynamics or transport models.   

The distributions which illustrate the new features implemented in GLISSANDO 3  will be presented.

It is predicted that the local density fluctuations near critical point exhibit power-law scaling, which can be probed with a intermittency analysis of the scaled factorial moments ($F_{q}$) for charged particles. The power-law behavior of $q^{th}$ order scaled factorial moments can be expressed as: $F_{q}\sim (M^{2})^{\phi_{q}}$, where $M^{2}$ is the number of equally sized cells in momentum space, and $\phi_{q}$ is the intermittency index. The scaling exponent, $\nu$, related to the critical component can be derived from the ratio, $\phi_{q}/\phi_{2}$. The  energy dependence of $\nu$ could be used to search for the signature of the QCD critical point.

Recently, significant enhancements of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair and J/$\psi$ production at very low transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) were observed by the STAR [1, 2] and ALICE [3] collaborations in peripheral hadronic A+A collisions. The excess yields exhibit a much weaker centrality dependence compared to the expectation for hadronic production, and are consistent with coherent photon-photon and photon-nucleus interactions. The measured $p_{T}$ broadening for $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs may indicate the existence of a strong magnetic field in the medium. Measurements with $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs provide a complementary channel to investigate these phenomena.

In 2014 and 2016, the STAR experiment at RHIC recorded large samples of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV with di-muon triggers utilizing the Muon Telescope Detector.

We call this QLBT model, in which the in-medium scatterings of heavy quarks are described using the linear Boltzmann transport that includes both elastic and inelastic energy loss of heavy quarks within the perturbative QCD framework. The temperature dependences of the quasi-particle masses, as well as the strong coupling parameter among them, are systematically extracted from two different sets of lattice EOS (Hot QCD and Wuppertal­-Budapest) with a Bayesian statistical analysis method. With all model parameters fixed by the lattice QCD calculations, QLBT naturally provides a good description of the nuclear modification factors and elliptic flow coefficients of heavy mesons at high transverse momenta.

Poster Session,poster,Study of (multi-)strange particle production in jets and two-particle correlations with high-$p_{\rm T}$ ${\rm V}^{0}$ particles in small collision systems with ALICE at the LHC,"Cui, Pengyao",Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN),China,"Recent ALICE results on the yield of strange particles in pp and p-Pb collisions reveal the possibility that similar strange quark production mechanisms could be present in all collision systems. The $p_{\rm T}$-dependent baryon-to-meson yield ratio in hadronic and nuclear collisions is sensitive to the collective expansion of the system, the partonic recombination into hadrons, the jet fragmentation and hadronization.

In this work, we explore the connection between (multi-)strange hadron yields enhancement and jet production via the measurement of the $p_{\rm T}$-differential spectrum of strange and multi-strange particles (${\rm K}_{\rm S}^{0}$,  $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$ and $\Xi$) within jets and in the underlying event, in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV, respectively.

Poster Session,poster,The HADES RICH upgrade within the FAIR Phase-0 program*,"Weber, Adrian Amatus",Justus-Liebig-University Giessen,Unknown,"The High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) is measuring properties of baryonic matter at moderate temperatures in A+A collisions at the SIS18 accelerator at GSI, Darmstadt. After a long shutdown of SIS18 to prepare for the future FAIR facility, beamtimes have been resumed within the FAIR Phase-0 program in March 2019.
Meanwhile, the HADES experiment has undergone several upgrades. In this presentation the successful upgrade of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH) with MAPMTs will be reported as well as first performance studies from the beamtime in March 2019. This success is also an important step towards the realization of the CBM-RICH detector in due time for the start of  the SIS100 physics program.

The RICH detector of the HADES experiment measured for nearly two decades with a CsI photocathode based readout which now has been replaced with modern Hamamatsu H12700 MAPMTs that have been purchased already for the CBM-RICH detector. The complete readout chain of the subdetector was replaced by newly developed DiRICH frontend boards.  The update to a MAPMT based readout has been a big steps to excellent timing property, high quantum efficiency, fine pixel granularity and low dark noise. As key features the new readout chain can work at higher rates than before and also provided a substantial gain in photoelectrons per ring.

The updated HADES RICH MAPMT plane is build up with 428 H12700 MAPMTs where the inner part of the plane is coated with a wavelength shifter to increase the number of photons per ring. The readout electronics is based on the TrbNet system and uses FPGA based TDCs for signal measurements. Each of the 856 DiRICH frontend boards measures on 32 channels - half a MAPMT – and provides a prepacked dataflow.
As a second central improvement the radiator gas of the HADES RICH was exchanged from C4F10 to C4H10 which reduced the amount of scintillation light. As measured in previous tests the old CaF2 window, a separator between the old radiator and the photocathode volume, was unmounted to reduce the scintillation light in the detector by orders of magnitudes.

The combination of the new TrbNet readout, new MAPMTs, temperature measurements and the change of the radiator gas brought the HADES RICH upgrade to a full success. The HADES RICH detector participated with unprecedented performance in the HADES beamtime in March 2019 recording Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV.

These measurements have different trigger bias, in terms of both the path-length distribution and quark/gluon mix of the recoil jet population, and their corrected recoil spectra are compared. We also report the recoil jet azimuthal distribution relative to the $\pi^0$ trigger axis, and search for medium-induced modifications. Such modifications may probe the quasi-particle nature of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and help discriminate different models of it.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'NIHAR RANJAN', 'last_name': 'Sahoo for STAR Collaboration', 'fullName': 'Sahoo for STAR Collaboration, NIHAR RANJAN', 'id': '4602001', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '93b3fb217d5cb4c667d8a139bafd6b60', 'db_id': 4602001, 'person_id': 4698506}"
Poster Session,poster,Magnetic Field Induced Polarization Difference between Hyperons and Anti-hyperons,"Guo, Yu","College of Science, China Three Gorges University",Unknown,"Recent STAR measurements of global hyperon polarization in AuAu Collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)  have attracted significant interest and generated wide enthusiasm. The data present an intriguing puzzle, showing a difference in the global spin polarization between hyperons and anti-hyperons, especially at relatively low collision beam energy. One possible cause of this difference is the potential presence of in-medium magnetic field. In this talk, we report our study on the phenomenological viability of this interpretation. Using the AMPT model framework, we quantify the influence of different magnetic field evolution scenarios on the size of the polarization difference in a wide span of collision beam energies. We find that such difference is very sensitive to the lifetime of the magnetic field and also mildly dependent on the precise form of magnetic field time dependence. Assuming magnetic polarization as the mechanism to enhance anti-hyperon signal while suppress hyperon signal, we phenomenologically extract an upper limit on the needed magnetic field lifetime in order to account for the experimental data. The so-obtained lifetime values are in a quite plausible ballpark and follow approximately the scaling relation of being inversely proportional to the beam energy. The time-integrated magnetic field shows an interesting non-monotonic dependence on the collision beam energy. Possible implications on other magnetic field related effects are discussed. Finally, we also report predictions for polarization effect in the CuCu and CuAu colliding systems, demonstrating an interesting hierarchy CuCu > CuAu > AuAu due to interplay between hyperon production timing and the evolution of vorticity. These predictions can be readily tested by future experimental analysis. [Refs: (1) arXiv:1905.12613; (2) Phys. Lett.

Poster Session,poster,Generalized High Twist Approach to Parton Energy Loss,"Zhang, Yuanyuan","LBL, CCNU",Unknown,"The Generalized High Twist approach has been established to investigate the radiative parton energy loss in deeply inelastic scattering off a large nucleus. The parton undergoes multiple medium parton scatterings and medium-induced radiation after scattering with the virtual photon. In the calculation of radiative energy loss, we relax the approximation in High Twist approach that the radiated gluon transverse momentum is much larger than transverse momentum transfer of parton-medium scattering, and do not perform the collinear expansion in the Generalized High Twist approach. In this new approach, the gluon radiation spectrum is expressed in terms of the convolution of hard partonic part and transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark-gluon correlation function. The TMD quark-gluon correlation can be factorized approximately as a product of initial quark distribution and TMD gluon distribution. The TMD gluon distribution can be used to define the TMD jet transport coefficient. Under static medium and soft radiative gluon approximation, we recover the Gylassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) approach result in the first order of the opacity expansion. We also compare numerically  the difference between our result and that of GLV and High-Twist result.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuanyuan', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'id': '4579116', 'affiliation': 'LBL, CCNU', 'emailHash': '550461346ab55067e71e9374c58c5ddf', 'db_id': 4579116, 'person_id': 4585354}"
Poster Session,poster,Data-driven constraints on the drag and diffusion of light partons,"Dai, Tianyu",Duke University,USA,"Interactions between hard partons and the quark-gluon plasma range from frequent soft collisions to rare large angle scatterings. The larger number of soft interactions makes possible an effective stochastic description of parton-plasma interactions in terms of drag and diffusion transport coefficients [1]. We build on the methodical division between soft and hard parton-plasma interactions derived in Ref. [2] and present a first Monte-Carlo implementation of this reformulated parton energy loss model. We discuss the model's dependence on the scale separating soft and hard interactions, both for small and large values of the strong coupling constant.

Using the model's systematic separation between the transport (soft) sector of the parton energy loss and harder vacuum-like interactions, we perform a Bayesian analysis to calibrate the model to jet measurements and extract the transport properties of light partons propagating in a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma. We constrain the drag and diffusion coefficients alongside the strong coupling constant and the scale separating soft and hard parton-plasma interactions, and discuss the physical interpretation of the phenomenologically-constrained soft/hard scale.

Poster Session,poster,"Identified light flavor particle production in ""jetty"" and ""isotropic"" pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV with ALICE at the LHC","Nassirpour, Adrian Fereydon",Lund University (SE),SE,"Identified light flavour particles, such as the $\pi$, K, $\phi$ mesons and the p, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$  baryons, constitute interesting probes to investigate the collective behaviour recently observed in small collision systems. The underlying mechanisms of light flavour production are currently not well understood, and the mechanisms are explained in the framework of different models. pQCD models based on hard scatterings, such as PYTHIA, describe light flavour production via string-breakings and rope hadronization. Other thermal and statistical models, mainly dominated by soft processes, predict a mechanism for the production of light flavour particles based on mass hierarchies in (grand) canonical ensembles.

This analysis is aimed to disentangle and isolate events that are dominated by soft processes (""isotropic"") and hard processes (""jetty"") by using the transverse spherocity observable. The light flavour production is then studied in both events with jet-like topologies and isotropic topologies, which are assumed to be dominated by hard and soft processes, respectively. This is done in an effort to pin-point the underlying mechanisms of the collective behaviour observed in small systems, such as radial flow and long-range angular correlations.

In this contribution we report about the measurement of transverse momentum spectra of strange and non-strange mesons and baryons in transverse spherocity selected events.

Precise measurement of yields coming from small-x, small-$Q^2$ gluons are essential to understand these effects which have a significant contribution to the suppressions observed in A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC. The inverse Compton process $q+q\rightarrow \gamma+q \rightarrow \gamma+h$ is one of the few which can access and provide information on the gluon $x$ and $Q^2$ in the region where nPDFs are not well constrained.

This unique coverage allow us to search for the gluon saturation scale, the transition between dilute and saturated gluons, predicted by the Color-Glass Condensate effective theory.

Then we take in to account the boundary condition to perserve the casuality find that mode accumulation at the boundary occurs for large angular momenta and that the magnetic effect is enhanced on the boundary surface.

Owing to the short lifetime of resonances $(\sim 10^{-23}$s), their characteristic properties such as mass, width and yield are very sensitive to the collision dynamics and in-medium effects. Multiple resonances have been studied in ALICE, including $\rho(770)$, $K^{*}(892)$, $\phi(1020)$, $\Lambda(1520)$ . However there are higher excited state resonances like $K^{*}(1430)$ and $K_2(1770)$ which have not yet been studied in the experiment because of their low production rate and difficulties in separating them cleanly from the underlying correlated background. Recent high statistics data in pp collisions collected by ALICE allow us to study the higher excited kaon state $K^{*}(1430)$. The lifetime of the $K^{*}(1430)$ ($\sim$1.5 fm$\thinspace /c$) is smaller than that of $K^{*}(892)$ ($\sim$4 fm$\thinspace /c$), it is expected that $K^{*}(1430)$ will be affected more by re-scattering in the late hadronic phase and hence measuring $K^{*}(1430)$ production in pp collisions will provide a baseline for similar measurements in Pb--Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Extracting jet transport coefficient via single hadron and dihadron productions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions,"xie, man",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We study [1] the suppressions of high transverse momentum single hadron and dihadron productions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions based on the framework of a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD parton model combined with the higher-twist energy loss formalism [2,3]. Our model can provide a consistent description for the nuclear modification factors of single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ in central and non-central nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC energies. 

We quantitatively extract the value of jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ via a global $\chi^2$ analysis, and obtain the scaled jet quenching parameter ${\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 4.1 \sim 4.4$ at $T = 378$ MeV for 0.2 TeV Au+Au collisions and ${\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 2.6 \sim 3.3$ at $T = 486$ MeV for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions, which are consistent with the results from JET Collaboration [4]. We also get the ${\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 2.5 $ at $T=516$ MeV for 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions, ${\hat{q}}/{T^3} = 3.5$ at $T= 469$ MeV for 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions only via single hadron productions and provide the predictions for the dihadron $I_{AA}$ of these two collisions. The above numerical analysis shows that ${\hat{q}}/{T^3}$ has some temperature dependence: it decreases as one increases the temperature, which can be understood as decreasing jet-medium interaction strength with increasing temperature.

Here are some other interesting results that the dihadron $I_{AA}$ are typically larger than single hadron $R_{AA}$ given the same nucleus-nucleus collision conditions and the values of $I_{AA}$ also increase as one increases the trigger hadron $p_T$. These results can be explained by that high $p_T$ single hadrons mainly come from surface bias emission jets, while high $p_T$ dihadrons come from a combination of surfacial and tangential jets as well as punching-through jets [5,6]. And with increasing trigger hadron $p_T$, the contribution from punching-through jets increases [7]. On average in a A + A event, the total energy loss for jets in the surface bias case is larger than in the case with punching-through jets.

Model comparisons are essential to decipher the properties of the QGP. In this talk, we study the correlations between flow harmonics $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ over a wide centrality range with two-particle correlations in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}=2.76$ TeV simulated by the HYDJET++ and AMPT models. We compare the model results to the experimental data from ATLAS and find both models are in good agreement with data for $v_2$-$v_3$ correlation. For $v_2$-$v_4$ and $v_3$-$v_4$ correlations, while AMPT is still in good agreement, HYDJET++ gives stronger slopes in the correlations than the ATLAS data. The AMPT model qualitatively predicts a boomerang-like shape in the correlations as observed in the experimental data, however, they quantitatively disagree. The HYDJET++ model fails completely to reproduce such a boomerang shape. We study flow fluctuations by the $v_2$ obtained with different Q-cumulant orders, namely $v_2\{2\}, v_2\{4\}, v_2\{6\},$ and $v_2\{8\}$. In particular, we study the skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of the $v_2$ distribution, by the ratio of

Poster Session,poster,Non-zero chiral and isospin imbalance in QCD phase diagram: dualities in effective models and lattice QCD,"Zhokhov, Roman",IHEP,Unknown,"in this talk there will be discussed the phase structure of the dense quark matter with isospin and chiral imbalances has been investigated in the framework of effective models and lattice QCD.  It has been shown that in the large-N$_c$ limit (N$_c$ is the number of colours of quarks) there exist duality correspondences, which are the symmetries of the thermodynamic potential and the phase structure itself. The first one is a duality between the chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) and the charged pion condensation (PC) phenomena. The dualities were shown to exist in the matter with chiral imbalance that can be produced in compact stars or heavy ion collisions. One of the key conclusions of these studies is the fact that chiral imbalance generates charged PC in dense baryonic/quark matter even in the case of charge neutral matter, which is interesting in the context of neutron stars. It was also shown that the duality can be observed in lattice QCD. Moreover, they were used for prediction of catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking by chiral imbalance. It is known that chiral imbalance can occur due to temperature and sphaleron transitions. Our studies show that chiral imbalance can occur in the cores of neutron stars or in heavy ion collisions at NICA, FAIR, where large baryon densities can be reached, due to other phenomena the so-called chiral separation and chiral vortical effects. Even if the phase diagram contains phases with inhomogeneous condensates, it still possesses the duality. Just by the duality we obtained, in the inhomogeneous case, without any calculations, a full phase diagram of chirally asymmetric dense quark matter. This shows that the duality is an instrument of high predictivity power. The obtained phase diagram is quite rich and contains various spatially inhomogeneous phases.

Due to its  anomalous component the η′ carries significant informations on the nature of the phase transition, and the role of the anomaly.   We contrast and compare the results for the η′ with the behaviour of chiral observables as well as with predictions of models.  Results are obtained from the analysis of the gluonic defined topological charge density correlator after gradient flow. Our results indicate the growth of the η′ mass above the pseudocritical temperature, associated with the chiral symmetry restoration. In the vicinity of the pseudocritical temperature the results are consistent with a small dip in the η′ mass. The magnitude of the dip is compatible with the reduction of the η′ mass obtained by experimental analysis and suggests that η′ mass comes close to zero temperature non-anomalous contribution.

Poster Session,poster,D-meson production in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Trogolo, Stefano","Universita e INFN, Padova (IT)",Italy,"The production of charm quarks occurs predominantly in hard scattering processes in the earliest stages of a heavy-ion collision, and due to their relatively long lifetimes they experience the full evolution of the system. In ALICE, charmed mesons ($D^0$,$D^+$,$D^{*+}$ and $D_{s}^{+}$) are reconstructed in their hadronic decay channels, allowing the full kinematic information of the original particle to be retained. Their nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) evaluated as the modification of the D meson production $p_{\rm T}$ spectra in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to the one in proton--proton collisions gives insight into the energy loss mechanisms charm quark undergoes as it traverses the strongly interacting medium (QGP). In particular comparisons with lighter hadrons give insight into the possible mass and flavour dependence of the in-medium energy loss. Comparative studies between particle species in Pb--Pb and pp collision systems allow us to test possible differences in the production of different charge states and resonances such as $D^{*+}$. 

Furthermore, charmed hadrons with strangeness content, such as $D_{s}^{+}$, are of particular interest as they allow us to probe the effect of the hot and dense medium on charm hadronisation such as the possible recombination of charm and strange quarks in the strangeness-rich QGP. In this case one expects a difference in the $R_{\rm AA}$ of strange and non-strange D mesons.

In this contribution will be presented the latest ALICE results for the production of strange and non-strange D mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, using the data provided by the 2018 run of the LHC. The nuclear modification factor of strange and non-strange D-mesons will be shown, along with the relative production ratios of the strange and non-strange D-meson species. Of particular interest is the extremely low $p_{\rm T}$ reach ALICE is able to achieve on the measurement of the production of $D^0$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions that allows to evaluate the $D^0$ $R_{\rm AA}$ down to $\sim$ 0 $p_{\rm T}$ and opens the possibility to determine the total $D^0$ production cross-section in heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Studying strangeness enhancement in small systems through $\Xi-$hadron correlations using the ALICE detector,"Adolfsson, Jonatan",Lund University (SE),SE,"One of the remaining puzzles in heavy-ion physics is that strangeness enhancement - believed to be a signature of the Quark-Gluon Plasma - is not only observed in heavy-ion collisions, but also in high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. Various phenomenological models have been developed to try to understand this, such as rope hadronisation (used in the Angantyr extension of Pythia) and core-corona models (used in EPOS). A prediction of the string/rope model is that strangeness is produced in $s\bar{s}$ pair breakings, so there will be correlations between strange and anti-strange hadrons in the same event, even between different hadronic species. By studying these correlations one can learn more about the strangeness production mechanism and test if it changes with multiplicity.

In this study, these predictions are tested by comparing angular correlations between in particular $\Xi^--K^+$ ($\overline{\Xi}^+-K^-$) and the reference $\Xi^--\pi^+$ ($\overline{\Xi}^+-\pi^-$) as a function of multiplicity, in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13\,\rm TeV$ using the ALICE detector. The results are compared to theoretical predictions by Angantyr and EPOS. A comparison will also be done between $\Xi-$baryon and $\Xi-$meson correlations. While this probes different physics, it further aids in the understanding of the production of multi-strange hadrons in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jonatan', 'last_name': 'Adolfsson', 'fullName': 'Adolfsson, Jonatan', 'id': '4554401', 'affiliation': 'Lund University (SE)', 'emailHash': '8b8964e03e818791c284cf57d90cc7b1', 'db_id': 4554401, 'person_id': 4582058}"
Poster Session,poster,D + meson production as a function of charged- particle multiplicity in pp collisions at √s =13 TeV with ALICE,"Singh, Randhir",University of Jammu (IN),India,"Charm and beauty are heavy quarks with observed masses of
1.28 GeV/c 2 and 4.18 GeV/c 2 respectively. They are produced
in initial hard scattering processes. Due to their small

time of QGP ( ∆t~0.3 fm/c) at the LHC, they experience all the
stages occuring during the time evolution of the hot and dense
medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, the
measurement of open charm and beauty production allows
probing QGP properties and investigating the color charge and
mass dependence of the parton in-medium energy loss.
Moreover, due to their large masses (m c , m b >> Λ QCD ) their pp
production cross-sections are calculable within the domain of
perturbative QCD constituting an excellent test of pQCD
calculations.

involved in the production of charm quarks. Moreover,
analyzing the charm production processes could help in

Due to their short lifetimes, resonances
are useful tools to understand the particle production mechanisms and the properties of the hadronic phase. Resonance yields are expected to be modified due to the interaction of their decay daughters within the hadronic medium via the re-scattering and re-generation processes.
The study of resonance production in p--Pb collisions fills the gap between pp and heavy-ion (Pb--Pb, Xe--Xe) collisions and also helps us
to understand the initial state effects due to cold nuclear matter. In asymmetric collisions, the produced particle yields are different at the forward and backward rapidities.

Even though we study ideal fluids (i.e., shear stress and bulk pressure are zero everywhere), we find a suppression of elliptic flow ($v_2$) at high transverse momenta ($p_T>1.5$ GeV/c), relative to results obtained with the traditional Boltzmann distributions [1].  The non-viscous suppression shows qualitatively similar features to the well-known shear viscous suppression of $v_2$; for example, it increases with $p_T$, and it is smaller for heavier species as seen in self-consistent kinetic theory calculations. Our results question whether all of the $v_2$ suppression seen in the data can be attributed to viscous effects, and indicate that shear viscosities extracted from RHIC and LHC elliptic flow data might be overestimated.

Poster Session,poster,Reconstruction of neutral mesons in heavy ion collisions using the conversion method with HADES and CBM*,"Kres, Ievgenii",University of Wuppertal,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) and the High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) are part of a worldwide research program devoted to study the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter at high baryon densities $\rho_{B}$ and moderate temperatures $T$ in p+A and A+A collisions. One of the major observables addressed by both experiments is dilepton production.

A central goal is to establish the excitation function of dilepton emission for heavy collision systems. While HADES is studying the lowest collision energies up to 1.5$A$ GeV, CBM, in a first campaign, will continue the excitation function to 12$A$ GeV. Central component of both detector setups is Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors (RICH), which are intended to identify and select leptons among all other particles.

Dalitz decays of long-lived neutral mesons ($\pi^0$, $\eta$) constitute an important source of dielectrons in the LMR (hadronic cocktail). The presented analysis aims to reconstruct neutral mesons using conversion ($\pi^0/\eta \rightarrow \gamma\gamma \rightarrow (e^+e^-)+(e^+e^-)$ or $\pi^0/\eta \rightarrow e^+e^-\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-+(e^+e^-)$) inside the target or in first detector layers in order to provide an independent measurement of the respective multiplicities needed to constrain the hadronic cocktail with sufficient precision. Proper counting of these mesons requires an exact description of the combinatorial background below $\pi^0/\eta$ invariant mass peaks, which is achieved using the event mixing technique.

The poster will present first results from the conversion based analysis of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ multiplicities using the new HADES data set obtained for Ag+Ag at 1.58$A$ GeV collisions in spring this year. For this run, the photon detector of HADES RICH was replaced by a newly developed MAPMT based system also foreseen for CBM. The performance obtained in the HADES run was studied in details and consistently introduced in the CBM experiment simulation framework.
Respective results of performance studies of the CBM experiment will also be shown.

However, the resulting space-time evolution could result in subtle differences depending on the particular choice. In this work we quantify measurable consequences of the choice of the evolution variable and show how the implications of such a choice propagates into jet quenching observables. 
We have developed a parton shower algorithm for a general evolution variable, that includes the virtuality, angle, transverse momentum and formation time. We study the interplay between the shower history for different evolution variables and the phase space affected by parton energy loss. In particular, we implement effects of jet quenching in the dense and dilute medium limits, and highlight the role of color coherence effects [1,2]. We compare the results of the different evolutions to existing Monte Carlo shower implementations on the parton level by analyzing primary and secondary Lund planes. Finally, we study the sensitivity of quenched jets to the choice of evolution variable by confronting our results for certain key observables, such as the inclusive jet spectrum, the (groomed) momentum sharing fraction or the jet mass, against theoretical expectations and experimental data.

Poster Session,poster,A Comprehensive Study of Bottomonium Production in Heavy-ion Collision,"Hatwar, Nikhil","Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, Pilani campus",Unknown,"One of the important goals of heavy-ion collision experiments is to test the predictions of Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD). One such QCD prediction is the formation of Quark-Gluon Plasma(QGP) in the heavy-ion collision experiments. Quarkonia suppression has been suggested as a sign of formation of QGP in heavy ion collision, where it could exist as a transient state. We have developed a model to predict the suppression of quarkonia in QGP. It incorporates quarkonia production and suppression due to hot nuclear matter effects like color screening, collisional damping, gluonic dissociation and cold nuclear matter effect namely, nuclear shadowing. We have considered the possibility of regeneration of quarkonia due to correlated/uncorrelated quark and anti-quark pair in QGP medium. Since our model had employed Bjorken's (1+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics, we were restricted to predict suppression at mid-rapidity only. A complete rapidity dependence of suppression was also missing in our previous work.

Poster Session,poster,Pre-hydrodynamic evolution and its signatures in final-state observables,"Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio",Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"The system created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions quickly reaches local equilibrium and its evolution is usually modeled with relativistic hydrodynamics. However, the effects of the early, pre-equilibrium stages of system evolution on final-state observables are largely unknown. In this work, we study the effects of pre-hydrodynamic evolution on final-state observables in various heavy-ion collision systems. We employ state-of-the art hydrodynamic simulations coupled to different pre-hydrodynamical scenarios, including Kompost, a recently-developed effective kinetic transport theory evolution model. We find that the addition of a pre-equilibrium stage can have a significant effect on the development of transverse momentum, but only a small effect on flow and fluctuations, even differentially in transverse momentum. These results impose constraints on the way in which the initial particle production immediately after the initial hard scattering is connected to the subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mauricio', 'last_name': 'Hippert Teixeira', 'fullName': 'Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio', 'id': '4578972', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo', 'emailHash': '22b7a8899e5b8f2b4152e676a052d67a', 'db_id': 4578972, 'person_id': 4585235}"
Poster Session,poster,Passive Gating Grid Studies for a Time Projection Chamber,"Garg, Prakhar",Stony Brook University,USA,"A Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is a good candidate as the main tracking device for many experiments. 
A TPC measures space points of charged tracks, which provide momentum resolution and particle identification for a variety of measurements. 
In high multiplicity environments a TPC has to cope with the build-up of space charge in the drift volume which is created by two major effects; primary ionization and Ion Back Flow (IBF) from an amplification device.
Primary ionization is inevitable and one concentrates on combating IBF. Traditionally, this is accomplished with a temporarily powered gating grid which absorbs all charge carriers. However, this limits the operation of a TPC to very limited readout rates. To overcome this limit micropattern gas detectors (MPGD) will be implemented in future TPCs. MPGDs are inherently capable to reduce IBF yet not at an optimum level. A passive or statically powered gating grid might optimize the IBF reduction.
We have simulated woven wire meshes, different patterns of etched meshes, hexagonal micropattern meshes and static bi-polar wire gating grids. We have studied several options to achieve good electron transparency for the primary electrons and high blocking for the ions coming from the amplification stage. In this presentation, we will discuss the results and provide conclusions for overcoming IBF.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Prakhar', 'last_name': 'Garg', 'fullName': 'Garg, Prakhar', 'id': '4659062', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '5fc5f7e98d895de63933f6828cc14774', 'db_id': 4659062, 'person_id': 4589383}"

The strength of magnetic fields is up to 3 GeV$^2$.

We found that the masses of neutral pseudo-scalars monotonically decrease as the magnetic field grows and then saturate at a nonzero value. It is observed that heavier neutral pseudo-scalars are less affected by magnetic fields. While the masses of charged pion and kaon show a non-monotonic behavior in magnetic field, which is different from all the previous studies from quenched QCD. In the case of small magnetic field (0 $\leq~|eB|\le$ 0.3 GeV$^2$ )  the mass of charged pseudo-scalar grows with magnetic field and can be well described by the Lowest Landau Level approximation, while for eB larger than 0.3 GeV$^2$ the mass starts to decrease.

We will discuss the possible connection between eB dependences of mesons in pseudo-scalar channels and the decreasing behavior of pseudo-critical temperature in magnetic field.

The cumulants of conserved quantities (net-charge, net-baryon number, net-strangeness) are directly related to the quark number susceptibilities calculated with lattice QCD. In a fluctuation analysis, net-pion, net-proton, and net-kaon are typically used as proxies for net-charge, net-baryon, and net-strangeness respectively. The $\Lambda$-particle consists of a strange quark and it is as well a baryon. Hence, measuring the cumulants of net-$\Lambda$ distributions provides insight into the fluctuations of net-strangeness and net-baryon number.
In addition, the ratios of net-$\Lambda$ cumulants that are used to estimate freeze-out parameters can be compared to the ones extracted using net-proton to identify the signature of a flavor hierarchy, that is, if heavier quarks may freezeout at a different $(T_{f})$ and $(\mu_{B}^f)$ from lighter quarks.

The model relies on the assumption that all hadronic resonances are free particles, which is valid, given that their decay widths are negligible. However, when the temperature is close to the crossover region, the model does not agree with lattice QCD data for observables like second order charge susceptibility ($\chi^2_Q$), the difference between second and fourth order baryon susceptibility ($\chi^2_B -\chi^4_B$) and the baryon-strange correlator ($C_{BS}$). Interaction among constituent hadrons is expected to affect these observables. We have implemented interactions among hadrons in the HRG model using $S$-matrix framework. The elements of $S$-matrix are related to the two body scattering phase shifts of interacting hadrons. The positive phase shifts, related to attractive interactions are calculated using $K$-matrix formalism while the negative phase shift, related to repulsive interactions are obtained from experimentally measured phase shifts. We observe a good agreement between results from our $S$-matrix formalism and lattice QCD data for the aforementioned higher order susceptibilities along with bulk properties like the speed of sound and interaction measure etc. Further, we use the $S$-matrix formalism to calculate the temperature ($T$) and baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) dependence of transport coefficients (shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, heat conductivity and diffusion coefficient) for the multi-component system of hadrons.

Poster Session,poster,Parametrized equation of state with critical point and first-order phase transition,"Yoshida, Yuto",Sophia University,Unknown,"At low temperature and low density, the chiral symmetry is broken dynamically to form hadronic phase. While, at high temperature and/or high density, this symmetry is restored and consequently the quark gluon plasma (QGP) appears. In the QCD phase diagram with temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, it is established from first-principle calculations that the transition from hadronic matter to the QGP is crossover at $\mu_B = 0$. On the other hand, in the finite density region ($\mu_B > 0$), the equation of state is still unknown due to the difficulty in the first-principle calculations, namely, the sign problem. Nevertheless, some effective models predict the existence of a critical point connected with a first-order phase transition line [1]. The precise position of the point is still unknown.
In this study, we construct a model of the equation of state in the entire phase space with a critical point which is connected with a first-order phase transition line by smoothly connecting several equations of state. By making use of the fact that the critical phenomena of QCD and the 3D Ising model belong to the same universality class [2], we construct an equation of state near the critical point [3]. The bag model is used in the high temperature and high density region, the lattice QCD calculation in the high temperature and low density region, the hadron resonance gas model with mean field potential in the low temperature and low density region, and the three-dimensional Ising model near the critical point. The model is designed to place the critical point at any position in the QCD phase diagram so that one can utilize it in the hydrodynamic model of nuclear collisions for critical point search. We discuss the relationship between the position of the critical point and the collision energy using the constructed equation of state.

Elliptic flow in ultra-central collisions is driven mainly by fluctuations rather than collision geometry. Therefore, magnitudes of elliptic flow and triangular flow coefficients are almost identical. Some hydrodynamic models, which have been successful in describing non-central data, fail to reproduce elliptic flow and triangular flow coefficients simultaneously in ultra-central collisions. We try to resolve the issue by investigating effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on anisotropic flow coefficients in ultra-central collisions.
We employ an integrated dynamical model [1] to describe the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy. Here, we introduce hydrodynamic fluctuations into relativistic hydrodynamic model through the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [2]. Hydrodynamic fluctuations are thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution. Since anisotropic flow is driven mainly by fluctuations in ultra-central collisions, hydrodynamic fluctuations play an important role in understanding their coefficients. The gap between magnitudes of elliptic flow and triangular flow is expected to decrease because hydrodynamic fluctuations enhance higher order flow coefficients more effectively. Setting impact parameter to be vanished to remove geometric effects, we first compare the results with hydrodynamic fluctuations and without them. Next, we analyze the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on azimuthal flow in ultra-central collisions. We also analyze the correlation between initial transverse eccentricity $\varepsilon_n$ and final anisotropic flow $v_n$ in ultra-central collisions.

This algorithm, which we denote ICCING (Initial Conserved Charges in Nuclear Geometries), treats an initial distribution of energy density as if it were composed entirely of gluons.  It then samples the probabilities for a gluon to split into a quark-antiquark pair, which we have calculated in the color-glass condensate framework, to redistribute this energy density in space along with the conserved charges carried only by quarks.  In this way, we provide a new tool to the community which can be incorporated into any initial-condition framework to initialize the conserved charges.  Interestingly, we find that the quark flavors couple differently to the collision geometry: up and down quarks are produced by the bulk event geometry, while strange and charm quarks are preferentially produced from hot spots.

In heavy-ion collisions, local parity violation manifests as charge separation along the direction of the strong magnetic field, a phenomenon called the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). We present results on the centrality, particle separation in pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum dependence of the charge-dependent two- and three-particle correlators in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm_{NN}}} = 5.44$ TeV recorded by the ALICE detector.

Poster Session,poster,Using Event Shape Engineering to study anisotropic flow of inclusive and identified particles in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Ristea, Catalin",Institute of Space Science (RO),Unknown,"Heavy-ion collisions produce asymmetric pressure gradients which convert via interactions the initial spatial asymmetry into an anisotropy in final state momentum space, a phenomenon referred to as anisotropic flow. Anisotropic flow is characterized using the harmonic coefficients $v_{\rm n}$ in a Fourier decomposition of the azimuthal distribution of produced particles relative to the symmetry plane in a collision. It is found that flow fluctuates event-by-event due to fluctuations in the initial geometry, which allows for an efficient selection of events that correspond to a specific initial geometry. This technique, called Event Shape Engineering, was applied to select events within the same centrality but having very different values of the elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow coefficients.

Poster Session,poster,Gluon emission from heavy quarks in dense nuclear medium,"Zhang, Le",Hubei Normal University,Unknown,"We study the medium-induced gluon emission process experienced by a hard jet parton propagating through the dense nuclear matter in the framework of deep inelastic scattering off a large nucleus. We work beyond the collinear rescattering expansion and the soft gluon emission limit, and derive a closed formula for the medium-induced single gluon emission spectrum from a heavy or light quark jet interacting with the dense nuclear medium via transverse and longitudinal scatterings. Without performing the collinear rescattering expansion, the medium-induced gluon emission spectrum is controlled by the full distribution of the differential elastic scattering rates between the propagating partons and the medium constituents. We then use two different models, heavy static scattering centers and the effective HTL dynamical medium, to characterize the traversed nuclear matter. If one utilizes heavy static scattering centers and takes the soft gluon emission limit, our result can reduce to the first order in opacity Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formula (with zero mass for radiated gluon). If we take the effective HTL spectral functions for the exchanged gluon field correlation, our result with similar approximations can reduce to Djordjevic-Heinz formula for medium-induced gluon emission in dynamical QCD medium (with zero thermal mass for radiated gluon).

One basic observable that needs to be understood before assessing more complex correlations and fluctuations is the rapidity distribution of net protons, that determines the net baryon density of the system. 
The stopping dynamics of baryons is still lacking a quantitative understanding from the theory side. Here, we implement a string model for the description of hadronic interactions within a newly developed transport approach, SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons). The free parameters of the string model are determined by comparing to experimental measurements in elementary proton-proton collisions. With the adjusted parameters, we advance to heavy ion collisions, where the experimentally observed change of the shape of the net proton rapidity spectrum from a single peak structure to a double peak structure with increasing beam energy is reproduced.
By adjusting details of the formation process of string fragments, a good agreement with the measured rapidity spectra of protons and pions is achieved while insights on the fragmentation process are obtained.

A smooth evolution of yields of strange particles relative to the non-strange ones with event multiplicity has been observed in those systems. Results from Run 2 at the top LHC energy allows us to improve previous measurements by exploiting a dedicated high multiplicity trigger. This offers the unique opportunity to study, in elementary collisions, the multiplicity range covered by semi-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. We present the latest results obtained with ALICE on the multiplicity-dependent strangeness production. The strangeness enhancement is investigated by measuring the evolution with multiplicity of single-strange and multi-strange baryon production relative to non-strange particles. In addition recent measurements of mesonic and baryonic resonances in small collision systems are shown. We investigate the system size dependence in different collision systems as well as lower collision energies to study how the hadronic scattering processes affect measured resonance yields, as well as the interplay between canonical suppression and strangeness enhancement. The measurement of the $\phi$(1020) meson as a function of multiplicity provides crucial constraints in this context.

A point of interest arises when comparing the extracted freeze-out parameters obtained using different sets of particles in the thermal fit;  namely, the $T_{ch}$ differences between the light hadrons and the strange hadrons.  In this talk, I will show recent calculations of the freeze-out parameters using STAR and ALICE particle yields measured at collision energies ranging from 7.7 GeV to 7 TeV.  Employing the Grand Canonical approach within the framework of the Thermal-FIST HRG model package, I will show evidence for a flavor-dependent freeze-out in the QCD crossover region and compare our findings with lattice calculations.  Lastly, I will compare the quality of the extrapolated fits using various treatments of strangeness conservation under different freeze-out conditions.  I will focus on system size dependence by applying the same approach to pp and pPb collisions and show that the statistical hadronization approach is applicable to small systems and that flavor dependencies in the freeze-out parameters lead to a natural explanation of strangeness enhancement from small to large systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Fernando Antonio', 'last_name': 'Flor', 'fullName': 'Flor, Fernando Antonio', 'id': '4578736', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston (US)', 'emailHash': '6cf906e5cbbf3c61b882a2a27aa65826', 'db_id': 4578736, 'person_id': 4578889}"

We present here measurements of two particle azimuthal correlation with neutral pion$(\pi^0)$, neutral kaon$(k^0)$ and proton as trigger particles having the highest transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and associated charged hadrons of transverse momentum $(p_{T}) >$ 0.5 in an event on the basis of the difference in azimuthal angle  ($\Delta \phi$) and pseudorapidity ($\Delta \eta$) at midrapidity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV using the pQCD inspired model PYTHIA8. Multiplicity dependent study of these measurements can explain the production and hadronization of particles at different multiplicities. In order to explain the collective behavior of the medium formed, we can use this analysis. Mixed event technique is used to obtain the pure correlation distribution and afterward, the per-trigger yields are extracted on the near side ($ |\Delta \phi| < 0.7$) as well as on the away side ($ |\Delta \phi - \pi|<1.1$). The modification in the per-trigger yields is given by a factor $I_{AA}$ which is the ratio of near-side to away-side yields. The collectivity of the medium is explained by the Fourier coefficient ($v_{2}$) extracted from the two particles angular correlation function. This explains the collective motion of the particles. The mass dependency of particles and the behavior of mean transverse momentum ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$) as a function of charged-particle multiplicity is presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dhananjaya', 'last_name': 'Thakur', 'fullName': 'Thakur, Dhananjaya', 'id': '4578728', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': 'f29307fce2f5a188647ae329dd256867', 'db_id': 4578728, 'person_id': 4578193}"

Poster Session,poster,Equation of State for BES with EPOS model,"Stefaniak, Maria",Warsaw University of Technology,Unknown,"Studies of collisions of highly accelerated ions are the key to understand the creation of quark matter. Experimental physicists put considerable effort in collecting information characterizing the various processes occurring during such collisions. In order to describe such scenarios, complex models have been constructed, one of them being the EPOS approach. It applies Parton-based Gribov-Regge theory as an initial condition, introduces the core-corona approach, hydrodynamical evolution and hadronic cascades as well. The model is used by an experimental physicist at the LHC or in cosmic ray physics. However, the proper theoretical description of the collisions occurring in the region of higher baryon densities (i. e. studied in the frame of Beam Energy Scan program) requires the introduction of the first order phase transition and possible Critical Point (CP).
	
The new Equation of State (EoS) proposed by BEST collaboration [1] is introduced in the model. It contains all corssover, first and second order (CP) transitions of the matter. Furthermore, the location of the CP can be changed. Studies of the impact of the new EoS on final observables will be discussed and compared with the published experimental data.

Poster Session,poster,Studying the phi meson in nuclear matter by simulating low energy pA reactions,"Gubler, Philipp",JAEA,Unknown,"The behavior of the $\phi$ meson in nuclear matter has attracted renewed interest because of (recent and future) experiments that aim to study its properties in nuclei [1-3]. Theoretically, many works have however been conducted assuming infinite nuclear matter [4-5], which is not realistic from an experimental point of view. To relate theoretical predictions with experimental observables, a thorough understanding of the actual reaction, in which the $\phi$ meson is produced in a nucleus, is required. For the past E325 experiment at KEK [1] and the future E16 experiment at J-PARC [3], this is a pA reaction with initial proton energies between 10 and 30 GeV. To simulate such a reaction, we make use of the PHSD transport approach, which is based on a covariant microscopic transport model [6]. In this framework, the $\phi$ meson spectral function obtained theoretically as a function of density, can be used as an input, while the output of the simulation can be compared with experimentally observed dilepton spectrum.

Poster Session,poster,Long-range azimuthal correlations arising with HBT suppressions in partially coherent pion emissions in AA and pp collisions,"Ru, Peng",South China Normal University / Dalian University of Technology / Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The presence of coherence in pion emission will suppress the strength of the final-state pion HBT correlations. The recently observed significant pion HBT suppressions in both Pb-Pb and pp collisions at the LHC indicate the pion emissions may be partially coherent in such violent collisions. In this talk we will show that the coherence in particle emission can give rise to a remarkable long-range azimuthal correlation.

  In Ref [1], we study the pion transverse-momentum spectrum and elliptic anisotropy of an expanding coherent source with a classical current radiation model. It is found that the elliptic anisotropy of coherent emission is connected to the source initial geometry through an *interference* effect but is *not* sensitive to the source expansion (flow effect). We further construct a partially coherent source by adding an incoherent emission component described by a viscous hydrodynamic model. The partially coherent source model can successfully reproduce the experimental data on the pion $p_T$ spectrum, $v_2(p_T)$ as well as 4-pion HBT correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.

  Furthermore, we focus on the coherence phenomena in pp collisions in Ref [2]. We extend the coherent pion source by incorporating a Bjorken longitudinal expansion and study the long-range two-particle angular correlations. A “*ridge*” structure is found to arise from the interferences in coherent emission and to be largely related to the source transverse shape and size at the initial time. From the 2-pion HBT measurement at the LHC, we extract a coherent fraction *increasing* with the charged-particle multiplicity, as an input of a partially coherent pion emission model, and the calculations suggest a more pronounced ridge effect from the coherent pion emission in high-multiplicity pp collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Future opportunities of small system scan at RHIC,"Jia, Jiangyong",Stony Brook University,USA,"The observation of multi-particle azimuthal correlations in high-energy small-system collisions has led to intense debate on its physical origin between two competing theoretical scenarios: one based on initial-state intrinsic momentum anisotropy (ISM), the other based on final-state collective response to the collision geometry (FSM). To complement the previous scan of asymmetric collision systems ($p$+Au, $d$+Au and He+Au), we propose a scan of small symmetric collision systems at RHIC, such as C+C, O+O, Al+Al and Ar+Ar at $\mbox{$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$}=0.2$ TeV, to further disentangle contributions from these two scenarios. These symmetric small systems have the advantage of providing access to geometries driven by the average shape of the nuclear overlap, compared to fluctuation-dominant geometries in asymmetric systems. A transport model is employed to investigate the expected geometry response in the FSM scenario. Different trends of elliptic flow with increasing charge particle multiplicity are observed between symmetric and asymmetric systems, while triangular flow appears to show a similar behavior.

The enhanced pseudo-rapidity coverage of STAR with iTPC, EPD, and forward upgrade, together with sPHENIX's capabilities of state-of-art hard-probe measurments, make RHIC the ideal place for the proposed scan. Furthermore, a comparison of O+O collisions at $\mbox{$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$}=0.2$ TeV and at $\mbox{$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$}=2.76-7$ TeV, as proposed at the LHC, provides a unique opportunity to disentangle the collision geometry effects at nucleon level from those arising from subnucleon fluctuations.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of simulating parity-odd observables in high energy heavy ion collisions on balance functions of charged particles and elliptic flow of pions,"ALAM, SK NOOR","Indian Institute Of Science Education and Research, Tirupati",Unknown,"At the early stage of heavy ion collisions, non-trivial topologies of the gauge fields can be created resulting in an imbalance of axial charge density and eventually separation of electric charges along the direction of the magnetic field produced in such collisions. This process is called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). In this work we implement such a charge separation at the partonic level in AMPT for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV to study its consequence on experimental observables. We present the effects on the pion elliptic flow ($v_2$) and the charged particle balance function (BF) for varying strengths of initial charge separation. We find that the shape of the balance function is sensitive to the increasing charge separation. $v_2$ of pion shows a strong decreasing trend at higher transverse momenta ($p_T$) with increasing charge separation. Charge balance functions show a peak at $\Delta\phi \sim 180 $ with charge separation implemented in the partonic level as expected for the parity violation. We have also calculated parity observable $\gamma$ in the form of BF's moments. $\gamma$ shows a decreasing trend with charge separation. It has a negative value for charge separation produced by flipping more than 30 $\%$ of quarks in the parton level. We also notice that $<\gamma>$ for the same charge correlation and the opposite charge correlation shows negative and positive values, respectively.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'SK NOOR', 'last_name': 'ALAM', 'fullName': 'ALAM, SK NOOR', 'id': '4578666', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute Of Science Education and Research, Tirupati', 'emailHash': '2a676892d47f97b0605ee31bf306d7ef', 'db_id': 4578666, 'person_id': 4560502}"
Poster Session,poster,Charm and beauty isolation in heavy flavor electron measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC,"Si, Fan",USTC,Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are believed to be produced predominately in hard scattering processes at early stage of the collisions before the QGP production so they can pass through the hot-dense medium completely, and their production yields can be calculated by perturbative-QCD, which makes them ideal probes for QGP. According to the theoretical prediction, energy loss of heavy quarks is less than that of light quarks due to the suppression of the gluon radiation angle by the quark mass. Heavy quarks could be more difficult to be thermalized than light quarks in the hot-dense medium and moved following the collective flow during the expansion of the partonic matter. Because of its three times larger mass compared with that of charm, beauty could have different properties in terms of its interactions with QGP medium from charm.

We develop a data-driven method to isolate charm and beauty contributions from the inclusive heavy flavor electrons based on the most recent open charm hadron measurements in minimum bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,First results from hybrid hadronization in small and large systems,"Fries for JETSCAPE Collaboration, Rainer",Texas A&M University,USA,"“Hybrid Hadronization” is a new Monte Carlo package to hadronize systems of partons. It smoothly combines quark recombination applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems, following the picture outlined by Han et al. [PRC 93, 045207 (2016)]. Hybrid Hadronization integrates with PYTHIA 8 and can be applied to a variety of systems from $e^++e^-$ to A+A collisions. It takes systems of partons and their color flow information, for example from a Monte Carlo parton shower genera-tor, as input. In addition, if for A+A collisions a thermal background me-dium is provided, the package allows to sample thermal partons that con-tribute to hadronization. Hybrid Hadronization is available for use as a standalone code and is also part of the JETSCAPE 2.0 release.
In this presentation we review the physics concepts underlying Hybrid Hadronization and how users can use the code with parton shower Monte Carlos. We demonstrate how Hybrid Hadronization affects multiplicities, hadron chemistry, fragmentation functions and jet shapes in $e^++e^-$, p+p and A+A collisions when combined with different parton shower Monte Carlos using PYTHIA 6, PYTHIA 8 and JETSCAPE/MATTER. We compare to calculations using pure Lund string fragmentation as well as to data from LEP, RHIC and LHC.

Poster Session,poster,Possible observation of parton energy loss in pp collisions with Pythia,"Paic, Guy",CERN,Switzerland,"We study the evolution of jetty and underlying parts of the transverse momentum spectra as a function of multiplicity in pp 13 TeV collisions at midrapidity (|eta|<0.8) using pythia8 event generator. We observe that beyond a multiplicity of dN/deta ~ 40 the maximum reachable leading transverse momentum gets smaller and at the same time the slope of the spectra both in the jetty and underlying parts show a continuous rise. At high multiplicity (>70) a rise in pT spectra at very low momenta (~ 1GeV/c) is also observed. We interpret this as a possible  loss of the momentum at a certain particle/energy density in pp collisions. 

The similarity in the behavior of transverse momentum spectra in Pb-Pb and pp collisions (shown in  arXiv:1805.04572v2) indicate that the same mechanism could be responsible for the parton energy loss in heavy ions collisions. Although the behaviour of the spectra at low momenta are usually explained by hydro flow mechanisms, we demonstrate that with the present mechanism the low momentum features are perfectly explained by the overall hardening of the spectra. The saturation of the sum of the transverse momenta with multiplicity gives strong base to our observations.

We will present the results obtained with Pythia8 using different multiplicity estimators (central multiplicity estimator and the one based on the multiplicity in the transverse side) for different pseudorapidity ranges.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guy', 'last_name': 'Paic', 'fullName': 'Paic, Guy', 'id': '4579106', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '90bebb431e8645cf97f2491dd1ae432c', 'db_id': 4579106, 'person_id': 4585272}"
Poster Session,poster,Evolution of jet shapes in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV with the STAR experiment at RHIC,"Mazer, Joel Anthony",University of Tennessee (US),USA,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a strongly interacting medium known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is produced.  Quarks and gluons from incoming nuclei collide to produce partons at high momenta early in the collisions.  By fragmenting into collimated sprays of hadrons, these partons form `jets'.  The resulting jets, which in vacuum are well understood within the framework of perturbative QCD, are attenuated by medium interactions, a process known as jet quenching.  The jet shape variable, $\rho(\Delta r)$, reveals the radial profile of transverse momentum distribution inside the jet.  By measuring the modifications of the jet shape, properties of the QGP at different length scales can be studied.

In this poster, the differential jet shape for full (charged + neutral) jets in mid-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV with the STAR experiment at RHIC will be presented and compared to a baseline p+p measurement.  As the first measurement of its kind at RHIC energies, this work will extend the kinematic range offered at the LHC to lower $\it{p}_{T}$ and demonstrate whether there is a modification and a broadening of the jet profile at RHIC energies.  The jet shape measurement is extended to include an event plane (defined by the beam direction and the vector of the impact parameter) dependence to study the path length dependence of medium modifications to the jets and their associated hadrons.

Poster Session,poster,Photon identification in the ALICE EMCal using a neural network and template fit,"Liu, Alwina",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"Photon identification in the ALICE EMCal using a neural network and template fit
Alwina Liu for the ALICE collaboration

The measurement of isolated photon-tagged correlations of jets and jet fragments is a promising channel for the study of partonic energy loss in heavy-ion collisions. Isolated photons are an excellent probe because they constrain the parton kinematics of the initial hard scattering. For prompt photon measurements, the main background are photons from the decays of neutral mesons. Photons are measured in the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal) and reconstructed as EMCal clusters. Higher-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ neutral mesons decay into photons with a small opening angle, which can produce a single cluster with both photons when the photon showers overlap; this starts to happen for neutral pions at around 6 GeV/$c$, for example. A deep neural network is trained to distinguish between clusters containing one or two photons. Thus the energy distribution in the cluster (the ``shower shape'') can be encoded with the output of this deep neural network as well as with a geometric variable. The shower shape distribution of isolated clusters in the data can then be fit to two templates. The purity can then be extracted from the result of the template fit and is used in the isolated photon correlation measurements. This poster will present the details and results of calculating the photon purity with a template fit procedure using both the deep neural network and the geometric variable in multiple collision systems. The photons are measured in a $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range (12--60 GeV/$c$) that provides access to a regime in which the largest modifications due to the QGP are expected and which is thus far unexplored. However, this $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range is technically challenging due to the large number of neutral mesons produced relative to prompt photons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alwina', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Alwina', 'id': '4554321', 'affiliation': 'University of California Berkeley (US)', 'emailHash': '9b73dbf30ea0c7c908c97c25e2649272', 'db_id': 4554321, 'person_id': 4585243}"
Poster Session,poster,Charged particle multiplicity dependence of $\Lambda(1520)$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE at the LHC,"Sahoo, Pragati",Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,Unknown,"Resonances are useful tools to study the properties of the hadronic medium produced in high energy heavy-ion collisions, due to their short lifetime. In particular, the baryonic resonance $\Lambda(1520)$ is important because of its lifetime ($\tau \sim$ 12.6 fm/$\it c$), which lies in between the lifetimes of $ K^*$ and $\phi$ resonances. 
Its study will indicate the dominance of re-scattering or regeneration in the yields and support results obtained for other resonances having different lifetimes. The reconstruction of $\Lambda(1520)$ as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV has been performed via its hadronic decay channel. New measurements of the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) spectra, $p_{\rm{T}}$-integrated yield ($\langle dN/dy\rangle$), $\langle p_{\rm{T}}\rangle$  and $\Lambda(1520)/ \Lambda$ yield ratio in different multiplicity classes will be presented and discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Inclusive jet measurements in p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV in STAR,"Liu, Tong",Yale University,USA,"The Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is a state of matter at extremely high energy density, where the quark and gluon constituents of nucleons become deconfined. Although there is strong evidence at RHIC and the LHC that the QGP is created in A+A collisions, it was initially assumed to be absent in smaller systems, such as p+p and p+A collisions. However, the observation of flow-like correlations in such collisions at the LHC and RHIC has made the existence of the QGP in small systems an open question. High momentum partons produced at early stages of heavy ion collisions generate collimated sprays of hadrons called \textit{jets}. These partons lose energy when passing through the medium. This effect, usually referred to as \textit{jet quenching}, is well established as a probe of the existence and properties of the QGP.

In this analysis, we aim to investigate p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV at STAR for possible evidence of jet quenching by studying the binary-scaled inclusive jet yield. Measurements for both full (charged + neutral) and charged jets will be presented. We will present preliminary results on jet spectra along with our analysis process, and compare the jet yields in different backward (Au-going direction) event activity bins. Progress on our simulation procedures will be shown, including the Glauber model calculation and detector response simulations.

In the present study, we incorporate for the first time this mechanism in a transport model that is based on the chiral kinetic equations. For a system of rotating and unpolarized quarks in a box, we find that the side-jump mechanism can dynamically generate the spin polarization of quarks with its final value consistent with that of massless quarks in thermal equilibrium in a self-consistent nonzero vorticity field. The total angular momentum of the system is also seen to be conserved during the evolution of the system. We further employ this angular momentum conserved chiral transport model to study the spin polarizations of quarks in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Besides the global polarization of massless quarks, results from this model can also help understand the puzzles in the local spin polarizations measured in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider [2].

The energy loss model includes scatterings between hard partons and the medium as well as inelastic (bremsstrahlung) processes.
Importantly, the model takes into account the finite formation time of parton bremsstrahlung, an essential ingredient for a realistic implementation of the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect in an evolving medium.
The model predictions in a static medium agree quantitatively with leading-order theoretical calculations. It also captures the qualitative features of bremsstrahlung in a finite-size and expanding medium.
The model with these features makes possible a more reliable space-time description of jet propagation in the quark-gluon plasma.

In a finite brick medium, early time splittings receive larger transverse-momentum broadening than those received by later time splittings. 
To study such relation between momentum broadening and locations of splitting vertices in an event-by-event fluctuating and expanding medium,  we look into the transport evolution history after calibrating the model to inclusive jet $R_{AA}$.
We demonstrate that the early/high-temperature regions of the medium can be probed by large-angle splittings, while small angle splittings are favorably produced at later times of the evolution.

Poster Session,poster,Dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm {NN}}}=54$  GeV at STAR,"wang, zhen",Shandong University,Unknown,"Dielectrons are excellent probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Because they can be produced at all stages of the collision system evolution and do not interact with the medium strongly, dielectrons carry the information from the initial stage to the final stage. In the low mass region (LMR, $\rm M_{ee} < M_{\phi}$), the mass spectra of vector mesons will be modified by the hot and dense medium  which is related to the chiral symmetry restoration in the medium. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, $\rm M_{\phi} < \rm M_{ee} < \rm M_{J/\psi}$), QGP thermal radiation can be used as a QGP thermometer. However, it is hard to measure the QGP thermal radiation because of the heavy flavor semi-leptonic decay contributions.

In this poster, we will present the dielectron production in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm {NN}}}=54$ GeV at STAR. With a 10 times larger data sample than that at 62 GeV from the first phase of the STAR Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program, in-medium $\rho$ modification can be studied with better precision and compared to different theoretical predictions. With lower heavy flavor semi-leptonic decay contributions compared to those at RHIC top energies, QGP thermal radiation in the IMR will be discussed. Furthermore, physics implications of these measurements will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'zhen', 'last_name': 'wang', 'fullName': 'wang, zhen', 'id': '4685934', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '9e24c6ffc263490ca82f9eeac2e71de2', 'db_id': 4685934, 'person_id': 4773682}"
Poster Session,poster,Influences of electromagnetic field characteristics on the CME and CMW measurements,"Ma, Guo-Liang",Fudan University,Unknown,"Many great efforts have been made to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) and Chiral Magnetic Wave (CMW), which reply on the existence of extremely large electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

However, the current main difficulty of measuring the CME signal is some backgrounds which we do not understand clearly. To isolate the influence of those backgrounds, the isobar program at RHIC has been proposed and it collides $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ and $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ elements, since they have a same nucleon number but the 10$\%$ difference of proton number. The CME signal is expected to be different between the two isobaric collisions. By investigating the the properties of electromagnetic fields in two isobaric collisions with special emphasis on the correlation between magnetic field direction and participant plane angle $\Psi_{2}$ (or spectator plane angle $\Psi_{2}^{SP}$), i.e. $\langle$cos2$(\Psi_B - \Psi_{2})\rangle$ [or $\langle$cos2$(\Psi_B - \Psi_{2}^{SP})\rangle$], we confirm that the magnetic fields of $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ collisions are stronger than those of $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ collisions. Moreover, we find that the $\textbf{deformation of nuclei has a non-negligible effect on}$ $\langle$cos2$(\Psi_B - \Psi_{2})\rangle$, especially in peripheral events. Because the magnetic field direction is more strongly correlated with $\Psi_{2}^{SP}$ than with $\Psi_{2}$, $\textbf{the relative difference of the chiral magnetic effect observable with respect to}$ $\Psi_{2}^{SP}$ $\textbf{is expected to}$ $\\$ $\textbf{be able to reflect much cleaner information about the CME with less influences of deformation}$[1].

What is more, with the presence of magnetic field, the coupling of the vector and axial currents induced by the chiral anomaly can motivate a collective gapless excitation in QGP, i.e. CMW. The CMW can lead to an electric quadrupole moment in relativistic heavy-ion collision, which explains the observed charge-dependent elliptic flow of pions. In our study, a dipolar distribution of $\bf E \cdot B$ is observed at the non-central collisions in Au+Au collisions at the RHIC energy $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV. More importantly, we find that the coupling of the dipole QED anomaly and magnetic field $\bf B$ can also induce an electric quadrupole moment which can further lead to the difference in elliptic flows between positive charged particles and negative charged particles through final interactions. The centrality dependence of the density of $\bf E \cdot B$ is similar to the trend of the slope parameter $r$ measured from the difference in elliptic flows between positive pions and negative pions by the STAR collaboration. Therefore, $\textbf{the novel mechanism for electric quadrupole moment generation can offer a new}$ $\textbf{interpretation of the observed charge-dependent elliptic flow of pions, but without the}$ $\textbf{formation}$ $\\$ $\textbf{of CMW}$[2].

Poster Session,poster,Study of dielectron productions in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Sekihata, Daiki",University of Tokyo (JP),Japan,"Photons and dileptons ($\gamma^{*} \to l^{+}l^{-}$) are unique tools to study the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
The space-time evolution of heavy-ion collisions can be calculated using relativistic hydrodynamics and hadronic transport models.
Up to the present time, theoretical models fail to describe the large direct photon yields and the large elliptic flow simultaneously.
One advantage to measure direct photons via dielectrons from virtual direct photons is that the background from $\pi^{0}$ decays can be significantly reduced compared to real photon measurements by selecting invariant mass region at $M_{ee} > M_{\pi^{0}}$.
The fraction of direct virtual photon to inclusive virtual photon in the kinematic region of $p_{\rm T}^{ee} \gg M_{ee}$ is expected to be identical to that of real photons in the $M_{\gamma^{*}} \to 0$ limit.
Therefore, measurements of direct virtual photons are independent and complementary to those of real direct photons.
Finally, thermal virtual photons are expected to contribute to the direct virtual photon yield at $p_{\rm T} < 3$ GeV/$c$, providing information about the thermalization of the system.
In ALICE, electrons can be identified by TPC, ITS and TOF at mid-rapidity.

The Silicon Tracking System is the central detector for momentum measurement and charged-particle identification. It is designed to measure up to 1000 charged particles in A+A collisions between 0.1 and 10 MHz interaction rate, to achieve a momentum resolution in a 1 Tm dipole magnetic field of better than 2%, and to be capable of identifying complex particle decays topologies, e.g., such with strangeness content. The STS employs high-granularity double-sided silicon strip sensors matching the non-uniform track density, and fast self-triggering electronics with a free streaming data acquisition system and online event selection. With the resulting 1.8 million readout channels, it poses the most demanding requirements regarding bandwidth and density of all CBM detectors.
In the context of FAIR phase 0, the mini-CBM (mCBM) project aims to prove the concept of free-streaming data generation, transport and reconstruction, as well as to provide a test setup for all CBM subsystems using the existing GSI/FAIR accelerator facilities. The STS deployed a demonstrator of one small tracking station with full readout chain. The prototype, called mSTS, has been operated in Ag+Au collisions at energies above 1.59 AGeV and overall interaction rates up to 40 MHz, which is similar to a realistic experimental scenario. This allows evaluating the detector performance integrated with other subsystems into a free-streaming DAQ.

Several QGP induced effects, such as the melting of charmonium states due to color screening or the recombination of uncorrelated charm and anti-charm quarks, can influence charmonium yields. Recent ALICE measurements of charmonium nuclear modification factor in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV showed that the (re)combination mechanism plays a dominant role in the production of charmonia at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$.

By incorporating nuclei with finite thickness along the beam axis, we naturally break boost invariance and obtain Gaussian-like rapidity profiles of energy densities already at the tree level [1]. The profiles resemble strong coupling results and agree surprisingly well with experimental data of pion multiplicities as obtained at RHIC. The applicability of these simulations is limited by the numerical Cherenkov instability. We construct a new lattice action which allows us to cure this instability along one lattice direction [2]. This paves the way for simulations at higher energies and better resolution.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonia as an Open-Quantum-System,"Tiwari, Anurag",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,Unknown,"Quarkonia suppression has been long predicted \cite{satz19861} and explored as a defining signature of formation of quark-gluon-plasma (QGP). Various physical processes \cite{satz19861,laine20071,brambilla20081} have been understood to contribute to the dynamics of a Q-$\bar{Q}$ traversing through the QGP. The proper framework to implement a Schr\""{o}dinger equation, which takes into account the dynamical nature of the above problem, is treating the system as an open quantum system \cite{akamatsu20121,akamatsu20151}. 
 
In our calculation, we implement a stochastic Schr\""{o}dinger equation which describes the evolution of the Q-$\bar{Q}$ pair starting from a pure state.
In the first part, we start with an extension of the results obtained in \cite{akamatsu20181} by extending the calculation to three-dimensional case and including the full-color structure of a Q-$\bar{Q}$ pair (including color-octet states as well). We do so by expanding the equations obtained in \cite{akamatsu20151} in small $\vec{r}$ limit. This is not an ad hoc approximation but is rather motivated by the idea of effective-field-theory (EFT) methods, such as pNRQCD \cite{brambilla20081}. Further, in a simple calculation, we check how much of an error small `$\vec{r}$' expansion brings. This is an example of a Markovian process as shown in \cite{akamatsu20151}. This formalism does not include on-shell gluon emission or absorption.

The second part of the calculation is a dynamical implementation of the physical process called gluo-dissociation \cite{brambilla20081} by the means of stochastic evolution. This necessarily involves kernels which remember correlation in time as the process occurs at a finite frequency. This is an example of a non-Markovian process. If one wants to use results from lattice (since the QGP formed at RHIC and LHC is an example of a strongly coupled system), one would like to understand the relative importance of these physical processes. We suggest that this can be done by comparing correlation functions of color electric-fields at zero and non-zero frequencies. It appears that non-Markovian dynamics will play an important role when higher-excited states are considered.

The measurements of prompt  $\rm D$-meson production in small systems like p--Pb collisions allow us to decode the Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects such as the modification of parton densities in nuclei and $k_{\rm T}$-broadening or parton energy loss. Recent studies show that the high-multiplicity events of p--Pb collisions at the LHC exhibit unforeseen collective behaviour and the origin remains unclear. For a deeper understanding on the collective-like effects in high-multiplicity p--Pb events, the study of D-meson production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity can give further insight into the interplay between hard and soft mechanisms of particle production. Furthermore, to understand the role of initial-state geometry on the final-state observables in p--Pb collisions, a more differential study can be attempted based on the technique of Event-Shape Engineering (ESE) by selecting events of different initial geometry at similar multiplicity. The modification of production cross sections of D mesons in different shape-engineered events would strengthen our understanding of influence of initial geometry on the final state particle production mechanisms.

In this contribution, the production cross sections of D mesons (${\rm D}^{0}$, ${\rm D}^{+}$, ${\rm D}^{*+}$ and ${\rm D}_{\rm s}^{+}$) measured at mid-rapidity in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 5.02$ TeV with ALICE detector will be presented. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm pPb}$) for minimum bias p--Pb collisions will be shown. The results will be compared with model predictions including CNM effects. The prompt D-meson transverse momentum distributions in p--Pb collisions relative to pp collisions ($Q_{\rm pPb}$), measured in several multiplicity/centrality classes, will also be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Somnath', 'last_name': 'Kar', 'fullName': 'Kar, Somnath', 'id': '4554181', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN)', 'emailHash': '9f2197b3bf6c7dc040f7a1df410206e7', 'db_id': 4554181, 'person_id': 4584066}"
Poster Session,poster,Tidal deformability with magnetic field for neutron star and  quark star,"Zhu, Zhenyu",Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,Unknown,"The recent detection of gravitational wave signal from binary 
compact star merger has set a strong constraint on tidal defomability, 
which motivated a large amount of studies about the equation of state. 
But the tidal deformability of compact star depends not only on the 
equation of state, but also on the spin and magnetic field of the star. 
In this study, we calculated for the first time the contribution of 
tidal deformability from magnetic field. Both the magnetic field and 
tidal field act as a perturbation of a spherical star. We found that 
they are independent with each other at first order because of linearity 
of perturbed equations, and their coupling firstly appears in the second 
order of perturbation. Our results show that the correction of tidal 
deformability is only about 0.1% for magnetic field at surface of star 
is 10^15 gauss. We explored the difference of our results from neutron 
star and quark star. the possibility of detection for this difference 
from magnetic field in the future gravitational wave observations are 
also discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhenyu', 'last_name': 'Zhu', 'fullName': 'Zhu, Zhenyu', 'id': '4641453', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt am Main', 'emailHash': '815f04e0807cbc37ad592e9c19740419', 'db_id': 4641453, 'person_id': 4733764}"
Poster Session,poster,Thermal Field Theory of the Tsallis statistics,"Rahaman, Mahfuzur","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, 1/AF, Bidhan Nagar, Kolkata - 700064, India and Homi Bhabha National Institute, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, India.",Unknown,"Classical and quantum Tsallis distributions have been widely used in many branches of natural sciences. But, the quantum field theory of the Tsallis distributions is relatively a less explored arena. In the article **arXiv:1906.02893v2 [hep-ph]**, we derived the expressions for the thermal two-point functions for the Tsallis statistics with the help of the corresponding statistical mechanical formulations. In the conference, we will show that the quantum Tsallis distributions used in the literature appear in the thermal part of the propagator much in the same way the Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions appear in the conventional thermal field theory. As an application of our findings, the thermal mass in the  $ \phi^4 $ scalar field theory within the realm of the Tsallis statistics will also be discussed.  For small system like quark gluon plasma (QGP) where the application of Boltzmann-Gibbsstatistics is uncertain, the thermal field theoretic formulation developed in this work for Tsallis statistics will have crucial importance. The thermal spectral function of quarks and gluons estimated using BG and Tsallis statistics will differ (as the case for $ \phi^4 $   interaction) which may have significant impact on the signals of QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mahfuzur', 'last_name': 'Rahaman', 'fullName': 'Rahaman, Mahfuzur', 'id': '4579071', 'affiliation': 'Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, 1/AF, Bidhan Nagar, Kolkata - 700064, India and Homi Bhabha National Institute, Anushaktinagar, Mumbai, India.', 'emailHash': 'fe278f0312f10cd64a6cc94fc00e6424', 'db_id': 4579071, 'person_id': 4584065}"
