Poster Session,poster,Strangeness production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 14.6 GeV using AMPT and UrQMD model,"Bhagat, Pratibha",University of Jammu,Unknown,"The production of strange quarks and antiquarks in high-energy collisions of
heavy ions is a significant indicator for the creation of a state of matter known
as Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The QGP is characterized by the liberation of
quarks and gluons from their confinement inside hadrons. Due to their prompt
decay via weak interactions, strange quarks and antiquarks are not present in
normal matter and can only be produced via strong interactions within the
QGP. As the mass of strange quarks and antiquarks is close to the temperature
at which protons, neutrons, and other hadrons dissolve into quarks, they serve
as sensitive probes for studying the conditions, structure, and evolution of the
deconfined state of matter.
The current work will compare the properties of different strange particles,
including Λ, Ξ, and Ω in heavy-ion collisions at varying centralities, using two
models for simulating these collisions: the AMPT and UrQMD models, by com-
paring the yield and the baryon-to- antibaryon ratio of these particles at different
centralities at √sN N = 14.6 GeV from the two models, we can better under-
stand the properties of the QGP medium and gain insight into the differences
and similarities between the two simulation models. The better understanding,
we can better understand the properties of the QGP medium and gain insight
into the differences and similarities between the two simulation models. The
ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide a more comprehensive understanding
of the production of strange particles in heavy-ion collisions and its implications
for the formation and properties of the QGP medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pratibha', 'last_name': 'Bhagat', 'fullName': 'Bhagat, Pratibha', 'id': '7824512', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu', 'emailHash': '02078569c2d7b74c63312a252e05ed21', 'db_id': 7824512, 'person_id': 7558345}"
Poster Session,poster,Entanglement entropy measurements from p-p collisions at LHC energies,"Hutson, Alek",University of Houston (US),Unknown,"In an effort to better understand the thermal-like behavior and particle yields seen in p-p collisions we recast the problem employing the principles of quantum states and their entanglement in the produced system. We seek to show that this entanglement in the initial state has a measurable effect on the evolution of the system and is the driving mechanism behind the thermal-like behavior and particle yields observed. Recent studies have demonstrated that entanglement in the initial state could endure the evolution of a strongly coupled system. Consequently, we attempt to show equivalence in a calculation of the initial state entropy (calculated using PDF’s) and the final state entropy (calculated using multiplicity distributions). Multiplicity distributions used in this study are that of primary charged particles, measured using the ALICE detector at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alek', 'last_name': 'Hutson', 'fullName': 'Hutson, Alek', 'id': '7993001', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston (US)', 'emailHash': 'd647c8d7868a3e88a9a7eacd7dfeb000', 'db_id': 7993001, 'person_id': 7682292}"
Poster Session,poster,Dilepton anisotropic flow from hadronic transport,"Hirayama, Renan",FIAS,Unknown,"We present the first results for dielectron anisotropic flow computed directly from hadronic transport in different systems, and explore the different calculation methods. Because leptons are insensitive to the strong interaction, they are mostly undisturbed by the hadronic medium created after a heavy-ion collision, and therefore serve as direct probes for it. In particular, the HADES experiment at GSI measures flow of dielectrons using the reaction plane method, which can lead to large systematic uncertainties. At the low beam energies of GSI, the evolution is mainly off-equilibrium, and hadronic transport provides an appropriate description and gives access to the full phase space, as well as knowledge on the dilepton origin, being a useful tool in studying the mechanisms behind flow generation from this off-equilibrium hadron resonance gas.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Renan', 'last_name': 'Hirayama', 'fullName': 'Hirayama, Renan', 'id': '7992979', 'affiliation': 'FIAS', 'emailHash': '603be4735966e1b2627bb195c94ca2ca', 'db_id': 7992979, 'person_id': 7533590}"
Poster Session,poster,Charm production in various scenarios of the QGP evolution,"Mykhaylova, Valeriya",University of Wrocław,Unknown,"We study the production of charm quarks in hot QCD medium described by quasiparticle excitations of quarks and gluons. The effective masses are adjusted through the coupling to satisfy the entropy density obtained on the lattice [1]. The evolution of the QGP is described by hydrodynamic simulations in (2+1) dimensions with temperature-dependent shear viscosity taken into account [1,2]. The temperature and time evolution of the charm quark number obtained in the above-described scenario is further juxtaposed to the results acquired from ideal QGP obeying Bjorken flow. We observe a suppression of charm quark production in the absence of shear viscosity and transverse expansion [3]. Moreover, we compute the charm quark fugacity by solving the rate equation and find that it exhibits a global attracting solution, specific to the differential equations [4].

Poster Session,poster,Antiproton production cross sections for dark matter search at the AMBER experiment @CERN,"Giordano, Davide",Università degli Studi di Torino / INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Multiple evidence reveals that the vast majority of the matter content of the universe is non baryonic and electrically neutral. This component is usually called Dark Matter (DM), for its lack of electromagnetic interactions, and is measured to constitute about 25% of the energy density of the Universe. The most common hypothesis is that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles, supposed to be cold thermal relics of the Big-Bang.
The indirect detection of DM is based on the search of the products of DM annihilation or decay. They should appear as distortions in the gamma ray spectra or in anomalies in the rare Cosmic Ray (CR) components. In particular, antimatter components, like antiprotons, antideuterons and positrons, promise to provide sensitivity to DM annihilation on top of the standard astrophysical production.
The interpretation of galactic CR data requires the correct modeling of their source terms and the turbulence spectrum of the galactic magnetic field, in addition to the knowledge of the cross sections that regulate the production of CR interacting with the interstellar medium. 
After PAMELA detector results, the antiprotons flux has been measured with an accuracy of a few percent by AMS-02 over an energy range from below 1 GeV up to a few hundreds of GeV. However, the only currently measured production cross section is the proton-proton one, while all the reactions involving helium have no laboratory data in the phase space covered by AMS-02 (only LHCb, but with incident proton energy of 6.5 TeV). This requires a scaling of the pp channel to pA interaction through approximation and modeling.
The AMBER fixed target experiment at the M2 beam line at CERN will contribute to this fundamental DM search, performing a unique and complementary measurement of the double differential antiprotons production cross-section with a proton beam ranging from 60 to 250 GeV/c impinging on a liquid He target.
The data taking for the experimental determination of the cross-section in p+4He scattering is scheduled for May-June 2023. This result from AMBER will directly pin down the production of anti-protons in the relevant kinematical region covered by AMS-02.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Davide', 'last_name': 'Giordano', 'fullName': 'Giordano, Davide', 'id': '7987038', 'affiliation': 'Università degli Studi di Torino / INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '4bc8defe2b91976b9480d00b8449e72b', 'db_id': 7987038, 'person_id': 7541164}"
Poster Session,poster,A Longitudinally Segmented Hadronic Calorimeter for the Forward Region of the Future ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion-Collider,"Ponce, Iris",Yale University,USA,"The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory will be an experimental facility to explore gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and the interactions within. The ePIC detector will be the first experiment at the EIC dedicated to detailed studies of nuclear structure in electron-proton and electron-ion collisions.

The ambitious physics program of the EIC requires a high performance hadronic calorimetry system in the hadron-going “forward” region. Accurate jet measurements are crucial to reconstruct the full 3D nucleon tomography and to study the gluon saturation region. The main goal of the Longitudinally segmented Forward HCal (lf-HCal) is measuring the energies of jets and distinguishing between overlapping jet depositions to high accuracy in the jet energy range up to 120 GeV.

lf-HCal is designed as a plastic scintillator-steel sandwich calorimeter. The plastic scintillator is transversely segmented into $5\times5$,cm${}^2$ tiles. Each tile is directly coupled to a silicon photomultiplier. The electrical signals of all photomultipliers are routed out of the lf-HCal to be digitized by external readout electronics.

This poster will present the current status as well as ongoing and future R&D of the lf-HCal for the ePIC experiment.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Iris', 'last_name': 'Ponce', 'fullName': 'Ponce, Iris', 'id': '7887446', 'affiliation': 'Yale University', 'emailHash': '684af907ad40cda7b2e834e479196bfc', 'db_id': 7887446, 'person_id': 7710398}"
Poster Session,poster,A modular perspective to the jet quenching from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets,"Palni, Prabhakar",IIT Mandi,Unknown,"In this contribution, we extend the scope of the JETSCAPE framework  to cover the jet radius ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}}$= 5.02 TeV for the most-central (0-10%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for inclusive jets to compare with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors in the jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$)  ranging from 100 GeV up to 1 TeV. The results predicted by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes within 10-20\%. We also calculate the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic multi-stage evolution of the parton shower. The calculations are then performed for low-virtuality-based evolution models like the MARTINI and the AdS/CFT, followed by a rigorous comparison between the former model's predictions and the CMS experiment's measurements.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Prabhakar', 'last_name': 'Palni', 'fullName': 'Palni, Prabhakar', 'id': '7884483', 'affiliation': 'IIT Mandi', 'emailHash': '1b3647dece178b1f98e8b6aabcae4ed3', 'db_id': 7884483, 'person_id': 7561386}"
Poster Session,poster,First measurement of femtoscopic correlation function between $D^0$ mesons and charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV at STAR,"Roy Chowdhury, Priyanka",Unknown,Unknown,"Heavy quarks are produced in hard partonic scatterings at the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions and they experience the whole evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium. Femtoscopic correlations, i.e. two-particle correlations at low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions as well as to the extent of the region from which the correlated particles are emitted. A study of such correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the medium.
        
In this poster, we will present the first measurement of femtoscopic correlations between $D^0-{\pi}$,  $D^0-K$, and $D^0-proton$ pairs at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using the data taken in the year 2014 and 2016 by the STAR experiment. $D^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the $K^{-}-{\pi}^{+}$ decay channel using topological criteria enabled by the Heavy Flavor Tracker with excellent track pointing resolution. We will present the femtoscopic correlation function for $D^0$ transverse momentum above 1 GeV/c in the $0-80\%$ centrality. We will also compare the experimental results with available theoretical models and discuss physical implications.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Priyanka', 'last_name': 'Roy Chowdhury', 'fullName': 'Roy Chowdhury, Priyanka', 'id': '7824275', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '7cc4c8d422625a18be555f66105c1a23', 'db_id': 7824275, 'person_id': 7562730}"
Poster Session,poster,Momentum shell and rapid stiffening in Quarkyonic matter from explicit duality,"Fujimoto, Yuki",University of Washington,USA,"Large-$N_c$ QCD implies a duality between confined baryons and deconfined quarks at high baryon densities; it is called Quarkyonic matter. We present a model of Quarkyonic matter that is explicitly dual between quarks and baryons. The duality means that the free energy of the matter is expressed in two ways: One is as a functional of the quark distribution function in the momentum space, $f_Q$, and the other as a functional of the baryon distribution function, $f_B$. We then posit the duality relation between $f_Q$ and $f_B$, which describes the binding of quarks into baryons.
We explicitly construct an analytic solution of this model and show that the theory has two distinct regimes: An ordinary nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at relatively high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, $f_B$ is underoccupied at low momentum and has an enhanced occupation at high momentum, which can be interpreted as that baryons sit on a shell in momentum space on top of a quark Fermi sea. Baryons and quarks do not interact except for the duality relation and the constraint that $f_Q$ and $f_B$ must satisfy $0 \le f_Q \le 1$ and $0 \le f_B \le 1$. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the sound velocity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuki', 'last_name': 'Fujimoto', 'fullName': 'Fujimoto, Yuki', 'id': '7884834', 'affiliation': 'University of Washington', 'emailHash': '7d09f4110758b347c989357fe817898b', 'db_id': 7884834, 'person_id': 7562766}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the mass spectrum of vector mesons in nuclei at J-PARC,"Murakami, Tomoki",Unknown,Unknown,"The mass spectrum of hadrons in finite-density QCD matter is believed to reveal the effects of partial chiral symmetry restoration. However, despite the importance of understanding QCD at finite density, decisive evidence linking the mass spectrum and chiral symmetry is still lacking.
The J-PARC E16 experiment aims to fill this gap with high-statistics measurements of vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$, $\phi$) in nuclei. The experiment will measure the momenta of electron-positron pairs from vector meson decays and reconstruct their invariant mass. 

To obtain large statistics, 
we use a new beamline at J-PARC that provides $30\,\rm{GeV}$-proton beams with an intensity of $1 \times 10^{10}$ protons/spill. 
The maximum hit rate reaches $15\,\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ and $5\,\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ at two innermost detectors, necessitating an innovative spectrometer for high-rate environments.

Since the experiment commenced in 2020, three commissioning runs have been conducted
  with a limited number of detectors. 
Partial results were reported at QM2022.
  The next run, scheduled for June 2023, aims to improve beam microstructures
  detected in the last run.
  Eight modules of detectors will be operated, as proposed for the first physics run.
In the commissioning runs so far,  
our detectors were successfully operated under the high-counting environment.
Tracking is performed using a layer of the Silicon Strip Detector and three layers of thin gas chambers with different sizes, all employing the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM).
Calibration is ongoing, but the current tracking resolution is sufficient to observe changes in the mass spectrum of vector mesons.
For the $\phi$ mesons, we anticipate a mass resolution of $5.8\,\rm{MeV/c^2}$, while a mass change of $35\,\rm{MeV/c^2}$ was observed in the preceding experiment, KEK-PS E325.
Electron identification is carried out using the Hadron Blind Detector and the Lead Glass Calorimeter installed outside the trackers. 
We achieved electron efficiency and pion rejection power consistent with the design values, at $57\%$ and  $99.97\%$ , respectively.

In this presentation, we will report the result of the run in June, including the detector performance
  and improvement of the beam microstructure, and discuss
 the anticipated outcomes for the physics run planned in 2024. 
 In the physics run, we aim to collect 15000 phi mesons, representing six-fold
improvement compared to the KEK-PS E325 experiment.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomoki', 'last_name': 'Murakami', 'fullName': 'Murakami, Tomoki', 'id': '7884756', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'b4d9bec944696c22f4723e5b32cef039', 'db_id': 7884756, 'person_id': 7562791}"
Poster Session,poster,Projected 3-point Energy Correlator measurements in jets in p-p at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13TeV with ALICE,"Rai, Ananya",Yale University (US),USA,"The sequential clustering of particles into jets offers an algorithmic connection of hadrons to the partons of the radiation shower. Jet substructure allows us to access the radiation history of a jet thereby providing a useful avenue to probe QCD through different energy scales. The N-point Energy Correlator (ENC) is a recently proposed observable that highlights this feature of jets as a multi-scale object. The evolution of jets from the perturbative (partonic) to non-perturbative (hadronic) regimes is imprinted in the slopes of the ENC. Experimentally, the ENC is defined as the energy-weighted cross-section of N particles in a jet as a function of their angular separation. This makes the ALICE detector suitable for these measurements due to its excellent momentum and track resolution. Theoretical calculations have shown excellent agreement with the recent measurement of the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in jets at ALICE $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in p-p as well as in jets at STAR $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in p-p.  Extending the EEC to the three-point correlator (EEEC) is the first step in extending the scaling information of the energy flow to a shape dependence. An intermediate step to achieving this goal is measuring the projected EEEC (E3C) which retains information about the largest angular scale of the correlation. The motivation to study the E3C is two-fold i) It has been shown theoretically that the projected E3C operators encode the same scaling information as the full E3C, a highly non-trivial property of this observable. ii) Taking ratios of the projected E3C with the EEC may enable us to better access perturbative QCD since it is known that the EECs are not immune to hadronization effects. Moreover, these ratios may offer precision tests of the coupling strength of the strong force, $\alpha_S$. In this poster, we will show the progress towards the first preliminary measurements of the projected E3C with ALICE at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13 TeV in p-p. We will also present simulation studies that extend these measurements to heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we will show the sensitivity of ENCs in jets to the heavy-ion background to motivate further measurements in the quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ananya', 'last_name': 'Rai', 'fullName': 'Rai, Ananya', 'id': '7824325', 'affiliation': 'Yale University (US)', 'emailHash': '099985cd574a51532994d0e8b4fa44f5', 'db_id': 7824325, 'person_id': 7551012}"
Poster Session,poster,Interpretable Machine Learning applications to Jet Background Subtraction,"Mengel, Tanner",University of Tennessee,USA,"Previous applications of machine learning to jet background subtraction have shown improvements over the traditional background subtraction methods, especially at low jet momentum. While machine learning applications generally lead to improvements, care must be taken to ensure they are not at the cost of interpretability and bias from models used for training. We present a novel application of symbolic regression to extract a functional representation of a deep neural network trained to subtract background for measurements of jets. With this functional representation we show that the relationship learned by a neural network is approximately the same as a new background subtraction method using the particle multiplicity in a jet. This multiplicity method uses measured features, rather than learned weights, to achieve most of the improvements demonstrated by the deep neural network. Additionally, we show the algorithmic complexity of the deep neural network can be decreased by reducing it to a shallower representation while still achieving similar performance. Our study demonstrates that interpretable machine learning methods can provide insights into underlying physical processes and achieve the performance of black-box machine learning without the opaqueness and model bias.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tanner', 'last_name': 'Mengel', 'fullName': 'Mengel, Tanner', 'id': '7912848', 'affiliation': 'University of Tennessee', 'emailHash': 'bbcffb02a5c31c7da717eeb775cc056e', 'db_id': 7912848, 'person_id': 7708478}"
Poster Session,poster,Generation of magnetic field in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Słoń, Patrycja",National Centre for Nuclear Research,UK,"Various interesting phenomena have been predicted to occur in a quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to a strong magnetic field which is also generated in these collisions. However, none of these predictions has been convincingly confirmed experimentally yet. So, the question is why? Our aim is to systematically discuss the problem of magnetic field generation. In particular, we argue that the currents induced in the plasma, which have been expected to sustain the magnetic field throughout the plasma lifetime, are much smaller than expected.

Poster Session,poster,Neutral pion and η meson production at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at √sN N = 200 GeV,"Chen, Dading",Unknown,Unknown,"Direct photons are useful probes to study the properties of QGP and the dynamic evolution of collision systems. Estimating and subtracting direct photons from hadron decays that contribute to the bulk of the measured photons is crucial and challenging. Although the most abundant source, $\pi^{0}$ $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$$\gamma$ is well studied and constrained. $\eta$ $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$$\gamma$ is less constrained and the related study is scarce below $p_{T}$ $<$ 2 $GeV/c$. The ratio,$\eta/\pi^{0}$ exhibits universal behavior regardless of collision system, energy, and centrality in high $p_{T}$ from the analysis of world data. However, associated measurements have been inconclusive in low $p_{T}$. Possible deviations from the universal behavior could be owing to the rapid radial hydrodynamic expansion of the $A+A$ collision system. PHENIX presents measurements of the centrality dependence of $p_{T}$ spectra of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ and their ratio in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV with large statistics data taken in the year 2014.

We will discuss the unfolding procedure to obtain such yields from raw data in a way to account for $p_T$ migration as well as correct for detector acceptance and efficiency. For the nuclear modification factor, we employ the double ratio $R_{xA}=(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^0)_{pp}/(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^0)_{xA}$ which can be shown to be analytically equivalent to the regular expression for $R_{xA}$, but using an experimentally determined metric for the number of binary collisions ($N_{coll}^{exp}=\gamma_{xA}^{dir}/\gamma_{pp}^{dir}$). As we will show, using this ratio has the advantage of canceling systematic uncertainties that are present in both $p+p$ and $^3\text{He}+\text{Au}$ collisions (such as the reduced production of high $p_T$ pions and $\gamma^{dir}$ due to cold nuclear matter effects and uncertainties due to the $p+p$ cross section), as well as detaching the nuclear modification factor from the Glauber model, thus minimizing biases on centrality determination which are particularly relevant for the studies of small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Firak', 'fullName': 'Firak, Daniel', 'id': '7824497', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'b870350e889f8c9dbb95cdc6fb9a66bc', 'db_id': 7824497, 'person_id': 7563162}"

In this analysis, we compare angular distributions of in-cone radiation across various medium profiles with effective scaling laws. Our findings indicate that the out-of-cone loss of energy occurs through the radiative break-up of hard fragments, which is followed by an angular broadening of soft fragments. Although the broadening of the leading fragments is substantially impacted by the dilution of the medium caused by expansion, we find that in the low-x range, which is accountable for the majority of gluon multiplicity in the cascade, the angular distributions are almost identical when comparing different medium profiles. This similarity is primarily because multiple splittings play a dominant role in broadening within this range. Lastly, we examine how our findings influence the phenomenological explanation of jet quenching and out-of-cone radiation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Souvik Priyam', 'last_name': 'Adhya', 'fullName': 'Adhya, Souvik Priyam', 'id': '7884942', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences', 'emailHash': 'a86e39803ec40cde5db72fcfdd1981b2', 'db_id': 7884942, 'person_id': 7552427}"

Model calculations have also predicted that directed flow could be sensitive to the softening of EoS associated with a first order phase transition. Directed flow of protons and anti-protons are also of interest as they offer sensitivity to both the contributions from the transported quarks and the component generated by medium interactions at the later stage. Measurements of proton and net proton directed flow from BES-I have shown that there is a non-monotonous dependence on collision energy. 
In this poster, We will present measurements of the directed flow of protons and antiprotons from 19.6, 14.5, 11.5, 9.2, and 7.7 GeV Au+Au collisions, using high statistics BES-II data from STAR.

Poster Session,poster,Chiral critical point via scalar-dilaton coupling in soft-wall AdS/QCD,"Bartz, Sean",Indiana State University,USA,"The AdS/CFT correspondence, which connects strongly coupled conformal field theories in $N$ dimensions to gravity in $N+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, has provided valuable insights into the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. Soft-wall AdS/QCD is a phenomenological model that uses a dilaton field to introduce confinement, while a scalar field is dual to the chiral condensate. The thermodynamics of the deconfined state are introduced using an asymptotically AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole, which includes both temperature and baryon chemical potential. Minimal models of this type yield a chiral phase transition that is not affected by the chemical potential, and thus lack a critical point.

In this work, we investigate the chiral phase transition in an AdS/QCD action that includes a coupling between the scalar and dilaton fields. Our results reveal that the scalar-dilaton coupling produces a rich phase structure, with the emergence of a critical point at finite temperature and density. The location and presence of the critical point is found to be highly sensitive to the strength of the scalar-dilaton coupling. We present results for both 3-flavor symmetric and 2+1 flavor cases. This work provides a foundation for future phenomenological applications, as well as dynamical models, which solve the scalar and dilaton fields using the gravitational equations of motion.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sean', 'last_name': 'Bartz', 'fullName': 'Bartz, Sean', 'id': '7884892', 'affiliation': 'Indiana State University', 'emailHash': '4e3d453704f1fa2cbe61458f20c68360', 'db_id': 7884892, 'person_id': 7563298}"

Here we update our hadron resonance list to the PDG 2021 including all $*~–****~$ states and make direct comparisons to lattice QCD susceptibilities and partial pressures where an improvement is seen since recently-observed particles have been included in the strange baryonic sector.  Additionally, we reanalyze thermal models with this new list and extract the freeze-out temperatures.  A next crucial step is to reformat our list to be compatible with SMASH such that hydrodynamic simulations can use the latest PDG list as well [1]. Before this change, SMASH has approximately half of the resonances included in the PDG 2021 list.  To include these new states in SMASH we have rewritten the list that contains $1\to3$ and $1\to4$ body decays to include only $1\to2$ body decays and study this change on the particle spectra and mean transverse momentum.  Finally, we find that the additional states improve the SMASH cross-sections, although some rescaling is required.

Poster Session,poster,Bulk Viscosity of Hadronic Matter from a Microscopic Transport Model,"Demir, Nasser",Kuwait University (KW),Unknown,"Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC are thought to have created a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) with a very low shear viscosity in the deconfined phase. However, as the QGP hadronizes it will evolve through a hadronic phase with rapidly increasing shear viscosity. In order to fully characterize the QGP state, one has to separately determine the viscosity of the hadronic phase.  Although many approaches have been used to determine the shear viscosity coefficient and the associated shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\frac{\eta}{s}$) in the hadronic phase, much is unknown regarding the bulk viscosity to shear viscosity coefficient ($\frac{\zeta}{s})$ in the hadronic phase.  We present preliminary results of a calculation of the bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio $\frac{\zeta}{s}$ for hot hadronic matter.  The Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is used to simulate the hadronic medium and periodic boundary conditions are used to simulate infinite hot equilibriated hadronic matter.  The Green-Kubo formalism is employed and a comparison is made with the results of the bulk viscosity calculation from the Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly Interacting Hadrons (SMASH) model from [1].

This observation offers an opportunity to bridge low-energy nuclear physics and high-energy collisions. Many recent works have concentrated on using the initial geometry to predict final flow data and see if nuclear shape differences would be visible. In this work, we build upon the results in [1]  and actually run hydrodynamics and study how each phase (free streaming, Landau matching, expansion, hadronic transport) are related to the initial nuclear shapes seen in data. The simulations were performed using the public available X-SCAPE framework, which allows for the integration of different stages of the collision dynamics. We consider five different nuclear configurations, where we continuously change the nuclear shape from the $^{96}_{44}$Ru to $^{96}_{40}$Zr.

Poster Session,poster,Color-superconductivity of asymptotically conformal quark matter as a portal between astrophysics and heavy ions collisions,"Ivanytskyi, Oleksii",University of Wroclaw,Unknown,"We present a relativistic density functional approach to color superconducting quark matter that mimics quark confinement by a fast growth of the quasiparticle self-energy in the confining region [1]. The approach is shown to be equivalent to a chiral model of quark matter with medium dependent couplings. The approach to the conformal limit at asymptotically high densities is provided by a medium dependence of the vector-isoscalar, vector-isovector and diquark couplings motivated by non-perturbative gluon exchange [2]. While the (pseudo)scalar, vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector sectors of the model are fitted to the mesonic mass spectrum and vacuum phenomenology of QCD, the strength of interaction in the diquark channel is varied in order to obtain the best agreement with the observational constraints from measurements of mass, radius and tidal deformability of neutron stars. These constraints favor an early onset of deconfinement and color superconductivity in neutron stars with masses below one solar mass. We also discuss a new two-zone interpolation scheme for the construction of the hadron-to-quark matter transition [3] that allows to test different structures of the QCD phase diagram with one, two or no critical endpoints in simulations of supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions. We argue that the formation of color-superconducting quark matter drives the trajectories of its evolution in supernovae and neutron star mergers towards the regimes reached in terrestrial experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,The freezeout procedure with the method of moments,"Brito, Caio",Universidade Federal Fluminense,Unknown,"The method of moments has been employed to derive relativistic fluid-dynamical theories from the Boltzmann equation for the past decades [1]. This approach consists in expanding the single-particle distribution function using a basis of irreducible momenta, where the expansion coefficients are the irreducible moments of the nonequilibrium distribution function [2]. Unlike the Chapman-Enskog method [3], it has the advantage of yielding formulations that might be causal and stable, provided the transport coefficients satisfy certain constraints [4]. However, so far, only the equations of motion for the hydrodynamic moments have been explicitly calculated, with the equations of motion for the moments of rank 3 and 4 being calculated recently, in Ref. [5]. In this contribution, we address this problem by systematically calculating the general equations of motion for all irreducible moments and show how they can be used to solve the Boltzmann equation itself. Since this method of solving the Boltzmann equation does not rely on resolving particle degrees of freedom, it can be used to provide a more consistent description of the freezeout process that does not require a particlization procedure. We investigate this prescription in a Bjorken flow scenario and investigate with detail the transition from a fluid description to a transport one.

It is therefore important to find orthogonal observables to constrain the initial conditions separately from the viscosity. New observables have been measured at the LHC and shown to be sensitive to initial conditions and less to medium properties, specifically factorization breaking ratios appears to be promising. Here we consider two initial condition models, NeXus and TRENTO. While both models yield similar results for the scaled flow harmonic distributions both at the LHC and RHIC, they lead to quantitatively much more different patterns for the factorization breaking ratios at RHIC than at LHC, due to the shorter lifetime. For the same reason, not only final state interactions but also initial free streaming matter in these predictions and differences between these are enhanced at RHIC compared to LHC. Therefore experimental factorization breaking ratios at RHIC top energy would be interesting to get.

Poster Session,poster,Study of multiplicity-dependent ρ0(770) production in pp collisions with ALICE,"Lim, Hyunji",Pusan National University (KR),USA,"Short-lived resonances are ideal probes to study the properties of the hadron gas phase created in heavy-ion collisions in the post-hadronization phase. Since the resonance lifetime is comparable to that of the hadron gas phase, their yields are affected by the competing rescattering and regeneration effects. These can be studied experimentally by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived hadron as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity, which is directly connected to the lifetime of the hadron gas phase. In this context, the $\rho^{0}(770)$ resonance is particularly interesting due to its very short lifetime of about 1.3 fm/$c$. The measurement of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ production yield in low-multiplicity collisions, corresponding to a very short duration of the hadron gas phase, serves as a fundamental reference for measurements in heavy-ion collisions.  

In this poster, recent ALICE measurements of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ production in pp collisions as a function of multiplicity are presented. The results are discussed together with existing measurements in other collision systems in the context of the state-of-the-art phenomenological models used to describe particle production at LHC energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hyunji', 'last_name': 'Lim', 'fullName': 'Lim, Hyunji', 'id': '7824267', 'affiliation': 'Pusan National University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'a61ed56b5d264b87e7e09c5d371df28a', 'db_id': 7824267, 'person_id': 7560184}"
Poster Session,poster,Understanding effect of event-by-event fluctuations on light-nuclei yield ratio,"Murase, Koichi","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University",UK,"We investigate how the event-by-event fluctuations of the final-state distribution function of nucleons physically affect the yield ratio of light nuclei based on the coalescence model.

The yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N_d^2$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively) [1,2], is one of the observables suggested for a possible signal of the critical point of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Based on the analyses with idealized setups, the yield ratio is known to be sensitive to the two-point neutron correlation and thus to the critical correlations. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions, such as anisotropic flows [3] and the event-by-event fluctuations coming from the initial state.

In this talk, we establish a qualitative understanding of how event-by-event fluctuations affect the yield ratio [4]. We model the ``single-event'' distribution $f(x,p)$ by a superposition of $n$-Gaussian hot spots in phase space and randomize the positions and magnitudes of the hot spots from event to event. We obtain analytical formulae for the yields of light nuclei and related ratios under this setup. We investigate how each feature of the event-by-event distribution affects the yield ratio. We find that the event-by-event fluctuations increase the yield ratio, where the value takes maximum at a particular hot-spot number $n$ depending on the fireball size. We also discuss the scale separation between the critical correlations and short-range thermal fluctuations using two different sizes of hot spots. The scale of critical correlations is bounded by the finite spacetime size of the fireball. We find that the effect in the yield ratio becomes larger for larger separation of hot-spot sizes. These understandings of the yield ratio will be important in analyzing the results of future realistic analyses based on state-of-the-art dynamical models.

Information on the final state interactions amongst the particles under study can also be extracted from the measurement. For example, from the p-$\Lambda$ and p-$\Xi^-$ correlation functions, one could study the hyperon-nucleon (Y-N) interactions in such collisions. It is particularly interesting to study the dependence on the collision energy of the source size at the moment of freeze-out. The STAR fixed-target program from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3.0$ to 7.7 GeV has enabled us to investigate the high baryon density region from $\mu_{\rm B}$ = 420 to 750 MeV.



In this poster, the first measurements of p-$\Lambda$ and p-$\Xi^-$ correlation functions in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3.2$, 3.5, and 3.9 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR will be presented.  The results will be compared with the data from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV Au + Au collisions ($\mu_{\rm B}$ = 750 MeV) and the data from higher energies [1, 2], where $\mu_{\rm B}$ is close to 0, along with model calculations generated via the UrQMD hadronic transport model and CRAB afterburner.

The latter resums an infinite series of ladder diagrams for heavy-light interactions appropriate for a strongly coupled QGP which are implemented via half-off-shell amplitudes accounting for recoil corrections and interference effects (related to the imaginary part of the Q-Qbar potential). In particular, the T-matrix approach accounts for non-trivial thermal-parton spectral functions in the QGP with an equation of state that agrees with lattice-QCD results, thus ensuring consistency between the heavy- and light-parton sectors. We compare these rates to perturbative ones as previously employed in semiclassical transport calculations and to those utilized in currently employed quantum transport approaches.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on mixed harmonic cumulants at the LHC,"Murase, Koichi","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University",UK,"We analyze the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on normalized mixed harmonic cumulants ($nMHC$) [1,2] for the first time based on event-by-event simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions using an integrated model of an initial state model, stochastic causal fluctuating hydrodynamics, and a hadronic afterburner.

For the quantitative constraints on the transport properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the initial-state models, it is important to compare various flow correlations from dynamical models to data.  Recently, $nMHC$ was shown to be useful in constraining theoretical models [3].  Meanwhile, we have shown that hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the longitudinal factorization ratio $r_n(\eta_a,\eta_b)$ [4] and can reproduce the experimental centrality dependence with initial longitudinal fluctuations [5].  However, it is non-trivial how the hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the constraints on the QGP properties through various flows and correlations.

In this talk, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on $nMHC$ in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. We combine the $\mathtt{TRENTo}$ initial conditions and the $\mathtt{UrQMD}$ afterburner used in Refs. [3,6] with relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics $\mathtt{rfh}$ [6].  We first compare the results with and without hydrodynamic fluctuations and see the effect.  We next consider different temperature dependencies of viscosity. We find that the hydrodynamic fluctuations tend to decrease $nMHC$, which is because they de-correlate initial correlations. In particular, $nMHC(v_2^2,v_3^2)$ is sensitive to the hydrodynamic fluctuations but almost insensitive to the viscosity. We also discuss the effect of the rapidity gap. We argue that $nMHC$ is useful for identifying the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations and is a key to properly constraining the theoretical models.

In this model, we initialize the QGP in a completely gluon dominated state, as motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models. Local light and strange quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. This impacts the system through the equation of state, which we have constructed to depend on the quark flavor content throughout the QGP.

Using this model, implemented in the MUSIC hydrodynamic code and iS3D particlization code, we have simulated ensembles of Pb+Pb and Au+Au collision events with varying quark chemical equilibration times. We discuss the observed dependence of hadronic and electromagnetic observables on the equilibration time. We also examine the impact of quark chemical equilibration on the transport properties of the QGP, and show preliminary results for a Bayesian model-to-data comparison that will  simultaneously constrain the equilibration times and transport coefficients of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Gordeev', 'fullName': 'Gordeev, Andrew', 'id': '7884588', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '5ff048e17e6b389cc8449ca4ddf9d63a', 'db_id': 7884588, 'person_id': 7561207}"

The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the future Facility for Anti-Proton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt offers the perfect conditions to explore the production of hypernuclei. The excitation function of hypernucleus production exhibits its maximum in the FAIR energy range.

Poster Session,poster,Repulsive $\Lambda$ potential at high densities examined from heavy-ion collision and hypernuclear data,"Jinno, Asanosuke",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We investigate the validity of the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential at high densities which suppresses $\Lambda$ in dense neutron star matter by investigating whether it reproduces the heavy-ion collision and the hypernuclear data.

In the 20th cenury, $\Lambda$ baryon was predicted to appear in neutron star matter at $2$-$4\rho_0$ from the hypernuclear spectroscopy and the phenomenology of dense neutron star matter. However, most of the hyperonic matter equations of state cannot support the observed massive neutron stars (hyperon puzzle). One of the proposed scenarios is that the $\Lambda$NN three-body force generates enough repulsion to suppress $\Lambda$s in the dense nuclear matter. From chiral effective field theory, a $\Lambda$ potential that satisfies this scenario has been obtained (Gerstung et al. (2020)). However, the density dependence of this potential has not been verified using experimental data.

In this talk, we will report that the above $\Lambda$ potential reproduces the experimental data of heavy-ion collisions and $\Lambda$ hypernuclei. We have found that the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential explains both data on the $\Lambda$ directed flow of heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$−$20~{\rm GeV}$ within a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics implemented in JAM2 (Nara et al. (2022)), and the $\Lambda$ binding energy of hypernuclei by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method with spherical symmetry (Jinno et al. in prep.). We conclude that the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential with two- and three-body force can be a solution for the hyperon puzzle.

On the other hand, it is found that more attractive potential can also explain the both heavy-ion collision and hypernuclear data. To discriminate the repulsive $\Lambda$ potentials to attractive ones, we will also examine ${}^3_\Lambda {\rm H}$ directed flow of heavy-ion collisions, which is recently measured by the STAR collaboration (STAR, arXiv:2211.16981) and is overestimated by the old version of JAM.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Asanosuke', 'last_name': 'Jinno', 'fullName': 'Jinno, Asanosuke', 'id': '7884763', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'ca785abda4ddbd6e21f354858fcccb47', 'db_id': 7884763, 'person_id': 7562154}"

Poster Session,poster,Universality of quark/gluon energy loss using Bayesian inference,"Falcão, Alexandre",University of Bergen,Unknown,"Experimental data on a wide range of jet observables measured in heavy ion collisions provide a rich picture of the modification of jets as perturbative probes and of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. However, their interpretation is often limited by the assumptions of specific quenching models, and it remains a challenge to establish model-independent statements about the universality of different jet quenching observables.
  
In this work, we address this issue by proposing a treatment that is agnostic to the details of the jet-medium interactions and relies only on the universality of quark and gluon quenching in different jet observables. We use Bayesian inference to constrain the parameterisation of the energy loss of quark- and gluon-initiated jets in a data-driven manner. This constraint is primarily performed using the inclusive jet pT spectrum, for which the quark/gluon fraction varies across rapidity. We then predict the observed jet asymmetry in di-jet and boson-jet measurements, providing evidence for the universality of quenching effects.

No longitudinal broadening was observed. These smaller systems are either too small or too short-lived to manifest viscous effects based on the $G_{2}$ observable.

In this contribution, identified charged particles $G_{2}$ in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions at the same nucleon--nucleon collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV) in different multiplicity classes measured with the ALICE detector are presented.

The recent discovery of entanglement enabled spin interference in photonuclear heavy-ion collisions offers a powerful new avenue for exploring gluon distributions at high energy with RHIC and the LHC in the years leading up to the EIC. Most importantly, these novel polarization dependent observables provide direct access to information for constraining gluon transverse spatial distribution inside large nuclei. This poster discusses calculations of polarization dependent diffractive $J/\psi$ production at RHIC and LHC energies using the color glass condensate effective theory. The predictions have been extended to EIC energies and conditions, showing that strong azimuthal modulations are expected due to the initial photon polarization in diffractive photonuclear production at the EIC.

Poster Session,poster,Physics prospects of central exclusive production in pp collisions with ALICE Run 3 data,"Kim, Minjung",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"Central exclusive production (CEP) is a diffractive process in which the colliding particles remain intact. Three different processes are involved: photon-photon exchange, photon-pomeron exchange and double-pomeron exchange. Each process produces distinguishable states with specific sets of quantum numbers, making CEP measurements a unique tool for searching for exotic resonances. Furthermore, measurements of well-known states in CEP can provide a clean probe of the structure of matter. For example, the photoproduction of the J/𝜓 (via photon-pomeron exchange) can be used for probing the low-𝑥 gluon content of protons.

In ALICE, events of the CEP can be identified by its signature of double-gap in pseudorapidity. Relying on the tracking and particle identification capabilities in the central barrel of ALICE, various final state two particle systems can be measured including 𝜋+𝜋− and 𝐾+𝐾−. In addition, heavy vector mesons such as J/𝜓 can be studied via their decay into 𝑒+𝑒− pair.

Poster Session,poster,On the gravitational wave emission in the magnetic field of a heavy-ion collision,"Gasik, Piotr",GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE),Germany,"On the gravitational wave emission in the magnetic field
of a heavy-ion collision

In the classic 1961 paper of Gertsenshtein [1] he demonstrated that an electromagnetic wave can be transformed into a gravitational wave when propagating through an external, transverse magnetic field. Later in 1973, Zel’dovich calculated the fraction of energy of the electromagnetic wave transformed into the energy of the gravitational wave in such a process in astrophysical situations [2].
In the following, we investigate a possibility of a transition of an electromagnetic wave into a gravitational wave in the high magnetic field expected to be formed in heavy-ion collisions.

Electromagnetic radiation, emitted in all stages of a heavy-ion collision, reflects the evolution of the latter and encodes the information on the properties of the created medium, such as fireball lifetime, temperature, acceleration, and polarization. This information can be decoded by studying di-lepton spectra by means of their invariant mass reconstruction. The slope of the di-lepton excess spectrum measured in the intermediate-mass region provides information on the temperature of the emitting medium.

In the poster, we discuss the modification of a slope value due to the excitation of a gravitational wave by light emitted from the medium in the magnetic field generated in a non-central heavy-ion collision. Based on several simplifications, we estimate the possible redshift and conclude the effect is not detectable with heavy-ion experiments planned in the foreseeable future. However, with this contribution, we also want to trigger a discussion on the emerging field of ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves physics and its possible relation to high-energy heavy-ion collision physics.

For the first time we extract participant fluctuations directly from the data used for the fluctuation analysis, i.e., without involving model calculations [1]. To achieve this we exploit a dedicated event-mixing algorithm. Participant fluctuations are extracted by constructing cumulants of multiplicity distributions for different particle species and covariances between all possible pairs of particles.

Poster Session,poster,The most vortical baryonic matter,"Akridge, Zachary",Indiana University,USA,"The study of strongly interacting matter under external conditions (such as high temperatures and/or baryon densities) provides unique insights into its fundamental theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A nonzero angular momentum imposed on a QCD system can bring rich and intriguing phenomena, with the proton spin structure being a perfect example. A much larger QCD system with substantial angular momentum, produced by non-central heavy ion collisions, has attracted a lot of interest recently. This angular momentum induces nontrivial vortical fluid patterns in the fireball formed by the collision and eventually leads to spin polarization of final state hadrons, as shown by experimental measurements from the STAR, ALICE and HADES Collaborations. A clear understanding of the angular momentum initial conditions for the fireball, such as the total amount and its rapidity distribution, is, however, still lacking. In this talk, we demonstrate how baryon stopping plays a key role for the deposition of angular momentum toward the mid-rapidity region. By calculating rapidity loss after multiple binary collisions for wounded nucleons, we quantify the angular momentum initial conditions for heavy ion collisions from GeV to TeV beam energies. This also allows us to explain the beam energy dependence of experimental data for spin polarization as well as to reveal a nontrivial correlation between net baryon number and initial angular momentum in the fireball. Finally we introduce the ratio of angular momentum to net baryon number as a measure for comparing “spinning-ness” and show that the most spinning baryonic matter, created in heavy ion collisions at energies of a few GeV, is about an order of magnitude higher than a proton in terms of this measure.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Akridge', 'fullName': 'Akridge, Zachary', 'id': '7884507', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University', 'emailHash': 'bdb4e5c81f529fcbe01d558777b94839', 'db_id': 7884507, 'person_id': 7559335}"

Poster Session,poster,The study of $v_{2}$ with a new double-differential event categorization using multiplicity and spectator neutrons in PHENIX,"Shimomura, Maya",Nara Women's University (JP),Japan,"When studying the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, it is necessary to classify the events based on the size and shape of the QGP. Typically, events are categorized by mapping the impact parameter, which cannot be measured directly, to a bulk observable that varies monotonically with it, such as soft particle production. In the mapping, fluctuations in the initial state nuclei and the nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken into account. Even a tight experimental centrality based solely on multiplicity includes events with quite different shapes due to these fluctuations. To select much more homogeneous sub-samples of events, adding a second, independent qualifier is helpful. A decade ago, event-shape engineering proposed the flow vector as a second qualifier, but it is influenced by final state interactions. Instead, we use spectator neutrons measured in the zero-degree calorimeter of PHENIX as the second dimension. This new approach provides a more precise way to categorize QGP events, which has important implications for understanding the underlying physics of heavy ion collisions. By using this novel 2D event characterization in Au$+$Au collisions at RHIC, we will demonstrate elliptic flow results with tighter constraints on the initial geometry.

Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic initial conditions from non-linear causality,"Hoshino, Tau",Sophia University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been successful in describing space-time evolution of matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. It is conventionally supposed that the created matter starts to behave as fluids all at once at a certain initial time. It is, however, not at all trivial from which stage after the collision the fluid picture can be applied to the system. According to the hydrodynamization theory [1], any solutions of hydrodynamic equations converge to an attractor. Thus, hydrodynamic description might be justified anyway even starting from the system far away from local equilibrium. Do we really describe space-time evolution of the system using hydrodynamics even when the system is far away from local equilibrium? In this study, we address this issue from a point of view of causality. 
A recent study shows necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions to be causal in non-linear relativistic hydrodynamic equations [2]. When they are applied to numerical hydrodynamic simulations, it turns out that causality tends to be violated at the early time and/or in peripheral regions [3]. This indicates that violation of causality has something to do with how far the system is away from local equilibrium. Motivated by these observations, we scrutinize a one-dimensionally expanding conformal system from a view point of causality and constrain the initial conditions whose solutions by no means violate the causality. We first define the degree of non-equilibrium and then describe its time evolution solving the Muller-Israel-Stewart type constitutive equation in one-dimensionally expanding system. We find that it is acausal in fact when the system is far away from local equilibrium. Using these solutions, we quantify a range of the inverse Reynolds number in which hydrodynamic description is justified from a view point of causality. This sheds light on the understanding of initial stages in high-energy nuclear collisions.

In such ultra-high-density matter, many phenomena are expected, such as the transition to the non-confined phase. Among those, a few things are well understood about high-density matter, both theoretically and experimentally, and these are currently being actively studied.
 
J-PARC Heavy Ion Project (J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project to generate and study ultra-high-density matter using 1-12A GeV heavy ion beams. Although the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, it has successfully supplied a high-intensity beam of about 60kW even in slow extraction. Therefore, the J-PARC-HI case will expect high-flux beams with excellent performance. In other words, only the injector must be newly constructed, and the acceleration afterwards will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme is being studied in detail by the J-PARC accelerator group.
 
We have the staging plan of the project into two stages. In the first stage, a booster ring will reuse the KEK-PS. Even in this stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of $10^{8}$Hz. In the second stage, a new booster ring will be constructed where the highest intensity heavy ion beam of $10^{11}$Hz is expected. We consider the primary goal of the first stage as the confirmation of non-confined phases in high-density regions.

Poster Session,poster,Topological separation of dielectron signals using machine learning in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Dielectrons are an exceptional tool to study the evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. In central collisions, the energy densities are sufficient to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Thermal e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs with invariant masses around 1.5 GeV/$c^{2}$ can be used to estimate the early average temperature of the QGP. 

At LHC energies, the cross section of heavy-flavour (HF) production is large and correlated HF hadron decays dominate the dielectron yield for invariant masses above 1.1 GeV/$c^2$. Their contribution is modified in the medium compared to elementary collisions to an unknown extent, leading to large uncertainties in the subtraction of known hadronic sources. Alternatively, a topological separation based on the larger decay length of HF hadrons of the order of $c\tau \approx 100-500\;\mu$m, can be utilised to disentangle them from the contribution of thermal dielectrons originating from the primary vertex. To classify these pairs, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be applied to capture the complex multidimensional correlations in the tracking parameters.

In this poster, ML techniques to classify dielectron sources based on their decay topology with the ALICE detector will be presented for simulated Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Their performance will be compared to the established analysis on the distance-of-closes approach (DCA) to the primary vertex.

Poster Session,poster,Measuring the Global Spin Alignment of Vector Mesons in Heavy Ion Collisions by STAR,"Robertson, C.W.",Purdue University,USA,"In non-central Heavy-Ion collisions, a large orbital angular momentum is produced. A part of the orbital angular momentum can polarize the quarks and anti-quarks, hence the vector mesons, inside the medium. Recently, STAR measured the global spin alignment of φ(1020) mesons in Au+Au collisions from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan I (BES I) program [1].

The global spin alignment, quantified by the 00th coefficient of the spin density matrix ρ00, is measured by a fit to the acceptance and efficiency corrected φ meson yield versus polar angle (θ∗) between the daughter kaon in the parent’s rest frame and the orbital angular momentum direction.

In this poster, we present an alternative approach to extract ρ00 by utilizing the ⟨cos2 θ∗⟩ as a function of pair-invariant mass instead of analyzing the φ meson yields in cos θ∗ bins. The acceptance and efficiency effects are taken into account by using the combinatorial background. This method only uses the signal to background ratio and is insensitive to few percent variations in the yield vs. θ∗. We report preliminary results from this method and compare with previous measurements by STAR.

Poster Session,poster,Analysis of the critical fluctuations in the light-nuclei production,"Wu, Shanjin",Peking University,Unknown,"We investigate the critical fluctuations in light-nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions based on the coalescence model, where we introduce corrections to the distribution function from critical correlators from the Ising model.

The measurement of the yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N^2_d$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively), in STAR collaboration [1], has shown a non-monotonic behavior as a function of collision energy in a heavy-ion collision. Based on the analyses with idealized setups, it was also suggested that the yield ratio is one of the observables for a possible signal of the QCD critical point [2]. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions. In our previous study, we expanded the distribution function of nucleons in terms of phase-space cumulants [3] and found that the effect of cumulants cancels in the yield ratio up to the second order, which also includes the effect of radial expansions.

In the first part of this talk, we further investigate the effect of non-trivial phase-space distributions [3] by example distributions including the Woods-Saxon distribution, two Gaussian forms, and the blast-wave-type anisotropic flows. We find that the spatial structure decreases the ratio while the momentum anisotropy increases it. In the second part, we extend our analysis by evaluating the critical effect in the generalized light-nuclei ratio $N_p^{B-A}N_B^{A-1}/N_A^{B-1}$ [4,5] with $N_A$ being the nuclei yield of mass number A.  We introduce the critical correction to the phase-space distribution by employing the critical fluctuations from the Ising model.  We find that the overall non-monotonic behavior of the yield ratio arises from the increasing correlation length near the critical point. In addition, if the strength of the critical fluctuation is sufficiently significant, the collision energy dependence of the ratio exhibits double peaks by the interplay between the two- and three-point critical corrections.

It later emerged that BFs are rather sensitive to the radial expansion dynamics of the matter formed in these collisions and can, in principle, be used to probe hadron production mechanisms such as the formation of clusters. Later still, it was found that the azimuthal dependence of hadrons BFs, particularly heavier hadrons, is sensitive to  the  diffusivity of light quarks. In this work, we show how the conservation of quantum numbers can be properly accounted for and how cross-species BF can be exploited to determine the relative strengths of distinct species pairs  from heavy hadron decay feeddowns, long range correlations arising at the onset of collisions, and  contributions from baryon stopping. We addtionally  examine the possibility of  probing the degree of equilibration achieved in A--A collisions (at both RHIC and LHC energies) as well as the evaluation  of QGP susceptibilities by means of measurements of charge, strange, and baryon BFs.

Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic theories for a system of classical weakly self-interacting ultra-relativistic scalar particles,"Soares Rocha, Gabriel",Unknown,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely employed in high energy nuclear physics, with applications in heavy-ion collisions, neutron star mergers and coalescing matter in black holes [1]. Due to the acausality and instability of relativistic Navier-Stokes (NS) theory [2], one usually employs Israel-Stewart-like (IS) formulations of fluid dynamics [3] in which the constitutive relations for the dissipative currents are replaced by relaxation type equations. This comes at the expense of a more complex structure of the partial differential equations being solved, which renders the assessment of features of solutions in the non-linear regime very intricate. More recently, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory has emerged [4], where theorems for causality, linear stability and existence of solutions can be rigorously established, but unconventional matching conditions are required. For all of the aforementioned theories, transport coefficients play a fundamental role. However, their computation is usually a very non-trivial task, even in the context of Kinetic Theory. We show that this difficulty can be circumvented for a system composed of classical ultra-relativistic scalar particles weakly interacting via a quartic potential. Then, the specific form of the cross-section [5] allows for the computation of transport coefficients without approximations beyond the power-counting scheme of the corresponding hydrodynamic theory. In this contribution, we calculate all transport coefficients of NS, BDNK and IS theories and demonstrate, in a Bjorken flow scenario, that NS and BDNK theories are pathological for large gradients and thus cannot be used to describe the early stages of heavy ion collisions. For BDNK and IS theories, attractor solutions are also analyzed.

In this contribution, we present intermittency analysis of the normalized factorial moments ($F\rm{_{q}}$) of the multiplicity distributions of the charged particles produced in Pb--Pb collisions as a function of phase-space resolution. The spatial configurations of the charged particles in two-dimensional ($\eta,\varphi$) phase space are investigated. For a system with scale-invariant dynamical fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, the $F\rm{_{q}}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing phase-space resolution, which is a signature of self-similar fluctuations and the fractal structure of the system. The dependence of the fractal dimension $D_{q}$ on the order parameter $q$ is indicative of the multifractal nature of the system. By relating the $q^{\rm{th}}$-order $F\rm{_{q}}$ to the normalized second-order factorial moment ($F\rm{_{2}}$), we extract the scaling exponent ($\nu$), which provides information about the order of the phase transition in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The first results of the intermittency analysis show the presence of scale-invariant fluctuations, the multifractal nature of the system, and that $\nu$ is independent of $p\rm{_{T}}$ in the soft $p\rm{_{T}}$ region.

Poster Session,poster,Model study on bottomonia modification in small collision systems,"Lim, Sanghoon",Pusan National University (KR),USA,"Quarkonia have been long considered as key features in heavy ion collision to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. One of the key signatures is the sequential yield suppression for different quarkonium states in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions compared to p+p collisions following the ordering of their binding energies. Moreover, sequential yield modification has also been observed in small collision systems such p+Au and p+Pb collisions. Theoretical models consider dissociation and regeneration effects to describe these experimental results, whereas the additional suppression of excited states in small systems is considered to be beyond initial-state effects which is premature to claim for any hot medium effect. To quantitatively test and disentangle such hot medium effects, a model study is performed in various small collision systems such as p+p, p+Pb, p+O, and O+O collisions for $\Upsilon(nS)$ production. In this model, we incorporate a theoretical calculation of hot in-medium effects for $\Upsilon(nS)$ states into a Monte Carlo simulation to more realistically probe the medium produced in heavy ion collisions with event-by-event initial collision geometry and hydrodynamical evolution. The theory calculation considers gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering for dissociation and their inverse reaction for regeneration and reasonably describes the modification of $\Upsilon(1S)$ in Pb+Pb collisions.

The per-event yield of unfolded dijet pairs is presented in terms of kinematic variables that allow for full characterization of the partonic scattering system, i.e. the average $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of the dijet, $p_{\mathrm{T,Avg}} = (p_{\mathrm{T,1}} + p_{\mathrm{T,2}})/2$, the boost of the dijet system, $y^{b} = (y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{1} + y^{\mathrm{CN}}_{2})/2$, and the half rapidity separation between the jets, $y^{\ast} = |y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{1} - y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{2}|/2$. Initial state effects are investigated by constructing central-to-peripheral ratios of dijet yields, $R_{\mathrm{CP}}$. We present $R_\mathrm{CP}$ results comparing central collisions with peripheral ones rescaled by the nuclear thickness function $T_{AB}$, in order to equalize the two based on pure geometrical expectations. The $R_\mathrm{CP}$ shows a clear dependence on the Bjorken-$x$ of the parton extracted from the proton in the hard-scattering, $x_\mathrm{p}$, while no clear trend is observed while displaying the results as a function $x_\mathrm{Pb}$. These results will help in understanding the implications introduced by the initial state kinematics in $p$+Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Riccardo', 'last_name': 'Longo', 'fullName': 'Longo, Riccardo', 'id': '7912805', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

Poster Session,poster,Probing particle production and transport at top LHC Run 3 energy with ALICE,"Gonzalez, Victor",Wayne State University (US),United States,"Two-particle number and transverse momentum correlations are sensitive probes of particle production and transport in AA collisions.  Their shape and strength are sensitive to the interplay of all production processes, and are further influenced by transport mechanisms, including longitudinal,  radial, and anisotropic flow.  However, the correlations are also sensitive to instrumental effects, including distortions associated with  space-charge effects in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), to technical issues related to pile up rejection, suppression of contamination, and corrections for particle losses. It is thus a fundamental quality control for the ALICE data-taking machinery to perform analyses already completed and compare the results obtained with the new GEM readout, the new data-collecting machinery, and the new software framework, with those obtained with the prior TPC readout technology and overall scenario. 

In this contribution, two-particle number and transverse momentum correlations in different multiplicity classes of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\;\text{TeV}$ recorded by ALICE during the Run 3 at the LHC are reported. The very large datasets obtained in Run 3 will provide for a significant reduction of statistical and systematic uncertainties and enable more differential analyses of these correlations based on more varied and selective kinematic criteria.

The CGC effective theory and the HT factorization theorem are two established formalisms that describe multiple scatterings of quarks and gluons in nuclear media within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). These formalisms have distinct domains of validity in kinematic regions. Going beyond the shock wave approximation and considering the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, which arises from the interference of initial- and final-state scatterings, we show for the first time that CGC and HT formalisms can be unified to describe the same physics in the transition region where they overlap. This unified picture provides a framework for understanding the QCD dynamics in the transition from dilute to dense nuclear matter, paving the way for mapping out the QCD evolution phase diagram of nuclear medium from dilute to dense region.

The models can describe the measurements of $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^{+}$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{c}^{0,++}$, that don't contain a strange quark.

The study of various hadrons, characterized by diverse internal structures, constituent quark numbers, and quark species, has been essential for understanding QGP properties. It has become increasingly evident that hadron yields in nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions exhibit modifications compared to proton-proton collisions, which can be attributed to their internal structures. Therefore, analyzing the yields of hadrons with unidentified internal structures in such collisions can give valuable insights into their composition. Numerous hadrons with unknown internal structures, such as ${\rm f_0}$ mesons (e.g., ${\rm f_0}$(1500) and ${\rm f_0}$(1710), leading glueball candidates), have been observed in the mass range of 1-2 GeV/c$^2$
With its advanced particle identification capabilities, precise secondary vertex determination, and extensive data sample, the ALICE experiment is ideally suited for this study. These features are crucial as these mesons decay into hadrons with relatively long lifetimes, such as the ${\rm K^0_s K^0_s}$ pair.

These correlations arise due to quantum statistics, Coulomb and strong final state interactions. From the non-identical particle correlation study, particularly the hyperon-nucleon correlations, one can obtain information about the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars and the existence of various exotic hadrons (H-dibaryons).We report the calculations of femtoscopic correlations between proton and lambda  pairs in Au+Au events simulated using the Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via CRAB (Correlation After Burner) to account for the Final State Interaction among the emitted particles.

The generalization of SC to correlations involving different-order moments of flow amplitudes is not trivial, and it was accomplished only recently. These generalized flow observables are dubbed Asymmetric Cumulants (AC), and they by definition extract new and independent information in flow analyses that is not accessible either to $v_n$, nor to SC observables. 

In this contribution, the first feasibility study for centrality dependence of AC is presented for data-taking conditions in CBM experiment at FAIR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ante', 'last_name': 'Bilandzic', 'fullName': 'Bilandzic, Ante', 'id': '7824528', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '65e58f83f1ec1a2bc937d4fa18424a31', 'db_id': 7824528, 'person_id': 7541686}"
Poster Session,poster,Development of unfolding techniques for dijet measurements in sPHENIX,"Meskowitz, Micah",Unknown,Unknown,"The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a liquid created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions where quarks and gluons become deconfined. This state allows us to examine the emergent properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme conditions. sPHENIX, a new experiment at RHIC, studies the QGP created in Au-Au collisions and started taking data in 2023. Collimated sprays of particles, called jets, may be created in these collisions, typically in back-to-back (dijet) configurations. These dijets are produced prior to the formation of the QGP and interact with it during their development, losing energy ins a process called “jet quenching” which probes the nature of the QGP. When these dijets do not pass through the same path-length of QGP, the energy loss will be asymmetric. The dijet momentum imbalance (x$_J$) is defined as the ratio between the sub-leading (second highest energy) jet’s energy and the leading (highest energy) jet’s energy, and is a useful measure of energy loss. However, dijet measurements are sensitive to the underlying event and detector resolution. To correct for these effects we examine the development and application of Bayesian unfolding techniques on PYTHIA jets embedded into HIJING Au+Au background. Future uses will include implementation on measured dijet distributions in sPHENIX.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Micah', 'last_name': 'Meskowitz', 'fullName': 'Meskowitz, Micah', 'id': '7903142', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fa4ff85295c6ce28ecacfbbaa1f7658c', 'db_id': 7903142, 'person_id': 7709382}"

The sPHENIX calorimeter system consists of three sampling calorimeters: a tungsten and scintillating fiber electromagnetic calorimeter, and an aluminum (steel) and scintillating tile inner (outer) hadronic calorimeter. These calorimeters must be calibrated to reconstruct the full electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposited by jets. The jet level calibration combines Monte Carlo-based corrections and data-driven techniques to provide fully calibrated calorimeter jets for measurements of jet quenching in sPHENIX.

Poster Session,poster,The effects of hydrodynamic causality conditions on Bayesian analysis,"Siqueira Domingues, Thiago",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"Despite the success of hydrodynamic models in describing heavy-ion collisions, there have long been questions about its regime of validity.  Recently-derived conditions on the causality of the hydrodynamic equations [1] can give a concrete answer --- if evolution is acausal, it is not a faithful representation of the underlying QCD theory.  It is now known that current simulation models reach acausal regimes, at least sometimes.  

We study the phenomenological effects of this knowledge in the context of a comprehensive, multi-system model-to-data comparison that was originally performed by the JETSCAPE Collaboration [2].  Different ways are explored to include information about causality violation (and therefore the validity of the model) into the analysis, and its effects on the extracted physical properties.    Specifically, when performing Bayesian inference we can include the information in the prior probability (quantifying our trust in the model based on the degree or frequency of causality violation), or in the model uncertainty (estimating an increased uncertainty when there is violation of causality).   The resulting changes in the posterior give an indication of the uncertainty that is contributed by model (in)validity, and  the importance of addressing these fundamental issues in our treatment of heavy-ion collisions.

As an additional study, we identify various causes of acausality in hydrodynamic simulations, and therefore the best targets for designing more realistic models.

These measurements will be presented and compared to different nuclear formation models. The two most prevalent formation models—the thermal and coalescence models—are based on different underlying physics. A better understanding of (anti)nuclei production mechanisms is needed, which drives the effort to analyze high-statistics data sets from fixed-target experiments. Additionally, new updated measurements of proton, antiproton, π±, and K± spectra will be showcased, along with unique measurements of Omega and K0s production in p+p interactions.

Deuteron production measurements are important for understanding cosmic-ray antinuclei. The detection of cosmic antinuclei holds the potential to be a breakthrough approach for identifying dark matter signatures. The main source of cosmic antinuclei background are interactions between cosmic-ray protons and interstellar hydrogen gas. Gaining a deeper insight into deuteron production in p+p interactions is an essential first step in modelling these astrophysical processes.

The sPHENIX ElectroMagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) and Hadronic Calorimeter (HCal), used for the first time at RHIC, will provide good energy measurements for full jet reconstruction. sPHENIX will enable an unprecedented series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements at sPHENIX in 200 GeV p+p, p+Au and Au+Au collisions. In particular, the heavy flavor hadron inside jet production can provide vital information about the heavy quark hadronization process and how such process gets modified in a nuclear medium. Less recombination contribution to the hadron production is expected at RHIC compared to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, which makes these measurements an unique approach to explore the universality of heavy quark fragmentation functions in different nuclear environments.

Before physics analyses can take place using the EMCal, however, it must be calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale, and this will be done by calibrating the EMCal’s response relative the neutral pion’s ($\pi^0$) invariant mass. $\pi^0$’s are reconstructed from pairs of EMCal clusters that were produced by decay photons from $\pi^0$’s.  However, due to cluster merging effects, this procedure is not practical at high momentum. Thus, as a high-energy cross-check on the energy scale calibration, the calorimeter’s response relative to $\eta$ mesons, whose heavier mass allows for reconstruction without merging to much higher momenta, will also be measured. The EMCal’s successful calibration will enable measurements with the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons, which will take advantage of both sPHENIX’s large acceptance and the high luminosity 200 GeV Au + Au data set currently being recorded.

This poster will present the advancements made in calibrating both the inner and outer HCals utilizing cosmic ray muons. Energy deposited by muons traversing the sectors is recorded, and events in which muons pass through all scintillator tiles in a tower are selected for analysis. The primary diagnostic is the Most Probable Value (MPV) of the ADC distributions associated with these events. Subsequently, MPVs undergo corrections to account for temperature variations and the tower tiles’ response to LED signals. These corrected MPVs determine the gain of each tower. A Monte Carlo study, based on Geant4 simulations, will establish a reference for the relative calibration of the gains on a tower-by-tower basis. The bias voltage applied to the silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) will be adjusted to fine-tune the gain and eliminate the outliers, resulting in a more accurate calibration of the HCals.

A wavelength shifting fiber is glued into each tile using an optical epoxy with an index of refraction matching that of the scintillator. The tiles cover 16 segments in $\eta$ and 24 in $\phi$. The sectors were installed into two disks covering a pseudorapidity of 2.1 < |$\eta$| < 4.9. To build the detector, scintillating plastic was milled into a triangular shape to create 24 sectors.

Optical fibers were then glued into the grooves, and the channels were filled with a reflective epoxy to achieve optical isolation between tiles. An overview of this construction process will be given in detail, including the machining of the sectors, the installation of the fibers in the tiles, and the creation of two types of bundles of fiber optic assemblies.

In order to accurately track particles, calibrations must be performed and the performance of the TPC must be understood. As part of normal operation, space charge builds up within the TPC, leading to tracking distortions. These distortions must be accurately characterized over time such that they can be corrected as they evolve.

These integrated correlations cannot be described by conventional heavy-ion models, such as EPOS and AMPT. So far, the ALICE measurements can only be described by invoking the presence of condensates ~\cite{Kapusta:2022ovq}. A candidate for such a condensate is the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC)~\cite{Mohanty:2005mv}. DCC arises from chiral symmetry restoration in the QGP, which breaks during the phase transition to form a condensate which coherently emits hadrons. Therefore, the discovery of DCC would indicate that chiral symmetry is restored in the QGP, a major prediction of QGP formation that has yet to be confirmed experimentally. 

To investigate these anomalous kaon correlations further, a differential analysis of two-particle angular correlation functions of charged and neutral kaons as a function of $\Delta \varphi$ and $\Delta \eta$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02 $ TeV is intended.

The measurements of multiparticle cumulants of mean transverse momentum, $[p_\mathrm{T}]$, allow us to probe the size and its fluctuations in the initial state. Furthermore, we present the first measurements of newly proposed multiparticle cumulants between anisotropic flow $v_{\rm n}^{\rm m}$ (m = 2,4) and mean transverse momentum correlations $[p_\mathrm{T}^{(k)}]$ (k $\leq$ 4), in both Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions. The presented measurements and comparisons to the state-of-the-art theoretical model calculations show unambiguous evidence of a deformed and triaxial structure for $^{129}$Xe, and in Pb--Pb collisions further provide tight constraints to the nucleon width $w$, which was poorly controlled before. These studies enormously improve our understanding of the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions and allow us to explore LHC's full potential as a robust nuclear physics machine.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emil Gorm', 'last_name': 'Nielsen', 'fullName': 'Nielsen, Emil Gorm', 'id': '7887406', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': 'fc2e08404ae7bc0e0f07fc1c4e83ad6e', 'db_id': 7887406, 'person_id': 7710370}"
Poster Session,poster,First measurement of properties of strong interaction between deuterons and light hadrons in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Rzesa, Wioleta",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Unknown,"Accurate knowledge of the strong interaction between charged kaons and (anti)deuteron is a missing piece of information in the field of the low-energy (anti)kaon-nucleon interactions for more than 40 years. The interaction between charged kaons and (anti)deuterons is a complex subject at both experimental and theoretical levels. From the experimental point of view, so far scattering cross sections at intermediate momenta were performed. Specific information on the strong interaction can be accessed also via kaonic deuterium X-ray spectroscopy but such measurements are challenging due to the available detection efficiency. One of the missing information on $\mathrm{K^{-} d}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d}$ interactions is their scattering lengths. Due to the lack of direct experimental measurements, theoretical predictions for $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d}$ have been made based on input from kaonic hydrogen measurements. There are no published theoretical predictions for the scattering length of $\mathrm{K^{+} d}$. The first femtoscopic measurement of $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{-}\overline{\mathrm{d}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{+} \overline{\mathrm{d}}$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02\ \mathrm{TeV}$ are presented. In this study, the scattering lengths of $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d}$ pairs associated with strong final-state interactions, as well as the source radii of the kaon-deuteron pairs were determined using the Lednický-Lyuboshitz model. The interaction parameters obtained for $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{-} \overline{\mathrm{d}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{+} \overline{ \mathrm{d}}$ are compared with the values available in the literature to discriminate between the different theoretical approaches.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wioleta', 'last_name': 'Rzesa', 'fullName': 'Rzesa, Wioleta', 'id': '7899096', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': '9b6edcb693063da99c7074ac87dc5c7a', 'db_id': 7899096, 'person_id': 7710395}"

Poster Session,poster,Charmonium production measurement at midrapidity using TRD-triggered data in ALICE,"Seo, Jinjoo",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"Quarkonium production is considered one of the golden probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in heavy-ion collisions.
Due to their large mass, the production of heavy-quarks is governed by hard scales of QCD, while the formation of the bound quarkonium state involves soft QCD scales.
The regeneration process of J/$\psi$ in the QGP or at the phase boundary is crucial for describing the observed centrality, rapidity, and $p_{\mathrm T}$ dependence of J/$\psi$ nuclear modification factor at the LHC.
Quarkonium production in more dilute systems is essential to provide a baseline for Pb--Pb results.
They are also useful for investigating the production mechanisms for pp collisions and studying the cold nuclear matter effect for p--Pb collisions.
The $\psi$(2S) production relative to J/$\psi$ is observable with strong discriminating power between the two regeneration scenarios in Pb--Pb collisions, as well as among quarkonium production models in pp and p--Pb systems.
Thanks to the ALICE online single-electron triggers from the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), the $\psi$(2S) signal can be extracted at midrapidity in the dielectron channel.

Poster Session,poster,The Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment towards starting system assembly,"Rodriguez, Adrian",Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,Unknown,"The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the main tracking detector of the CBM experiment.

The main STS functional building block is the detector module. It consists of a double-sided silicon sensor connected through a stack of low-mass microcables to the custom-developed readout ASICs on two front-end electronics boards. 876 modules are arranged in 8 tracking stations, where 1.8 million channels are read out with self-triggering electronics, matching the experiment’s data streaming and online event analysis concept. 
Currently, the construction of the STS detector is progressing on several fronts. Firstly, the mechanical design is being finalized and tested, while the cooling concept is being assessed through a thermal demonstrator. In addition, modules assembled during pre-series are undergoing characterization, and the final production phase has begun, with multiple quality control steps in place to ensure reliable module performance and high production yield. The implementation of these quality control steps has involved the development of necessary hardware and software.

Poster Session,poster,SUBA-Jet: a new coherent jet energy loss model for heavy-ion collisions,"Karpenko, Iurii",FNSPE CTU in Prague,Unknown,"We present a new model for jet quenching via coherent gluon radiation and elastic scatterings off medium partons. The jet energy loss is simulated as a perturbative final-state vacuum parton shower followed by a medium-induced shower originating from elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. Above a phase threshold, the trial gluons will be formed and can produce coherent radiation themselves.

The model has been implemented in a Monte Carlo code and has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z prediction for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium. The realistic case with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. In particular, we show the influence of various parameters on the energy spectrum and transverse momentum distribution, such as the in-medium quark masses, the energy transfer in the recoil process, and the phase accumulation criteria, especially for low and intermediate energy gluons.

The model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind. As such, we also show the first results when the parton shower is coupled to realistic expanding medium modelled usign vHLLE code. Finally, we use Pythia for jet hadronization and draw a basic comparison to RHIC and LHC data.

Poster Session,poster,Results on Breit-Wheeler Process in Heavy-Ion Collisions and its Application to Nuclear Charge Radius Measurements,"Wang, Xiaofeng",Shandong University,United States,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, strong electromagnetic fields arising from the Lorentz-contracted, highly charged nuclei can be approximated as a large flux of high-energy quasi-real photons that can interact via the Breit-Wheeler process to produce $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs. The collision energy dependence of the cross section and the transverse momentum distribution of dielectrons from the Breit-Wheeler process in heavy-ion collisions are calculated with lowest-order EPA-QED. Within a given experimental kinematic acceptance, the cross section is found to increase while the pair transverse momentum decreases with increasing beam energy. The corresponding results are also compared with STAR measurements, which are consistent with each other and found to be sensitive to the nuclear charge distribution and the infrared-divergence of the ultra-Lorentz boosted Coulomb field. Following this approach we demonstrate that the experimental measurements of the Breit-Wheeler process in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be used to quantitatively constrain the nuclear charge radius. The extracted parameters show sensitivity to the impact parameter dependence, and can be used to study the initial-state and final-state effects in hadronic interactions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaofeng', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Xiaofeng', 'id': '7884833', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '12ecd79bfef8d58dd6e4e9a52ec0910f', 'db_id': 7884833, 'person_id': 7557528}"

The cumulants of the distributions of the conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions can be related to the equation of state in lattice QCD (LQCD), making first-principles calculations accessible in the experiment. Recent results from LQCD suggest that the thermodynamic susceptibilities, which are related to the experimentally measurable cumulants of the conserved charges, are significantly affected by strong magnetic fields.

In this talk, measurements of the second-order cumulants of the (anti-)proton and net-proton numbers in Pb--Pb collisions with the ALICE detector at the LHC are presented. The moments of the net-proton number, used as a proxy for the baryon number, are calculated using the Identity Method to avoid the problem of misidentification. The new results cover a large momentum acceptance and the centrality range.

Non-statistical fluctuations are observed in all collision systems, indicating correlated particle emission. The central Pb--Pb collisions show a significant reduction in the fluctuation compared to the peripheral collisions and are in qualitative agreement with previous measurements in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. This effect is discussed in view of radial flow effects and/or the presence of mini-jets. The positive skewness of the $\langle p_{\rm{T} }\rangle$ fluctuation, which has been proposed as an essential consequence of the hydrodynamic evolution of the produced fireball in heavy-ion collisions, is observed. The kurtosis is found to decrease with increasing system size and saturates at the Gaussian expectation for most central Pb--Pb collisions. To investigate the impact of jets in the measurement of the $\langle p_{\rm{T} }\rangle$ fluctuations, a transverse spherocity study was performed and found that jetty events show higher fluctuations compared to isotropic events.

Poster Session,poster,Performance study of the exclusively reconstructed  $B^\pm$ meson in the  $J/\psi$ decay channel with ALICE,"Storehaug, Ida",University of Oslo (NO),NO,"The $B^\pm$ meson is produced more frequently than any other meson containing beauty quarks in pp collisions at the LHC. Measuring its production cross-section is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows for testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Secondly, it provides an essential reference for measurements of its nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm A \rm A}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The $B^\pm$ meson $R_{\rm A \rm A}$ measurement can provide new constraints on the partonic energy loss mechanism in the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. Since the radiative energy loss depends heavily on the quark mass, the beauty quark, being the heaviest readily observable flavor, is a particularly valuable probe for investigating the mass dependence of the in-medium energy loss mechanisms. Due to its design, ALICE is unique in accessing beauty production in the low $p_{\rm T}$-region at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$). 

This poster shows a performance study of the exclusive reconstruction of the $B^\pm$ meson at midrapidity through the decay channel $B^\pm \rightarrow J/\psi + K^\pm$, with the $J/\psi$ reconstructed in its dielectron decay channel. Exclusive reconstruction of beauty mesons will be done for the first time in ALICE during LHC Run 3. In previous LHC runs, inclusive beauty hadron measurements were carried out via non-prompt $J/\psi$ using the displacement of the secondary vertices with respect to the primary vertex. This study, however, relies on full reconstruction of the $B^\pm$ meson candidate, taking advantage of the improved vertex resolution provided by the upgraded Inner Tracking System of ALICE, fully operational during the LHC Run 3.

These collisions are considered to be an effective way to minimize the flow-driven background contribution to search for the possibly small CME signal. Anisotropic flow is an important tool to understand properties of the QGP medium. Elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is the second-order coefficient in the Fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane. Elliptic flow of charged hadrons has been measured in the isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The magnitude of $v_{2}$ shows difference between the two isobar collisions despite the same nucleon number. This indicates a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between these nuclei. The $v_{2}$ measurements of the strange and multi-strange hadrons are excellent probes for understanding these initial state anisotropies of the medium produced in these collisions, owing to their smaller hadronic cross-section compared to light hadrons. The collected datasets include approximately two billion events per isobaric species, offering a unique opportunity for making this statistically hungry measurement.

Poster Session,poster,Exploring hadronic resonances through EPOS4 model: A study of particle interactions and spectra,"Sumberia, Vikash",University of Jammu (IN),Unknown,"Hadronic resonances are interesting candidates to study the properties of the hadronic phase, which is the time span between the chemical and kinetic freeze-outs,  formed during the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, comparable to the lifetime of hadronic phase ($\sim$10 $-$ 12 fm/$c$), they decay in the hadronic phase and their decay products undergo rescattering or regeneration within the hadronic gas. Thus, the yields of the hadronic resonances alter than what was originally produced before the chemical freeze-out. This change in their yield, which is extensively studied to understand the properties of the hadronic phase, depends upon the lifeime of the decaying resonance, the interaction cross-sections of its decay daughters, and the lifetime of the hadronic phase.  \\
In this study, we explore the production yields of hadronic resonances by simulating pp, p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions at various centre of mass energies using the latest EPOS4 model. The EPOS4 model employs a comprehensive scheme for simulating high-energy particle collisions, which includes primary interactions based on S-Matrix theory, secondary interactions using a core-corona separation approach, hydrodynamic evolution, micro-canonical hadronization, and a final hadronic afterburner using UrQMD. This scheme allows for the simulation of parallel scatterings and accurately models the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions, thus providing some new understanding of a deep connection between four basic concepts in pp and AA collisions: parallel scattering, energy conservation, factorization, and saturation. We measure the transverse momentum spectra ( $p_{\rm{T}}$ ), energy dependence of resonance production, ratio of yield of resonance particles to their corresponding stable particles, nuclear modification factor ( $R_{\rm{pA}}$ and $R_{\rm{AA}}$) for various hadronic resonances of different lifetimes and compare the results with the data available from the ALICE experiment at CERN.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vikash', 'last_name': 'Sumberia', 'fullName': 'Sumberia, Vikash', 'id': '7824438', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu (IN)', 'emailHash': '746023f262668d4c35c5276b50bb5ac7', 'db_id': 7824438, 'person_id': 7558526}"

Recent measurements of the fragmentation fractions of charm hadrons in pp and p–Pb challenge the universality of fragmentation in the presence of a hadronic medium. In addition, the ratio of $p_\mathrm{T}$ spectra of $\mathrm{\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ in pp collisions, shows a separation between the highest and the lowest multiplicity classes within $5.3\sigma$, with the maximum discrepancy occurring for $2\ \mathrm{GeV}/c<p_\mathrm{T}<6\ \mathrm{GeV}/c$, suggesting that additional mechanisms, such as coalescence, might play a role in heavy quark hadronization. In p–Pb collisions, the $p_\mathrm{T}$ behavior is similar to that observed in pp collisions but no strong multiplicity dependence is observed. In PYTHIA, the formation of hadrons is described by fragmentation of strings tuned from $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ and $\mathrm{ep}$ collision measurements, and color reconnection mechanisms are necessary to capture the observed baryon to meson enhancement. By including additional states, predicted by the relativistic quark model, statistical hadronization models  can reproduce as well the $\mathrm{\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ yield ratio.

Measurements of jets initiated by heavy quarks play an important role in the testing of pQCD calculations and represent a critical component of the studies of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. We present the first measurements of the EECs for D$^0$-tagged jets in pp collisions at 13 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of directed flow of inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC,"Singha, Subhash",Institute of Modern Physics CAS,Unknown,"Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons fragmented by highly virtual partons produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions via hard scatterings. Different observables of the jet-medium interaction probe the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and its dynamics. The bulk medium produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions is expected to be tilted with respect to the beam axis, while the hard scatterings are symmetric along the rapidity. This asymmetry between hard and soft processes coupled with in-medium interactions can induce a large rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) for jets. In fact, it has been observed that the $D^0$ mesons show a significantly larger $v_1$ signal as a function of rapidity compared to charged hadrons at the top-RHIC energy, reflecting the interplay between soft and hard processes.

Poster Session,poster,Multiplicity dependence of $\Upsilon$ and $J/\psi$ production in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV,"Knospe, Anders Garritt",Lehigh University,United States,"Studying quarkonium production allows us to probe the properties of strongly interacting matter, such as the quark-gluon plasma and the gluonic matter in heavy nuclei. While such a probe is widely used, a complete understanding of the quarkonium production mechanism is not yet achieved, even for $p$+$p$ collisions. Therefore, quarkonium studies in $p$+$p$ collisions are essential for advancing the field. Measuring the dependence of self-normalised quarkonium yield on self-normalised charged particle multiplicity can elucidate the interplay of involved soft- and hard-QCD processes. While proposed explanatory mechanisms, including multi-parton interactions, string screening, and gluon radiation, converge at low values of self-normalised multiplicity, their divergence at higher values emphasises the potential for new insights by extending experimental reach in multiplicity.


Herein we present measurements of $\Upsilon$(1S+2S+3S) and $J/\psi$ production, reconstructed through the dielectron decay channel, in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV recorded by the STAR detector in 2017. Observables include transverse momentum and rapidity distributions, as well as the self-normalised $\Upsilon$ and $J/\psi$ yields as a function of self-normalised charged particle multiplicity. The presented analysis utilises a large sample of quarkonia with up to a factor of 10 increase in statistics compared to previous STAR measurements, therefore both improving precision and extending the reach into higher multiplicity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anders Garritt', 'last_name': 'Knospe', 'fullName': 'Knospe, Anders Garritt', 'id': '7886615', 'affiliation': 'Lehigh University', 'emailHash': '3614cc9ab0fffd8752369b3a08996fe5', 'db_id': 7886615, 'person_id': 7709597}"

This work presents comprehensive measurements on both topics for various event-shape and centrality selections of Au+Au collisions at RHIC BES-I (e.g. 11.5, 19.5, and 39~GeV), BES-II (14.6, 27, and 54.4~GeV), and 200~GeV. We present new measurements of the beam energy dependence of higher-order flow-angular de-correlations ($r_n(\eta_a,\eta_b)$) that are sensitive to the three-dimensional initial state. We also study new observables which are selectively sensitive to the viscous attenuation in the final state, such as the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$. We observe a non-monotonic behavior in the longitudinal width of $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$ with the collision energy, which is expected to be proportional to $\eta/s$ according to the ansatz proposed by S. Gavin et. al. [1]. In addition, we further explore the higher-order flow-angular correlation $\langle\cos(a_{1}n_{1}\Psi_{n1}+\cdots+a_{k}n_{k}\Psi_{nk})\rangle$ and the higher-order flow-magnitude correlations $SC(n,m)\{4\}$ and $SC(n,m)\{6\}$ using the $2$- through $6$-particle correlation method. The higher-order flow-angular (magnitude) correlations are predicted to be sensitive to both initial and final state effects. We compare our findings with similar studies conducted at the LHC and with viscous hydrodynamic calculations. Our analyses aim to disentangle the initial and final-state effects and extract the QGP transport properties.

Poster Session,poster,Production of $\Sigma$ baryons as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at the LHC with ALICE,"Heybeck, Benedict",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"The strangeness content of the final state in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been studied through measurements of kaons, Λ, Ξ and Ω baryons in pp, pA and AA collisions. $\Sigma$ baryons contain a single strange quark and form a triplet, with the charge (+, 0, -) depending on the light quark content. In a thermal model scenario, these states are abundant enough to carry a significant fraction of the strangeness produced in the collision. However, the experimental measurement is challenging, and to date only $\Sigma^{0}$ in 7 TeV pp collisions have been measured by ALICE, while few other experiments have measured the charged states at lower pp($\rm p \bar{p}$) collision energies.
A number of methods to identify charged Σ have developed during the LHC Run 2. The decay $\Sigma^{+}$ -> p $\pi^{0}$ can be reconstructed via the direct detection of the proton and the two gammas from the $\pi^{0}$ decay, either through them both converting to $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or through one converting and the other being reconstructed in the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS). Additionally, a method to detect anti-neutrons in the PHOS has been developed. This allows the (anti-$\Sigma$)$^{\pm}$ -> anti-n + $\pi^{\pm}$ decays to be reconstructed. We present the transverse momentum spectra of $\Sigma^{+}$ and its charge conjugate anti-particle, in both minimum bias and high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. These are then compared to the latest MC simulations, including the tunes of PYTHIA, which best reproduce the existing hyperon data.
With the advent of Run 3, ALICE has improved the capability of the Inner Tracker, allowing the detection of the charged $\Sigma$ particle with the reconstruction of its decay after traversing several detector layers. The performance of this novel reconstruction method is discussed. In addition, the prospects for measurements of the interaction between $\Sigma$  and other baryon species will be discussed together with the implications for constraining the neutron star equation of state.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Benedict', 'last_name': 'Heybeck', 'fullName': 'Heybeck, Benedict', 'id': '7949139', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt (DE)', 'emailHash': '60851502a9f498bb56690c4692eb77ba', 'db_id': 7949139, 'person_id': 7764772}"

Among them directed flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. It is an important probe to study the in-medium dynamics as it is sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of the produced medium. Minimum in the slope of directed flow ($dv_1/dy$) as a function of collision energy has been proposed as a signature of the first-order phase transition between hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma. The triangular flow $(v_3)$ typically arises from the initial condition fluctuations and is expected to be uncorrelated to the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\Psi_{1}$).

Poster Session,poster,Baryon stopping from the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum,"Nese, Sigurd",University of Oslo (NO),NO,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the colliding nuclei are decelerated and kinetic energy is converted into new particles. This energy loss is referred to as baryon stopping. A fundamental question one can ask in the study of high energy heavy-ion collisions is how much baryon stopping there is. This can be quantified by measuring the net proton rapidity distributions. Previous measurements at RHIC and in fixed target experiments have shown that the amount of stopping decreases with increasing collision energy. At LHC energies, there are no experimental constraints beyond the central rapidity region, where there are no net protons.

In order to investigate the net proton distribution at LHC energies beyond mid-rapidity, we propose using the bremsstrahlung photons emitted from the nuclei as they slow down. In our recent study [1], we investigated stopping scenarios which are based on model calculations or phenomenology and consistent with existing data. Furthermore, we performed a detailed estimate of the background from hadronically produced photons, using the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator, aiming to investigate in which areas of phase space the bremsstrahlung photons constitute a viable observable for baryon stopping. The bremsstrahlung spectra are highly sensitive to the amount of nuclear stopping, and depending on the scenario, a significant signal over background is obtained for pseudorapidities η>∼4−5 and for photon energies ω<∼300−500MeV.

Here, we expand our investigation to include the baryon stopping predicted by the EPOS4 event generator for PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN)=5.02TeV. EPOS4 gives zero net protons at mid-rapidity, making the bremsstrahlung spectrum from this stopping scenario plausible.

Furthermore, we discuss the bremsstrahlung spectrum coming from proton-proton collisions, which gives insight into the charge dependence of the signal to background ratio of bremsstrahlung photons in hadron collisions.

Differential measurements of the dependence of the inclusive jet nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) on the jet resolution parameter ($R$) may help disentangle energy loss mechanisms and discriminate between different jet quenching models. One recent $R$-dependence measurement by the ALICE collaboration hints that large-$R$ jets lose more energy. This result is inconsistent with the expectation that jets with larger radii will recover more of the energy redistributed to larger angles via jet-medium interactions. However, many models can describe the trend despite including different implementations of physics effects, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single energy loss mechanism. In this work, we utilize PYTHIA simulations coupled with phenomenologically-derived quenching to better understand the contribution of single effects to this observed $R$-dependence. These effects include the $R$-dependence of the vacuum jet spectrum, differences in energy loss of quark- and gluon-initiated jets, and the impact of wide-angle radiation recovered at large $R$.

Poster Session,poster,Elliptic flow splittings in the Polyakov–Nambu–Jona-Lasinio transport model,"Zhou, Wen-Hao",复旦大学,Unknown,"To incorporate the effect of gluons on the evolution dynamics of the quark matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we extend the three-flavor Nambu–Jona-Lasinio (NJL) transport model to include the contribution from the Polyakov loops. Imbedding the resulting pNJL partonic transport model in an extended multiphase transport (extended AMPT) model, we then study the elliptic flow splittings between particles and their antiparticles in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at beam energy scan energies. We find that a weak quark vector interaction in the partonic phase is able to describe the elliptic flow splitting between protons and antiprotons in heavy-ion collisions at √sNN = 7.7 to 39 GeV.

Poster Session,poster,Medium response made efficient: a linearized hydro approach,"Yao, Xiaojun",University of Washington,USA,"When a jet injects energy and momentum into a droplet of QGP, it generates a wake that, after the QGP hadronizes, results in the creation of soft and semi-hard particles correlated with the jet direction. This medium response phenomenon plays a crucial role in describing various jet observables, as demonstrated by many jet quenching studies. However, the computational complexity of current techniques used to describe these wakes has hindered a thorough understanding of their phenomenological consequences. In this talk we will describe a computationally efficient approach to determine the properties of hadrons generated by QGP wakes on an event-by-event, jet-by-jet basis. Using a library of template solutions obtained within linearized hydrodynamics on a Bjorken flow, and employing the appropriate set of scalings, translations, rotations, and boosts to build the wake of any jet via superposition of templates, we achieve results similar to those obtained through 3+1D hydrodynamics, but with a computational cost that is orders of magnitude smaller.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaojun', 'last_name': 'Yao', 'fullName': 'Yao, Xiaojun', 'id': '7884527', 'affiliation': 'University of Washington', 'emailHash': '7a75db5ff6bdeafec462dd56a7ba0b17', 'db_id': 7884527, 'person_id': 7544576}"
Poster Session,poster,Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect by Event Shape Engineering as a Function of Invariant Mass in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV from STAR,"Li, Han-Sheng",Purdue University,Unknown,"Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In this contribution, we report a fresh investigation of charge separation in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV with the STAR detector using the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) approach [1]. Our approach has several novel aspects, such as using three subevents to identify dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ by using subevent different from particles of interest for the ESE selection. Since the CME is a low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ phenomenon, we further apply the ESE differentially to the $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{inv}$), particularly at lower $m_{inv}$, which is dominated by a larger fraction of low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ pions. We extract the signal as the intercept by projecting $\Delta \gamma$ to zero $v_{2}$, both integrated over inclusive mass and at low mass. Our results suggest non-zero intercept with an approximately 2$\sigma$ significance, which we compare to the published results from the spectator/participant measurement [2]. The extracted signals, highly sensitive to the CME, may still be contaminated by residual flow as well as nonflow contributions
in the $v_{2}$ measurement and in the three-particle correlator [3]. We investigate these contaminations in the ESE measurement, and also report measurement using the zero-degree calorimeter (ZDC) that largely supresses the nonflow contamination. We discuss the implications of our results and perspectives with the expected 10-fold increase in statistics from the RHIC runs in the years 2023 and 2025.

Poster Session,poster,Search for medium-induced jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity pp collisions with ALICE,"Kim, Dong Jo",University of Jyvaskyla (FI),FI,"Collisions of small systems show signatures suggestive of collective flow associated with QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions. Jet quenching is also a consequence of QGP formation, but no significant evidence of it in small systems has been found to date. Measuring or constraining the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems is essential to determine the limits of QGP formation. The ALICE collaboration presents a broad search for jet quenching in high multiplicity (HM) pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, based on several observables: the semi-inclusive acoplanarity distribution of jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\text{T}}$ hadron (h+jet); di-hadron correlations; and intra-jet measurements. Marked broadening of the h+jet acoplanarity distribution is observed in HM compared to minimum-bias (MB) events, which could arise from jet quenching. Both data and PYTHIA simulations suggest that this broadening arises from a generic bias of the HM selection towards multi-jet final states. In contrast, the di-hadron correlations between low-momentum particles exhibit azimuthal narrowing in HM relative to MB events, which are described by PYTHIA simulations and might arise from a similar HM bias. We also report the average charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation functions in HM and MB-selected populations, whose differences are qualitatively described by PYTHIA. We discuss the implications of these results for the understanding of collective effects and jet quenching in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dong Jo', 'last_name': 'Kim', 'fullName': 'Kim, Dong Jo', 'id': '7912694', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyvaskyla (FI)', 'emailHash': 'e2b28c57bef49178dec87e5d78c08369', 'db_id': 7912694, 'person_id': 7541264}"

Collisions of deformed nuclear enhance the fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients $v_n$ and event-wise mean transverse momentum $[p_T]$, therefore offering a viable approach to establish clear correspondences between the structure of colliding nuclei and the final state observables.

We present measurements of $v_n$, $[p_T]$ fluctuations as well as $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations from the STAR experiment. Significant differences are observed for [$p_T$] fluctuations and $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations between $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au and $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions, which can be quantitatively explained by the large prolate deformation of $^{238}$U with $\beta_{2, \mathrm{U}} \sim 0.28$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{U}} \sim 0$. Striking differences are also observed in isobar collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, where ratios of many observables show significant deviations from unity and exhibit rich patterns as a function of centrality. A comparison with hydrodynamic model simulations suggests a large quadrupole deformation in Ru nucleus with $\beta_{2, \mathrm{Ru}} \sim 0.16$ and a large octupole deformation in $^{96}$Zr nucleus with $\beta_{3, \mathrm{Zr}} \sim 0.2$. The non-monotonic dependence of ratios of multiplicity distribution, $v_2$, and $[p_T]$ fluctuations in the mid-central collisions also requires a difference in the surface diffuseness between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr in the model
calculations. Combining all these observables, we can precisely constrain the parameters associated with various nuclear deformations in isobar nuclei.

Poster Session,poster,Hyperon Polarization in Isobar Collisions and Correlation of Global Polarization with Directed Flow from STAR,"Okubo, Kosuke",University of Tsukuba,Unknown,"The observation of hyperon polarization has revealed the existence of large vorticities in the medium created by heavy-ion collisions. Global polarization indicates vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to the system's orbital angular momentum, while local polarization indicates vorticities along the beam direction due to anisotropic transverse expansion of the medium. With the high-statistics data collected by the STAR experiment for isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, we present the measurements of global polarization for $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, and $\Xi^{\pm}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azimuthal angle relative to the event plane. These measurements allow us to study possible magnetic field driven effects through the polarization difference between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr, owing to a larger magnetic field expected in the former. 

Furthermore, the first measurements of $\Lambda$ hyperon local polarization along the beam direction relative to the second and third-order event planes in isobar collisions will be presented. Comparisons with previous measurements in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC will be performed to gain important insights into the collision system size and energy dependence of the vorticities in heavy-ion collisions. 

Previous measurements have shown a similar trend in the energy dependence between the global polarization and the slope of directed flow, suggesting a strong correlation between the initial tilt of the system and the vorticity [1]. For the first time, this correlation is investigated, and the dependence of the $\Lambda$ global polarization as well as directed flow on the first-order flow vector ($q_1$) is presented in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 19.6$ GeV.

The harmonic flow coefficients $v_n$ of the order $n = 1 − 6$ are measured with HADES as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity in Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV. Combining them allows to construct for the first time a complete, multi-differential picture of the emission pattern as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum.

The predictions of ideal hydrodynamic simulations, confirmed by transport model calculations, suggest a scaling between various flow coefficients. For protons at mid-rapidity the ratio $v_{4}/(v_{2})^{2}$ is found to be close to 0.5. The correlations of flow coefficients are investigated based on an event-by-event selection of the mid-rapidity final state elliptic flow of protons. The correlations are compared to the results of transport models and to eccentricity calculations within the Glauber Monte Carlo approach.

This new model responds to the need for a rapidity-resolved initial-state Monte Carlo event generator which can deposit the relevant conserved charges (energy, charge and baryon densities) both in the midrapidity and forward/backward regions of the collision.
Based on the IP-Sat model this event-by-event generator computes the phase-space distributions, from where the relevant conserved charges can be computed as moments. In the present work we have included the leading order contributions to the light flavor parton densities.

Poster Session,poster,Multi-parton interactions in pp collisions using charged-particle flattenicity with ALICE,"Ortiz Velasquez, Antonio",Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX),Unknown,"Event classifiers based either on the charged-particle multiplicity or on event topologies, such as spherocity and Underlying Event, have been extensively used in proton-proton (pp) collisions by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. These event classifiers became very useful tools since the observation of fluid-like behavior in high multiplicity pp collisions, for example radial and anisotropic flow. Furthermore, the study as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the forward V0 ALICE detector allowed for the discovery of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, one drawback of the multiplicity-based event classifiers is that, requiring a high charged-particle multiplicity, biases the sample towards hard processes like multijet final states. These biases blur the effects of multi-parton (MPI) interactions and make it difficult to pin down the origins of fluid-like effects.

This contribution explores the use of a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, defined in ALICE using the charged-particle multiplicity estimated  in 2.8 < η < 5.1 and −3.7 < η < −1.7 intervals. New final results on the production of pions, kaons, protons, and unidentified charged particles at midrapidity (|η| < 0.8) as a function of flattenicity in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV will be discussed. It will be shown how flattenicity can be used to select events more sensitive to MPI and less sensitive to final state hard processes. All the results are compared with predictions from QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators such as PYTHIA and EPOS.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions with ALICE,"Kumar, Deekshit",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Indeed, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by available theoretical models. Quarkonium polarization measurements provide also stringent tests of theoretical approaches, as this observable strongly depends on the quarkonium production mechanism at play. Another way to provide constraints on quarkonium production mechanisms is by looking at the production of J/$\psi$ inside jets. For instance, quarkonium production in a parton shower predicts that J/$\psi$ mesons are rarely produced in isolation, contrary to expectations from direct quarkonium production via parton-parton scattering. The measurement of quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions can also provide a reference for investigating the fate of charmonium in the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. ALICE can measure inclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$), at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\it{y}$|< 0.9). Prompt and non-prompt charmonium separation is performed at midrapidity down to low $p_{\rm{T}}$. In this contribution, we will report on recent quarkonium results in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, including Υ(nS) cross section measurements and Υ(1S) polarization at forward rapidity, as well as the prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production in jets at midrapidity.

Poster Session,poster,Using multi-particle correlations to estimate fluctuations in jet and rare probe azimuthal anisotropies,"Holtermann, Abraham",University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,USA,"Rare probes such as jets and heavy flavor hadrons  provide unique opportunities to study the short-distance scale properties of the QGP created in heavy ion collisions. For example, recent measurements at the LHC and RHIC indicate that jet energy loss is correlated with the distance traveled through the QGP medium, and as a result, the initial geometry of the QGP. While estimates of differential azimuthal anisotropies, which we label $v^\prime_n$, have been experimentally measured for various rare probes, the fluctuations in $v^\prime_n$ have not been systematically studied. 

We present a statistical formalism for the study of $v^\prime_n$ and its correlations with the integrated azimuthal anisotropies (reference flow), $v_n$, by constructing correlators of azimuthal angles from multiple rare probe objects. We then construct multivariate cumulants and moments using these correlators, which can measure fluctuations to arbitrary order in $v'_n$. The experimental methods and procedures for computing these quantities are also discussed. 

To demonstrate how the measurements of the moments and cumulants can constrain the event by event distribution of $v'_n$, we propose a bivariate copula model to parametrize $v^\prime_n$ and $v_n$, and their correlations.

Poster Session,poster,Multi-differential Studies of Strangeness Production with the CBM at FAIR using Machine Learning Techniques,"Puntke, Axel",WWU Münster,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR will investigate the QCD phase diagram at high net-baryon densities ($μ_B$ > 500 MeV) with heavy-ion collisions in the energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9−4.9$ GeV. Precise determination of dense baryonic matter properties requires multi-differential measurements of strange hadron yields and their collective flow, both for the most copiously produced $K_s^0$ and Λ as well as for rare (multi-)strange hyperons and their antiparticles.

In CBM strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ are reconstructed by their weak decays  using a Kalman Filter algorithm. A machine learning model based on boosted decision trees (XGBoost) is used to make a non-linear multi-parameter selection according to the topology of the decay with high purity and high background rejection. For the rare $Ξ^-$ baryon a special selection using two consecutive XGBoost models is used. The yield of the strange hadrons is extracted multi-differentially using a multi-step fitting routine, where each $p_T$-$y$-interval has its separately trained machine learning model.

The CBM performance for multi-differential analysis of yields and collective flow of strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ will be presented together with an estimation of systematic uncertainties. Also, statistical error projections for flow measurements with rarely produced strange hyperons at the high rate data taking expected at CBM will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Axel', 'last_name': 'Puntke', 'fullName': 'Puntke, Axel', 'id': '7884778', 'affiliation': 'WWU Münster', 'emailHash': '14a806b067692355762ecd2ad13ec296', 'db_id': 7884778, 'person_id': 7549624}"

The charged-particle multiplicity distribution as a function of pseudorapidity ($\eta$) is asymmetric in p--Pb collisions. Since the mean free path depends on multiplicity, the $v_{n}(\eta)$ reflects the dynamics of collectivity in p--Pb collisions. The measurement of $v_{n}(\eta)$ in p--Pb collisions is an important study of how charged-particle multiplicity and anisotropic flow relate to the longitudinal evolution of the system. In this poster, we present new final results of $v_{2}(\eta)$ extracted from long-range two-particle azimuthal correlations in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV measured with ALICE. These measurements utilize the Forward Multiplicity Detector, which allows for unprecedented pseudorapidity ranges to be explored (up to $\Delta\eta\sim$ 8) and allow to measure the $\eta$ dependence of $v_{2}$ over a wide pseudorapidity range (−3.1 $< \eta<$ 4.8).

Strangeness production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of the nuclear matter, such as the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at the chemical freeze-out temperature ($\mu_S/T_{\mathrm{ch}}$ and $\mu_B/T_{\mathrm{ch}}$).

Measurements from the first phase of the BES program have indicated potential changes in the medium properties with decreasing collision energy. However, the precision of those measurements is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions. During BES phase-II (BES-II), STAR has accumulated high statistics data in Au+Au collisions at various energies, which can help reduce the uncertainties in the strange hadron measurements, in particular for the multi-strange hadrons. Benefiting from the iTPC upgrade, the strangeness measurements are now extended from mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) to a larger rapidity range (|y|<1.0) as well.

Poster Session,poster,Applying the multiplicity-dependent Momentum Kick Model to the pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC,"Yoon, Jeongseok",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"The long-range ($|\Delta\eta| \gt 2$) near-side ($\Delta\phi\approx0$) ridge structure in a two-particle correlation analysis has been observed in heavy ion collision, which was well-explained by the hydrodynamic models based on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) effect. However, even though small systems such as pp and pPb collisions cannot have enough density and temperature to create the QGP matter, the ridge phenomenon appeared in high multiplicity events of small systems, which is controversial in the hydrodynamic models. Among numerous models to explain this phenomenon in small systems, the Momentum Kick Model (MKM) can give a description of it via a kinematic process where the high-momentum jet particles transfer their momentum to the medium partons called a ``kick"" process, leading to collective motion which becomes the ridge phenomenon in the MKM. The MKM has been applied to various experimental data, such as the STAR and the PHENIX, and has shown good agreement. Furthermore, since the ridge yields are dependent on multiplicity in high-energy collision experiments, C. Y. Wong built a multiplicity dependence on the MKM through an impact parameter and applied it to the CMS data for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV.
Recently, the CMS Collaboration measured the ridge yields along the different $p_T$ and multiplicity ranges for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. To verify the MKM with multiplicity dependence, we expand the model analysis at 7 TeV to those at 13 TeV and provide the theoretical basis on two questions raised by the CMS Collaboration; the linearity of the ridge yield with multiplicity and the prominence at the middle $p_T$ range. Moreover, the CMS Collaboration suggested that the ridge structure does not have the collision energy dependence for pp collisions by comparing the ridge yields at 7 TeV with those at 13 TeV. From this surmise, we predict the future ridge behavior of the LHC Run3 at $\sqrt{s}=5.3$ and $8.5$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jeongseok', 'last_name': 'Yoon', 'fullName': 'Yoon, Jeongseok', 'id': '7884471', 'affiliation': 'Inha University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'b85c70a8ed4db40d78bb1f2c9c326d4b', 'db_id': 7884471, 'person_id': 7550173}"
Poster Session,poster,Effect of Nuclear Shape Parameters On Initial State Observables In Heavy Ion Collisions,"Dimri, Aman",Stony Brook University (US),USA,"In heavy ion collisions, the initial state geometry plays a crucial role in determining final state observables such as elliptic flow $v_2$ and radial flow reflected by event-wise average transverse momentum $[p_{\rm T}]$. The initial state geometry is influenced by several nuclear shape parameters, including quadrupole deformation (β), triaxiality (γ) [1], nuclear radius (r), and skin depth (a) [2]. It is known from low-energy physics that many atomic nuclei exhibit a quadrupole shape that fluctuates around an average profile. This talk investigates the impact of nuclear shape fluctuations on initial state geometry in heavy ion collisions, focusing on eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and inverse transverse size ($d_⊥$), which are linearly related to fluctuations of flow, i.e. $v_2 \propto \epsilon_2$ and $\delta [p_T]\propto \delta d_{\perp}$, and comparing them across different system sizes. Our aim is to quantify the effects of these parameters on initial state observables in a coherent manner. We show that overall quadrupole deformation fluctuations enhance the cumulants of $\epsilon_2$ and $d_⊥$, while triaxiality fluctuations reduce the differences between prolate and oblate nuclei. Our results suggest that, in the large fluctuation limit, the initial state observables' values approach those obtained in collisions of rigid triaxial nuclei.

The strangeness population factor, $S_{\rm A}=(^{A}_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}/^{A}\mathrm{He})/(\Lambda/p)$ (A=3,4), is of particular interest as it directly relates to the ratio of light nuclei and hypernuclei coalescence parameters $B_{A}$.

Assuming a thermally equilibrated system, experimental particle yields at RHIC and the LHC serve as an anchor for the determination of common freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram -- namely, the baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$) and the chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{\mathrm{ch}}$) -- via thermal fits in the SHM framework. Heavy flavor particle production is of particular interest in heavy ion phenomenology by virtue of the large difference between the mass of the bare heavy quarks and the calculated pseudocritical hadronization temperature. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in the initial hard partonic scattering of heavy ion collisions. The produced charm and beauty quarks then interact with other constituents of the collision fireball and then potentially thermalize. These heavy quarks can then recombine with the surplus of deconfined light flavor quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma generated in a heavy ion collision; where the total number of constituent heavy quarks is assumed to stay constant until hadronization is reached. This thermal-like behavior of final state heavy flavor hadron yields allows for their production to be modeled in the context of the SHM using an additional fugacity parameter. In this contribution, we will show recent thermal fits to single charm hadrons measured in ALICE Pb+Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV and STAR Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV utilizing the same PDG2016+ hadronic spectrum as our previous work and a modified version of the most recent PDG2022 list.

Poster Session,poster,Event-by-event comparison of initial state models with momentum space information in a hybrid approach,"Götz, Niklas",Goethe University,Unknown,"The initial state of heavy-ion collisions has a short lifetime and cannot be directly measured. As a result, various initial condition models exist. Although averaged event observables with different initial condition models give comparable results, event by event analysis can help to identify systematic differences.  To determine the initial conditions is crucial to assess systematic uncertainties of Bayesian analysis, that aim at the extraction of transport coefficients from experimental data. The qualitative impact of the choice of initial conditions in hydrodynamical simulations is studied on an event-by-event basis in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid\textsuperscript{1}, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH\textsuperscript{2} and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE\textsuperscript{3,4}. Event-by-event correlations are studied for SMASH IC as well as for IP-Glasma and TRENTO, with and without early time out-of-equilibrium dynamics, for Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in different centrality classes.
 We observe that the initial state eccentricities $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ are, depending on the setup and the model, not independent and show correlations which also result due to the assumed linear response of flow to eccentricity\textsuperscript{5} in correlations between the elliptic and triangular flow. Additionally, we also study initial momentum space information present in the SMASH and IP-Glasma initial condition models. We find that for very spherical events, the initial state momentum anisotropy significantly contributes to the final state momentum anisotropy, which means that the description of such events is especially sensitive to the choice of the initial state model.

Using EFTs, one can systematically exploit the hierarchies of scale of the combined system to arrive at an effective description valid in a particular regime while the OQS formalism enables a quantum description of a system evolving coupled to and out of equilibrium with an environment.

During the Beam Energy Scan Phase-II (BES-II) program, the STAR experiment recorded large datasets at low center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$) from 3 to 19.6 GeV with detector upgrades. In this poster, we will report the first measurement of the thermal dielectron invariant mass distribution at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV. Machine learning techniques are used for suppressing background and increasing signal significance, which is critical for such measurements at low energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chenliang', 'last_name': 'Jin', 'fullName': 'Jin, Chenliang', 'id': '7824379', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '8c06a7f1c8df896c73816b87118437da', 'db_id': 7824379, 'person_id': 7537485}"

This evidence is currently interpreted in terms of a modification of the hadronization mechanisms in hadronic collisions. Therefore, valuable information on how the charm quarks hadronize can be studied by measuring charm baryon production. In addition, by sorting out the produced baryons by the multiplicity of the event, further information such as the multiplicity dependence of the hadronization process can be assessed. In this study, we report the status of the analysis of the $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ $\rightarrow$ $\Xi^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e}$ (and its charge conjugate) baryon by using the LHC Run 2 data collected with ALICE detectors.

Based on the quark-meson (QM) model, we develop a new framework for calculating $\hat{q}$ at finite chemical potentials, in which $\hat{q}$ is related to the spectral function of the chiral order parameter. A perturbative calculation up to the one-loop order indicates that the momentum broadening of jets is enhanced at both the high temperature and high chemical potential, and approximately proportional to the parton number density in the partonic phase. We further investigate the behavior of $\hat{q}$ in the vicinity of the critical endpoint (CEP) by coupling our calculation with a recently developed equation of state that includes a CEP in the universality class of the Ising model, from which we discover the partonic critical opalescence (PCO) -- a prominent enhancement of the momentum broadening of jets near CEP, contributed by the scatterings via the $\sigma$ exchange process.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of inclusive J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) production at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV with ALICE,"Zhang, Yuan",University of Science and  Technology of China (CN),China,"Quarkonium production in high-energy proton-proton (pp) collisions is an important tool for studying perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Charmonia are bound states of charm and anti-charm quark pairs. Their production process can be factorized  into two stages: the heavy quark production and the formation of the bound state. The former happens within initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfers, and can be well described by perturbative QCD. The second one, which involves long distances and soft momentum scales, is a typical non-perturbative process.  Measurements of J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) cross section in pp collisions are crucial for studying charmonium production mechanisms and testing different QCD-based model calculations. They can also provide a reference for investigating the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions and the cold nuclear matter effects present in proton-nucleus collisions.

In this poster, we will present the performance and the analysis status of inclusive J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) production at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$) in pp collisions at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2022 by the upgraded ALICE detector during the Run 3 of LHC, which offers significantly higher statistics compared to previous runs. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential production of inclusive J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S), as well as the $\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\psi$ ratio, might be reported.

A clear excess of dileptons is seen above the contributions from initial state processes and late meson decays which serves as messenger of the dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This excess reveals the thermal properties and the lifetime of the medium but also gives insight into meson properties at high densities.

To disentangle the various contributions to the measured dielectron yield it is important to precisely understand the dielectron production in elementary reactions.

Poster Session,poster,The Tsallis-Thermometer as a QGP Indicator For Large And Small Collisional Systems,"Barnafoldi, Gergely",Wigner RCP,HU,"Recent experimental results present collectivity also in small systems with high-multiplicity. Today these phenomena are not completely understood: it is an important question whether the presence of the QGP is necessary for the observed collectivity or not. Moreover, the connection between the experimental observables and theories is not trivial. In our phenomenological study we introduce the ‘Tsallis-thermometer’ as an indicator of quark-gluon plasma, that aims to describe the smooth transition from small to large collisional systems.

The transverse momentum distribution of identified hadrons are analyzed within the thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-extensive statistics. A wide range of center-of-mass energies and average event multiplicities are studied for various hadron species. We demonstrate that the average event multiplicity is a key variable in the study of high-energy collisions. For this purpose the non-extensive statistical approach is more than appropriate.

Poster Session,poster,"Testing new proxies of B,Q and S cumulants in Au-Au collisions at BES energies with EPOS 4","Jahan, Johannès",University of Houston - Department of Physics,Unknown,"In the exploration of the nuclear matter phase diagram, the susceptibilities of conserved charges are useful theoretical tools to probe the existence of a $1^\text{st}$ order phase transition, and a possible critical endpoint. They can be related to the cumulants of the considered net-charges, for which STAR collaboration recently published experimental measurements of proxies, in Au-Au collisions at several energies of the Beam Energy Scan. Hence, the measured (co)variances of $\pi^\pm$, $p/\overline{p}$ and $K^\pm$ are used to build proxy ratios for the corresponding $2^\text{nd}$ order cumulant ratios of electric charge Q, baryonic number B and strangeness S.

It is nevertheless important to disentangle the different effects contributing to these net-multiplicity cumulants of hadronic species, in addition to the fluctuations which they are supposed to probe. For this reason, we studied the impact of hadronic cascades on these observables, thanks to complete simulations of Au-Au collisions performed with EPOS 4. The results are compared with cumulant ratios of exact conserved charges, and proposed enhanced proxy ratios based on a study of the hadronic breakdown contributions to the total susceptibilities with lQCD and HRG model calculations.

We show that the use of $\Lambda$ baryons variance, additionally to $\sigma^2_\pi$, $\sigma^2_p$ and $\sigma^2_K$ used by STAR, allow to build proxies that reconstruct quantitatively better the ratios of $B,Q$ and $S$ correlations. Moreover, even if hadronic cascades modify the signal amplitude for all (co)variances, they have little impact on most of their ratios.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Johannès', 'last_name': 'Jahan', 'fullName': 'Jahan, Johannès', 'id': '7884777', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston - Department of Physics', 'emailHash': 'a0f093159fa6622d641c96fad27b2c2a', 'db_id': 7884777, 'person_id': 7516786}"
Poster Session,poster,Alignment from spin-1 hydrodynamics,"Wagner, David",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"The spin alignment of vector mesons emitted in heavy-ion collisions has recently been measured by the ALICE and STAR collaborations over a wide range of energies  [1, 2]. The alignment is part of the so-called tensor polarization, which is a property that is exclusive to particles of spin 1 and higher. Even though there have been substantial theoretical efforts, a definite explanation for the tensions between theory and experiments does not yet exist.

In this work [3], we derive an expression for the tensor polarization of a system of massive spin-1 particles in a hydrodynamic framework. Starting from quantum kinetic theory based on the Wigner-function formalism, we employ a modified method of moments which also takes into account all spin degrees of freedom. We find that the tensor polarization is independent of the nonlocal part of the collision term and sourced by the usual dissipative quantities of the fluid, i.e., the bulk-viscous pressure, the particle-diffusion current, and the shear-stress tensor. As an example, we compute the relevant transport coefficient in the case of an uncharged fluid, where, neglecting bulk effects, the tensor polarization is determined solely by the shear-stress tensor. In order to quantify this polarization effect, we provide a formula which can be used for numerical calculations of vector-meson spin alignment in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Measurment of Two-Point Energy Correlator Within Jets in $pp$ Collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV,"Tamis, Andrew",Yale University,USA,"Hard-scattered partons ejected from high-energy collisions undergo fragmentation and hadronization, resulting in collimated sprays of particles that are clustered into jets. The Energy-Energy correlator (EEC) is a jet substructure observable used to study the time evolution of the parton shower. This observable re-contextualizes jet substructure study by using the distribution of angular distance of all combinations of two final state particles within a jet weighted by the product of the fractions of jet energy carried by each constituent. With this definition, the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD effects can be separated without the need for re-clustering or rejection of soft constituents. The EEC distribution cleanly reveals the separation between these two regimes: i) from the free hadrons phase at small opening angles, and ii) from the perturbative fragmentation of quarks and gluons at large opening angles. 

In this poster, the first measurement of the corrected EEC distribution at RHIC is presented using $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV collected by the STAR experiment. The EEC is shown differentially in jet transverse momentum and compared to predictions from the Monte-Carlo event generator PYTHIA-8 and next-to-leading-logarithmic pQCD calculation. Furthermore, this work will serve as the baseline for future measurements of the EEC in heavy-ion systems which will provide information about how the quark-gluon plasma interacts with jets across different angular and time scales.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Tamis', 'fullName': 'Tamis, Andrew', 'id': '7824377', 'affiliation': 'Yale University', 'emailHash': '27fa002287f5e6232f6233cee66cab87', 'db_id': 7824377, 'person_id': 7538629}"
Poster Session,poster,New Insights to the Weak Interaction and Quark Model,"Zhang, Dr. Tianxi",Unknown,Unknown,"A quark is a subatomic particle, composed of the mass, electric charge, and color charge, the three fundamental elements found in the nature. Among these three fundamental elements, there are four fundamental interactions, which are the gravitational force between masses, the electromagnetic force between electric charges, the strong force between color charges, and the weak force between electric and color charges. Inside a quark, the weak force or interaction between electric and color charges influences and excites the quark, which relaxes and transits from one state to another by emitting a quark-antiquark pair, in analogy to the emission of a photon by an excited electron in an atom. A quark and an antiquark with either the same or different flavors and states combine to form a meson when they couple together via mainly the strong interaction, a charged lepton when they annihilate their color charges and combine their electric charges and masses, a neutrino when they annihilate both their color and electric charges and combine their masses, and a photon or gamma ray when they entirely annihilate all their mass, electric, and color charges. The decay of a particle (e.g. the beta decay of a neutron) with formation of leptons involves one or more quark-antiquark pair emissions and annihilations. This multi-pair quark and antiquark emission and annihilation process establishes a fine structure of the Feynman diagram for the quark decay with lepton formation and indicates the formed leptons as products rather than participants of the weak interaction. This study attempts to fully explain and describe how various possible particles (far more than the discovered so far) are formed, generated, decayed, and interacted via quark excitations, degenerations, pair productions and annihilations. We aim at advancing and developing the standard model of particle physics and quantum chromodynamics in terms of innovatively theorizing the weak interaction as an interaction between electric and color charges and creatively modelling quarks with two flavors and multiple excitations.

The spin density matrix of vector mesons is obtained by quark coalescence via the Wigner function and kinetic equation. Our approach predicts a local spin correlation that is distinct from the non-local expressions previously obtained in phenomenological derivations. We estimate the magnitude of such local correlations in the glasma model of the preequilibrium phase of relativistic heavy ion collisions.

In the crossover region, we find large fluctuations associated with the critical point in coordinate space, but in the absence of collective flow and expansion, they are essentially washed out when momentum cuts are imposed instead.

In the mixed phase region, the behavior depends on whether the system is in a metastable nucleation or cavitation region, or in the spinodal decomposition region, and can be interpreted in terms of simplified analytic models. For the case of nucleation, we find that fluctuations are qualitatively described by a non-interacting cluster model.

Poster Session,poster,b-jet tagging at sPHENIX,"Kvapil, Jakub",Los Alamos National Laboratory (US),USA,"Beauty quarks are produced in hard-parton scatterings in the early stages of the partonic collisions. They are the ideal probe to investigate the properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions as they experience the whole QGP evolution. Due to their large mass, their production can be calculated using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD), thus they can be used to test pQCD based models. Moreover, measurements in p+p collisions provide the necessary reference for the interpretation of heavy-ion collision results. Experimentally, tagging a jet by its flavor content gives direct access to the initial parton kinematics and can provide information on how the energy is dissipated in the QGP medium. The possible studies include the flavor and mass dependence of jet quenching, the collisional energy loss, the dead-cone effect, and the modification of the fragmentation and jet structure in the medium.
The sPHENIX detector will begin commissioning with Au + Au collisions in Spring 2023. It provides an excellent vertex resolution using 3 layers of Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) and Intermediate Silicon Tracker (INTT) detectors. The expected spatial resolution is <6μm and the track vertex distance of closest approach (DCA) <30 $\mu$m for p$_T$>1 GeV/c. In addition, a full azimuthal coverage of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters provides an excellent tool to study jet physics. In this poster, we will focus on the prospects of beauty-jet-tagging of full jets at sPHENIX.

The successful construction and deployment of the three-layer Monolithic-Active-Pixel-Sensor (MAPS) based VerTeX detector (MVTX) for the sPHENIX experiment in 2023 enables precise measurements of heavy bottom quark jets (b-jets) and B-hadrons produced in high-energy heavy-ion Au+Au and p+p collisions at RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,Charged kaon and pion femtoscopy in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan at the STAR experiment,"Khyzhniak, Eugenia",Unknown,Unknown,"The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program aims to study the properties of strongly interacting matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at various energy densities and temperatures. Correlation femtoscopy technique is a useful tool to study systems undergoing QCD phase transitions, and can extract valuable information about the size, shape, and lifetime of the particle-emitting source in heavy-ion collisions. 

This study presents the first comprehensive femtoscopic analysis of identical kaons and pions produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6 - 200 GeV from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phases I and II, focusing on charge, transverse momentum, and centrality-dependent properties. The charge-dependent analysis reveals differences at the level of correlation functions for both kaons and pions for the first time at these energies. This observation is consistent with Coulomb field effect due to residual charge after the collision and hadronic final state effects, as implemented in UrQMD. The three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis reveals that the extracted radii, assuming Gaussian distribution for emission source, increase with collision energy, decrease with transverse mass, and are generally larger for kaons compared to pions under the same conditions. The study compares experimental data with different model scenarios and discusses the implications of the trend of the extracted size and lifetime of the particle source with the change of collision energy.

An analysis of one-dimensional two-pion and two-kaon correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, utilizing Levy-stable distributions for the source shapes, is also presented. The current analysis status of the extracted Levy source parameters, including their dependence on average transverse mass and centrality, is reported. A comparison of the pion and kaon Levy exponent is presented, potentially shedding light on the deviation from the Gaussian approximation of the emission source.

Poster Session,poster,Observation of a mesoscopic fluid of 10 strongly-interacting fermions,"Giacalone, Giuliano",Universität Heidelberg,Unknown,"Collective flow is observed in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions where particle multiplicities are small and a quark-gluon plasma description is hard to justify. Here, we address the origin of such observations from a new angle, by performing an experimental investigation of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional ultra-cold Fermi gases with with controllable interactions and in the regime of small particle numbers. We study the inversion of the aspect ratio (akin to elliptic flow) in the expansion of samples of atoms initially prepared in elliptical traps. To overcome the finiteness of the samples, a statistical measure of the elliptic anisotropy is devised in full analogy with the methods employed in the analysis of high-energy collisions.

With ten or more fermions, we observe the emergence of elliptic flow due to inter-particle interactions, which justifies a hydrodynamic interpretation. We show that ideal hydrodynamic predictions using the equation of state of 2D Fermi gases in the many-body limit underestimate the measured elliptic anisotropy. Hence, we witness the breakdown of ideal hydrodynamics due to quantum corrections beyond standard dissipative ones but rather induced by the mesoscopic nature of our samples. We discuss how hydrodynamic equations could be generalized to account for these effects, and give an outlook on further possibilities with our experimental setup to advance our understanding of collective phenomena in few-particle systems.

Poster Session,poster,Understanding Ridge behavior via kinematics between jets and medium,"Cho, Soyeon",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"The Ridge behavior in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions has been discussed a lot since it was first reported. However, small systems like proton-proton collisions are not enough to generate a medium called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in which the Ridge behavior is explained with high-order flows. In this work, we suggest the pure kinematic mechanism between jets and medium partons as tools for understanding the Ridge behavior; during jets passing through the medium, the momentum transferred from jets to medium partons makes the medium partons aligned along the direction of jets’ motion. It produces a collective motion of the medium, which is in charge of the Ridge behavior in small system collisions.

We adopt Parton Distribution from the hard scattering model (PDh) as a distribution function for initial medium partons’ momentum. The PDh is parameterized by a fallout parameter, $a$, a non-extensive parameter, $q$, and the temperature of the system, $T$; $a$ decides the shape of rapidity distribution and $q$ affects rapidity and transverse momentum distribution. And $T$ is related to scales of rapidity and transverse momentum distributions. We choose values of these free parameters by comparing PYTHIA8-string shoving simulation for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \rm{TeV}$ with high-multiplicity.

We set the initial conditions that jet particles with $10 \rm{GeV}$ lose their energy by $1 \rm{GeV}$ while interacting with medium partons through bremsstrahlung. Then, we calculate the cross-section with various outgoing angles of jet particles using PDh and derive the two-particle angular correlation from this. We find out that the Ridge like behaviors appear when the outgoing jets’ angle gets smaller. To integrate over the scattering angles, we calculate the cross-sections for several angles within the jet radius of 0.4 and sum them over with the weights, which are from the experimental data. We calculate the correlation and find that Ridge like behaviors exist in pp collision, compared to the experimental data. We also find $v_{2}$ within 0.025 ~ 0.045, consistent with the experimental result.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Soyeon', 'last_name': 'Cho', 'fullName': 'Cho, Soyeon', 'id': '7824408', 'affiliation': 'Inha University (KR)', 'emailHash': '1315410b1559ee8cf6c6051fdb9935a3', 'db_id': 7824408, 'person_id': 7552144}"

The study of three- and many-body dynamics has been a long-standing goal in nuclear physics, particularly for understanding the structure of light nuclei and describing neutron-rich and dense nuclear matter.

The ALICE Collaboration has performed measurements of the K$^+$--d and p--d correlations analyzing high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The correlation functions are compared with effective two-body calculations anchored to results from K$^+$--d and p--d scattering experiments that provide an excellent description of the measured $\mathrm{K}^+$–d correlation but fail to describe the p--d system. This discrepancy can only be resolved by performing a full three-body calculation that accounts for the underlying three-nucleon dynamics.

Current approaches rely on analytical results for static cases, introducing theoretical uncertainties and biases in our understanding of the pre-equilibrated medium. To address this issue, we employ analytical re-summation schemes to incorporate multiple scattering in a class of expanding backgrounds. By introducing a new length scale related to the equilibration time of the QGP, we investigate the range of validity of Bethe-Heitler emissions, LPM interference effects, and higher-twist contributions to the emitted gluon spectrum. We also discuss methods to mitigate the non-local nature of the emission spectrum. Our analysis shows that strong jet quenching is only possible when the equilibration time of the medium is longer than its mean free path, highlighting the importance of medium modifications of jets in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions. By accounting for the expansion of the medium, our approach reduces the uncertainties in model predictions for jet quenching observables, providing insights into the nature of the pre-equilibrated medium.

We have developed rejection techniques that effectively eliminate this background, improving the signal-to-background ratio by orders of magnitude.

The study of these correlations can probe thermal conditions in a medium and help to elucidate the nature of the strongly interacting matter formed in high-energy nuclear collisions. Recent lattice QCD results suggest that the presence of a magnetic field has a significant impact on the ratios of thermodynamic susceptibilities. Therefore, correlations between net-conserved charges could be used to study the magnetic field produced in peripheral heavy-ion collisions.

 We present the new results on the first-order correlations of net-proton, net-charge, and net-kaon, where net-proton and net net-koan act as a proxy of net-baryon and net-strangeness, respectively. The measurements are performed as a function of centrality in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV using the data recorded by the ALICE detector.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of $J/\psi$ polarization in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV at STAR,"Shen, Dandan",Shandong  University,Unknown,"$J/\psi$ serves as an important probe to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. In Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, it has been observed that the $J/\psi$ yield is strongly suppressed and its elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is consistent with zero, indicating $J/\psi$'s strong coupling with the medium and its potentially small regeneration contribution. Besides those measurements, the $J/\psi$ polarization can shed new light on the QGP properties and the $J/\psi$ production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. For example, it has been hypothesized that $J/\psi$ can be polarized due to the spin-orbit coupling between $J/\psi$ and QGP's large angular momentum in non-central heavy-ion collisions. The early production of $J/\psi$ also makes its polarization potentially sensitive to the strong magnetic field at the early stage. 
   In this poster, we will present the first measurement of $J/\psi$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC. The $J/\psi$ polarization in the Helicity frame and Collins-Soper frame, as well as with respect to the event-plane, in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV will be presented, and its physics implications will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dandan', 'last_name': 'Shen', 'fullName': 'Shen, Dandan', 'id': '7824489', 'affiliation': 'Shandong  University', 'emailHash': '695548e5f5067de5ab9aeba370ddd129', 'db_id': 7824489, 'person_id': 7540267}"
Poster Session,poster,The universality of energy-momentum response from kinetic theories & applicability of hydrodynamics,"Ochsenfeld, Stephan",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Universality is omnipresent when certain classes of microscopic theories are coarse-grained into effective macroscopic descriptions. Hydrodynamic theories are such macroscopic descriptions in long-wavelength, low-frequency limits of many quantum field theories. On the phenomenological side, hydrodynamics not only serves as a successful macroscopic description of the Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (HICs) but also serves as the energy deposition bin of hard probes such as jets and heavy quarks. It is important to understand to what extent the propagation of the deposited energy can be described within hydrodynamics. We investigate the universality and validity of hydrodynamic theory by studying the propagation of energy-momentum perturbations in kinetic theories from microscopic to macroscopic scales. By comparing results for different microscopic theories, we find a remarkable degree of universality, where the evolution of energy-momentum perturbations of the QGP is rather well described by a pair of sound and nonhydrodynamic modes. We also discuss the future perspectives in hydrodynamic theories that one may explore based on these findings.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stephan', 'last_name': 'Ochsenfeld', 'fullName': 'Ochsenfeld, Stephan', 'id': '7884503', 'affiliation': 'Bielefeld University', 'emailHash': 'a1079bc47ea5dff06ce33426a42c03ff', 'db_id': 7884503, 'person_id': 7540290}"
Poster Session,poster,The shear viscosity of parton matter under two-body scatterings,"Lin, Zi-Wei",East Carolina University,Unknown,"The shear viscosity (eta) of a quark-gluon plasma in equilibrium can be calculated numerically using the Green-Kubo relation or analytically using several methods, including the Israel-Stewart, Navier-Stokes, relaxation time approximation, and Chapman-Enskog methods. In this work [1], we first examine these analytical methods for isotropic as well as anisotropic two-body scatterings. We confirm that the Chapman-Enskog method is the most accurate while correcting the typos in an earlier work on this subject. 

We then apply the Chapman-Enskog method to study the shear viscosity of the parton matter in the center cell of central and midcentral Au+Au collisions at 200AGeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76ATeV from a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. At the parton scattering cross section of 3 mb that enables the transport model to reproduce bulk observables including the elliptic flow, the average eta/s of the parton matter is found to be very small, between one to three times 1/(4pi). In addition, as a result of using a constant Debye mass or cross section for parton scatterings, the eta/s ratio from the AMPT model increases with time (as the effective temperature decreases), contrary to the pQCD results that use temperature-dependent Debye masses. This can be a direction for future model improvements.

Poster Session,poster,Momentum transport coefficients with chiral dependent quark masses in thermal QCD medium,"Panday, Pushpa",Unknown,Unknown,"We have studied the momentum transport coefficients, viz. shear and 
bulk viscosity, in a weakly magnetized ($eB << T^2$) deconfined thermal 
QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential ($\mu$). The magnetic 
field generates anisotropy in the medium, causing the previously 
isotropic scalar transport coefficients to become anisotropic and separate into several components. Depending upon the direction of the magnetic field and current, we can have three possible components, namely, longitudinal, transverse, and Hall. We have obtained five shear ($\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3$ and $\eta_4$) and two bulk viscous components ($\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$) using relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under relaxation time approximation. Interaction among partons is incorporated through the quasiparticle mass of quarks and gluons (T, $\mu$, B dependent), calculated using oneloop perturbative thermal QCD.
It is observed that the magnetic field acts differently on left (L) and 
right (R)-handed chiral modes of quark. This leads to the lifting of degeneracy in mass of those modes, in contrast to the strong magnetic field case ($eB >> T^2$), where these modes are degenerate. The magnetic field dependence of L and R modes of $\eta_0$, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_3$ is opposite in nature, viz. the L mode magnitude decreases whereas the R mode magnitude increases, with the magnetic field. This is in contrast to $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$, for which, both the L and R mode magnitudes
increase with the magnetic field. The bulk viscous coefficients, $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ increase with magnetic field for both L and R mode. Also, these shear and bulk viscosities get amplified with quark chemical potential for both modes. Shear viscosity to entropy density ratios are found to be greater than $1/(4\pi)$ for $\eta_0, \eta_1$ and $\eta_3$, but less than $1/(4\pi)$ for $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$. The ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density for $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour with temperature, showing minima or maxima around $T\sim$ 200 MeV. Furthermore, the Reynolds number for L mode is found to be greater than 
that for R mode due to a difference in mass densities.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pushpa', 'last_name': 'Panday', 'fullName': 'Panday, Pushpa', 'id': '7884487', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'd43b9cb231e5da8bd35d6ed067a5bac7', 'db_id': 7884487, 'person_id': 7540517}"

The collision energy dependence of net-proton $C_4/C_2$ from Beam Energy Scan I hints at a possible enhancement from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6 GeV to 7.7 GeV across the baseline, while the proton $C_4/C_2$  value at 3~GeV from the Fixed-Target program (FXT) returns to the baseline.

Poster Session,poster,The direct photon puzzle and the weak magnetic photon emission,"Sun, Jing-an",Fudan University,Unknown,"In heavy ion collisions, the measured spectrum of direct photons at RHIC and the LHC has been found as azimuthally anisotropic as pions. In particular, a large elliptic flow of the direct photos has been observed, which strongly contradicts conventional theoretical predictions, leading to the well-known “direct photon puzzle”. 

In this talk, instead of a strong magnetic field assumption which has been considered previously, we propose the effect of weak magnetic photon emission, originated from the interplay of a weak external magnetic field and the longitudinal dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. The weak magnetic photon emission results in an extra source of photon production from the quark-gluon plasma, with a large elliptic flow. In cases of Bjorken flow and more realistic 3+1D hydrodynamical evolution simulated via MUSIC, the effects of weak magnetic photon emission are justified. Given this novel effect, under realistic conditions with respect to heavy-ion collisions carried out at RHIC and the LHC, especially that a weak magnetic field satisfying $|eB|\ll m_\pi^2$, the experimentally measured direct photon elliptic flow can be well reproduced. 

Accordingly, we found that the direct photon elliptic flow can be used as a magnetometer for the expanding QGP. For the top energy of RHIC collisions, through event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations with respect to Trento 3D initial conditions, the averaged magnetic field strength can be extracted to be a few percent of the pion mass square. Moreover, a significant increase in $v_3$ of direct photons is observed as well from the weak magnetic photon emission.

Diffusion wake accompanying this Mach-cone provides a unique probe of the properties of quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It can be characterized by a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by $\gamma$-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. Using a two-Gaussian fit, we extract the diffusion wake and MPI contributions to the double peak. The diffusion wake valley is found to increase with the azimuthal angle away from the jet. It is also found to deepen with the jet energy loss as characterized by the $\gamma$-jet asymmetry. Its sensitivity to medium properties such as the shear viscosity and equation of state is also studied.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhong', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Zhong', 'id': '7884754', 'affiliation': 'CCNU', 'emailHash': '19367007456f1b280bacec249ba089a2', 'db_id': 7884754, 'person_id': 7541117}"

Measurements of the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of charmed mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide ample evidence of strong interactions between charm quarks and the QGP. However, a complete understanding of the nature of the charm-medium interaction is yet to be achieved. Thus, new observables are needed to constrain theoretical models and the charm quark diffusion coefficient in the QGP.

Measurements of azimuthal and femtoscopic correlations involving charmed mesons can provide such new insights. Azimuthal correlations of charmed mesons can help to pin down the relative role of radiative and collisional energy losses for charm quarks. On the other hand, femtoscopic correlations, i.e., two-particle correlations at the low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions and the extent of the region from which correlated particles are emitted. Therefore,  a study of femtoscopic correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the bulk partons.

Poster Session,poster,Feasibility study of chiral symmetry restoration with ALICE,"Tomohiro, Keisuke",Hiroshima University (JP),Unknown,"The origin of hadron masses cannot be attributed to the Higgs mechanism alone. On top of that, the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry potentially restored at extremely high temperatures, plays an important role. Low-mass vector mesons (ρ, ω, φ) are highly sensitive to chiral symmetry restoration effects, and their electromagnetic spectral function is expected to be modified in Pb-Pb collisions as compared to the “vacuum” spectral function measured in pp collisions. Chiral symmetry restoration can manifest itself in two different ways: a pole-mass shift or a broadening of the spectral function.
 In this poster, the feasibility study for measuring ω meson in the dimuon channel using the ALICE forward muon tracker is presented.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of jet $v_{2}$ in medium-sized systems at STAR,"Protzman, Tristan",Lehigh University,Unknown,"Hard partonic scatterings, occurring at the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, produce jets, which experience the full evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  As they traverse through the QGP, jets lose energy through collisional and radiative processes, collectively known as the jet quenching.  In semi-central heavy-ion events, the QGP takes an approximately elliptical shape in the transverse plane whose mean in-plane and out-of-plane distances differ.  This fact can be used to vary the average path length for jets traversing the QGP, and those traveling in-plane should experience less quenching effects than those traveling out-of-plane.  This differential quenching manifests as a suppression of jet yield out-of-plane relative to in-plane, quantified by jet $v_2$, the second order Fourier coefficient.  In this poster, jet $v_2$ will be presented from Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, and O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=200\hbox{ GeV}$ with multiple jet resolution parameters.

Jet showering processes, with and without the quenching effect, are simulated with the JEWEL model, and are embedded with thermal backgrounds. Sequential substructure variables are extracted from the jet clustering history following an angular-ordered sequence, and are used in the training of a neural network built on top of a long short-term memory network.

Poster Session,poster,Adiabatic hydrodynamization in the bottom-up thermalization scenario,"Scheihing Hitschfeld, Bruno Sebastian",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"We demonstrate that the early stages of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [1] are well described by the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, thus providing novel analytic results on the thermalization process of QCD in a heavy ion collision. These results provide an intuitive explanation of why a gas of quarks and gluons can relax so quickly towards equilibrium, and provide a starting point for a systematic exploration of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in QCD. All of the qualitative features exhibited in QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) simulations at weak coupling [2] are captured by the emergence of an effective low-energy instantaneous ground state for the 1-particle gluon distribution function, which defines the early-time kinetic theory attractor. This ground state may be pulled back to arbitrarily early times, where it represents a free-streaming solution, and at later times it integrally describes the BMSS fixed point, including the recently observed deviations from the original predictions for the scaling exponents [2].

To find this instantaneous ground state it is necessary to elucidate the deep connections between scaling and adiabaticity in expanding gluon plasmas [3]. We first solve the Boltzmann equation for gluons in the small-angle scattering approximation numerically and find that it features time-dependent scaling, reproducing the QCD EKT scaling of hard gluons [2]. By studying this equation analytically, we find that an appropriate momentum rescaling allows the scaling distribution to be identified as the instantaneous ground state of the operator describing the evolution of the distribution function, and the approach to the scaling function is described by the decay of the excited states. That is to say, the system evolves adiabatically, and the instantaneous ground state describes the early-time kinetic theory attractor. We obtain this ground state analytically. Corrections to the BMSS fixed point exponents agree quantitatively with those found previously in QCD EKT.

Recently, proton cumulants from central Au+Au $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV collisions were reported, which implies that hadronic interactions are dominant at 3 GeV and the QCD critical point could exist at the collision energies higher than 3 GeV. The baryon-strangeness correlation is expected to deviate from the QGP expectation for the hadronic gas at high baryon-chemical potential region, which can be used to confirm the turning-off signal of the QGP.  Previously, the STAR measurement of baryon-strangeness correlation using (anti)protons and $\rm K^{\pm}$ shows no strong signal compared with theoretical prediction. So it is suggested to include hyperons in the measurement to study QCD phase transition.

Poster Session,poster,Empirical Characteristics of Light and Heavy Flavor Parton Energy Loss Dynamics at the LHC and RHIC,"MARSHALL, THOMAS",UCLA,Unknown,"Nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles provide valuable information about the flavor dependent magnitude and characteristics of parton energy loss in $A+A$ collisions. Experimental measurements of $R_{AA}$ exhibit a distinct different dependence on transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Previous analyses of RHIC data treated the difference in the $p_{T}$ spectrum between $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions as a leading parton $p_{T}$ loss and empirically concluded that the flat $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ corresponds to a constant fractional $p_{T}$ loss ($\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}$) [1]. This feature of $\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $p_{T}$ can be understood via elastic collisions in classical dynamics. We analyze LHC measurements of the strong $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for light and heavy flavor leading particles. Our analyses indicate that LHC data for a variety of leading particle species are consistent with $\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$, in contrast to proportional to $p_{T}$ at RHIC. In addition, Charm hadrons exhibit differing behavior compared to the other species studied, revealing possible unique heavy flavor dynamics. These distinct features are consistent with the scenario of increased contributions from radiative energy loss at LHC energies compared with stronger collisional energy loss dominance at RHIC energies. Moreover, linear trends between fractional energy loss and initial parton density at varying $p_{T}$ magnitudes indicate that the amount of parton energy loss does not depend strongly on the traversing geometrical path length of the parton during collision evolutions, which is in agreement with previous empirical findings at RHIC despite significant different initial parton densities formed at LHC and RHIC. We will also discuss further implications of the observed proportionality in LHC data and differences in fractional energy loss at varying $p_{T}$ scales.

We include the interactions of heavy quarks with the medium constituents through the heavy quark transport coefficients. The space-time expansion of the QGP medium is described using the hydrodynamical approach MUSIC with IP-Glasma initial state and Bayesian-quantified viscous coefficients of the strongly-interacting matter. The properties of the QGP medium are probed by analyzing the heavy meson nuclear modification factor and flow coefficient for Pb+Pb collision.

Poster Session,poster,Non-interdependent Collective Motions in Heavy-ion Collisions,"Wang, Gang",UCLA,USA,"The widely used Fourier expansion for studying collective motions in heavy-ion collisions implies that different modes of collectivity could be non-interdependent, driven by factorized actions in the created nuclear medium. Following this line of thought, we assume each non-dependent collective motion modulates the probability of particle emission with a single-harmonic Fourier expansion, and then express the final-state particle azimuthal distribution as the product of these expansions, 
$\frac{2\pi}{N^\pm}\frac{dN^\pm}{d\varphi} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1+2\tilde{a}_n^\pm\sin n\Delta \varphi) \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1+ 2\tilde{v}_n^\pm\cos n\Delta \varphi)$, instead of a long linear Fourier series. Here, $\Delta\varphi$ is the particle azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane. This scheme may better capture the genuine strength of each collectivity mode ($\tilde{a_n}$ and $\tilde{v_n}$), and results in non-leading cross terms between collectivity modes, with significant impacts on experimental observables.  We explore the possibility that the chiral magnetic effect (CME) [1] and elliptic flow can evolve separately, thereby their convolution affecting not only the observable that is sensitive to the CME, but also that to the shear-induced CME [2]. We employ the event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics model to showcase the implications of this scenario on searches for the CME. In addition, we also propose practical experimental tests using conventional flow harmonics and exploit a multiphase transport model to demonstrate the emergence of non-leading cross terms, such as the rapidity-odd component of triangular flow. The universality of the assumption regarding factorized actions can be investigated by analyzing real data collected from RHIC and the LHC, which will enhance our understanding of the collective motions.

Gluon junction has been proposed as a possible structure allowing for baryon number transport over large rapidity gaps.

In particular, the $\Omega$-hadron correlations in AMPT show distinct dependence on baryon densities indicating quantitative sensitivity to details of the baryon number transport dynamics. Results from the default and string-melting versions of the AMPT calculations are used to examine the imprints on such correlations left by the hadronization schemes of string fragmentation and quark coalescence, respectively. AMPT calculations predict very significant differences in the correlations at 7.7 GeV between these hadronization schemes, which can be used experimentally to investigate the extent of roles played by partonic degrees of freedom in Au+Au collisions at this energy.

The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) fraction of the jet carried by hadrons along the jet axis ($z = \vec{p}_{\rm T, hadron}\textbf{.}\hat{p}_{\rm T, jet}/|\vec{p}_{\rm T, jet}|$) is related to the jet fragmentation function, and connects the production of quarks and gluons in the perturbative regime with the hadronized final-state particles in the non-perturbative regime. In the QGP medium, modifications to the fragmentation function compared to that in a vacuum can provide insights into the underlying mechanism of jet quenching.

Using two independent approaches, one from a rapid rise in entropy density and another dealing with a dip in the speed of sound, we identify deconfinement in the framework of a modified statistical hadronization model. We find that the deconfinement temperature $T_C(\mu_B,\omega,eB)$ decreases nearly monotonically with increasing $ \mu_B, \omega $ and $ eB $ with the most prominent drop (by nearly $40$ to $50$ MeV) in $T_C$ occurring when all the three quasi-control (collision energy and impact parameter dependent) parameters are  simultaneously tuned to finite values that are typically achievable in present and upcoming heavy-ion colliders.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gaurav', 'last_name': 'Mukherjee', 'fullName': 'Mukherjee, Gaurav', 'id': '7884464', 'affiliation': 'Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Homi Bhabha National Institute', 'emailHash': '28e117e73c4bbb52cd66fc3167044218', 'db_id': 7884464, 'person_id': 7533292}"

The excellent particle identification, track and decay-vertex reconstruction capabilities of the ALICE experiment, together with machine-learning techniques for multi-class classification, are exploited to separate the non-prompt D mesons from the prompt ones. The precise measurements of non-prompt D-mesons production, in particular, allow us to  investigate the production of beauty quarks in pp collisions.

Ratios of particle yields involving strange particles  are often utilized to study properties of the nuclear matter at freeze-out, such as the strangeness chemical potential and the chemical freeze-out  temperature. The $d$+Au collisions bridge the multiplicity gap between  $p$+$p$  and Au+Au  collisions  and can provide insight to the role of event multiplicity in strange hadron production. The study of strange hadrons in $d$+Au collisions  can also help to understand their cold nuclear matter effects, a necessary ingredient for interpreting similar measurements in heavy-ion collisions.

In this poster, we will present new measurements on the production of strange hadrons  ($K{_S}{^0}$, $\Lambda$)  for different rapidity intervals in $d$+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} =$ 200 GeV, recorded by the STAR experiment in 2016.

Poster Session,poster,Probing the effect of the nonextensivity on the transport properties of hot QCD medium at finite magnetic field and chemical potential,"Rath, Shubhalaxmi",Indian Institute of Technology Bombay,Unknown,"We have probed the effect of the nonextensivity on the transport properties related to the charge and heat in hot QCD medium at finite magnetic field and chemical potential. The coefficients associated with the charge and heat transport, such as the electrical conductivity, Hall conductivity, thermal conductivity and Hall-type thermal conductivity are determined using the nonextensive Tsallis framework within the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory. The Tsallis distribution function encodes the effect of the nonextensivity, where the deviation of parameter $q$ from unity signifies the extent of the nonextensivity. The matter produced in heavy ion collisions may not be exactly in the locally equilibrated state, and for understanding the properties of such matter to a greater degree, the nonextensive Tsallis framework is a relevant approach to follow. Our observation shows that the electrical and thermal conductivities as well as their Hall components increase with the nonextensivity and this implies an increased deviation of both charge and heat transports from their counterparts at $q=1$. It is observed that the deviations of the abovementioned transport coefficients from their respective equilibrated values get further increased at finite magnetic field, whereas these deviations become decreased at finite chemical potential. Furthermore, the effects of the nonextensivity on the flow characteristics through the Knudsen number, specific heat and elliptic flow have been explored.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shubhalaxmi', 'last_name': 'Rath', 'fullName': 'Rath, Shubhalaxmi', 'id': '7824491', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay', 'emailHash': '1f01e9099b0e46a4b6e9ae566e8f3fbe', 'db_id': 7824491, 'person_id': 7534097}"
Poster Session,poster,Prospects for light (anti)nuclei measurements in jets in Run 3 with ALICE,"Rasa, Marika",University and INFN Catania,Unknown,"The production of light (anti)nuclei in high-energy hadronic collisions has been studied in depth with the ALICE experiment at the LHC.  Despite this, the production mechanism of light (anti)nuclei is still not well understood and remains a highly-discussed topic in the scientific community. One of the phenomenological models typically used to describe the hadronization process is the coalescence model. In this model, if the nucleons at kinetic freezeout are close in phase space and match their spin state they can bind and form a nucleus. More advanced coalescence model uses the Wigner formalism for the bound state.  A prediction of this model is an enhanced coalescence probability of nuclei in jets with respect to the underlying event in small collision systems. To test this prediction, ALICE has published a work where the (anti)deuteron coalescence parameter in and out of jets is measured in pp collisions, and the same study has been performed in p-Pb collisions, observing in both cases such enhancement.  In this poster, the prospects for light (anti)nuclei measurements in jets and in underlying event during the Run 3 will be presented, considering the developments along this research line and the expected precision obtained thanks to the integrated luminosity that will be collected.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marika', 'last_name': 'Rasa', 'fullName': 'Rasa, Marika', 'id': '7824517', 'affiliation': 'University and INFN Catania', 'emailHash': '0a3e7a216f199c4511d8557e78743233', 'db_id': 7824517, 'person_id': 7534305}"
Poster Session,poster,MC-EKRT event generator for initializing 3+1 D hydrodynamics,"Kuha, Mikko",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"We present a Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT initial-state model (MC-EKRT) [1]. Our new MC-EKRT event generator is based on collinearly factorized, dynamically fluctuating pQCD minijet production, supplemented with a saturation conjecture that controls the low-$p_T$ particle production. Previously, the EKRT model has been very successful in describing low-$p_T$ observables at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies [2,3]. As novel features, our new MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, and includes dynamical fluctuations in the saturation and particle production. As a proof of principle study, we average a large set of event-by-event MC-EKRT initial conditions and compute the rapidity and centrality dependence of the charged hadron multiplicities and elliptic flow for the LHC Pb+Pb collisions using 3+1 D viscous fluid dynamical evolution. In particular, we show that global energy conservation and spatial dependence of the nuclear PDFs are essential features to reach a good agreement with the measurements.

Poster Session,poster,Probing parton shower and hadronization with novel jet substructure measurements at STAR,"Song, Youqi",Unknown,Unknown,"Jets are collimated sprays of final-state particles produced from initial high-momentum-transfer partonic scatterings in particle collisions. Since jets are multi-scale objects that connect asymptotically free partons to confined hadrons, jet substructure measurements in vacuum can provide insight into the parton evolution and the ensuing hadronization processes. With $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV $pp$ collision data recorded by the STAR experiment, we reconstruct full jets to measure CollinearDrop$-$SoftDrop jet correlation and the charge correlation ratio ($r_c$) with hadrons in jets, which probe the dynamics of the parton shower and hadronization, respectively.

The interplay between different stages of the parton shower can be explored with the correlation between SoftDrop and CollinearDrop groomed jet observables, the latter of which have an enhanced sensitivity to the soft radiation within jets. We present the first measurements of CollinearDrop jet mass and its correlation with SoftDrop groomed jet observables, such as the opening angle $R_{\mathrm{g}}$ and the shared momentum fraction $z_{\mathrm{g}}$. They are fully corrected for detector effects with a novel machine learning method, MultiFold, which preserves the correlations in the multi-dimensional observable phase space.

Precision measurements sensitive to the hadronization process are crucial for testing phenomenological models and furthering our understanding of non-perturbative QCD. The observable $r_c$ characterizes the fraction of string-like fragmentation by distinguishing the charge signs of leading and subleading charged particles within jets. We present the first measurement of $r_c$ in hadronic collisions and compare it to event generator predictions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Youqi', 'last_name': 'Song', 'fullName': 'Song, Youqi', 'id': '7824519', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '63d263900779cb5407f90d113f78804b', 'db_id': 7824519, 'person_id': 7534593}"
Poster Session,poster,Azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavor decay electrons and charged particles with the ALICE detector,"Flores, Amanda Nicole",University of Texas at Austin (US),USA,"Heavy-flavor (charm and beauty) quarks are generated primarily via hard scattering processes in high-energy hadronic collisions, and then undergo parton shower (fragmentation) and hadronization. Two-particle azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavor particles is a differential measurement which allows for the study of the fragmentation of heavy quarks. By measuring the azimuthal correlation in different transverse momentum ($p_T$) regions, one can study the details of the structure and particle momentum distribution of jets produced by the heavy-quark fragmentation process. The azimuthal correlations between electrons from heavy-flavor decays (trigger) and charged particles (associated) are studied in different trigger and associate particle $p_T$ regions. A distinguishing feature of heavy-ion collisions is the production of a hot and deconfined state of nuclear matter, called Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). By comparing the heavy-flavor and charged particle azimuthal correlations in Pb-Pb collisions to measurements in smaller collision systems, we can determine how the heavy-quark fragmentation is modified by interactions with the QGP medium. In this poster, ALICE results on the modifications of the azimuthal distribution in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions will be presented. The results in pp and p-Pb collision systems will also be shown and compared to predictions from Monte Carlo simulations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Amanda Nicole', 'last_name': 'Flores', 'fullName': 'Flores, Amanda Nicole', 'id': '7824441', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Austin (US)', 'emailHash': '705275a19426ab6a3e8c957b3860969d', 'db_id': 7824441, 'person_id': 7534859}"

Poster Session,poster,QCD mesonic screening masses using Gribov quantization,"N/A, SUMIT",IIT Roorkee,Unknown,"Chiral symmetry is lost at low temperatures, and pions are massless in the chiral limit;  there is no longer any screening mass. The screening mass of mesons approaches the standard value of $2 \pi T$ at high temperatures. The screening masses of mesons provide a gauge invariant and definite order parameter of chiral symmetry restoration. Different mesonic correlation lengths for flavor non-singlets, at least up to NLO, are well-defined gauge invariant physical quantities calculated earlier using the perturbative resummation techniques. It was found that these NLO corrections are small and come with a positive sign. The lattice simulation results match the existing perturbative results only in the high-temperature regime. There needs to be more clarity between the lattice results and the theoretical calculations at low temperatures, as the perturbative expansion fails at low temperatures. One of the ways to probe the low-temperature region is by using the non-perturbative Gribov resummation. We have studied the spatial correlation lengths $\zeta$ of various mesonic observables using the Gribov action in quenched QCD and for $(2+1)$ flavor QCD. In particular, we have calculated the non-perturbative NLO correction to the meson screening mass using the Gribov propagator.
