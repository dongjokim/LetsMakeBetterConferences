Flash Talks,other,Deep learning for flow observables in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Hirvonen, Henry",University of Jyväskylä (FI),Unknown,"We train a deep convolutional neural network to predict hydrodynamic results for flow coefficients, average $p_T$ and charged particle multiplicities in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions from the initial energy density profiles event-by-event [1]. We show that the network can be trained accurately enough so that it can reliably predict the hydrodynamic results for the flow coefficients and, remarkably, also their correlations like normalized symmetric cumulants, mixed harmonic cumulants and flow-$p_T$ correlations. At the same time the required computational time decreases by several orders of magnitude. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural network, we train it using 5k hydro events, and validate it using 90k events per collision energy. The events are computed from the pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics -based EKRT framework supplemented with a dynamical decoupling condition that improves the description of peripheral collisions [2]. We then generate 10M events using neural network and show that increasing the number of events from 90k to 10M can have significant effects on certain statistics-expensive flow correlations. Neural networks will therefore enable adding statistics-expensive flow correlations to the global Bayesian analysis with a fraction of computation time compared to the current state-of-the-art procedures [3].

Flash Talks,other,Proton-cluster femtoscopy at the HADES experiment,"Stefaniak, Maria",Unknown,Unknown,"The coherent description of nuclear matter properties at high baryon densities is of utmost importance. The limited number of experimental references in the region of the phase diagram corresponding to Neutron Stars (NS) and NS mergers poses major challenges for constructing a universal Equation of State. The matter created in heavy-ion collisions at the HADES experiment can be characterized by similar thermodynamic quantities as NS mergers, thus becoming an essential reference for the studies of these compact stellar objects [1]. Understanding the properties of the newly created matter , such as the strong interaction between hadrons or the presence of bound states, provides substantial insight for such investigation.

One of the methods applied in these studies is femtoscopic correlations (FC). It is a unique tool for the determination of the interactions between hadrons and searching for possible nuclear matter exotic states. Nonetheless, FC is found to be sensitive to variations of EoS, which makes it a valuable reference for its studies. 
This poster will present the newest results on the proton-cluster (deuteron, triton, and He-3) FC at the HADES experiment showing the presence of unbound ground state Li-4 and excited states of He-4. The interactions between proton and clusters will be discussed as well. This research brings us closer to understanding the essential properties of nuclear matter at higher baryon densities.

Small Systems,parallel,Pinning down the origin of collectivity in small systems with ALICE (remote),"Zhao, Mingrui",China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN),China,"While the formation of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions has been confirmed by characteristic patterns of flow measurements, it remains unclear what is the smallest possible collision system that can generate a similar medium exhibiting partonic collectivity. In this talk, we will present the new preliminary results of anisotropic flow in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions that, for the first time, encompass all the data collected by ALICE. The highlights include the flow of charged and identified particles ($\pi^{\pm}$, K$^{\pm}$, p ($\overline{\rm {p}}$), K$^0_S$, $\Lambda$ ($\overline \Lambda$), $\varphi$), correlations and fluctuations of flow vectors and correlations between the mean transverse momentum and flow coefficients, $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$. Multiparticle cumulants with the subevent method, ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations with the template fit method, and a novel jet veto approach have been implemented to effectively suppress short-range non-flow contamination.  We compare our results to state-of-the-art theoretical models, which will allow us to study contributions from initial momentum anisotropies to final anisotropic flow, and to understand how anisotropic flow in small collision systems developed from the initial geometry through the dynamic evolution including the understanding of the role of mass and constituent-quark numbers.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mingrui', 'last_name': 'Zhao', 'fullName': 'Zhao, Mingrui', 'id': '7976916', 'affiliation': 'China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN)', 'emailHash': '474c000b999310db901e6c96af4864f0', 'db_id': 7976916, 'person_id': 7681659}"
Initial State,parallel,Pursuing the Precision Study for Color Glass Condensate in Forward Hadron Productions,"Shi, Yu",Shandong University,Unknown,"With the tremendous accomplishments of RHIC and the LHC experiments and the advent of the future electron-ion collider on the horizon, the quest for compelling evidence of the color glass condensate (CGC) has become one of the most aspiring goals in the high energy quantum chromodynamics research. Pursuing this question requires developing the precision test of the CGC formalism. By systematically implementing the threshold resummation, we significantly improve the stability of the next-to-leading-order calculation in CGC for forward rapidity hadron productions in pp and pA collisions, especially in the high pT region, and obtain reliable descriptions of all existing data measured at RHIC and the LHC across all pT regions. Consequently, this technique can pave the way for the precision studies of the CGC next-to-leading-order predictions by confronting them with a large amount of precise data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'Shi', 'fullName': 'Shi, Yu', 'id': '7819031', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '3e879828623ce53a7632aed8b8718ec2', 'db_id': 7819031, 'person_id': 7551724}"
Jets,parallel,Jet-flow coupling in heavy-ion collisions and the jet-induced diffusion wake,"Yang, Zhong",CCNU,Unknown,"Diffusion wake accompanying jet-induced Mach-cone is a unique feature of jet-medium interaction in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The interaction between the jet and QGP fluid will also deflect partons  associated with the jet from their initial direction. Such deflection depends on the energy of the jet constitutes and the velocity of the flow, leading to an angular intra-jet asymmetry of particle distribution inside the jet. We also study the intra-jet asymmetry and its dependence on jet path length and fluid viscosity in both transverse and longitudinal directions. Our methods can be further used to localize the initial production position of the jet without specified requirements of the jet direction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhong', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Zhong', 'id': '8015988', 'affiliation': 'CCNU', 'emailHash': '19367007456f1b280bacec249ba089a2', 'db_id': 8015988, 'person_id': 7541117}"

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Quarkonia as probes of initial and final states in small systems with ALICE (remote),"Choudhury, Subikash",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"Measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions, so-called small systems, besides serving as baseline for studying vacuum production and cold-nuclear matter effects, respectively, have recently shown intriguing features. In particular, measurements in high-multiplicity events have revealed striking similarities with heavy-ion collisions, where the formation of a quark-gluon plasma is expected. One of the possible scenarios proposed for describing these findings, which include among others collective effects, is the presence of multiple parton-parton interactions (MPIs). At LHC energies, MPIs affect both the soft component of the event, as well as the hard scales responsible for heavy-quark production. Quarkonium associated production, such as double J/$\psi$ production in the same event, provides a direct way to study MPIs. Conversely, quarkonium measurements which correlate soft and hard components of the event, such as multiplicity dependent production or azimuthal correlations between quarkonia and hadrons produced in the same event, represent an indirect method to investigate MPIs. In addition, these studies can reveal any other potential underlying mechanisms taking place in the final state, such as possible dissociation effects for loosely bound excited quarkonia. In case of charmonia, the corresponding measurements for the non-prompt component, originating from beauty hadron decays, allows for extending such correlations studies to the open beauty hadron sector.

In this talk, new published measurements of double J/$\psi$ production at forward rapidity, as well as new preliminary multiplicity dependent measurements of non-prompt J/$\psi$ fractions at midrapidity, in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, will be shown. Recent multiplicity dependent measurements of $\psi$(2S) and $\Upsilon$($n$S) states ($n$ = 1,2,3), along with excited-to-ground state ratios,  carried out at forward rapidity in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, will be presented. Furthermore, recently published prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production at midrapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16, will be discussed. The status of ongoing analyses on J/$\psi$ production as a function of multiplicity or spherocity at central and forward rapidity, in pp and p--Pb collisions, will also be shown. Results will be compared to available model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Subikash', 'last_name': 'Choudhury', 'fullName': 'Choudhury, Subikash', 'id': '7974507', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': 'b1023c994193c053c3a60e4089566e5a', 'db_id': 7974507, 'person_id': 7681795}"

colliders may indicate that the mechanisms by which partons evolve into visi-
ble matter are not universal. In particular, the presence of many other quarks
produced in the underlying event may affect the hadronization process. With
full particle ID, precision vertexing, and a high rate DAQ, the LHCb detector

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Elliptic and triangular flow of light (anti-)nuclei in Au+Au collisions in the BES-II energies using the STAR detector (remote),"Sharma, Rishabh ",Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati,Unknown,"The formation of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions can be explained by two models: the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model proposes that light nuclei originate from a thermal source where they are in equilibrium with other particles in the fireball. However, due to their low binding energies, the formed nuclei are unlikely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. In contrast, the coalescence model suggests that light nuclei are formed later in time by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-stage coalescence of nucleons would lead to the mass number scaling, where the anisotropic flow of light nuclei scaled by their mass numbers follows closely the anisotropic flow of nucleons. Therefore, comparing the anisotropic flow of light nuclei with protons will help us experimentally test the coalescence model hypothesis. Moreover, compared to elliptic flow ($v_2$), triangular flow ($v_3$) of light nuclei has a better sensitivity to the fluctuating initial conditions as well as the properties of the created systems. This information will provide us with  tighter constraints on the theoretical models that describe the production mechanism of light nuclei.

In this talk, we will present the transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of $d$, $t$, and $^3$He, as well as their corresponding antinuclei, in Au+Au collisions at energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ -- 54.4 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR. We will discuss the mass number scaling study of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of light nuclei in the BES-II energies. Additionally, we will compare the experimental results with model calculations that use specific initial conditions and/or nucleon coalescence.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rishabh ', 'last_name': 'Sharma', 'fullName': 'Sharma, Rishabh ', 'id': '7908960', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati', 'emailHash': '704dca1928ae543bebe94bd6ffb9b641', 'db_id': 7908960, 'person_id': 7695846}"
Light Flavor,parallel,Exploring the hadron gas phase of relativistic heavy-ion collisions with ALICE (remote),"Agrawal, Neelima","Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",Unknown,"Hadronic resonances have typical lifetimes that are comparable to that of the hadron gas phase created in the late stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. Therefore, a significant fraction of resonances decays inside a high-density medium and their decay daughters may rescatter with other hadrons destroying their initial kinematic correlations. A competing effect is resonance regeneration via pseudo-elastic interactions of hadrons. The interplay between these effects, which may modify the measured yields and transverse-momentum spectra of hadronic resonances, can be studied by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived particle as a function of the hadronic lifetime, i.e. charged-particle multiplicity. In addition, measurements of the differential yields of resonances with different masses, quark content, and quantum numbers help in understanding particle production mechanisms, strangeness production, and parton energy loss.

In this presentation, recent measurements of hadronic resonances in Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions as a function of multiplicity will be presented. Collisions between Xe nuclei provide the ultimate test for validating the picture of the smooth evolution of hadronic rescattering across different collision systems by filling the gap between p--Pb and Pb--Pb multiplicities. Furthermore, the measured resonance yields in Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb collisions are used as an experimental input in a partial chemical equilibrium-based thermal model to constrain the kinetic freeze-out temperature. This is a novel procedure that is independent of assumptions on the flow velocity profile and the freeze-out hypersurface.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Neelima', 'last_name': 'Agrawal', 'fullName': 'Agrawal, Neelima', 'id': '7974647', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)', 'emailHash': '261aba0db2f0844d37d637cc045e06fc', 'db_id': 7974647, 'person_id': 7681778}"
Light Flavor,parallel,Particle production and collective flow measurements with CMS Run 3 PbPb data (remote),"Wang, Jing",CERN,Switzerland,"The pseudorapidity distributions and anisotropic flow coefficients of charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions are key observables that characterize the initial conditions and subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. Recent LHC Run 3 lead-lead (PbPb) data collected at a center-of-mass per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$~TeV allow the study of these effects at a record collision energy. We present the first measurements of the midrapidity charged particle $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}\eta$ as a function of collision centrality, as well as the Fourier harmonics, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$, with two- and four-particle correlations in PbPb collisions recorded at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$~TeV with the CMS experiment.

Jets,parallel,Looking for the dead-cone in heavy-ion collisions with energy correlators (remote),"Moult, Ian James",Unknown,Unknown,"In this talk we use the recently introduced energy correlator framework for jet substructure in heavy-ion collisions to show how the radiation pattern of heavy quarks is modified by the presence of the QGP. We present an analytical calculation of the medium-modified 2-point energy correlator of a heavy quark jet determining how the dead-cone is populated by medium-induced radiation. We identify two regimes: the near-massless limit where the deadcone is not affected by the QGP, and the large-mass limit where the in-medium radiation begins to fill the deadcone.

Jets,parallel,Revealing the medium-recoil effect with high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Z boson tagged underlying event distribution in PbPb collisions at CMS (remote),"Chou, Pin-Chun",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Extensive studies of dijet momentum balance, inclusive jet shapes, and photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions have revealed a significant contribution of low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) particles to the energy momentum balance of dijet and photon-jets. Effects such as medium-induced radiation and medium response could contribute to the enhancement of low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles. In this presentation, we utilize the Z boson reconstructed within the dimuon channel, which does not interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout the decay chain before interacting with the detector. Moreover, Z bosons are high precision probes, and their reconstruction does not introduce bias into the underlying event distribution near them, unlike the isolation requirement of photons. This feature enables the selection of a single quark-enriched high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ parton and study the modification of the underlying events associated with this probe. We present the first measurement of the Z boson-tagged underlying event spectra over a large acceptance with respect to the Z boson, using lead-lead data recorded by the CMS detector at 5.02 TeV. This new result can provide an unambiguous signal of the medium-recoil effect, and it could be sensitive to the equation of state and the speed of sound of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pin-Chun', 'last_name': 'Chou', 'fullName': 'Chou, Pin-Chun', 'id': '7974465', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '977c4bb20b7d72412e5ba0df4c0a8d81', 'db_id': 7974465, 'person_id': 7690216}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Probe parton propagation in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE heavy-flavour measurements (remote),"Singh, Ravindra",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are valuable probes for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are mainly produced through hard-scattering processes prior to the formation of the QGP, and their number is conserved during the subsequent QGP evolution. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ of charm and beauty hadrons allow the characterisation of the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks while traversing the QGP. Information on their diffusion and degree of participation in the medium collective motion can be obtained by measuring the elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$ of heavy-flavour particles. Complementary insights into heavy-quark fragmentation and energy redistribution can be obtained by measuring angular correlations involving heavy-flavour particles.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Recent charmonium measurements in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE (remote),"Bai, Xiaozhi",University of Science and Technology of China (USTC),Unknown,"Charmonia have long been recognized as a valuable probe of the nuclear matter in extreme conditions, such as the strongly interacting medium created in heavy-ion collisions and known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). At LHC energies, the regeneration process due to the abundantly produced charm quarks, was found to considerably affect measured charmonium observables. Comprehensive production measurements of charmonia, including both ground and excited states, are crucial to discriminate among different regeneration scenarios assumed in theoretical calculations. Charmonia can also be sensitive to the initial state of the heavy-ion collision. In particular, their spin-alignment can be affected by the strong magnetic field generated in the early phase, as well as by the large angular momentum of the medium in non-central collisions. The determination of the component originating from beauty hadron decays, known as non-prompt charmonium, grants a direct insight into the nuclear modification factor of beauty hadrons, which is expected to be sensitive to the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. Furthermore, once it is subtracted from the inclusive charmonium production, it allows for a direct comparison with prompt charmonium models.

We first compute the chemistry of bottom-hadrons in high-energy $pp$ collisions employing statistical hadronization with a largely augmented set of states beyond the currently measured spectrum. This enables a comprehensive prediction of fragmentation fractions of weakly decaying bottom hadrons for the first time and a satisfactory explanation of the existing measurements in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Utilizing the bottom hadro-chemistry thus obtained as the baseline, we then perform transport simulations of bottom quarks in the hot QCD matter created in PbPb collisions at the LHC energy and calculate the pertinent bottom-hadron observables.

Also, triangular flow ($v_3$) provides valuable information on the initial geometry fluctuations and transport properties of the medium. Studying these flow harmonics for various identified particles at different energies provides insights into the medium going through QCD phase transition.

Critical Point,parallel,Spinodal enhancement of fluctuations in nucleus-nucleus collisions (remote),"Poberezhnyuk, Roman",Bogolubov Institute for Theoretical Physics,Unknown,"Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) [1,2] is an essential link between measured event-by-event fluctuations and their grand canonical theoretical predictions such as lattice QCD. The method allows quantifying the global conservation law effects in fluctuations. In its basic formulation, SAM requires a sufficiently large system such as created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions and sufficient space-momentum correlations. Directly in the spinodal region of the First Order Phase Transition (FOPT) different approximations should be used that account for finite size effects. Thus, we present the generalization of SAM applicable in both the pure phases, metastable and unstable regions of the phase diagram [3]. Obtained analytic formulas indicate the enhancement of fluctuations due to crossing the spinodal region of FOPT and are tested using molecular dynamics simulations. A rather good agreement is observed. Using transport model calculations with interaction potential we show that the spinodal enhancement of fluctuations survives till the later stages of collision via the memory effect [4]. However, at low collision energies the space-momentum correlation is not strong enough for this signal to be transferred to second and third order cumulants measured in momentum subspace.  This result agrees well with recent HADES data on proton number fluctuations at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV which are found to be consistent with the binomial baseline of non-interacting hadrons [5].  It indicates that the large fluctuations observed in HADES data do not signal the presence of phase transition and their origin is yet to be identified. We suggest a crosscheck of this picture based on calculating the correlation between proton multiplicities in two non-overlapping rapidity intervals.

Critical Point,parallel,Baryon number fluctuations at high baryon density (remote),"Fu, Wei-jie",Dalian University of Technology,Unknown,"Calculations of baryon number fluctuations up to the sixth order at finite temperature and density in Ref.[1] have been extended to regime of high baryon chemical potentials with 400 MeV $\leq \mu_B\leq 700$ MeV. A peak structure is found for the dependence of the kurtosis of baryon number distributions, i.e., $R^{B}_{42}=\chi^{B}_{4}/\chi^{B}_{2}$, on the collision energy in a range of 3 GeV $\leq\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\leq 7.7$ GeV [2]. The computation is done within the functional renormalization group approach with a critical end point located at around $(T,\,\mu_B)_{\mathrm{CEP}}\sim(100,\,640)$ MeV in the phase diagram, which is in agreement with recent estimates from first-principle QCD calculations. Errors of calculated results arising from, e.g., the chemical freeze-out curves, locations of CEP, effects of baryon number conservation at low collision energy etc., have been evaluated in detail.

Poster Session,poster,Strangeness production in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 14.6 GeV using AMPT and UrQMD model,"Bhagat, Pratibha",University of Jammu,Unknown,"The production of strange quarks and antiquarks in high-energy collisions of
heavy ions is a significant indicator for the creation of a state of matter known
as Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The QGP is characterized by the liberation of
quarks and gluons from their confinement inside hadrons. Due to their prompt
decay via weak interactions, strange quarks and antiquarks are not present in
normal matter and can only be produced via strong interactions within the
QGP. As the mass of strange quarks and antiquarks is close to the temperature
at which protons, neutrons, and other hadrons dissolve into quarks, they serve
as sensitive probes for studying the conditions, structure, and evolution of the
deconfined state of matter.
The current work will compare the properties of different strange particles,
including Λ, Ξ, and Ω in heavy-ion collisions at varying centralities, using two
models for simulating these collisions: the AMPT and UrQMD models, by com-
paring the yield and the baryon-to- antibaryon ratio of these particles at different
centralities at √sN N = 14.6 GeV from the two models, we can better under-
stand the properties of the QGP medium and gain insight into the differences
and similarities between the two simulation models. The better understanding,
we can better understand the properties of the QGP medium and gain insight
into the differences and similarities between the two simulation models. The
ultimate goal of this analysis is to provide a more comprehensive understanding
of the production of strange particles in heavy-ion collisions and its implications
for the formation and properties of the QGP medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pratibha', 'last_name': 'Bhagat', 'fullName': 'Bhagat, Pratibha', 'id': '7824512', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu', 'emailHash': '02078569c2d7b74c63312a252e05ed21', 'db_id': 7824512, 'person_id': 7558345}"

We seek to show that this entanglement in the initial state has a measurable effect on the evolution of the system and is the driving mechanism behind the thermal-like behavior and particle yields observed. Recent studies have demonstrated that entanglement in the initial state could endure the evolution of a strongly coupled system. Consequently, we attempt to show equivalence in a calculation of the initial state entropy (calculated using PDF’s) and the final state entropy (calculated using multiplicity distributions).

Poster Session,poster,Dilepton anisotropic flow from hadronic transport,"Hirayama, Renan",FIAS,Unknown,"We present the first results for dielectron anisotropic flow computed directly from hadronic transport in different systems, and explore the different calculation methods. Because leptons are insensitive to the strong interaction, they are mostly undisturbed by the hadronic medium created after a heavy-ion collision, and therefore serve as direct probes for it. In particular, the HADES experiment at GSI measures flow of dielectrons using the reaction plane method, which can lead to large systematic uncertainties. At the low beam energies of GSI, the evolution is mainly off-equilibrium, and hadronic transport provides an appropriate description and gives access to the full phase space, as well as knowledge on the dilepton origin, being a useful tool in studying the mechanisms behind flow generation from this off-equilibrium hadron resonance gas.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Renan', 'last_name': 'Hirayama', 'fullName': 'Hirayama, Renan', 'id': '7992979', 'affiliation': 'FIAS', 'emailHash': '603be4735966e1b2627bb195c94ca2ca', 'db_id': 7992979, 'person_id': 7533590}"
Poster Session,poster,Charm production in various scenarios of the QGP evolution,"Mykhaylova, Valeriya",University of Wrocław,Unknown,"We study the production of charm quarks in hot QCD medium described by quasiparticle excitations of quarks and gluons. The effective masses are adjusted through the coupling to satisfy the entropy density obtained on the lattice [1]. The evolution of the QGP is described by hydrodynamic simulations in (2+1) dimensions with temperature-dependent shear viscosity taken into account [1,2]. The temperature and time evolution of the charm quark number obtained in the above-described scenario is further juxtaposed to the results acquired from ideal QGP obeying Bjorken flow. We observe a suppression of charm quark production in the absence of shear viscosity and transverse expansion [3]. Moreover, we compute the charm quark fugacity by solving the rate equation and find that it exhibits a global attracting solution, specific to the differential equations [4].

Poster Session,poster,Antiproton production cross sections for dark matter search at the AMBER experiment @CERN,"Giordano, Davide",Università degli Studi di Torino / INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Multiple evidence reveals that the vast majority of the matter content of the universe is non baryonic and electrically neutral. This component is usually called Dark Matter (DM), for its lack of electromagnetic interactions, and is measured to constitute about 25% of the energy density of the Universe. The most common hypothesis is that it consists of weakly interacting massive particles, supposed to be cold thermal relics of the Big-Bang.
The indirect detection of DM is based on the search of the products of DM annihilation or decay. They should appear as distortions in the gamma ray spectra or in anomalies in the rare Cosmic Ray (CR) components. In particular, antimatter components, like antiprotons, antideuterons and positrons, promise to provide sensitivity to DM annihilation on top of the standard astrophysical production.
The interpretation of galactic CR data requires the correct modeling of their source terms and the turbulence spectrum of the galactic magnetic field, in addition to the knowledge of the cross sections that regulate the production of CR interacting with the interstellar medium. 
After PAMELA detector results, the antiprotons flux has been measured with an accuracy of a few percent by AMS-02 over an energy range from below 1 GeV up to a few hundreds of GeV. However, the only currently measured production cross section is the proton-proton one, while all the reactions involving helium have no laboratory data in the phase space covered by AMS-02 (only LHCb, but with incident proton energy of 6.5 TeV). This requires a scaling of the pp channel to pA interaction through approximation and modeling.
The AMBER fixed target experiment at the M2 beam line at CERN will contribute to this fundamental DM search, performing a unique and complementary measurement of the double differential antiprotons production cross-section with a proton beam ranging from 60 to 250 GeV/c impinging on a liquid He target.
The data taking for the experimental determination of the cross-section in p+4He scattering is scheduled for May-June 2023. This result from AMBER will directly pin down the production of anti-protons in the relevant kinematical region covered by AMS-02.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Davide', 'last_name': 'Giordano', 'fullName': 'Giordano, Davide', 'id': '7987038', 'affiliation': 'Università degli Studi di Torino / INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '4bc8defe2b91976b9480d00b8449e72b', 'db_id': 7987038, 'person_id': 7541164}"
Poster Session,poster,A Longitudinally Segmented Hadronic Calorimeter for the Forward Region of the Future ePIC Detector at the Electron-Ion-Collider,"Ponce, Iris",Yale University,USA,"The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory will be an experimental facility to explore gluons in nucleons and nuclei, shedding light on their structure and the interactions within. The ePIC detector will be the first experiment at the EIC dedicated to detailed studies of nuclear structure in electron-proton and electron-ion collisions.

The ambitious physics program of the EIC requires a high performance hadronic calorimetry system in the hadron-going “forward” region. Accurate jet measurements are crucial to reconstruct the full 3D nucleon tomography and to study the gluon saturation region. The main goal of the Longitudinally segmented Forward HCal (lf-HCal) is measuring the energies of jets and distinguishing between overlapping jet depositions to high accuracy in the jet energy range up to 120 GeV.

lf-HCal is designed as a plastic scintillator-steel sandwich calorimeter. The plastic scintillator is transversely segmented into $5\times5$,cm${}^2$ tiles. Each tile is directly coupled to a silicon photomultiplier. The electrical signals of all photomultipliers are routed out of the lf-HCal to be digitized by external readout electronics.

This poster will present the current status as well as ongoing and future R&D of the lf-HCal for the ePIC experiment.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Iris', 'last_name': 'Ponce', 'fullName': 'Ponce, Iris', 'id': '7887446', 'affiliation': 'Yale University', 'emailHash': '684af907ad40cda7b2e834e479196bfc', 'db_id': 7887446, 'person_id': 7710398}"

Poster Session,poster,A modular perspective to the jet quenching from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets,"Palni, Prabhakar",IIT Mandi,Unknown,"In this contribution, we extend the scope of the JETSCAPE framework  to cover the jet radius ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}}$= 5.02 TeV for the most-central (0-10%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for inclusive jets to compare with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors in the jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$)  ranging from 100 GeV up to 1 TeV. The results predicted by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes within 10-20\%. We also calculate the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic multi-stage evolution of the parton shower.

Poster Session,poster,First measurement of femtoscopic correlation function between $D^0$ mesons and charged hadrons in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV at STAR,"Roy Chowdhury, Priyanka",Unknown,Unknown,"Heavy quarks are produced in hard partonic scatterings at the very early stage of heavy-ion collisions and they experience the whole evolution of the Quark-Gluon Plasma medium. Femtoscopic correlations, i.e. two-particle correlations at low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions as well as to the extent of the region from which the correlated particles are emitted. A study of such correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the medium.
        
In this poster, we will present the first measurement of femtoscopic correlations between $D^0-{\pi}$,  $D^0-K$, and $D^0-proton$ pairs at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV using the data taken in the year 2014 and 2016 by the STAR experiment. $D^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the $K^{-}-{\pi}^{+}$ decay channel using topological criteria enabled by the Heavy Flavor Tracker with excellent track pointing resolution. We will present the femtoscopic correlation function for $D^0$ transverse momentum above 1 GeV/c in the $0-80\%$ centrality.

Poster Session,poster,Momentum shell and rapid stiffening in Quarkyonic matter from explicit duality,"Fujimoto, Yuki",University of Washington,USA,"Large-$N_c$ QCD implies a duality between confined baryons and deconfined quarks at high baryon densities; it is called Quarkyonic matter. We present a model of Quarkyonic matter that is explicitly dual between quarks and baryons. The duality means that the free energy of the matter is expressed in two ways: One is as a functional of the quark distribution function in the momentum space, $f_Q$, and the other as a functional of the baryon distribution function, $f_B$. We then posit the duality relation between $f_Q$ and $f_B$, which describes the binding of quarks into baryons.
We explicitly construct an analytic solution of this model and show that the theory has two distinct regimes: An ordinary nuclear matter regime at low density and a Quarkyonic regime at relatively high density. In the Quarkyonic regime, $f_B$ is underoccupied at low momentum and has an enhanced occupation at high momentum, which can be interpreted as that baryons sit on a shell in momentum space on top of a quark Fermi sea. Baryons and quarks do not interact except for the duality relation and the constraint that $f_Q$ and $f_B$ must satisfy $0 \le f_Q \le 1$ and $0 \le f_B \le 1$. Such a theory describes a rapid transition from a soft nuclear equation of state to a stiff Quarkyonic equation of state. At this transition, there is a rapid increase in the sound velocity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuki', 'last_name': 'Fujimoto', 'fullName': 'Fujimoto, Yuki', 'id': '7884834', 'affiliation': 'University of Washington', 'emailHash': '7d09f4110758b347c989357fe817898b', 'db_id': 7884834, 'person_id': 7562766}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the mass spectrum of vector mesons in nuclei at J-PARC,"Murakami, Tomoki",Unknown,Unknown,"The mass spectrum of hadrons in finite-density QCD matter is believed to reveal the effects of partial chiral symmetry restoration. However, despite the importance of understanding QCD at finite density, decisive evidence linking the mass spectrum and chiral symmetry is still lacking.
The J-PARC E16 experiment aims to fill this gap with high-statistics measurements of vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$, $\phi$) in nuclei. The experiment will measure the momenta of electron-positron pairs from vector meson decays and reconstruct their invariant mass. 

To obtain large statistics, 
we use a new beamline at J-PARC that provides $30\,\rm{GeV}$-proton beams with an intensity of $1 \times 10^{10}$ protons/spill. 
The maximum hit rate reaches $15\,\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ and $5\,\rm{kHz/mm^2}$ at two innermost detectors, necessitating an innovative spectrometer for high-rate environments.

Since the experiment commenced in 2020, three commissioning runs have been conducted
  with a limited number of detectors. 
Partial results were reported at QM2022.
  The next run, scheduled for June 2023, aims to improve beam microstructures
  detected in the last run.
  Eight modules of detectors will be operated, as proposed for the first physics run.
In the commissioning runs so far,  
our detectors were successfully operated under the high-counting environment.
Tracking is performed using a layer of the Silicon Strip Detector and three layers of thin gas chambers with different sizes, all employing the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM).
Calibration is ongoing, but the current tracking resolution is sufficient to observe changes in the mass spectrum of vector mesons.
For the $\phi$ mesons, we anticipate a mass resolution of $5.8\,\rm{MeV/c^2}$, while a mass change of $35\,\rm{MeV/c^2}$ was observed in the preceding experiment, KEK-PS E325.
Electron identification is carried out using the Hadron Blind Detector and the Lead Glass Calorimeter installed outside the trackers. 
We achieved electron efficiency and pion rejection power consistent with the design values, at $57\%$ and  $99.97\%$ , respectively.

In this presentation, we will report the result of the run in June, including the detector performance
  and improvement of the beam microstructure, and discuss
 the anticipated outcomes for the physics run planned in 2024. 
 In the physics run, we aim to collect 15000 phi mesons, representing six-fold
improvement compared to the KEK-PS E325 experiment.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomoki', 'last_name': 'Murakami', 'fullName': 'Murakami, Tomoki', 'id': '7884756', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'b4d9bec944696c22f4723e5b32cef039', 'db_id': 7884756, 'person_id': 7562791}"
Poster Session,poster,Projected 3-point Energy Correlator measurements in jets in p-p at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13TeV with ALICE,"Rai, Ananya",Yale University (US),USA,"The sequential clustering of particles into jets offers an algorithmic connection of hadrons to the partons of the radiation shower. Jet substructure allows us to access the radiation history of a jet thereby providing a useful avenue to probe QCD through different energy scales. The N-point Energy Correlator (ENC) is a recently proposed observable that highlights this feature of jets as a multi-scale object. The evolution of jets from the perturbative (partonic) to non-perturbative (hadronic) regimes is imprinted in the slopes of the ENC. Experimentally, the ENC is defined as the energy-weighted cross-section of N particles in a jet as a function of their angular separation. This makes the ALICE detector suitable for these measurements due to its excellent momentum and track resolution. Theoretical calculations have shown excellent agreement with the recent measurement of the two-point energy correlator (EEC) in jets at ALICE $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in p-p as well as in jets at STAR $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in p-p.  Extending the EEC to the three-point correlator (EEEC) is the first step in extending the scaling information of the energy flow to a shape dependence. An intermediate step to achieving this goal is measuring the projected EEEC (E3C) which retains information about the largest angular scale of the correlation. The motivation to study the E3C is two-fold i) It has been shown theoretically that the projected E3C operators encode the same scaling information as the full E3C, a highly non-trivial property of this observable. ii) Taking ratios of the projected E3C with the EEC may enable us to better access perturbative QCD since it is known that the EECs are not immune to hadronization effects. Moreover, these ratios may offer precision tests of the coupling strength of the strong force, $\alpha_S$. In this poster, we will show the progress towards the first preliminary measurements of the projected E3C with ALICE at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13 TeV in p-p. We will also present simulation studies that extend these measurements to heavy-ion collisions. Specifically, we will show the sensitivity of ENCs in jets to the heavy-ion background to motivate further measurements in the quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ananya', 'last_name': 'Rai', 'fullName': 'Rai, Ananya', 'id': '7824325', 'affiliation': 'Yale University (US)', 'emailHash': '099985cd574a51532994d0e8b4fa44f5', 'db_id': 7824325, 'person_id': 7551012}"
Poster Session,poster,Interpretable Machine Learning applications to Jet Background Subtraction,"Mengel, Tanner",University of Tennessee,USA,"Previous applications of machine learning to jet background subtraction have shown improvements over the traditional background subtraction methods, especially at low jet momentum. While machine learning applications generally lead to improvements, care must be taken to ensure they are not at the cost of interpretability and bias from models used for training. We present a novel application of symbolic regression to extract a functional representation of a deep neural network trained to subtract background for measurements of jets. With this functional representation we show that the relationship learned by a neural network is approximately the same as a new background subtraction method using the particle multiplicity in a jet. This multiplicity method uses measured features, rather than learned weights, to achieve most of the improvements demonstrated by the deep neural network. Additionally, we show the algorithmic complexity of the deep neural network can be decreased by reducing it to a shallower representation while still achieving similar performance. Our study demonstrates that interpretable machine learning methods can provide insights into underlying physical processes and achieve the performance of black-box machine learning without the opaqueness and model bias.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tanner', 'last_name': 'Mengel', 'fullName': 'Mengel, Tanner', 'id': '7912848', 'affiliation': 'University of Tennessee', 'emailHash': 'bbcffb02a5c31c7da717eeb775cc056e', 'db_id': 7912848, 'person_id': 7708478}"
Poster Session,poster,Generation of magnetic field in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Słoń, Patrycja",National Centre for Nuclear Research,UK,"Various interesting phenomena have been predicted to occur in a quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to a strong magnetic field which is also generated in these collisions. However, none of these predictions has been convincingly confirmed experimentally yet. So, the question is why? Our aim is to systematically discuss the problem of magnetic field generation. In particular, we argue that the currents induced in the plasma, which have been expected to sustain the magnetic field throughout the plasma lifetime, are much smaller than expected.

Poster Session,poster,Neutral pion and η meson production at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at √sN N = 200 GeV,"Chen, Dading",Unknown,Unknown,"Direct photons are useful probes to study the properties of QGP and the dynamic evolution of collision systems. Estimating and subtracting direct photons from hadron decays that contribute to the bulk of the measured photons is crucial and challenging. Although the most abundant source, $\pi^{0}$ $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$$\gamma$ is well studied and constrained. $\eta$ $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$$\gamma$ is less constrained and the related study is scarce below $p_{T}$ $<$ 2 $GeV/c$. The ratio,$\eta/\pi^{0}$ exhibits universal behavior regardless of collision system, energy, and centrality in high $p_{T}$ from the analysis of world data. However, associated measurements have been inconclusive in low $p_{T}$. Possible deviations from the universal behavior could be owing to the rapid radial hydrodynamic expansion of the $A+A$ collision system. PHENIX presents measurements of the centrality dependence of $p_{T}$ spectra of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ and their ratio in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV with large statistics data taken in the year 2014. Thanks to the large Au$+$Au data sample taken at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV in the year 2014 and improved analysis methods, PHENIX is capable of studying the $p_T$ spectra of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ down to 1 GeV/c and exploring the effect of radial flow on $\eta/\pi^0$ as a function of centrality.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dading', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Dading', 'id': '7824515', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '112a92b31b82c25a82dfada7f3acf225', 'db_id': 7824515, 'person_id': 7562978}"

Strong elliptic flow of $J/\psi$ has been observed in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and attributed to $J/\psi$ production through coalescence of charm quarks that flow with the medium. At RHIC, the $J/\psi$ flow measurements at mid-rapidity are presently inconclusive, while measurements of the nuclear modification factors at mid- and forward rapidity hint that coalescence may play a role in central collisions.

This stage can be probed by heavy quarks (HQs), charm and beauty, since they are produced almost immediately by hard scatterings. We study the propagation of HQs in the evolving Glasma fields, by solving the relativistic kinetic equations that couple the HQs to the fields themselves. We analyze the impacts of this (so far) neglected dynamics on observables, namely the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow.

In this analysis, we compare angular distributions of in-cone radiation across various medium profiles with effective scaling laws. Our findings indicate that the out-of-cone loss of energy occurs through the radiative break-up of hard fragments, which is followed by an angular broadening of soft fragments. Although the broadening of the leading fragments is substantially impacted by the dilution of the medium caused by expansion, we find that in the low-x range, which is accountable for the majority of gluon multiplicity in the cascade, the angular distributions are almost identical when comparing different medium profiles. This similarity is primarily because multiple splittings play a dominant role in broadening within this range. Lastly, we examine how our findings influence the phenomenological explanation of jet quenching and out-of-cone radiation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Souvik Priyam', 'last_name': 'Adhya', 'fullName': 'Adhya, Souvik Priyam', 'id': '7884942', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences', 'emailHash': 'a86e39803ec40cde5db72fcfdd1981b2', 'db_id': 7884942, 'person_id': 7552427}"

Model calculations have also predicted that directed flow could be sensitive to the softening of EoS associated with a first order phase transition. Directed flow of protons and anti-protons are also of interest as they offer sensitivity to both the contributions from the transported quarks and the component generated by medium interactions at the later stage. Measurements of proton and net proton directed flow from BES-I have shown that there is a non-monotonous dependence on collision energy. 
In this poster, We will present measurements of the directed flow of protons and antiprotons from 19.6, 14.5, 11.5, 9.2, and 7.7 GeV Au+Au collisions, using high statistics BES-II data from STAR.

Poster Session,poster,Chiral critical point via scalar-dilaton coupling in soft-wall AdS/QCD,"Bartz, Sean",Indiana State University,USA,"The AdS/CFT correspondence, which connects strongly coupled conformal field theories in $N$ dimensions to gravity in $N+1$ dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, has provided valuable insights into the non-perturbative aspects of QCD. Soft-wall AdS/QCD is a phenomenological model that uses a dilaton field to introduce confinement, while a scalar field is dual to the chiral condensate. The thermodynamics of the deconfined state are introduced using an asymptotically AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole, which includes both temperature and baryon chemical potential. Minimal models of this type yield a chiral phase transition that is not affected by the chemical potential, and thus lack a critical point.

In this work, we investigate the chiral phase transition in an AdS/QCD action that includes a coupling between the scalar and dilaton fields. Our results reveal that the scalar-dilaton coupling produces a rich phase structure, with the emergence of a critical point at finite temperature and density. The location and presence of the critical point is found to be highly sensitive to the strength of the scalar-dilaton coupling. We present results for both 3-flavor symmetric and 2+1 flavor cases. This work provides a foundation for future phenomenological applications, as well as dynamical models, which solve the scalar and dilaton fields using the gravitational equations of motion.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sean', 'last_name': 'Bartz', 'fullName': 'Bartz, Sean', 'id': '7884892', 'affiliation': 'Indiana State University', 'emailHash': '4e3d453704f1fa2cbe61458f20c68360', 'db_id': 7884892, 'person_id': 7563298}"

Here we update our hadron resonance list to the PDG 2021 including all $*~–****~$ states and make direct comparisons to lattice QCD susceptibilities and partial pressures where an improvement is seen since recently-observed particles have been included in the strange baryonic sector.  Additionally, we reanalyze thermal models with this new list and extract the freeze-out temperatures.  A next crucial step is to reformat our list to be compatible with SMASH such that hydrodynamic simulations can use the latest PDG list as well [1]. Before this change, SMASH has approximately half of the resonances included in the PDG 2021 list.  To include these new states in SMASH we have rewritten the list that contains $1\to3$ and $1\to4$ body decays to include only $1\to2$ body decays and study this change on the particle spectra and mean transverse momentum.  Finally, we find that the additional states improve the SMASH cross-sections, although some rescaling is required.

Poster Session,poster,Bulk Viscosity of Hadronic Matter from a Microscopic Transport Model,"Demir, Nasser",Kuwait University (KW),Unknown,"Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC are thought to have created a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) with a very low shear viscosity in the deconfined phase. However, as the QGP hadronizes it will evolve through a hadronic phase with rapidly increasing shear viscosity. In order to fully characterize the QGP state, one has to separately determine the viscosity of the hadronic phase.  Although many approaches have been used to determine the shear viscosity coefficient and the associated shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ($\frac{\eta}{s}$) in the hadronic phase, much is unknown regarding the bulk viscosity to shear viscosity coefficient ($\frac{\zeta}{s})$ in the hadronic phase.  We present preliminary results of a calculation of the bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio $\frac{\zeta}{s}$ for hot hadronic matter.  The Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is used to simulate the hadronic medium and periodic boundary conditions are used to simulate infinite hot equilibriated hadronic matter.  The Green-Kubo formalism is employed and a comparison is made with the results of the bulk viscosity calculation from the Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly Interacting Hadrons (SMASH) model from [1].

This observation offers an opportunity to bridge low-energy nuclear physics and high-energy collisions. Many recent works have concentrated on using the initial geometry to predict final flow data and see if nuclear shape differences would be visible. In this work, we build upon the results in [1]  and actually run hydrodynamics and study how each phase (free streaming, Landau matching, expansion, hadronic transport) are related to the initial nuclear shapes seen in data. The simulations were performed using the public available X-SCAPE framework, which allows for the integration of different stages of the collision dynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Color-superconductivity of asymptotically conformal quark matter as a portal between astrophysics and heavy ions collisions,"Ivanytskyi, Oleksii",University of Wroclaw,Unknown,"We present a relativistic density functional approach to color superconducting quark matter that mimics quark confinement by a fast growth of the quasiparticle self-energy in the confining region [1]. The approach is shown to be equivalent to a chiral model of quark matter with medium dependent couplings. The approach to the conformal limit at asymptotically high densities is provided by a medium dependence of the vector-isoscalar, vector-isovector and diquark couplings motivated by non-perturbative gluon exchange [2]. While the (pseudo)scalar, vector-isoscalar and vector-isovector sectors of the model are fitted to the mesonic mass spectrum and vacuum phenomenology of QCD, the strength of interaction in the diquark channel is varied in order to obtain the best agreement with the observational constraints from measurements of mass, radius and tidal deformability of neutron stars. These constraints favor an early onset of deconfinement and color superconductivity in neutron stars with masses below one solar mass. We also discuss a new two-zone interpolation scheme for the construction of the hadron-to-quark matter transition [3] that allows to test different structures of the QCD phase diagram with one, two or no critical endpoints in simulations of supernova explosions, neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions. We argue that the formation of color-superconducting quark matter drives the trajectories of its evolution in supernovae and neutron star mergers towards the regimes reached in terrestrial experiments with relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,The freezeout procedure with the method of moments,"Brito, Caio",Universidade Federal Fluminense,Unknown,"The method of moments has been employed to derive relativistic fluid-dynamical theories from the Boltzmann equation for the past decades [1]. This approach consists in expanding the single-particle distribution function using a basis of irreducible momenta, where the expansion coefficients are the irreducible moments of the nonequilibrium distribution function [2]. Unlike the Chapman-Enskog method [3], it has the advantage of yielding formulations that might be causal and stable, provided the transport coefficients satisfy certain constraints [4]. However, so far, only the equations of motion for the hydrodynamic moments have been explicitly calculated, with the equations of motion for the moments of rank 3 and 4 being calculated recently, in Ref. [5]. In this contribution, we address this problem by systematically calculating the general equations of motion for all irreducible moments and show how they can be used to solve the Boltzmann equation itself. Since this method of solving the Boltzmann equation does not rely on resolving particle degrees of freedom, it can be used to provide a more consistent description of the freezeout process that does not require a particlization procedure. We investigate this prescription in a Bjorken flow scenario and investigate with detail the transition from a fluid description to a transport one.

New observables have been measured at the LHC and shown to be sensitive to initial conditions and less to medium properties, specifically factorization breaking ratios appears to be promising. Here we consider two initial condition models, NeXus and TRENTO. While both models yield similar results for the scaled flow harmonic distributions both at the LHC and RHIC, they lead to quantitatively much more different patterns for the factorization breaking ratios at RHIC than at LHC, due to the shorter lifetime. For the same reason, not only final state interactions but also initial free streaming matter in these predictions and differences between these are enhanced at RHIC compared to LHC. Therefore experimental factorization breaking ratios at RHIC top energy would be interesting to get.

Poster Session,poster,Study of multiplicity-dependent ρ0(770) production in pp collisions with ALICE,"Lim, Hyunji",Pusan National University (KR),USA,"Short-lived resonances are ideal probes to study the properties of the hadron gas phase created in heavy-ion collisions in the post-hadronization phase. Since the resonance lifetime is comparable to that of the hadron gas phase, their yields are affected by the competing rescattering and regeneration effects. These can be studied experimentally by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived hadron as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity, which is directly connected to the lifetime of the hadron gas phase. In this context, the $\rho^{0}(770)$ resonance is particularly interesting due to its very short lifetime of about 1.3 fm/$c$. The measurement of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ production yield in low-multiplicity collisions, corresponding to a very short duration of the hadron gas phase, serves as a fundamental reference for measurements in heavy-ion collisions.  

In this poster, recent ALICE measurements of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ production in pp collisions as a function of multiplicity are presented. The results are discussed together with existing measurements in other collision systems in the context of the state-of-the-art phenomenological models used to describe particle production at LHC energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hyunji', 'last_name': 'Lim', 'fullName': 'Lim, Hyunji', 'id': '7824267', 'affiliation': 'Pusan National University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'a61ed56b5d264b87e7e09c5d371df28a', 'db_id': 7824267, 'person_id': 7560184}"
Poster Session,poster,Understanding effect of event-by-event fluctuations on light-nuclei yield ratio,"Murase, Koichi","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University",UK,"We investigate how the event-by-event fluctuations of the final-state distribution function of nucleons physically affect the yield ratio of light nuclei based on the coalescence model.

The yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N_d^2$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively) [1,2], is one of the observables suggested for a possible signal of the critical point of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Based on the analyses with idealized setups, the yield ratio is known to be sensitive to the two-point neutron correlation and thus to the critical correlations. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions, such as anisotropic flows [3] and the event-by-event fluctuations coming from the initial state.

In this talk, we establish a qualitative understanding of how event-by-event fluctuations affect the yield ratio [4]. We model the ``single-event'' distribution $f(x,p)$ by a superposition of $n$-Gaussian hot spots in phase space and randomize the positions and magnitudes of the hot spots from event to event. We obtain analytical formulae for the yields of light nuclei and related ratios under this setup. We investigate how each feature of the event-by-event distribution affects the yield ratio. We find that the event-by-event fluctuations increase the yield ratio, where the value takes maximum at a particular hot-spot number $n$ depending on the fireball size. We also discuss the scale separation between the critical correlations and short-range thermal fluctuations using two different sizes of hot spots. The scale of critical correlations is bounded by the finite spacetime size of the fireball. We find that the effect in the yield ratio becomes larger for larger separation of hot-spot sizes. These understandings of the yield ratio will be important in analyzing the results of future realistic analyses based on state-of-the-art dynamical models.

Information on the final state interactions amongst the particles under study can also be extracted from the measurement. For example, from the p-$\Lambda$ and p-$\Xi^-$ correlation functions, one could study the hyperon-nucleon (Y-N) interactions in such collisions. It is particularly interesting to study the dependence on the collision energy of the source size at the moment of freeze-out. The STAR fixed-target program from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3.0$ to 7.7 GeV has enabled us to investigate the high baryon density region from $\mu_{\rm B}$ = 420 to 750 MeV.



In this poster, the first measurements of p-$\Lambda$ and p-$\Xi^-$ correlation functions in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3.2$, 3.5, and 3.9 GeV with the fixed-target mode from STAR will be presented.  The results will be compared with the data from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV Au + Au collisions ($\mu_{\rm B}$ = 750 MeV) and the data from higher energies [1, 2], where $\mu_{\rm B}$ is close to 0, along with model calculations generated via the UrQMD hadronic transport model and CRAB afterburner.

The latter resums an infinite series of ladder diagrams for heavy-light interactions appropriate for a strongly coupled QGP which are implemented via half-off-shell amplitudes accounting for recoil corrections and interference effects (related to the imaginary part of the Q-Qbar potential). In particular, the T-matrix approach accounts for non-trivial thermal-parton spectral functions in the QGP with an equation of state that agrees with lattice-QCD results, thus ensuring consistency between the heavy- and light-parton sectors. We compare these rates to perturbative ones as previously employed in semiclassical transport calculations and to those utilized in currently employed quantum transport approaches.

With this new analysis, we aim at investigating the flavor-dependence of particle production in jets and the underlying event.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on mixed harmonic cumulants at the LHC,"Murase, Koichi","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University",UK,"We analyze the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on normalized mixed harmonic cumulants ($nMHC$) [1,2] for the first time based on event-by-event simulations of high-energy heavy-ion collisions using an integrated model of an initial state model, stochastic causal fluctuating hydrodynamics, and a hadronic afterburner.

For the quantitative constraints on the transport properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the initial-state models, it is important to compare various flow correlations from dynamical models to data.  Recently, $nMHC$ was shown to be useful in constraining theoretical models [3].  Meanwhile, we have shown that hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the longitudinal factorization ratio $r_n(\eta_a,\eta_b)$ [4] and can reproduce the experimental centrality dependence with initial longitudinal fluctuations [5].  However, it is non-trivial how the hydrodynamic fluctuations affect the constraints on the QGP properties through various flows and correlations.

In this talk, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations on $nMHC$ in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. We combine the $\mathtt{TRENTo}$ initial conditions and the $\mathtt{UrQMD}$ afterburner used in Refs. [3,6] with relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics $\mathtt{rfh}$ [6].  We first compare the results with and without hydrodynamic fluctuations and see the effect.  We next consider different temperature dependencies of viscosity. We find that the hydrodynamic fluctuations tend to decrease $nMHC$, which is because they de-correlate initial correlations. In particular, $nMHC(v_2^2,v_3^2)$ is sensitive to the hydrodynamic fluctuations but almost insensitive to the viscosity. We also discuss the effect of the rapidity gap. We argue that $nMHC$ is useful for identifying the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations and is a key to properly constraining the theoretical models.

Here we study the effects of quark chemical equilibration on the QGP using a novel model of viscous hydrodynamic evolution in partial chemical equilibrium. In this model, we initialize the QGP in a completely gluon dominated state, as motivated by the success of gluon saturated initial condition models. Local light and strange quark production during the hydrodynamic phase is simulated through the evolution of time-dependent fugacities for each quark flavor, with the timescales set as free parameters to compare different rates of equilibration. This impacts the system through the equation of state, which we have constructed to depend on the quark flavor content throughout the QGP.

Using this model, implemented in the MUSIC hydrodynamic code and iS3D particlization code, we have simulated ensembles of Pb+Pb and Au+Au collision events with varying quark chemical equilibration times. We discuss the observed dependence of hadronic and electromagnetic observables on the equilibration time. We also examine the impact of quark chemical equilibration on the transport properties of the QGP, and show preliminary results for a Bayesian model-to-data comparison that will  simultaneously constrain the equilibration times and transport coefficients of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Gordeev', 'fullName': 'Gordeev, Andrew', 'id': '7884588', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '5ff048e17e6b389cc8449ca4ddf9d63a', 'db_id': 7884588, 'person_id': 7561207}"

Poster Session,poster,Repulsive $\Lambda$ potential at high densities examined from heavy-ion collision and hypernuclear data,"Jinno, Asanosuke",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We investigate the validity of the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential at high densities which suppresses $\Lambda$ in dense neutron star matter by investigating whether it reproduces the heavy-ion collision and the hypernuclear data.

In the 20th cenury, $\Lambda$ baryon was predicted to appear in neutron star matter at $2$-$4\rho_0$ from the hypernuclear spectroscopy and the phenomenology of dense neutron star matter. However, most of the hyperonic matter equations of state cannot support the observed massive neutron stars (hyperon puzzle). One of the proposed scenarios is that the $\Lambda$NN three-body force generates enough repulsion to suppress $\Lambda$s in the dense nuclear matter. From chiral effective field theory, a $\Lambda$ potential that satisfies this scenario has been obtained (Gerstung et al. (2020)). However, the density dependence of this potential has not been verified using experimental data.

In this talk, we will report that the above $\Lambda$ potential reproduces the experimental data of heavy-ion collisions and $\Lambda$ hypernuclei. We have found that the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential explains both data on the $\Lambda$ directed flow of heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$−$20~{\rm GeV}$ within a relativistic quantum molecular dynamics implemented in JAM2 (Nara et al. (2022)), and the $\Lambda$ binding energy of hypernuclei by the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method with spherical symmetry (Jinno et al. in prep.). We conclude that the repulsive $\Lambda$ potential with two- and three-body force can be a solution for the hyperon puzzle.

On the other hand, it is found that more attractive potential can also explain the both heavy-ion collision and hypernuclear data. To discriminate the repulsive $\Lambda$ potentials to attractive ones, we will also examine ${}^3_\Lambda {\rm H}$ directed flow of heavy-ion collisions, which is recently measured by the STAR collaboration (STAR, arXiv:2211.16981) and is overestimated by the old version of JAM.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Asanosuke', 'last_name': 'Jinno', 'fullName': 'Jinno, Asanosuke', 'id': '7884763', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'ca785abda4ddbd6e21f354858fcccb47', 'db_id': 7884763, 'person_id': 7562154}"

However, their interpretation is often limited by the assumptions of specific quenching models, and it remains a challenge to establish model-independent statements about the universality of different jet quenching observables.
  
In this work, we address this issue by proposing a treatment that is agnostic to the details of the jet-medium interactions and relies only on the universality of quark and gluon quenching in different jet observables. We use Bayesian inference to constrain the parameterisation of the energy loss of quark- and gluon-initiated jets in a data-driven manner. This constraint is primarily performed using the inclusive jet pT spectrum, for which the quark/gluon fraction varies across rapidity. We then predict the observed jet asymmetry in di-jet and boson-jet measurements, providing evidence for the universality of quenching effects.  
  
Furthermore, we examine the extracted Casimir scaling of jet quenching and the role of resolution effects in constraining the early, perturbative jet evolution using these data-driven methods. This study provides a new perspective on the universality of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions, free from the assumptions of specific models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alexandre', 'last_name': 'Falcão', 'fullName': 'Falcão, Alexandre', 'id': '7884893', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen', 'emailHash': '9221fffcce05f98a75f4b9b15ef22039', 'db_id': 7884893, 'person_id': 7562251}"

Most importantly, these novel polarization dependent observables provide direct access to information for constraining gluon transverse spatial distribution inside large nuclei. This poster discusses calculations of polarization dependent diffractive $J/\psi$ production at RHIC and LHC energies using the color glass condensate effective theory. The predictions have been extended to EIC energies and conditions, showing that strong azimuthal modulations are expected due to the initial photon polarization in diffractive photonuclear production at the EIC.

Poster Session,poster,Physics prospects of central exclusive production in pp collisions with ALICE Run 3 data,"Kim, Minjung",University of California Berkeley (US),USA,"Central exclusive production (CEP) is a diffractive process in which the colliding particles remain intact. Three different processes are involved: photon-photon exchange, photon-pomeron exchange and double-pomeron exchange. Each process produces distinguishable states with specific sets of quantum numbers, making CEP measurements a unique tool for searching for exotic resonances. Furthermore, measurements of well-known states in CEP can provide a clean probe of the structure of matter. For example, the photoproduction of the J/𝜓 (via photon-pomeron exchange) can be used for probing the low-𝑥 gluon content of protons.

In ALICE, events of the CEP can be identified by its signature of double-gap in pseudorapidity. Relying on the tracking and particle identification capabilities in the central barrel of ALICE, various final state two particle systems can be measured including 𝜋+𝜋− and 𝐾+𝐾−. In addition, heavy vector mesons such as J/𝜓 can be studied via their decay into 𝑒+𝑒− pair.

Poster Session,poster,On the gravitational wave emission in the magnetic field of a heavy-ion collision,"Gasik, Piotr",GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE),Germany,"On the gravitational wave emission in the magnetic field
of a heavy-ion collision

In the classic 1961 paper of Gertsenshtein [1] he demonstrated that an electromagnetic wave can be transformed into a gravitational wave when propagating through an external, transverse magnetic field. Later in 1973, Zel’dovich calculated the fraction of energy of the electromagnetic wave transformed into the energy of the gravitational wave in such a process in astrophysical situations [2].
In the following, we investigate a possibility of a transition of an electromagnetic wave into a gravitational wave in the high magnetic field expected to be formed in heavy-ion collisions.

Electromagnetic radiation, emitted in all stages of a heavy-ion collision, reflects the evolution of the latter and encodes the information on the properties of the created medium, such as fireball lifetime, temperature, acceleration, and polarization. This information can be decoded by studying di-lepton spectra by means of their invariant mass reconstruction. The slope of the di-lepton excess spectrum measured in the intermediate-mass region provides information on the temperature of the emitting medium.

In the poster, we discuss the modification of a slope value due to the excitation of a gravitational wave by light emitted from the medium in the magnetic field generated in a non-central heavy-ion collision. Based on several simplifications, we estimate the possible redshift and conclude the effect is not detectable with heavy-ion experiments planned in the foreseeable future. However, with this contribution, we also want to trigger a discussion on the emerging field of ultra-high-frequency gravitational waves physics and its possible relation to high-energy heavy-ion collision physics.

For the first time we extract participant fluctuations directly from the data used for the fluctuation analysis, i.e., without involving model calculations [1]. To achieve this we exploit a dedicated event-mixing algorithm. Participant fluctuations are extracted by constructing cumulants of multiplicity distributions for different particle species and covariances between all possible pairs of particles.

Poster Session,poster,The most vortical baryonic matter,"Akridge, Zachary",Indiana University,USA,"The study of strongly interacting matter under external conditions (such as high temperatures and/or baryon densities) provides unique insights into its fundamental theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A nonzero angular momentum imposed on a QCD system can bring rich and intriguing phenomena, with the proton spin structure being a perfect example. A much larger QCD system with substantial angular momentum, produced by non-central heavy ion collisions, has attracted a lot of interest recently. This angular momentum induces nontrivial vortical fluid patterns in the fireball formed by the collision and eventually leads to spin polarization of final state hadrons, as shown by experimental measurements from the STAR, ALICE and HADES Collaborations. A clear understanding of the angular momentum initial conditions for the fireball, such as the total amount and its rapidity distribution, is, however, still lacking. In this talk, we demonstrate how baryon stopping plays a key role for the deposition of angular momentum toward the mid-rapidity region. By calculating rapidity loss after multiple binary collisions for wounded nucleons, we quantify the angular momentum initial conditions for heavy ion collisions from GeV to TeV beam energies. This also allows us to explain the beam energy dependence of experimental data for spin polarization as well as to reveal a nontrivial correlation between net baryon number and initial angular momentum in the fireball. Finally we introduce the ratio of angular momentum to net baryon number as a measure for comparing “spinning-ness” and show that the most spinning baryonic matter, created in heavy ion collisions at energies of a few GeV, is about an order of magnitude higher than a proton in terms of this measure.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Akridge', 'fullName': 'Akridge, Zachary', 'id': '7884507', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University', 'emailHash': 'bdb4e5c81f529fcbe01d558777b94839', 'db_id': 7884507, 'person_id': 7559335}"

Poster Session,poster,The study of $v_{2}$ with a new double-differential event categorization using multiplicity and spectator neutrons in PHENIX,"Shimomura, Maya",Nara Women's University (JP),Japan,"When studying the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions, it is necessary to classify the events based on the size and shape of the QGP. Typically, events are categorized by mapping the impact parameter, which cannot be measured directly, to a bulk observable that varies monotonically with it, such as soft particle production. In the mapping, fluctuations in the initial state nuclei and the nucleon-nucleon interactions are taken into account. Even a tight experimental centrality based solely on multiplicity includes events with quite different shapes due to these fluctuations. To select much more homogeneous sub-samples of events, adding a second, independent qualifier is helpful. A decade ago, event-shape engineering proposed the flow vector as a second qualifier, but it is influenced by final state interactions. Instead, we use spectator neutrons measured in the zero-degree calorimeter of PHENIX as the second dimension. This new approach provides a more precise way to categorize QGP events, which has important implications for understanding the underlying physics of heavy ion collisions. By using this novel 2D event characterization in Au$+$Au collisions at RHIC, we will demonstrate elliptic flow results with tighter constraints on the initial geometry.

Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic initial conditions from non-linear causality,"Hoshino, Tau",Sophia University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been successful in describing space-time evolution of matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. It is conventionally supposed that the created matter starts to behave as fluids all at once at a certain initial time. It is, however, not at all trivial from which stage after the collision the fluid picture can be applied to the system. According to the hydrodynamization theory [1], any solutions of hydrodynamic equations converge to an attractor. Thus, hydrodynamic description might be justified anyway even starting from the system far away from local equilibrium. Do we really describe space-time evolution of the system using hydrodynamics even when the system is far away from local equilibrium? In this study, we address this issue from a point of view of causality. 
A recent study shows necessary and sufficient conditions for the solutions to be causal in non-linear relativistic hydrodynamic equations [2]. When they are applied to numerical hydrodynamic simulations, it turns out that causality tends to be violated at the early time and/or in peripheral regions [3]. This indicates that violation of causality has something to do with how far the system is away from local equilibrium. Motivated by these observations, we scrutinize a one-dimensionally expanding conformal system from a view point of causality and constrain the initial conditions whose solutions by no means violate the causality. We first define the degree of non-equilibrium and then describe its time evolution solving the Muller-Israel-Stewart type constitutive equation in one-dimensionally expanding system. We find that it is acausal in fact when the system is far away from local equilibrium. Using these solutions, we quantify a range of the inverse Reynolds number in which hydrodynamic description is justified from a view point of causality. This sheds light on the understanding of initial stages in high-energy nuclear collisions.

In such ultra-high-density matter, many phenomena are expected, such as the transition to the non-confined phase. Among those, a few things are well understood about high-density matter, both theoretically and experimentally, and these are currently being actively studied.
 
J-PARC Heavy Ion Project (J-PARC-HI) is an experimental project to generate and study ultra-high-density matter using 1-12A GeV heavy ion beams. Although the current J-PARC is a 30GeV proton accelerator, it has successfully supplied a high-intensity beam of about 60kW even in slow extraction. Therefore, the J-PARC-HI case will expect high-flux beams with excellent performance. In other words, only the injector must be newly constructed, and the acceleration afterwards will use the current acceleration scheme as much as possible. The design of the injector and the acceleration scheme is being studied in detail by the J-PARC accelerator group.
 
We have the staging plan of the project into two stages. In the first stage, a booster ring will reuse the KEK-PS. Even in this stage, we expect to achieve an intensity of $10^{8}$Hz. In the second stage, a new booster ring will be constructed where the highest intensity heavy ion beam of $10^{11}$Hz is expected. We consider the primary goal of the first stage as the confirmation of non-confined phases in high-density regions.

Poster Session,poster,Topological separation of dielectron signals using machine learning in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Dielectrons are an exceptional tool to study the evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. In central collisions, the energy densities are sufficient to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Thermal e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs with invariant masses around 1.5 GeV/$c^{2}$ can be used to estimate the early average temperature of the QGP. 

At LHC energies, the cross section of heavy-flavour (HF) production is large and correlated HF hadron decays dominate the dielectron yield for invariant masses above 1.1 GeV/$c^2$. Their contribution is modified in the medium compared to elementary collisions to an unknown extent, leading to large uncertainties in the subtraction of known hadronic sources. Alternatively, a topological separation based on the larger decay length of HF hadrons of the order of $c\tau \approx 100-500\;\mu$m, can be utilised to disentangle them from the contribution of thermal dielectrons originating from the primary vertex. To classify these pairs, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be applied to capture the complex multidimensional correlations in the tracking parameters.

In this poster, ML techniques to classify dielectron sources based on their decay topology with the ALICE detector will be presented for simulated Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. Their performance will be compared to the established analysis on the distance-of-closes approach (DCA) to the primary vertex. Finally, the way these ML techniques could be incorporated in future dielectron analysis will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jerome', 'last_name': 'Jung', 'fullName': 'Jung, Jerome', 'id': '7824303', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt (DE)', 'emailHash': '8dbd81d383f91097c76bfd6b47ff26e2', 'db_id': 7824303, 'person_id': 7559390}"
Poster Session,poster,Measuring the Global Spin Alignment of Vector Mesons in Heavy Ion Collisions by STAR,"Robertson, C.W.",Purdue University,USA,"In non-central Heavy-Ion collisions, a large orbital angular momentum is produced. A part of the orbital angular momentum can polarize the quarks and anti-quarks, hence the vector mesons, inside the medium. Recently, STAR measured the global spin alignment of φ(1020) mesons in Au+Au collisions from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan I (BES I) program [1].

The global spin alignment, quantified by the 00th coefficient of the spin density matrix ρ00, is measured by a fit to the acceptance and efficiency corrected φ meson yield versus polar angle (θ∗) between the daughter kaon in the parent’s rest frame and the orbital angular momentum direction.

In this poster, we present an alternative approach to extract ρ00 by utilizing the ⟨cos2 θ∗⟩ as a function of pair-invariant mass instead of analyzing the φ meson yields in cos θ∗ bins. The acceptance and efficiency effects are taken into account by using the combinatorial background. This method only uses the signal to background ratio and is insensitive to few percent variations in the yield vs. θ∗. We report preliminary results from this method and compare with previous measurements by STAR.

Poster Session,poster,Analysis of the critical fluctuations in the light-nuclei production,"Wu, Shanjin",Peking University,Unknown,"We investigate the critical fluctuations in light-nuclei production in heavy-ion collisions based on the coalescence model, where we introduce corrections to the distribution function from critical correlators from the Ising model.

The measurement of the yield ratio of light nuclei, $N_tN_p/N^2_d$ (with $N_t$, $N_p$, and $N_d$ being triton, proton, and deuteron numbers, respectively), in STAR collaboration [1], has shown a non-monotonic behavior as a function of collision energy in a heavy-ion collision. Based on the analyses with idealized setups, it was also suggested that the yield ratio is one of the observables for a possible signal of the QCD critical point [2]. However, it is non-trivial how the yield ratio is affected by the other contributions in realistic setups of heavy-ion collisions. In our previous study, we expanded the distribution function of nucleons in terms of phase-space cumulants [3] and found that the effect of cumulants cancels in the yield ratio up to the second order, which also includes the effect of radial expansions.

In the first part of this talk, we further investigate the effect of non-trivial phase-space distributions [3] by example distributions including the Woods-Saxon distribution, two Gaussian forms, and the blast-wave-type anisotropic flows. We find that the spatial structure decreases the ratio while the momentum anisotropy increases it. In the second part, we extend our analysis by evaluating the critical effect in the generalized light-nuclei ratio $N_p^{B-A}N_B^{A-1}/N_A^{B-1}$ [4,5] with $N_A$ being the nuclei yield of mass number A.  We introduce the critical correction to the phase-space distribution by employing the critical fluctuations from the Ising model.  We find that the overall non-monotonic behavior of the yield ratio arises from the increasing correlation length near the critical point. In addition, if the strength of the critical fluctuation is sufficiently significant, the collision energy dependence of the ratio exhibits double peaks by the interplay between the two- and three-point critical corrections.

Poster Session,poster,"Probing the QGP to Hadron-Gas Phase Transition with Charge, Strange, and Baryon Balance Functions","Pruneau, Claude Andre",Wayne State University (US),United States,"Charge balance functions (BFs) were introduced at the beginning of the RHIC era  as a tool to investigate the evolution of particle production in heavy-ion collisions and identify the presence of delayed hadronization as an indicator of the formation of long lived isentropic expanding quark gluon plasma in high-energy nucleus-nucleus (A--A) collisions. It later emerged that BFs are rather sensitive to the radial expansion dynamics of the matter formed in these collisions and can, in principle, be used to probe hadron production mechanisms such as the formation of clusters. Later still, it was found that the azimuthal dependence of hadrons BFs, particularly heavier hadrons, is sensitive to  the  diffusivity of light quarks. In this work, we show how the conservation of quantum numbers can be properly accounted for and how cross-species BF can be exploited to determine the relative strengths of distinct species pairs  from heavy hadron decay feeddowns, long range correlations arising at the onset of collisions, and  contributions from baryon stopping. We addtionally  examine the possibility of  probing the degree of equilibration achieved in A--A collisions (at both RHIC and LHC energies) as well as the evaluation  of QGP susceptibilities by means of measurements of charge, strange, and baryon BFs.

Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic theories for a system of classical weakly self-interacting ultra-relativistic scalar particles,"Soares Rocha, Gabriel",Unknown,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been widely employed in high energy nuclear physics, with applications in heavy-ion collisions, neutron star mergers and coalescing matter in black holes [1]. Due to the acausality and instability of relativistic Navier-Stokes (NS) theory [2], one usually employs Israel-Stewart-like (IS) formulations of fluid dynamics [3] in which the constitutive relations for the dissipative currents are replaced by relaxation type equations. This comes at the expense of a more complex structure of the partial differential equations being solved, which renders the assessment of features of solutions in the non-linear regime very intricate. More recently, the Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory has emerged [4], where theorems for causality, linear stability and existence of solutions can be rigorously established, but unconventional matching conditions are required. For all of the aforementioned theories, transport coefficients play a fundamental role. However, their computation is usually a very non-trivial task, even in the context of Kinetic Theory. We show that this difficulty can be circumvented for a system composed of classical ultra-relativistic scalar particles weakly interacting via a quartic potential. Then, the specific form of the cross-section [5] allows for the computation of transport coefficients without approximations beyond the power-counting scheme of the corresponding hydrodynamic theory. In this contribution, we calculate all transport coefficients of NS, BDNK and IS theories and demonstrate, in a Bjorken flow scenario, that NS and BDNK theories are pathological for large gradients and thus cannot be used to describe the early stages of heavy ion collisions. For BDNK and IS theories, attractor solutions are also analyzed.

In this contribution, we present intermittency analysis of the normalized factorial moments ($F\rm{_{q}}$) of the multiplicity distributions of the charged particles produced in Pb--Pb collisions as a function of phase-space resolution. The spatial configurations of the charged particles in two-dimensional ($\eta,\varphi$) phase space are investigated. For a system with scale-invariant dynamical fluctuations due to the characteristic critical behavior near the phase transition, the $F\rm{_{q}}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing phase-space resolution, which is a signature of self-similar fluctuations and the fractal structure of the system. The dependence of the fractal dimension $D_{q}$ on the order parameter $q$ is indicative of the multifractal nature of the system. By relating the $q^{\rm{th}}$-order $F\rm{_{q}}$ to the normalized second-order factorial moment ($F\rm{_{2}}$), we extract the scaling exponent ($\nu$), which provides information about the order of the phase transition in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. The first results of the intermittency analysis show the presence of scale-invariant fluctuations, the multifractal nature of the system, and that $\nu$ is independent of $p\rm{_{T}}$ in the soft $p\rm{_{T}}$ region.

Poster Session,poster,Model study on bottomonia modification in small collision systems,"Lim, Sanghoon",Pusan National University (KR),USA,"Quarkonia have been long considered as key features in heavy ion collision to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. One of the key signatures is the sequential yield suppression for different quarkonium states in nucleus-nucleus (A+A) collisions compared to p+p collisions following the ordering of their binding energies. Moreover, sequential yield modification has also been observed in small collision systems such p+Au and p+Pb collisions. Theoretical models consider dissociation and regeneration effects to describe these experimental results, whereas the additional suppression of excited states in small systems is considered to be beyond initial-state effects which is premature to claim for any hot medium effect. To quantitatively test and disentangle such hot medium effects, a model study is performed in various small collision systems such as p+p, p+Pb, p+O, and O+O collisions for $\Upsilon(nS)$ production. In this model, we incorporate a theoretical calculation of hot in-medium effects for $\Upsilon(nS)$ states into a Monte Carlo simulation to more realistically probe the medium produced in heavy ion collisions with event-by-event initial collision geometry and hydrodynamical evolution. The theory calculation considers gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering for dissociation and their inverse reaction for regeneration and reasonably describes the modification of $\Upsilon(1S)$ in Pb+Pb collisions.

In this study, the measurements of the charm hadrons $D^0$, $D^+$, $D_s^+$, $\Lambda_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ performed by the ALICE, CMS and LHCb collaborations in $pp$ collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=\rm 5.02$ TeV are combined in transverse momentum and rapidity, and, using the most recent theoretical calculations, are extrapolated to the full phase space to determine the total charm-quark production cross section $\sigma_{c\bar{c}}$. We will discuss the final result, which increases the existing tension between experimental data and fixed order calculations, together with comparisons to PYTHIA predictions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jiayin', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, Jiayin', 'id': '7884866', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Cagliari', 'emailHash': 'd92122ddb053426167b500ee6a49edbb', 'db_id': 7884866, 'person_id': 7519653}"

Illinois at Urbana Champaign (US),USA,"In this poster, we present the ATLAS measurement of the centrality dependence of the dijet per-event yield at center-of-mass energy 8.16 TeV in $p$+Pb collisions. The per-event yield of unfolded dijet pairs is presented in terms of kinematic variables that allow for full characterization of the partonic scattering system, i.e. the average $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ of the dijet, $p_{\mathrm{T,Avg}} = (p_{\mathrm{T,1}} + p_{\mathrm{T,2}})/2$, the boost of the dijet system, $y^{b} = (y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{1} + y^{\mathrm{CN}}_{2})/2$, and the half rapidity separation between the jets, $y^{\ast} = |y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{1} - y^{\mathrm{CM}}_{2}|/2$. Initial state effects are investigated by constructing central-to-peripheral ratios of dijet yields, $R_{\mathrm{CP}}$. We present $R_\mathrm{CP}$ results comparing central collisions with peripheral ones rescaled by the nuclear thickness function $T_{AB}$, in order to equalize the two based on pure geometrical expectations. The $R_\mathrm{CP}$ shows a clear dependence on the Bjorken-$x$ of the parton extracted from the proton in the hard-scattering, $x_\mathrm{p}$, while no clear trend is observed while displaying the results as a function $x_\mathrm{Pb}$.

Their shape and strength are sensitive to the interplay of all production processes, and are further influenced by transport mechanisms, including longitudinal,  radial, and anisotropic flow.  However, the correlations are also sensitive to instrumental effects, including distortions associated with  space-charge effects in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), to technical issues related to pile up rejection, suppression of contamination, and corrections for particle losses. It is thus a fundamental quality control for the ALICE data-taking machinery to perform analyses already completed and compare the results obtained with the new GEM readout, the new data-collecting machinery, and the new software framework, with those obtained with the prior TPC readout technology and overall scenario. 

In this contribution, two-particle number and transverse momentum correlations in different multiplicity classes of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6\;\text{TeV}$ recorded by ALICE during the Run 3 at the LHC are reported. The very large datasets obtained in Run 3 will provide for a significant reduction of statistical and systematic uncertainties and enable more differential analyses of these correlations based on more varied and selective kinematic criteria.

These formalisms have distinct domains of validity in kinematic regions. Going beyond the shock wave approximation and considering the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect, which arises from the interference of initial- and final-state scatterings, we show for the first time that CGC and HT formalisms can be unified to describe the same physics in the transition region where they overlap. This unified picture provides a framework for understanding the QCD dynamics in the transition from dilute to dense nuclear matter, paving the way for mapping out the QCD evolution phase diagram of nuclear medium from dilute to dense region.

The study of various hadrons, characterized by diverse internal structures, constituent quark numbers, and quark species, has been essential for understanding QGP properties. It has become increasingly evident that hadron yields in nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions exhibit modifications compared to proton-proton collisions, which can be attributed to their internal structures. Therefore, analyzing the yields of hadrons with unidentified internal structures in such collisions can give valuable insights into their composition. Numerous hadrons with unknown internal structures, such as ${\rm f_0}$ mesons (e.g., ${\rm f_0}$(1500) and ${\rm f_0}$(1710), leading glueball candidates), have been observed in the mass range of 1-2 GeV/c$^2$
With its advanced particle identification capabilities, precise secondary vertex determination, and extensive data sample, the ALICE experiment is ideally suited for this study. These features are crucial as these mesons decay into hadrons with relatively long lifetimes, such as the ${\rm K^0_s K^0_s}$ pair.

The study of source radii in heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies can provide information about the phase transition from hadronic matter to quark-gluon plasma and  can help to distinguish between different models of the initial state and particle production mechanisms. Furthermore having the source fixed at both high and low energies allows for a direct comparison of the interaction at different energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'MAHIMA', 'last_name': 'SHARMA', 'fullName': 'SHARMA, MAHIMA', 'id': '7824351', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu', 'emailHash': 'b1be122724ed569f105006d9917fc305', 'db_id': 7824351, 'person_id': 7559095}"
Poster Session,poster,First feasibility study for Asymmetric Cumulants of flow amplitudes in CBM at FAIR,"Bilandzic, Ante",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"Besides the traditional flow studies of individual flow amplitudes $v_n$, independent information about all stages in heavy-ion evolution can be extracted from multi-harmonic correlations of flow amplitudes. The simplest realization is Symmetric Cumulants (SC), which correlate the same-order moments of two or more flow amplitudes. In recent studies, it was demonstrated that SC can reveal the details of the differential temperature dependence of specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) of quark--gluon plasma, while individual $v_n$ amplitudes are sensitive only to the average values $\langle\eta/s\rangle$. 

The generalization of SC to correlations involving different-order moments of flow amplitudes is not trivial, and it was accomplished only recently. These generalized flow observables are dubbed Asymmetric Cumulants (AC), and they by definition extract new and independent information in flow analyses that is not accessible either to $v_n$, nor to SC observables. 

In this contribution, the first feasibility study for centrality dependence of AC is presented for data-taking conditions in CBM experiment at FAIR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ante', 'last_name': 'Bilandzic', 'fullName': 'Bilandzic, Ante', 'id': '7824528', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '65e58f83f1ec1a2bc937d4fa18424a31', 'db_id': 7824528, 'person_id': 7541686}"
Poster Session,poster,Development of unfolding techniques for dijet measurements in sPHENIX,"Meskowitz, Micah",Unknown,Unknown,"The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a liquid created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions where quarks and gluons become deconfined. This state allows us to examine the emergent properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) under extreme conditions. sPHENIX, a new experiment at RHIC, studies the QGP created in Au-Au collisions and started taking data in 2023. Collimated sprays of particles, called jets, may be created in these collisions, typically in back-to-back (dijet) configurations. These dijets are produced prior to the formation of the QGP and interact with it during their development, losing energy ins a process called “jet quenching” which probes the nature of the QGP. When these dijets do not pass through the same path-length of QGP, the energy loss will be asymmetric. The dijet momentum imbalance (x$_J$) is defined as the ratio between the sub-leading (second highest energy) jet’s energy and the leading (highest energy) jet’s energy, and is a useful measure of energy loss. However, dijet measurements are sensitive to the underlying event and detector resolution. To correct for these effects we examine the development and application of Bayesian unfolding techniques on PYTHIA jets embedded into HIJING Au+Au background. Future uses will include implementation on measured dijet distributions in sPHENIX.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Micah', 'last_name': 'Meskowitz', 'fullName': 'Meskowitz, Micah', 'id': '7903142', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fa4ff85295c6ce28ecacfbbaa1f7658c', 'db_id': 7903142, 'person_id': 7709382}"

Poster Session,poster,The effects of hydrodynamic causality conditions on Bayesian analysis,"Siqueira Domingues, Thiago",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"Despite the success of hydrodynamic models in describing heavy-ion collisions, there have long been questions about its regime of validity.  Recently-derived conditions on the causality of the hydrodynamic equations [1] can give a concrete answer --- if evolution is acausal, it is not a faithful representation of the underlying QCD theory.  It is now known that current simulation models reach acausal regimes, at least sometimes.  

We study the phenomenological effects of this knowledge in the context of a comprehensive, multi-system model-to-data comparison that was originally performed by the JETSCAPE Collaboration [2].  Different ways are explored to include information about causality violation (and therefore the validity of the model) into the analysis, and its effects on the extracted physical properties.    Specifically, when performing Bayesian inference we can include the information in the prior probability (quantifying our trust in the model based on the degree or frequency of causality violation), or in the model uncertainty (estimating an increased uncertainty when there is violation of causality).   The resulting changes in the posterior give an indication of the uncertainty that is contributed by model (in)validity, and  the importance of addressing these fundamental issues in our treatment of heavy-ion collisions.

As an additional study, we identify various causes of acausality in hydrodynamic simulations, and therefore the best targets for designing more realistic models.

They are then propagated backward in space-time following an initial-state shower to obtain the initiating partons' energies and momenta before the collision. These energies and momenta are then subtracted from the incoming colliding nucleons for soft-particle production, modeled by the 3D-Glauber + hydrodynamics + hadronic transport framework.

Poster Session,poster,First Deuteron Production Measurement in Proton-Proton Interactions at SPS energies by NA61/SHINE,"Shukla, Anirvan",University of Hawai'i at Manoa (US),Unknown,"NA61/SHINE has measured the first deuteron production in proton-proton interactions at 158 GeV/c (sqrt(s) = 17.3 GeV). These measurements will be presented and compared to different nuclear formation models. The two most prevalent formation models—the thermal and coalescence models—are based on different underlying physics. A better understanding of (anti)nuclei production mechanisms is needed, which drives the effort to analyze high-statistics data sets from fixed-target experiments. Additionally, new updated measurements of proton, antiproton, π±, and K± spectra will be showcased, along with unique measurements of Omega and K0s production in p+p interactions.

Deuteron production measurements are important for understanding cosmic-ray antinuclei. The detection of cosmic antinuclei holds the potential to be a breakthrough approach for identifying dark matter signatures. The main source of cosmic antinuclei background are interactions between cosmic-ray protons and interstellar hydrogen gas. Gaining a deeper insight into deuteron production in p+p interactions is an essential first step in modelling these astrophysical processes. Furthermore, modeling of light antinuclei production typically requires antiproton production cross sections as input. Precise antiproton measurements are crucial. The updated hadron spectra exhibit significantly reduced statistical uncertainties and extend the phase space coverage in rapidity and transverse momentum compared to earlier measurements. These advancements can be employed to refine our understanding of proton-proton interactions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anirvan', 'last_name': 'Shukla', 'fullName': 'Shukla, Anirvan', 'id': '7914697', 'affiliation': ""University of Hawai'i at Manoa (US)"", 'emailHash': 'ae53deb623689e772752ac5743be41ef', 'db_id': 7914697, 'person_id': 7558747}"

In particular, the heavy flavor hadron inside jet production can provide vital information about the heavy quark hadronization process and how such process gets modified in a nuclear medium. Less recombination contribution to the hadron production is expected at RHIC compared to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) measurements, which makes these measurements an unique approach to explore the universality of heavy quark fragmentation functions in different nuclear environments.

Before physics analyses can take place using the EMCal, however, it must be calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale, and this will be done by calibrating the EMCal’s response relative the neutral pion’s ($\pi^0$) invariant mass. $\pi^0$’s are reconstructed from pairs of EMCal clusters that were produced by decay photons from $\pi^0$’s.  However, due to cluster merging effects, this procedure is not practical at high momentum. Thus, as a high-energy cross-check on the energy scale calibration, the calorimeter’s response relative to $\eta$ mesons, whose heavier mass allows for reconstruction without merging to much higher momenta, will also be measured. The EMCal’s successful calibration will enable measurements with the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons, which will take advantage of both sPHENIX’s large acceptance and the high luminosity 200 GeV Au + Au data set currently being recorded.

This poster will present the advancements made in calibrating both the inner and outer HCals utilizing cosmic ray muons. Energy deposited by muons traversing the sectors is recorded, and events in which muons pass through all scintillator tiles in a tower are selected for analysis. The primary diagnostic is the Most Probable Value (MPV) of the ADC distributions associated with these events. Subsequently, MPVs undergo corrections to account for temperature variations and the tower tiles’ response to LED signals. These corrected MPVs determine the gain of each tower. A Monte Carlo study, based on Geant4 simulations, will establish a reference for the relative calibration of the gains on a tower-by-tower basis. The bias voltage applied to the silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) will be adjusted to fine-tune the gain and eliminate the outliers, resulting in a more accurate calibration of the HCals.

A wavelength shifting fiber is glued into each tile using an optical epoxy with an index of refraction matching that of the scintillator. The tiles cover 16 segments in $\eta$ and 24 in $\phi$. The sectors were installed into two disks covering a pseudorapidity of 2.1 < |$\eta$| < 4.9. To build the detector, scintillating plastic was milled into a triangular shape to create 24 sectors.

Optical fibers were then glued into the grooves, and the channels were filled with a reflective epoxy to achieve optical isolation between tiles. An overview of this construction process will be given in detail, including the machining of the sectors, the installation of the fibers in the tiles, and the creation of two types of bundles of fiber optic assemblies.

is associated
with the common flow velocity in the bulk system, whereas at higher pT path length and

Flash Talks,other,Current status and future prospects of measuring hadronic interactions in pp collisions at 13.6 TeV with ALICE,"Riedel, Anton Albert",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"Understanding the strong interaction between nucleons and hyperons is fundamental for the microscopic description of bound systems as well as for modeling the equation of the state of dense stellar objects, such as neutron stars. Conventional scattering and hypernuclei measurements are insufficient to support theoretical predictions about the interaction between hadrons containing strangeness. Recently, the ALICE Collaboration has shown that two-particle correlation measurements are a prominent tool for studying strong interaction in detail.

During the ongoing Run 3 data-taking period at the LHC, the upgraded ALICE detector will deliver an increased luminosity that will enable precision studies of interactions in hadronic systems with strangeness up to S=-3 and with charm quark content. Consequently, it will be possible to test lattice QCD calculations and chiral effective field theory models with unprecedented accuracy. This will require constraining the emission source using correlation measurements of particle pairs for which the final-state interaction is well known. For this, the p-p correlations were measured for the first time in Run 3 and will be presented in this talk. In addition, the p-$\Lambda$ correlation function was measured as a benchmark in the S=-1 sector. This is essential for the investigation of three-body nuclear forces, which are a vital missing element in the description of dense nuclear matter. The prospects for these future studies are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anton Albert', 'last_name': 'Riedel', 'fullName': 'Riedel, Anton Albert', 'id': '7887444', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': '6bd45cda9202f45f66ccc5bb2b2194c2', 'db_id': 7887444, 'person_id': 7710396}"

Flash Talks,other,Dynamics of causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in an expanding system,"Fujii, Shin-ei",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"Nowadays, relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics including effects of finite viscosities is commonly used to extract transport properties of the quark gluon plasma (QGP), such as shear viscosity and bulk viscosity, from experimental data. However, according to the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in non-equilibrium statistical physics, fluctuations and dissipation are always accompanied with each other. Since phenomena induced by the hydrodynamic fluctuations, namely, thermal fluctuations associated with the viscosities, include the information of transport coefficients through FDR, these provide a multidimensional analysis of transport properties. Therefore, hydrodynamic fluctuations must be incorporated in the dynamical framework of relativistic heavy ion collisions. This could open up a new way of diagnosing the QGP properties precisely.

We derive equations of motion (EoM) of hydrodynamic fluctuations by considering the perturbative expansion of energy-momentum tensor around the Bjorken's boost invariant solution [1]. These EoMs are derived without any specific forms of constitutive equations contrary to a previous study in which constitutive equations from the first order dissipative hydrodynamics are assumed [2]. Therefore, this framework enables us to employ any kinds of constitutive equations at the second order dissipative hydrodynamics which satisfy the causality. This is the most precise framework in one-dimensional expanding system so far. With this framework, we describe the dynamics of (1+1)-dimensional causal hydrodynamic fluctuations and observe fluctuations of energy density are frozen in the early stage. It indicates that the distribution of energy density carries the information of the early stage of evolution. Furthermore, we analyze correlations of energy density fluctuations and find their behaviors are closely related with the properties of the medium such as relaxation time and sound velocity.

Previous measurement with LEP1 data at $\sqrt{s}=91$ GeV shows no significant long-range correlations in either lab coordinate or thrust coordinate analyses, with associated yield distributions in agreement with predictions from the PYTHIA v6.1 event generator. The use of higher collision energy LEP2 data allows access to not only higher event multiplicitybut also to additional production channels beyond the $e^+e^- \to \gamma^\star/Z \to q\bar{q}$ process. Notably, the highest multiplicity bin ($N_{\rm trk} \ge 50$) suggests a tantalizing disagreement with MC and implies the potential to search for collective phenomena in small systems. This measurement is pushing the studies of long-range correlation to the smallest collision system limit and includes the first flow coefficient ($v_n$) measurement in $e^+e^-$ collisions, which uses a Fourier decomposition analysis to quantify the anisotropy in the azimuthal two-particle correlation as a function of charged particles' transverse momentum.

Performing these measurements in intervals of charged particle multiplicities provides sensitivity to understand whether different hadronisation mechanisms are at play in small and large hadronic colliding systems.

In this contribution, ALICE will present a selection of the latest charm and beauty production measurements in proton-proton (pp) collisions, which can shed light on the modification of the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanisms.

We show that the connection between the stability of hydrodynamics and the evolution of plane waves is not as straightforward as in the homogeneous case and is restricted to the equilibrium-preserving subspace of the cotangent bundle, which is determined by thermal vorticity.

Chirality,parallel,Search for anomalous chiral effects in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Wang, Chunzheng",Fudan University (CN),Unknown,"The interplay of the chiral anomaly and the strong magnetic or vortical field created in the off-central heavy-ion collisions can give rise to anomalous chiral effects in the quark--gluon plasma.

The ESE technique is also adopted to quantitatively constrain the strength of the CMW signal, which is examined by the correlation between the charge asymmetry and the elliptic flow.

Recent ALICE measurements have demonstrated large dynamical correlations between produced neutral and charged kaons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.76 $ TeV~\cite{ALICE:2021fpb}. These integrated correlations cannot be described by conventional heavy-ion models, such as EPOS and AMPT. So far, the ALICE measurements can only be described by invoking the presence of condensates ~\cite{Kapusta:2022ovq}. A candidate for such a condensate is the Disoriented Chiral Condensate (DCC)~\cite{Mohanty:2005mv}. DCC arises from chiral symmetry restoration in the QGP, which breaks during the phase transition to form a condensate which coherently emits hadrons. Therefore, the discovery of DCC would indicate that chiral symmetry is restored in the QGP, a major prediction of QGP formation that has yet to be confirmed experimentally. 

To investigate these anomalous kaon correlations further, a differential analysis of two-particle angular correlation functions of charged and neutral kaons as a function of $\Delta \varphi$ and $\Delta \eta$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02 $ TeV is intended.

EM Probes,parallel,Direct photon production and correlations in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Arata, Carolina",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),Unknown,"Measurements of direct photons provide valuable information on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) because they are colour-neutral and created during all phases of the collision. Sources of photons include initial hard scatterings, Bremsstrahlung and the fragmentation process, jet-medium interactions, and radiation from the medium. 

Direct thermal photons, produced by the plasma, are sensitive to the collective flow at photon production time. Their exponential spectral shape gives access experimentally to an effective medium temperature.
Furthermore, Bose-Einstein correlations can be used to study the space-time evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions with Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry. The correlation function is sensitive to the source size and the direct photon fraction.

Direct prompt photons produced in hadronic collisions through annihilation and Compton processes have minimal event activity from the hard process, allowing the isolation method to suppress background photons from parton fragmentation and neutral meson electromagnetic decays. 
Isolated photon measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can constrain NLO pQCD predictions. Hadrons correlated with isolated photons are a promising channel to study the energy loss in heavy-ion collisions and to constrain the $Q^{2}$ of the initial hard scattering, obtaining information on the amount of energy lost by the parton recoiling off the photon. 

The ALICE experiment reconstructs photons from conversion photons using its excellent tracking capabilities and directly in calorimeters. Combining these methods, ALICE can measure direct photons at mid-rapidity with transverse momentum from 0.4 GeV/$c$, where direct thermal photons should dominate until few GeV, then direct prompt photons take over and can be measured until about 100 GeV/$c$.

The degree of modification of jets by the medium depends on how well the medium can resolve the internal jet structure. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the multi-partonic structure of jets and their interaction with a strongly-interacting medium. Specifically, we focus on the R-dependence of the jet $v_2$ coefficients as a function of collision centrality, which provides a unique handle on coherence physics.
Using resummed quenching weights that incorporate both elastic and state-of-the-art radiative energy loss and embedding the system into a realistic heavy-ion environment, we compute the R-dependence of jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC. We observe a very mild R-dependence at RHIC kinematics, similar to what was found at the LHC. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data.
Finally, we present results for the jet azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ as a function of R, which shows a sequential collapse of $v_2$ for moderate R jets towards the result for small R=0.1 as centrality is decreased. This behavior is due to the strong dependence of the decoherence angle $\theta_c$ on the in-medium traversed length, which affects the size of the resolved phase-space over which quenching weights are resummed.

To illustrate this, we study jet-particle correlations and the distributions of jet-induced identified particles with respect to the jet direction in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC via a multi-phase transport model. We find a strong enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios for associated particles at intermediate transverse momentum around the triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions, due to the coalescence of jet-excited medium partons. Since the lost energy from jets can diffuse to large angles, such baryon-to-meson-ratio enhancement is more pronounced for larger relative distance from the jet axis. We argue that the experimental confirmation of the enhancement of jet-induced baryon-to-meson ratios around the jets will provide an unambiguous evidence for the medium response to jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

All data have been collected by the STAR experiment in the fixed-target mode during the second phase of the RHIC beam energy scan program. The directed flow of hypernuclei shows a similar collision energy and mass dependence to light nuclei, as seen in the slope of $v_1$ at mid-rapidity $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$. This suggests that the two types of nuclei are formed in a similar way. We also observe that the slope $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$ decreases with increasing energy, with a stronger energy dependence for heavier nuclei. For light nuclei, the elliptic flow results indicate an out-of-plane expansion ($v_2 < 0$) at the lowest collision energy, whereas in-plane expansions ($v_2 > 0$) are evident at all other collision energies.

Following the quantum kinetic theory, we decompose the polarization vector as the parts induced by thermal vorticity, shear tensor and the spin Hall effect (SHE). We find that the polarization induced by SHE and the total polarization strongly depends on the initial conditions.  At $7.7$GeV, SHE gives a sizeable contribution and even flips the sign of the local polarization along the beam direction for AMPT initial condition, which is not observed for SMASH initial condition. Meanwhile, the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction induced by SHE with AMPT initial condition does not always increase with decreasing collision energies. Next, we find that the polarization along the beam direction is sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient, but the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction is not.  Our results for the global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ agree well with the STAR data.

Poster Session,poster,Characterising the initial conditions and probing the nuclear structure with multiparticle correlations techniques at ALICE,"Nielsen, Emil Gorm",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"High-energy heavy-ion collisions offer a unique and precise way to probe nuclear structures by providing a snapshot of the nuclear distribution at the time of the collision, which is complementary to low-energy nuclear physics experiments.

In this talk, we present a comprehensive scan of flow observables, including anisotropic flow coefficients, nonlinear flow modes, and normalized symmetric cumulants, in Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions measured with ALICE at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} =$ 5.02 and 5.44 TeV, respectively. These measurements can probe distinctive nuclear structures (i.e., quadrupole deformation) in central collisions and the size of the $^{208}$Pb neutron skin in midcentral to peripheral collisions. The measurements of multiparticle cumulants of mean transverse momentum, $[p_\mathrm{T}]$, allow us to probe the size and its fluctuations in the initial state. Furthermore, we present the first measurements of newly proposed multiparticle cumulants between anisotropic flow $v_{\rm n}^{\rm m}$ (m = 2,4) and mean transverse momentum correlations $[p_\mathrm{T}^{(k)}]$ (k $\leq$ 4), in both Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions. The presented measurements and comparisons to the state-of-the-art theoretical model calculations show unambiguous evidence of a deformed and triaxial structure for $^{129}$Xe, and in Pb--Pb collisions further provide tight constraints to the nucleon width $w$, which was poorly controlled before. These studies enormously improve our understanding of the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions and allow us to explore LHC's full potential as a robust nuclear physics machine.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emil Gorm', 'last_name': 'Nielsen', 'fullName': 'Nielsen, Emil Gorm', 'id': '7887406', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': 'fc2e08404ae7bc0e0f07fc1c4e83ad6e', 'db_id': 7887406, 'person_id': 7710370}"

The interaction between charged kaons and (anti)deuterons is a complex subject at both experimental and theoretical levels. From the experimental point of view, so far scattering cross sections at intermediate momenta were performed. Specific information on the strong interaction can be accessed also via kaonic deuterium X-ray spectroscopy but such measurements are challenging due to the available detection efficiency. One of the missing information on $\mathrm{K^{-} d}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d}$ interactions is their scattering lengths. Due to the lack of direct experimental measurements, theoretical predictions for $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d}$ have been made based on input from kaonic hydrogen measurements. There are no published theoretical predictions for the scattering length of $\mathrm{K^{+} d}$. The first femtoscopic measurement of $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{-}\overline{\mathrm{d}}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d} \oplus \mathrm{K}^{+} \overline{\mathrm{d}}$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02\ \mathrm{TeV}$ are presented. In this study, the scattering lengths of $\mathrm{K}^{+} \mathrm{d}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{-} \mathrm{d}$ pairs associated with strong final-state interactions, as well as the source radii of the kaon-deuteron pairs were determined using the Lednický-Lyuboshitz model.

Poster Session,poster,Charmonium production measurement at midrapidity using TRD-triggered data in ALICE,"Seo, Jinjoo",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"Quarkonium production is considered one of the golden probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in heavy-ion collisions.
Due to their large mass, the production of heavy-quarks is governed by hard scales of QCD, while the formation of the bound quarkonium state involves soft QCD scales.
The regeneration process of J/$\psi$ in the QGP or at the phase boundary is crucial for describing the observed centrality, rapidity, and $p_{\mathrm T}$ dependence of J/$\psi$ nuclear modification factor at the LHC.
Quarkonium production in more dilute systems is essential to provide a baseline for Pb--Pb results.
They are also useful for investigating the production mechanisms for pp collisions and studying the cold nuclear matter effect for p--Pb collisions.
The $\psi$(2S) production relative to J/$\psi$ is observable with strong discriminating power between the two regeneration scenarios in Pb--Pb collisions, as well as among quarkonium production models in pp and p--Pb systems.
Thanks to the ALICE online single-electron triggers from the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), the $\psi$(2S) signal can be extracted at midrapidity in the dielectron channel.

Currently, the construction of the STS detector is progressing on several fronts. Firstly, the mechanical design is being finalized and tested, while the cooling concept is being assessed through a thermal demonstrator. In addition, modules assembled during pre-series are undergoing characterization, and the final production phase has begun, with multiple quality control steps in place to ensure reliable module performance and high production yield.

Poster Session,poster,SUBA-Jet: a new coherent jet energy loss model for heavy-ion collisions,"Karpenko, Iurii",FNSPE CTU in Prague,Unknown,"We present a new model for jet quenching via coherent gluon radiation and elastic scatterings off medium partons. The jet energy loss is simulated as a perturbative final-state vacuum parton shower followed by a medium-induced shower originating from elastic and radiative collisions with the medium constituents. Coherency is achieved by starting with trial gluons that act as field dressing of the initial jet parton. These are formed according to a Gunion-Bertsch seed. The QCD version of the LPM effect is attained by increasing the phase of the trial gluons through elastic scatterings with the medium. Above a phase threshold, the trial gluons will be formed and can produce coherent radiation themselves.

The model has been implemented in a Monte Carlo code and has been validated by successfully reproducing the BDMPS-Z prediction for the energy spectrum of radiated gluons in a static medium. The realistic case with minimal assumptions is also produced and shown. In particular, we show the influence of various parameters on the energy spectrum and transverse momentum distribution, such as the in-medium quark masses, the energy transfer in the recoil process, and the phase accumulation criteria, especially for low and intermediate energy gluons.

The model is constructed with realistic medium description and jet-medium coupling in mind. As such, we also show the first results when the parton shower is coupled to realistic expanding medium modelled usign vHLLE code. Finally, we use Pythia for jet hadronization and draw a basic comparison to RHIC and LHC data.

The collision energy dependence of the cross section and the transverse momentum distribution of dielectrons from the Breit-Wheeler process in heavy-ion collisions are calculated with lowest-order EPA-QED. Within a given experimental kinematic acceptance, the cross section is found to increase while the pair transverse momentum decreases with increasing beam energy. The corresponding results are also compared with STAR measurements, which are consistent with each other and found to be sensitive to the nuclear charge distribution and the infrared-divergence of the ultra-Lorentz boosted Coulomb field. Following this approach we demonstrate that the experimental measurements of the Breit-Wheeler process in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions can be used to quantitatively constrain the nuclear charge radius. The extracted parameters show sensitivity to the impact parameter dependence, and can be used to study the initial-state and final-state effects in hadronic interactions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaofeng', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Xiaofeng', 'id': '7884833', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '12ecd79bfef8d58dd6e4e9a52ec0910f', 'db_id': 7884833, 'person_id': 7557528}"

The cumulants of the distributions of the conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions can be related to the equation of state in lattice QCD (LQCD), making first-principles calculations accessible in the experiment. Recent results from LQCD suggest that the thermodynamic susceptibilities, which are related to the experimentally measurable cumulants of the conserved charges, are significantly affected by strong magnetic fields.

In this talk, measurements of the second-order cumulants of the (anti-)proton and net-proton numbers in Pb--Pb collisions with the ALICE detector at the LHC are presented. The moments of the net-proton number, used as a proxy for the baryon number, are calculated using the Identity Method to avoid the problem of misidentification.

Non-statistical fluctuations are observed in all collision systems, indicating correlated particle emission. The central Pb--Pb collisions show a significant reduction in the fluctuation compared to the peripheral collisions and are in qualitative agreement with previous measurements in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. This effect is discussed in view of radial flow effects and/or the presence of mini-jets. The positive skewness of the $\langle p_{\rm{T} }\rangle$ fluctuation, which has been proposed as an essential consequence of the hydrodynamic evolution of the produced fireball in heavy-ion collisions, is observed. The kurtosis is found to decrease with increasing system size and saturates at the Gaussian expectation for most central Pb--Pb collisions. To investigate the impact of jets in the measurement of the $\langle p_{\rm{T} }\rangle$ fluctuations, a transverse spherocity study was performed and found that jetty events show higher fluctuations compared to isotropic events.

Poster Session,poster,Performance study of the exclusively reconstructed  $B^\pm$ meson in the  $J/\psi$ decay channel with ALICE,"Storehaug, Ida",University of Oslo (NO),NO,"The $B^\pm$ meson is produced more frequently than any other meson containing beauty quarks in pp collisions at the LHC. Measuring its production cross-section is important for two reasons. Firstly, it allows for testing perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Secondly, it provides an essential reference for measurements of its nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm A \rm A}$) in heavy-ion collisions. The $B^\pm$ meson $R_{\rm A \rm A}$ measurement can provide new constraints on the partonic energy loss mechanism in the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. Since the radiative energy loss depends heavily on the quark mass, the beauty quark, being the heaviest readily observable flavor, is a particularly valuable probe for investigating the mass dependence of the in-medium energy loss mechanisms. Due to its design, ALICE is unique in accessing beauty production in the low $p_{\rm T}$-region at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$). 

This poster shows a performance study of the exclusive reconstruction of the $B^\pm$ meson at midrapidity through the decay channel $B^\pm \rightarrow J/\psi + K^\pm$, with the $J/\psi$ reconstructed in its dielectron decay channel. Exclusive reconstruction of beauty mesons will be done for the first time in ALICE during LHC Run 3. In previous LHC runs, inclusive beauty hadron measurements were carried out via non-prompt $J/\psi$ using the displacement of the secondary vertices with respect to the primary vertex. This study, however, relies on full reconstruction of the $B^\pm$ meson candidate, taking advantage of the improved vertex resolution provided by the upgraded Inner Tracking System of ALICE, fully operational during the LHC Run 3.

These collisions are considered to be an effective way to minimize the flow-driven background contribution to search for the possibly small CME signal. Anisotropic flow is an important tool to understand properties of the QGP medium. Elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is the second-order coefficient in the Fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle distribution of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane. Elliptic flow of charged hadrons has been measured in the isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The magnitude of $v_{2}$ shows difference between the two isobar collisions despite the same nucleon number. This indicates a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between these nuclei. The $v_{2}$ measurements of the strange and multi-strange hadrons are excellent probes for understanding these initial state anisotropies of the medium produced in these collisions, owing to their smaller hadronic cross-section compared to light hadrons. The collected datasets include approximately two billion events per isobaric species, offering a unique opportunity for making this statistically hungry measurement.

Poster Session,poster,Exploring hadronic resonances through EPOS4 model: A study of particle interactions and spectra,"Sumberia, Vikash",University of Jammu (IN),Unknown,"Hadronic resonances are interesting candidates to study the properties of the hadronic phase, which is the time span between the chemical and kinetic freeze-outs,  formed during the evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their short lifetimes, comparable to the lifetime of hadronic phase ($\sim$10 $-$ 12 fm/$c$), they decay in the hadronic phase and their decay products undergo rescattering or regeneration within the hadronic gas. Thus, the yields of the hadronic resonances alter than what was originally produced before the chemical freeze-out. This change in their yield, which is extensively studied to understand the properties of the hadronic phase, depends upon the lifeime of the decaying resonance, the interaction cross-sections of its decay daughters, and the lifetime of the hadronic phase.  \\
In this study, we explore the production yields of hadronic resonances by simulating pp, p$-$Pb and Pb$-$Pb collisions at various centre of mass energies using the latest EPOS4 model. The EPOS4 model employs a comprehensive scheme for simulating high-energy particle collisions, which includes primary interactions based on S-Matrix theory, secondary interactions using a core-corona separation approach, hydrodynamic evolution, micro-canonical hadronization, and a final hadronic afterburner using UrQMD. This scheme allows for the simulation of parallel scatterings and accurately models the complex dynamics of high-energy particle collisions, thus providing some new understanding of a deep connection between four basic concepts in pp and AA collisions: parallel scattering, energy conservation, factorization, and saturation. We measure the transverse momentum spectra ( $p_{\rm{T}}$ ), energy dependence of resonance production, ratio of yield of resonance particles to their corresponding stable particles, nuclear modification factor ( $R_{\rm{pA}}$ and $R_{\rm{AA}}$) for various hadronic resonances of different lifetimes and compare the results with the data available from the ALICE experiment at CERN.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vikash', 'last_name': 'Sumberia', 'fullName': 'Sumberia, Vikash', 'id': '7824438', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu (IN)', 'emailHash': '746023f262668d4c35c5276b50bb5ac7', 'db_id': 7824438, 'person_id': 7558526}"

Recent measurements of the fragmentation fractions of charm hadrons in pp and p–Pb challenge the universality of fragmentation in the presence of a hadronic medium. In addition, the ratio of $p_\mathrm{T}$ spectra of $\mathrm{\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ in pp collisions, shows a separation between the highest and the lowest multiplicity classes within $5.3\sigma$, with the maximum discrepancy occurring for $2\ \mathrm{GeV}/c<p_\mathrm{T}<6\ \mathrm{GeV}/c$, suggesting that additional mechanisms, such as coalescence, might play a role in heavy quark hadronization. In p–Pb collisions, the $p_\mathrm{T}$ behavior is similar to that observed in pp collisions but no strong multiplicity dependence is observed. In PYTHIA, the formation of hadrons is described by fragmentation of strings tuned from $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ and $\mathrm{ep}$ collision measurements, and color reconnection mechanisms are necessary to capture the observed baryon to meson enhancement. By including additional states, predicted by the relativistic quark model, statistical hadronization models  can reproduce as well the $\mathrm{\Lambda_c^+/D^0}$ yield ratio.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of directed flow of inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC,"Singha, Subhash",Institute of Modern Physics CAS,Unknown,"Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons fragmented by highly virtual partons produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions via hard scatterings. Different observables of the jet-medium interaction probe the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma and its dynamics. The bulk medium produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions is expected to be tilted with respect to the beam axis, while the hard scatterings are symmetric along the rapidity. This asymmetry between hard and soft processes coupled with in-medium interactions can induce a large rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) for jets. In fact, it has been observed that the $D^0$ mesons show a significantly larger $v_1$ signal as a function of rapidity compared to charged hadrons at the top-RHIC energy, reflecting the interplay between soft and hard processes.

Poster Session,poster,Multiplicity dependence of $\Upsilon$ and $J/\psi$ production in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV,"Knospe, Anders Garritt",Lehigh University,United States,"Studying quarkonium production allows us to probe the properties of strongly interacting matter, such as the quark-gluon plasma and the gluonic matter in heavy nuclei. While such a probe is widely used, a complete understanding of the quarkonium production mechanism is not yet achieved, even for $p$+$p$ collisions. Therefore, quarkonium studies in $p$+$p$ collisions are essential for advancing the field. Measuring the dependence of self-normalised quarkonium yield on self-normalised charged particle multiplicity can elucidate the interplay of involved soft- and hard-QCD processes. While proposed explanatory mechanisms, including multi-parton interactions, string screening, and gluon radiation, converge at low values of self-normalised multiplicity, their divergence at higher values emphasises the potential for new insights by extending experimental reach in multiplicity.


Herein we present measurements of $\Upsilon$(1S+2S+3S) and $J/\psi$ production, reconstructed through the dielectron decay channel, in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV recorded by the STAR detector in 2017. Observables include transverse momentum and rapidity distributions, as well as the self-normalised $\Upsilon$ and $J/\psi$ yields as a function of self-normalised charged particle multiplicity. The presented analysis utilises a large sample of quarkonia with up to a factor of 10 increase in statistics compared to previous STAR measurements, therefore both improving precision and extending the reach into higher multiplicity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anders Garritt', 'last_name': 'Knospe', 'fullName': 'Knospe, Anders Garritt', 'id': '7886615', 'affiliation': 'Lehigh University', 'emailHash': '3614cc9ab0fffd8752369b3a08996fe5', 'db_id': 7886615, 'person_id': 7709597}"

This work presents comprehensive measurements on both topics for various event-shape and centrality selections of Au+Au collisions at RHIC BES-I (e.g. 11.5, 19.5, and 39~GeV), BES-II (14.6, 27, and 54.4~GeV), and 200~GeV. We present new measurements of the beam energy dependence of higher-order flow-angular de-correlations ($r_n(\eta_a,\eta_b)$) that are sensitive to the three-dimensional initial state. We also study new observables which are selectively sensitive to the viscous attenuation in the final state, such as the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$. We observe a non-monotonic behavior in the longitudinal width of $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$ with the collision energy, which is expected to be proportional to $\eta/s$ according to the ansatz proposed by S. Gavin et. al. [1]. In addition, we further explore the higher-order flow-angular correlation $\langle\cos(a_{1}n_{1}\Psi_{n1}+\cdots+a_{k}n_{k}\Psi_{nk})\rangle$ and the higher-order flow-magnitude correlations $SC(n,m)\{4\}$ and $SC(n,m)\{6\}$ using the $2$- through $6$-particle correlation method. The higher-order flow-angular (magnitude) correlations are predicted to be sensitive to both initial and final state effects. We compare our findings with similar studies conducted at the LHC and with viscous hydrodynamic calculations. Our analyses aim to disentangle the initial and final-state effects and extract the QGP transport properties.

Poster Session,poster,Production of $\Sigma$ baryons as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at the LHC with ALICE,"Heybeck, Benedict",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"The strangeness content of the final state in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been studied through measurements of kaons, Λ, Ξ and Ω baryons in pp, pA and AA collisions. $\Sigma$ baryons contain a single strange quark and form a triplet, with the charge (+, 0, -) depending on the light quark content. In a thermal model scenario, these states are abundant enough to carry a significant fraction of the strangeness produced in the collision. However, the experimental measurement is challenging, and to date only $\Sigma^{0}$ in 7 TeV pp collisions have been measured by ALICE, while few other experiments have measured the charged states at lower pp($\rm p \bar{p}$) collision energies.
A number of methods to identify charged Σ have developed during the LHC Run 2. The decay $\Sigma^{+}$ -> p $\pi^{0}$ can be reconstructed via the direct detection of the proton and the two gammas from the $\pi^{0}$ decay, either through them both converting to $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs or through one converting and the other being reconstructed in the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS). Additionally, a method to detect anti-neutrons in the PHOS has been developed. This allows the (anti-$\Sigma$)$^{\pm}$ -> anti-n + $\pi^{\pm}$ decays to be reconstructed. We present the transverse momentum spectra of $\Sigma^{+}$ and its charge conjugate anti-particle, in both minimum bias and high-multiplicity triggered pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. These are then compared to the latest MC simulations, including the tunes of PYTHIA, which best reproduce the existing hyperon data.
With the advent of Run 3, ALICE has improved the capability of the Inner Tracker, allowing the detection of the charged $\Sigma$ particle with the reconstruction of its decay after traversing several detector layers. The performance of this novel reconstruction method is discussed. In addition, the prospects for measurements of the interaction between $\Sigma$  and other baryon species will be discussed together with the implications for constraining the neutron star equation of state.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Benedict', 'last_name': 'Heybeck', 'fullName': 'Heybeck, Benedict', 'id': '7949139', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt (DE)', 'emailHash': '60851502a9f498bb56690c4692eb77ba', 'db_id': 7949139, 'person_id': 7764772}"

Among them directed flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles in heavy-ion collisions. It is an important probe to study the in-medium dynamics as it is sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of the produced medium. Minimum in the slope of directed flow ($dv_1/dy$) as a function of collision energy has been proposed as a signature of the first-order phase transition between hadronic matter and quark-gluon plasma. The triangular flow $(v_3)$ typically arises from the initial condition fluctuations and is expected to be uncorrelated to the reaction plane. However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane angle ($\Psi_{1}$).

Poster Session,poster,Baryon stopping from the bremsstrahlung photon spectrum,"Nese, Sigurd",University of Oslo (NO),NO,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the colliding nuclei are decelerated and kinetic energy is converted into new particles. This energy loss is referred to as baryon stopping. A fundamental question one can ask in the study of high energy heavy-ion collisions is how much baryon stopping there is. This can be quantified by measuring the net proton rapidity distributions. Previous measurements at RHIC and in fixed target experiments have shown that the amount of stopping decreases with increasing collision energy. At LHC energies, there are no experimental constraints beyond the central rapidity region, where there are no net protons.

In order to investigate the net proton distribution at LHC energies beyond mid-rapidity, we propose using the bremsstrahlung photons emitted from the nuclei as they slow down. In our recent study [1], we investigated stopping scenarios which are based on model calculations or phenomenology and consistent with existing data. Furthermore, we performed a detailed estimate of the background from hadronically produced photons, using the PYTHIA 8.3 event generator, aiming to investigate in which areas of phase space the bremsstrahlung photons constitute a viable observable for baryon stopping. The bremsstrahlung spectra are highly sensitive to the amount of nuclear stopping, and depending on the scenario, a significant signal over background is obtained for pseudorapidities η>∼4−5 and for photon energies ω<∼300−500MeV.

Here, we expand our investigation to include the baryon stopping predicted by the EPOS4 event generator for PbPb collisions at sqrt(sNN)=5.02TeV. EPOS4 gives zero net protons at mid-rapidity, making the bremsstrahlung spectrum from this stopping scenario plausible.

Furthermore, we discuss the bremsstrahlung spectrum coming from proton-proton collisions, which gives insight into the charge dependence of the signal to background ratio of bremsstrahlung photons in hadron collisions.

Differential measurements of the dependence of the inclusive jet nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) on the jet resolution parameter ($R$) may help disentangle energy loss mechanisms and discriminate between different jet quenching models. One recent $R$-dependence measurement by the ALICE collaboration hints that large-$R$ jets lose more energy. This result is inconsistent with the expectation that jets with larger radii will recover more of the energy redistributed to larger angles via jet-medium interactions. However, many models can describe the trend despite including different implementations of physics effects, making it difficult to isolate the impact of a single energy loss mechanism. In this work, we utilize PYTHIA simulations coupled with phenomenologically-derived quenching to better understand the contribution of single effects to this observed $R$-dependence.

Poster Session,poster,Medium response made efficient: a linearized hydro approach,"Yao, Xiaojun",University of Washington,USA,"When a jet injects energy and momentum into a droplet of QGP, it generates a wake that, after the QGP hadronizes, results in the creation of soft and semi-hard particles correlated with the jet direction. This medium response phenomenon plays a crucial role in describing various jet observables, as demonstrated by many jet quenching studies. However, the computational complexity of current techniques used to describe these wakes has hindered a thorough understanding of their phenomenological consequences. In this talk we will describe a computationally efficient approach to determine the properties of hadrons generated by QGP wakes on an event-by-event, jet-by-jet basis. Using a library of template solutions obtained within linearized hydrodynamics on a Bjorken flow, and employing the appropriate set of scalings, translations, rotations, and boosts to build the wake of any jet via superposition of templates, we achieve results similar to those obtained through 3+1D hydrodynamics, but with a computational cost that is orders of magnitude smaller.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaojun', 'last_name': 'Yao', 'fullName': 'Yao, Xiaojun', 'id': '7884527', 'affiliation': 'University of Washington', 'emailHash': '7a75db5ff6bdeafec462dd56a7ba0b17', 'db_id': 7884527, 'person_id': 7544576}"
Poster Session,poster,Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect by Event Shape Engineering as a Function of Invariant Mass in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV from STAR,"Li, Han-Sheng",Purdue University,Unknown,"Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$). In this contribution, we report a fresh investigation of charge separation in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV with the STAR detector using the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) approach [1]. Our approach has several novel aspects, such as using three subevents to identify dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ by using subevent different from particles of interest for the ESE selection. Since the CME is a low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ phenomenon, we further apply the ESE differentially to the $\Delta\gamma$ as a function of the pair invariant mass ($m_{inv}$), particularly at lower $m_{inv}$, which is dominated by a larger fraction of low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ pions. We extract the signal as the intercept by projecting $\Delta \gamma$ to zero $v_{2}$, both integrated over inclusive mass and at low mass. Our results suggest non-zero intercept with an approximately 2$\sigma$ significance, which we compare to the published results from the spectator/participant measurement [2]. The extracted signals, highly sensitive to the CME, may still be contaminated by residual flow as well as nonflow contributions
in the $v_{2}$ measurement and in the three-particle correlator [3]. We investigate these contaminations in the ESE measurement, and also report measurement using the zero-degree calorimeter (ZDC) that largely supresses the nonflow contamination. We discuss the implications of our results and perspectives with the expected 10-fold increase in statistics from the RHIC runs in the years 2023 and 2025.

Poster Session,poster,Search for medium-induced jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity pp collisions with ALICE,"Kim, Dong Jo",University of Jyvaskyla (FI),FI,"Collisions of small systems show signatures suggestive of collective flow associated with QGP formation in heavy-ion collisions. Jet quenching is also a consequence of QGP formation, but no significant evidence of it in small systems has been found to date. Measuring or constraining the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems is essential to determine the limits of QGP formation. The ALICE collaboration presents a broad search for jet quenching in high multiplicity (HM) pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, based on several observables: the semi-inclusive acoplanarity distribution of jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\text{T}}$ hadron (h+jet); di-hadron correlations; and intra-jet measurements. Marked broadening of the h+jet acoplanarity distribution is observed in HM compared to minimum-bias (MB) events, which could arise from jet quenching. Both data and PYTHIA simulations suggest that this broadening arises from a generic bias of the HM selection towards multi-jet final states. In contrast, the di-hadron correlations between low-momentum particles exhibit azimuthal narrowing in HM relative to MB events, which are described by PYTHIA simulations and might arise from a similar HM bias. We also report the average charged-particle multiplicity and jet fragmentation functions in HM and MB-selected populations, whose differences are qualitatively described by PYTHIA. We discuss the implications of these results for the understanding of collective effects and jet quenching in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dong Jo', 'last_name': 'Kim', 'fullName': 'Kim, Dong Jo', 'id': '7912694', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyvaskyla (FI)', 'emailHash': 'e2b28c57bef49178dec87e5d78c08369', 'db_id': 7912694, 'person_id': 7541264}"

Collisions of deformed nuclear enhance the fluctuations of harmonic flow coefficients $v_n$ and event-wise mean transverse momentum $[p_T]$, therefore offering a viable approach to establish clear correspondences between the structure of colliding nuclei and the final state observables.

We present measurements of $v_n$, $[p_T]$ fluctuations as well as $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations from the STAR experiment. Significant differences are observed for [$p_T$] fluctuations and $v_n$-$[p_T]$ correlations between $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au and $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions, which can be quantitatively explained by the large prolate deformation of $^{238}$U with $\beta_{2, \mathrm{U}} \sim 0.28$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{U}} \sim 0$. Striking differences are also observed in isobar collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, where ratios of many observables show significant deviations from unity and exhibit rich patterns as a function of centrality. A comparison with hydrodynamic model simulations suggests a large quadrupole deformation in Ru nucleus with $\beta_{2, \mathrm{Ru}} \sim 0.16$ and a large octupole deformation in $^{96}$Zr nucleus with $\beta_{3, \mathrm{Zr}} \sim 0.2$. The non-monotonic dependence of ratios of multiplicity distribution, $v_2$, and $[p_T]$ fluctuations in the mid-central collisions also requires a difference in the surface diffuseness between $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr in the model
calculations. Combining all these observables, we can precisely constrain the parameters associated with various nuclear deformations in isobar nuclei.

Poster Session,poster,Hyperon Polarization in Isobar Collisions and Correlation of Global Polarization with Directed Flow from STAR,"Okubo, Kosuke",University of Tsukuba,Unknown,"The observation of hyperon polarization has revealed the existence of large vorticities in the medium created by heavy-ion collisions. Global polarization indicates vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to the system's orbital angular momentum, while local polarization indicates vorticities along the beam direction due to anisotropic transverse expansion of the medium. With the high-statistics data collected by the STAR experiment for isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, we present the measurements of global polarization for $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, and $\Xi^{\pm}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azimuthal angle relative to the event plane. These measurements allow us to study possible magnetic field driven effects through the polarization difference between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr, owing to a larger magnetic field expected in the former. 

Furthermore, the first measurements of $\Lambda$ hyperon local polarization along the beam direction relative to the second and third-order event planes in isobar collisions will be presented. Comparisons with previous measurements in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC will be performed to gain important insights into the collision system size and energy dependence of the vorticities in heavy-ion collisions. 

Previous measurements have shown a similar trend in the energy dependence between the global polarization and the slope of directed flow, suggesting a strong correlation between the initial tilt of the system and the vorticity [1]. For the first time, this correlation is investigated, and the dependence of the $\Lambda$ global polarization as well as directed flow on the first-order flow vector ($q_1$) is presented in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 19.6$ GeV.

Combining them allows to construct for the first time a complete, multi-differential picture of the emission pattern as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum.

The predictions of ideal hydrodynamic simulations, confirmed by transport model calculations, suggest a scaling between various flow coefficients. For protons at mid-rapidity the ratio $v_{4}/(v_{2})^{2}$ is found to be close to 0.5. The correlations of flow coefficients are investigated based on an event-by-event selection of the mid-rapidity final state elliptic flow of protons.

Based on the IP-Sat model this event-by-event generator computes the phase-space distributions, from where the relevant conserved charges can be computed as moments. In the present work we have included the leading order contributions to the light flavor parton densities.

Poster Session,poster,Multi-parton interactions in pp collisions using charged-particle flattenicity with ALICE,"Ortiz Velasquez, Antonio",Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX),Unknown,"Event classifiers based either on the charged-particle multiplicity or on event topologies, such as spherocity and Underlying Event, have been extensively used in proton-proton (pp) collisions by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. These event classifiers became very useful tools since the observation of fluid-like behavior in high multiplicity pp collisions, for example radial and anisotropic flow. Furthermore, the study as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity in the forward V0 ALICE detector allowed for the discovery of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions. However, one drawback of the multiplicity-based event classifiers is that, requiring a high charged-particle multiplicity, biases the sample towards hard processes like multijet final states. These biases blur the effects of multi-parton (MPI) interactions and make it difficult to pin down the origins of fluid-like effects.

This contribution explores the use of a new event classifier, the charged-particle flattenicity, defined in ALICE using the charged-particle multiplicity estimated  in 2.8 < η < 5.1 and −3.7 < η < −1.7 intervals. New final results on the production of pions, kaons, protons, and unidentified charged particles at midrapidity (|η| < 0.8) as a function of flattenicity in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV will be discussed. It will be shown how flattenicity can be used to select events more sensitive to MPI and less sensitive to final state hard processes. All the results are compared with predictions from QCD-inspired Monte Carlo event generators such as PYTHIA and EPOS.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions with ALICE,"Kumar, Deekshit",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"Quarkonium production in high-energy hadronic collisions is sensitive to both perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculations. Indeed, the production of the heavy-quark pair is described by perturbative QCD while the formation of the bound state is a non-perturbative process, treated in different ways by available theoretical models. Quarkonium polarization measurements provide also stringent tests of theoretical approaches, as this observable strongly depends on the quarkonium production mechanism at play. Another way to provide constraints on quarkonium production mechanisms is by looking at the production of J/$\psi$ inside jets. For instance, quarkonium production in a parton shower predicts that J/$\psi$ mesons are rarely produced in isolation, contrary to expectations from direct quarkonium production via parton-parton scattering. The measurement of quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions can also provide a reference for investigating the fate of charmonium in the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. ALICE can measure inclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$), at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\it{y}$|< 0.9). Prompt and non-prompt charmonium separation is performed at midrapidity down to low $p_{\rm{T}}$. In this contribution, we will report on recent quarkonium results in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, including Υ(nS) cross section measurements and Υ(1S) polarization at forward rapidity, as well as the prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production in jets at midrapidity.

Poster Session,poster,Using multi-particle correlations to estimate fluctuations in jet and rare probe azimuthal anisotropies,"Holtermann, Abraham",University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign,USA,"Rare probes such as jets and heavy flavor hadrons  provide unique opportunities to study the short-distance scale properties of the QGP created in heavy ion collisions. For example, recent measurements at the LHC and RHIC indicate that jet energy loss is correlated with the distance traveled through the QGP medium, and as a result, the initial geometry of the QGP. While estimates of differential azimuthal anisotropies, which we label $v^\prime_n$, have been experimentally measured for various rare probes, the fluctuations in $v^\prime_n$ have not been systematically studied. 

We present a statistical formalism for the study of $v^\prime_n$ and its correlations with the integrated azimuthal anisotropies (reference flow), $v_n$, by constructing correlators of azimuthal angles from multiple rare probe objects. We then construct multivariate cumulants and moments using these correlators, which can measure fluctuations to arbitrary order in $v'_n$. The experimental methods and procedures for computing these quantities are also discussed.

Precise determination of dense baryonic matter properties requires multi-differential measurements of strange hadron yields and their collective flow, both for the most copiously produced $K_s^0$ and Λ as well as for rare (multi-)strange hyperons and their antiparticles.

In CBM strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ are reconstructed by their weak decays  using a Kalman Filter algorithm. A machine learning model based on boosted decision trees (XGBoost) is used to make a non-linear multi-parameter selection according to the topology of the decay with high purity and high background rejection. For the rare $Ξ^-$ baryon a special selection using two consecutive XGBoost models is used. The yield of the strange hadrons is extracted multi-differentially using a multi-step fitting routine, where each $p_T$-$y$-interval has its separately trained machine learning model.

The CBM performance for multi-differential analysis of yields and collective flow of strange hadrons Λ, $K_s^0$ and $Ξ^-$ will be presented together with an estimation of systematic uncertainties. Also, statistical error projections for flow measurements with rarely produced strange hyperons at the high rate data taking expected at CBM will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Axel', 'last_name': 'Puntke', 'fullName': 'Puntke, Axel', 'id': '7884778', 'affiliation': 'WWU Münster', 'emailHash': '14a806b067692355762ecd2ad13ec296', 'db_id': 7884778, 'person_id': 7549624}"

Since the mean free path depends on multiplicity, the $v_{n}(\eta)$ reflects the dynamics of collectivity in p--Pb collisions.

Strangeness production has been suggested as a sensitive probe to the early dynamics of the deconfined matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Ratios of particle yields involving strange particles are often utilized to study various properties of the nuclear matter, such as the strangeness and baryon chemical potentials at the chemical freeze-out temperature ($\mu_S/T_{\mathrm{ch}}$ and $\mu_B/T_{\mathrm{ch}}$).

Measurements from the first phase of the BES program have indicated potential changes in the medium properties with decreasing collision energy. However, the precision of those measurements is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions. During BES phase-II (BES-II), STAR has accumulated high statistics data in Au+Au collisions at various energies, which can help reduce the uncertainties in the strange hadron measurements, in particular for the multi-strange hadrons. Benefiting from the iTPC upgrade, the strangeness measurements are now extended from mid-rapidity (|y|<0.5) to a larger rapidity range (|y|<1.0) as well.

Poster Session,poster,Applying the multiplicity-dependent Momentum Kick Model to the pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC,"Yoon, Jeongseok",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"The long-range ($|\Delta\eta| \gt 2$) near-side ($\Delta\phi\approx0$) ridge structure in a two-particle correlation analysis has been observed in heavy ion collision, which was well-explained by the hydrodynamic models based on the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) effect. However, even though small systems such as pp and pPb collisions cannot have enough density and temperature to create the QGP matter, the ridge phenomenon appeared in high multiplicity events of small systems, which is controversial in the hydrodynamic models. Among numerous models to explain this phenomenon in small systems, the Momentum Kick Model (MKM) can give a description of it via a kinematic process where the high-momentum jet particles transfer their momentum to the medium partons called a ``kick"" process, leading to collective motion which becomes the ridge phenomenon in the MKM. The MKM has been applied to various experimental data, such as the STAR and the PHENIX, and has shown good agreement. Furthermore, since the ridge yields are dependent on multiplicity in high-energy collision experiments, C. Y. Wong built a multiplicity dependence on the MKM through an impact parameter and applied it to the CMS data for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV.
Recently, the CMS Collaboration measured the ridge yields along the different $p_T$ and multiplicity ranges for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. To verify the MKM with multiplicity dependence, we expand the model analysis at 7 TeV to those at 13 TeV and provide the theoretical basis on two questions raised by the CMS Collaboration; the linearity of the ridge yield with multiplicity and the prominence at the middle $p_T$ range. Moreover, the CMS Collaboration suggested that the ridge structure does not have the collision energy dependence for pp collisions by comparing the ridge yields at 7 TeV with those at 13 TeV. From this surmise, we predict the future ridge behavior of the LHC Run3 at $\sqrt{s}=5.3$ and $8.5$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jeongseok', 'last_name': 'Yoon', 'fullName': 'Yoon, Jeongseok', 'id': '7884471', 'affiliation': 'Inha University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'b85c70a8ed4db40d78bb1f2c9c326d4b', 'db_id': 7884471, 'person_id': 7550173}"
Poster Session,poster,Effect of Nuclear Shape Parameters On Initial State Observables In Heavy Ion Collisions,"Dimri, Aman",Stony Brook University (US),USA,"In heavy ion collisions, the initial state geometry plays a crucial role in determining final state observables such as elliptic flow $v_2$ and radial flow reflected by event-wise average transverse momentum $[p_{\rm T}]$. The initial state geometry is influenced by several nuclear shape parameters, including quadrupole deformation (β), triaxiality (γ) [1], nuclear radius (r), and skin depth (a) [2]. It is known from low-energy physics that many atomic nuclei exhibit a quadrupole shape that fluctuates around an average profile. This talk investigates the impact of nuclear shape fluctuations on initial state geometry in heavy ion collisions, focusing on eccentricity ($\epsilon_2$) and inverse transverse size ($d_⊥$), which are linearly related to fluctuations of flow, i.e. $v_2 \propto \epsilon_2$ and $\delta [p_T]\propto \delta d_{\perp}$, and comparing them across different system sizes. Our aim is to quantify the effects of these parameters on initial state observables in a coherent manner. We show that overall quadrupole deformation fluctuations enhance the cumulants of $\epsilon_2$ and $d_⊥$, while triaxiality fluctuations reduce the differences between prolate and oblate nuclei. Our results suggest that, in the large fluctuation limit, the initial state observables' values approach those obtained in collisions of rigid triaxial nuclei.

The strangeness population factor, $S_{\rm A}=(^{A}_{\Lambda}\mathrm{H}/^{A}\mathrm{He})/(\Lambda/p)$ (A=3,4), is of particular interest as it directly relates to the ratio of light nuclei and hypernuclei coalescence parameters $B_{A}$.

Assuming a thermally equilibrated system, experimental particle yields at RHIC and the LHC serve as an anchor for the determination of common freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram -- namely, the baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$) and the chemical freeze-out temperature ($T_{\mathrm{ch}}$) -- via thermal fits in the SHM framework. Heavy flavor particle production is of particular interest in heavy ion phenomenology by virtue of the large difference between the mass of the bare heavy quarks and the calculated pseudocritical hadronization temperature. Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in the initial hard partonic scattering of heavy ion collisions. The produced charm and beauty quarks then interact with other constituents of the collision fireball and then potentially thermalize. These heavy quarks can then recombine with the surplus of deconfined light flavor quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma generated in a heavy ion collision; where the total number of constituent heavy quarks is assumed to stay constant until hadronization is reached. This thermal-like behavior of final state heavy flavor hadron yields allows for their production to be modeled in the context of the SHM using an additional fugacity parameter. In this contribution, we will show recent thermal fits to single charm hadrons measured in ALICE Pb+Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV and STAR Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV utilizing the same PDG2016+ hadronic spectrum as our previous work and a modified version of the most recent PDG2022 list.

Poster Session,poster,Event-by-event comparison of initial state models with momentum space information in a hybrid approach,"Götz, Niklas",Goethe University,Unknown,"The initial state of heavy-ion collisions has a short lifetime and cannot be directly measured. As a result, various initial condition models exist. Although averaged event observables with different initial condition models give comparable results, event by event analysis can help to identify systematic differences.  To determine the initial conditions is crucial to assess systematic uncertainties of Bayesian analysis, that aim at the extraction of transport coefficients from experimental data. The qualitative impact of the choice of initial conditions in hydrodynamical simulations is studied on an event-by-event basis in the hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE-Hybrid\textsuperscript{1}, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH\textsuperscript{2} and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE\textsuperscript{3,4}. Event-by-event correlations are studied for SMASH IC as well as for IP-Glasma and TRENTO, with and without early time out-of-equilibrium dynamics, for Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV in different centrality classes.
 We observe that the initial state eccentricities $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ are, depending on the setup and the model, not independent and show correlations which also result due to the assumed linear response of flow to eccentricity\textsuperscript{5} in correlations between the elliptic and triangular flow. Additionally, we also study initial momentum space information present in the SMASH and IP-Glasma initial condition models. We find that for very spherical events, the initial state momentum anisotropy significantly contributes to the final state momentum anisotropy, which means that the description of such events is especially sensitive to the choice of the initial state model.

More recently, the use of effective field theories (EFTs) and the formalism of open quantum systems (OQS) has allowed for great advances in first principles descriptions of in-medium heavy-heavy bound states. Using EFTs, one can systematically exploit the hierarchies of scale of the combined system to arrive at an effective description valid in a particular regime while the OQS formalism enables a quantum description of a system evolving coupled to and out of equilibrium with an environment. In this talk, we present recent results obtained by solving the Lindblad equation derived using the EFT potential nonrelativistic QCD and the OQS formalism describing the in-medium evolution and suppression of the Υ(1S), Υ(2S) and Υ(3S) states.

Poster Session,poster,Jet momentum broadening during initial stages in kinetic theory,"Lindenbauer, Florian",TU Wien,Unknown,"The jet quenching parameter $\hat q$ encodes jet medium interactions during the entire quark-gluon plasma evolution in heavy-ion collisions. For a long time, the impact of pre-equilibrium stages has not been properly treated in jet quenching calculations, although recent studies find large values for $\hat q$ in the earliest (glasma) stage. For the first time, we show that QCD kinetic theory smoothly connects these values to the later hydrodynamic ones, providing the missing link for a consistent $\hat q$ evolution. We find that its evolution during the bottom-up kinetic scenario shows little sensitivity to the initial conditions, jet energies and models of the transverse momentum cutoff. We also observe that, similarly to the glasma case, the jet quenching parameter is enhanced along the beam axis as compared to the transverse direction during most of the kinetic evolution.

A perturbative calculation up to the one-loop order indicates that the momentum broadening of jets is enhanced at both the high temperature and high chemical potential, and approximately proportional to the parton number density in the partonic phase. We further investigate the behavior of $\hat{q}$ in the vicinity of the critical endpoint (CEP) by coupling our calculation with a recently developed equation of state that includes a CEP in the universality class of the Ising model, from which we discover the partonic critical opalescence (PCO) -- a prominent enhancement of the momentum broadening of jets near CEP, contributed by the scatterings via the $\sigma$ exchange process.

Charmonia are bound states of charm and anti-charm quark pairs. Their production process can be factorized  into two stages: the heavy quark production and the formation of the bound state. The former happens within initial hard parton-parton scatterings with large momentum transfers, and can be well described by perturbative QCD. The second one, which involves long distances and soft momentum scales, is a typical non-perturbative process.  Measurements of J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) cross section in pp collisions are crucial for studying charmonium production mechanisms and testing different QCD-based model calculations. They can also provide a reference for investigating the quark-gluon plasma formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions and the cold nuclear matter effects present in proton-nucleus collisions.

In this poster, we will present the performance and the analysis status of inclusive J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S) production at midrapidity ($|y|<0.9$) in pp collisions at the center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV. The analysis is based on the data collected in 2022 by the upgraded ALICE detector during the Run 3 of LHC, which offers significantly higher statistics compared to previous runs. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential production of inclusive J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S), as well as the $\psi$(2S)-to-J/$\psi$ ratio, might be reported.

Poster Session,poster,The Tsallis-Thermometer as a QGP Indicator For Large And Small Collisional Systems,"Barnafoldi, Gergely",Wigner RCP,HU,"Recent experimental results present collectivity also in small systems with high-multiplicity. Today these phenomena are not completely understood: it is an important question whether the presence of the QGP is necessary for the observed collectivity or not. Moreover, the connection between the experimental observables and theories is not trivial. In our phenomenological study we introduce the ‘Tsallis-thermometer’ as an indicator of quark-gluon plasma, that aims to describe the smooth transition from small to large collisional systems.

The transverse momentum distribution of identified hadrons are analyzed within the thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-extensive statistics. A wide range of center-of-mass energies and average event multiplicities are studied for various hadron species. We demonstrate that the average event multiplicity is a key variable in the study of high-energy collisions. For this purpose the non-extensive statistical approach is more than appropriate.

Poster Session,poster,"Testing new proxies of B,Q and S cumulants in Au-Au collisions at BES energies with EPOS 4","Jahan, Johannès",University of Houston - Department of Physics,Unknown,"In the exploration of the nuclear matter phase diagram, the susceptibilities of conserved charges are useful theoretical tools to probe the existence of a $1^\text{st}$ order phase transition, and a possible critical endpoint. They can be related to the cumulants of the considered net-charges, for which STAR collaboration recently published experimental measurements of proxies, in Au-Au collisions at several energies of the Beam Energy Scan. Hence, the measured (co)variances of $\pi^\pm$, $p/\overline{p}$ and $K^\pm$ are used to build proxy ratios for the corresponding $2^\text{nd}$ order cumulant ratios of electric charge Q, baryonic number B and strangeness S.

It is nevertheless important to disentangle the different effects contributing to these net-multiplicity cumulants of hadronic species, in addition to the fluctuations which they are supposed to probe. For this reason, we studied the impact of hadronic cascades on these observables, thanks to complete simulations of Au-Au collisions performed with EPOS 4. The results are compared with cumulant ratios of exact conserved charges, and proposed enhanced proxy ratios based on a study of the hadronic breakdown contributions to the total susceptibilities with lQCD and HRG model calculations.

We show that the use of $\Lambda$ baryons variance, additionally to $\sigma^2_\pi$, $\sigma^2_p$ and $\sigma^2_K$ used by STAR, allow to build proxies that reconstruct quantitatively better the ratios of $B,Q$ and $S$ correlations. Moreover, even if hadronic cascades modify the signal amplitude for all (co)variances, they have little impact on most of their ratios.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Johannès', 'last_name': 'Jahan', 'fullName': 'Jahan, Johannès', 'id': '7884777', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston - Department of Physics', 'emailHash': 'a0f093159fa6622d641c96fad27b2c2a', 'db_id': 7884777, 'person_id': 7516786}"
Poster Session,poster,Alignment from spin-1 hydrodynamics,"Wagner, David",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"The spin alignment of vector mesons emitted in heavy-ion collisions has recently been measured by the ALICE and STAR collaborations over a wide range of energies  [1, 2]. The alignment is part of the so-called tensor polarization, which is a property that is exclusive to particles of spin 1 and higher. Even though there have been substantial theoretical efforts, a definite explanation for the tensions between theory and experiments does not yet exist.

In this work [3], we derive an expression for the tensor polarization of a system of massive spin-1 particles in a hydrodynamic framework. Starting from quantum kinetic theory based on the Wigner-function formalism, we employ a modified method of moments which also takes into account all spin degrees of freedom. We find that the tensor polarization is independent of the nonlocal part of the collision term and sourced by the usual dissipative quantities of the fluid, i.e., the bulk-viscous pressure, the particle-diffusion current, and the shear-stress tensor. As an example, we compute the relevant transport coefficient in the case of an uncharged fluid, where, neglecting bulk effects, the tensor polarization is determined solely by the shear-stress tensor. In order to quantify this polarization effect, we provide a formula which can be used for numerical calculations of vector-meson spin alignment in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

The Energy-Energy correlator (EEC) is a jet substructure observable used to study the time evolution of the parton shower. This observable re-contextualizes jet substructure study by using the distribution of angular distance of all combinations of two final state particles within a jet weighted by the product of the fractions of jet energy carried by each constituent. With this definition, the perturbative and non-perturbative QCD effects can be separated without the need for re-clustering or rejection of soft constituents. The EEC distribution cleanly reveals the separation between these two regimes: i) from the free hadrons phase at small opening angles, and ii) from the perturbative fragmentation of quarks and gluons at large opening angles. 

In this poster, the first measurement of the corrected EEC distribution at RHIC is presented using $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV collected by the STAR experiment. The EEC is shown differentially in jet transverse momentum and compared to predictions from the Monte-Carlo event generator PYTHIA-8 and next-to-leading-logarithmic pQCD calculation. Furthermore, this work will serve as the baseline for future measurements of the EEC in heavy-ion systems which will provide information about how the quark-gluon plasma interacts with jets across different angular and time scales.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Tamis', 'fullName': 'Tamis, Andrew', 'id': '7824377', 'affiliation': 'Yale University', 'emailHash': '27fa002287f5e6232f6233cee66cab87', 'db_id': 7824377, 'person_id': 7538629}"
Poster Session,poster,New Insights to the Weak Interaction and Quark Model,"Zhang, Dr. Tianxi",Unknown,Unknown,"A quark is a subatomic particle, composed of the mass, electric charge, and color charge, the three fundamental elements found in the nature. Among these three fundamental elements, there are four fundamental interactions, which are the gravitational force between masses, the electromagnetic force between electric charges, the strong force between color charges, and the weak force between electric and color charges. Inside a quark, the weak force or interaction between electric and color charges influences and excites the quark, which relaxes and transits from one state to another by emitting a quark-antiquark pair, in analogy to the emission of a photon by an excited electron in an atom. A quark and an antiquark with either the same or different flavors and states combine to form a meson when they couple together via mainly the strong interaction, a charged lepton when they annihilate their color charges and combine their electric charges and masses, a neutrino when they annihilate both their color and electric charges and combine their masses, and a photon or gamma ray when they entirely annihilate all their mass, electric, and color charges. The decay of a particle (e.g. the beta decay of a neutron) with formation of leptons involves one or more quark-antiquark pair emissions and annihilations. This multi-pair quark and antiquark emission and annihilation process establishes a fine structure of the Feynman diagram for the quark decay with lepton formation and indicates the formed leptons as products rather than participants of the weak interaction. This study attempts to fully explain and describe how various possible particles (far more than the discovered so far) are formed, generated, decayed, and interacted via quark excitations, degenerations, pair productions and annihilations. We aim at advancing and developing the standard model of particle physics and quantum chromodynamics in terms of innovatively theorizing the weak interaction as an interaction between electric and color charges and creatively modelling quarks with two flavors and multiple excitations.

Our approach predicts a local spin correlation that is distinct from the non-local expressions previously obtained in phenomenological derivations. We estimate the magnitude of such local correlations in the glasma model of the preequilibrium phase of relativistic heavy ion collisions.

In the crossover region, we find large fluctuations associated with the critical point in coordinate space, but in the absence of collective flow and expansion, they are essentially washed out when momentum cuts are imposed instead.

In the mixed phase region, the behavior depends on whether the system is in a metastable nucleation or cavitation region, or in the spinodal decomposition region, and can be interpreted in terms of simplified analytic models. For the case of nucleation, we find that fluctuations are qualitatively described by a non-interacting cluster model.

Therefore, they are excellent probes of the QGP properties.Production of quarkonia depends on the dissociation and regeneration processes in the QGP, and also on the cold nuclear matter effect. To disentangle these effects and infer QGP properties, it is important to carry out differential precision measurements for various quarkonium states at different collision energies and system sizes. The STAR experiment offers opportunity to study the energy and colliding system size dependence of heavy-flavor production through large statistics samples of isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}{\rm Ru}+^{96}_{44} \rm Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}+^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}$) at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, as well as Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6, 27 GeV and 54 GeV collected in the phase II of Beam Energy Scan program.

In this talk, the first measurements of $\psi(2\rm{S})$ and $J/\psi$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, performed in isobaric collisions, will be presented. Centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the ratio of $\psi(2\rm{S})$ yield over that of $J/\psi$ will be shown. These results together with measurements of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states yield suppression allow a comprehensive study of binding energy dependent modifications to the quarkonium production in the medium. $J/\psi$ polarization measurement provides a new angle for studying QGP properties and the $J/\psi$ production mechanism. New measurments of inclusive $J\psi$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6 and 27 GeV will be also presented. Furthermore, measurements of central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factors (R$_{\rm CP}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of HFE in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 54.4GeV will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yan', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Yan', 'id': '7974506', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China', 'emailHash': 'a69b6cb33c5526a20285f20436bb1033', 'db_id': 7974506, 'person_id': 7535811}"
Initial State,parallel,Exploring electromagnetic field effects and constraining transport parameters of QGP using STAR BES II data,"DASH, ADITYA PRASAD",University of California Los Angeles,USA,"Constraining the initial strong electromagnetic field effects, three-dimensional structure of the initial state, and the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at different temperatures ($T$), and baryon chemical potentials ($\mu_B$) are critical objectives of the heavy-ion program at RHIC. The dominance of Faraday+Coulomb effect during the initial stages of non-central heavy ion collisions is predicted to result in a negative $\Delta v_1$, defined by the difference in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) between positively and negatively charged particles. With the large dataset accumulated in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) phase II of STAR, we probe the beam energy dependence of $\Delta v_{1}$  for charged pions, kaons, and protons as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum ($p_T$), and centrality at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 - 7.7 GeV. Our results support the notion of stronger $\Delta v_{1}$ at lower collision energies, expected due to the longer lifetime of the electromagnetic field and shorter lifetime of the fireball and a stronger effect with increasing $p_T$.

The flow angular decorrelations ($r_n(\eta)$) are sensitive to the 3D initial state,  and new observables such as the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$ and flow-magnitude and flow angular correlations are sensitive to the  %the viscous attenuation in the final state  transport parameters of the evolution. We present new measurements of the beam energy dependence of higher-order flow-angular de-correlations $r_n(\eta)(n=2,3)$, the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$, higher-order flow-angular correlation $\langle\cos(a_{1}n_{1}\Psi_{n1}+\cdots+a_{k}n_{k}\Psi_{nk})\rangle$ and higher-order flow-magnitude correlations $SC(n,m)\{4\}$ and $SC(n,m)\{6\}$ for various event-shape and centrality selections of Au+Au collisions in different BES energies ( $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 - 11.5 GeV) at RHIC. We observe a non-monotonic behavior in the longitudinal width of $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$ with the collision energy, which is expected to be proportional to $\eta/s$ according to the ansatz proposed by S. Gavin et. al.~[1]. Through these measurements we aim to gain insights into the role of electromagnetic fields and transport parameters of the QGP by disentangling the initial and final state effects.

Jets,parallel,Measurements of the jet axis decorrelation and the groomed jet radius with photon-jet events in PbPb and pp collisions at the CMS experiment,"Taylor, Molly",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Previous analyses have shown a narrowing effect in the inclusive jet substructure. While this narrowing effect could be a result of jet quenching, it could also be caused due to a selection bias by which very quenched and broader jets are filtered out from the considered jet transverse momentum window. Photon-tagged jets, which correspond to a quark-enriched sample, can significantly reduce this potential selection bias and the effect coming from the change in the quark versus gluon fraction. They also allow for a selection on the degree of quenching. In this presentation, we show new photon-tagged jet results using proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV recorded with the CMS detector in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We present the decorrelation of jet axes calculated with energy-weighted and winner-take-all recombination schemes and compare the results between photon-tagged jets and inclusive jets. We also explore the modification of the groomed jet radius and angularity in PbPb collisions relative to pp collisions for jets that have lost up to 60\% of their initial energy in the medium. The findings of these studies will contribute to a better understanding of the quark-gluon plasma and its properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Molly', 'last_name': 'Taylor', 'fullName': 'Taylor, Molly', 'id': '7862971', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '565554c608a0e24c3d70b08534bf52c7', 'db_id': 7862971, 'person_id': 7690217}"
Chirality,parallel,Search for the Chiral Magnetic and Vortical Effects Using Event Shape Variables in Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"XU, ZHIWAN",Los Alamos National Laboratory,Unknown,"Effects from quark chirality in heavy-ion collisions probe the topological sector of Quantum Chromodynamics, where parity and charge-parity symmetries are violated locally in strong interactions.  However, the experimental observables for the chiral magnetic/vortical effect (CME/CVE) are dominated by elliptic flow and nonflow backgrounds.  Recent STAR isobar data revealed a substantial background in the CME observable that prevented an unambiguous observation of the difference between two isobars. The Au+Au system has significant advantages over the isobar collisions, such as the larger magnetic fields and the lower statistical fluctuations.

We improve the analysis method with event shape variables (ESV), and apply it to  Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV in the search of the CME and CVE. After categorizing events based on ESV and extrapolating the CME/CVE observable towards zero flow limit, we report the $\Delta \gamma$ measurements using $h$-$h$  and $\Lambda$-$p$ correlations. To fully assess the possible CME signal, we employ a broad spectrum of observables and analysis techniques: with and without the particle pair information in constructing ESVs, utilizing invariant mass for differential studies, exploiting STAR Event Plane Detector and Zero-Degree Calorimeter to minimize nonflow backgrounds.

Small Systems,parallel,Measurement of the sensitivity of two-particle correlations in pp collisions to the presence of hard scatterings,"Mohapatra, Soumya",Columbia University (US),USA,"A key open question in the study of multi-particle production in high-energy $pp$ collisions is the relationship between the ""ridge"" - observed azimuthal correlations between particles in the underlying event that extend over all rapidities and hard or semi-hard scattering processes. In particular, it is not known whether jets or their soft fragments are correlated with particles in the underlying event. This talk presents measurements of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with two different particle-pair selections. In the first case, charged particles associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. This shows that excluding charged particles associated with jets does not affect the measured correlations.

Poster Session,poster,b-jet tagging at sPHENIX,"Kvapil, Jakub",Los Alamos National Laboratory (US),USA,"Beauty quarks are produced in hard-parton scatterings in the early stages of the partonic collisions. They are the ideal probe to investigate the properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions as they experience the whole QGP evolution. Due to their large mass, their production can be calculated using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD), thus they can be used to test pQCD based models. Moreover, measurements in p+p collisions provide the necessary reference for the interpretation of heavy-ion collision results. Experimentally, tagging a jet by its flavor content gives direct access to the initial parton kinematics and can provide information on how the energy is dissipated in the QGP medium. The possible studies include the flavor and mass dependence of jet quenching, the collisional energy loss, the dead-cone effect, and the modification of the fragmentation and jet structure in the medium.

The expected spatial resolution is <6μm and the track vertex distance of closest approach (DCA) <30 $\mu$m for p$_T$>1 GeV/c. In addition, a full azimuthal coverage of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters provides an excellent tool to study jet physics.

Correlation femtoscopy technique is a useful tool to study systems undergoing QCD phase transitions, and can extract valuable information about the size, shape, and lifetime of the particle-emitting source in heavy-ion collisions. 

This study presents the first comprehensive femtoscopic analysis of identical kaons and pions produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6 - 200 GeV from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan phases I and II, focusing on charge, transverse momentum, and centrality-dependent properties. The charge-dependent analysis reveals differences at the level of correlation functions for both kaons and pions for the first time at these energies. This observation is consistent with Coulomb field effect due to residual charge after the collision and hadronic final state effects, as implemented in UrQMD. The three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis reveals that the extracted radii, assuming Gaussian distribution for emission source, increase with collision energy, decrease with transverse mass, and are generally larger for kaons compared to pions under the same conditions. The study compares experimental data with different model scenarios and discusses the implications of the trend of the extracted size and lifetime of the particle source with the change of collision energy.

An analysis of one-dimensional two-pion and two-kaon correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, utilizing Levy-stable distributions for the source shapes, is also presented. The current analysis status of the extracted Levy source parameters, including their dependence on average transverse mass and centrality, is reported.

Poster Session,poster,Observation of a mesoscopic fluid of 10 strongly-interacting fermions,"Giacalone, Giuliano",Universität Heidelberg,Unknown,"Collective flow is observed in high-energy proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions where particle multiplicities are small and a quark-gluon plasma description is hard to justify. Here, we address the origin of such observations from a new angle, by performing an experimental investigation of the emergence of hydrodynamics in two-dimensional ultra-cold Fermi gases with with controllable interactions and in the regime of small particle numbers. We study the inversion of the aspect ratio (akin to elliptic flow) in the expansion of samples of atoms initially prepared in elliptical traps. To overcome the finiteness of the samples, a statistical measure of the elliptic anisotropy is devised in full analogy with the methods employed in the analysis of high-energy collisions.

With ten or more fermions, we observe the emergence of elliptic flow due to inter-particle interactions, which justifies a hydrodynamic interpretation. We show that ideal hydrodynamic predictions using the equation of state of 2D Fermi gases in the many-body limit underestimate the measured elliptic anisotropy. Hence, we witness the breakdown of ideal hydrodynamics due to quantum corrections beyond standard dissipative ones but rather induced by the mesoscopic nature of our samples. We discuss how hydrodynamic equations could be generalized to account for these effects, and give an outlook on further possibilities with our experimental setup to advance our understanding of collective phenomena in few-particle systems.

Poster Session,poster,Understanding Ridge behavior via kinematics between jets and medium,"Cho, Soyeon",Inha University (KR),Unknown,"The Ridge behavior in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions has been discussed a lot since it was first reported. However, small systems like proton-proton collisions are not enough to generate a medium called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in which the Ridge behavior is explained with high-order flows. In this work, we suggest the pure kinematic mechanism between jets and medium partons as tools for understanding the Ridge behavior; during jets passing through the medium, the momentum transferred from jets to medium partons makes the medium partons aligned along the direction of jets’ motion. It produces a collective motion of the medium, which is in charge of the Ridge behavior in small system collisions.

We adopt Parton Distribution from the hard scattering model (PDh) as a distribution function for initial medium partons’ momentum. The PDh is parameterized by a fallout parameter, $a$, a non-extensive parameter, $q$, and the temperature of the system, $T$; $a$ decides the shape of rapidity distribution and $q$ affects rapidity and transverse momentum distribution. And $T$ is related to scales of rapidity and transverse momentum distributions. We choose values of these free parameters by comparing PYTHIA8-string shoving simulation for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \rm{TeV}$ with high-multiplicity.

We set the initial conditions that jet particles with $10 \rm{GeV}$ lose their energy by $1 \rm{GeV}$ while interacting with medium partons through bremsstrahlung. Then, we calculate the cross-section with various outgoing angles of jet particles using PDh and derive the two-particle angular correlation from this. We find out that the Ridge like behaviors appear when the outgoing jets’ angle gets smaller. To integrate over the scattering angles, we calculate the cross-sections for several angles within the jet radius of 0.4 and sum them over with the weights, which are from the experimental data. We calculate the correlation and find that Ridge like behaviors exist in pp collision, compared to the experimental data. We also find $v_{2}$ within 0.025 ~ 0.045, consistent with the experimental result.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Soyeon', 'last_name': 'Cho', 'fullName': 'Cho, Soyeon', 'id': '7824408', 'affiliation': 'Inha University (KR)', 'emailHash': '1315410b1559ee8cf6c6051fdb9935a3', 'db_id': 7824408, 'person_id': 7552144}"

The ALICE Collaboration has performed measurements of the K$^+$--d and p--d correlations analyzing high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The correlation functions are compared with effective two-body calculations anchored to results from K$^+$--d and p--d scattering experiments that provide an excellent description of the measured $\mathrm{K}^+$–d correlation but fail to describe the p--d system. This discrepancy can only be resolved by performing a full three-body calculation that accounts for the underlying three-nucleon dynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Exploring the equilibration time of the QGP with jet quenching,"Adhya, Souvik Priyam","Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences",UK,"Heavy-ion collisions produce a quark-gluon plasma that undergoes rapid expansion and cooling, which presents a challenge for calculating jet quenching observables. Current approaches rely on analytical results for static cases, introducing theoretical uncertainties and biases in our understanding of the pre-equilibrated medium. To address this issue, we employ analytical re-summation schemes to incorporate multiple scattering in a class of expanding backgrounds. By introducing a new length scale related to the equilibration time of the QGP, we investigate the range of validity of Bethe-Heitler emissions, LPM interference effects, and higher-twist contributions to the emitted gluon spectrum. We also discuss methods to mitigate the non-local nature of the emission spectrum. Our analysis shows that strong jet quenching is only possible when the equilibration time of the medium is longer than its mean free path, highlighting the importance of medium modifications of jets in the earliest stages of heavy-ion collisions. By accounting for the expansion of the medium, our approach reduces the uncertainties in model predictions for jet quenching observables, providing insights into the nature of the pre-equilibrated medium. This work lays the foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of the QGP and the interplay between jets and the expanding medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Souvik Priyam', 'last_name': 'Adhya', 'fullName': 'Adhya, Souvik Priyam', 'id': '7884495', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences', 'emailHash': 'a86e39803ec40cde5db72fcfdd1981b2', 'db_id': 7884495, 'person_id': 7552427}"

Starting from the investigation on the difference in their internal structures, or different wave functions of charmonium states we calculate the yield and transverse momentum distributions of charmonium states produced in heavy ion collisions. We show that the wave function distribution plays a significant role, especially, in the production of charmonium states, leading to the transverse momentum distribution of the ψ(2S) meson as large as that of the J/ψ meson. We also discuss the anisotropic flow, or elliptic and triangular flow of charmonium states using the transverse momentum distribution of charmonium states. We find that the internal structure differences as well as feed-down contributions of charmonium states are averaged out for elliptic and triangular flow, resulting in similar elliptic and triangular flow for all charmonium states.

In this contribution, measurements of the non-prompt ${\rm J/\psi}$ fraction as a function of charged-particle pseudorapidity density (${\rm d}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}\eta$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with ALICE are reported. ${\rm J/\psi}$ mesons are reconstructed at midrapidity ($|\textit{y}|<0.9$) in the dielectron decay channel.

The multiplicity reach is seven times larger than the average charged particle multiplicity of inelastic collisions, thanks to the usage of high-multiplicity triggered events. The measurement of the fraction of non-prompt ${\rm J/\psi}$ is performed via unbinned maximum likelihood fit down to $p_{\rm T} = 1\ {\rm GeV}/c$.

The $\omega$ mesons can be reconstructed in ALICE via their primary decay channel into three pions ($\omega\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$). While the two charged pions are being directly identified with the tracking detectors, i.e. the Time Projection Chamber and the Inner Tracking System, the $\pi^0$ is reconstructed from its two decay photons.

In Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, it has been observed that the $J/\psi$ yield is strongly suppressed and its elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) is consistent with zero, indicating $J/\psi$'s strong coupling with the medium and its potentially small regeneration contribution. Besides those measurements, the $J/\psi$ polarization can shed new light on the QGP properties and the $J/\psi$ production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. For example, it has been hypothesized that $J/\psi$ can be polarized due to the spin-orbit coupling between $J/\psi$ and QGP's large angular momentum in non-central heavy-ion collisions. The early production of $J/\psi$ also makes its polarization potentially sensitive to the strong magnetic field at the early stage.

Hydrodynamic theories are such macroscopic descriptions in long-wavelength, low-frequency limits of many quantum field theories. On the phenomenological side, hydrodynamics not only serves as a successful macroscopic description of the Quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions (HICs) but also serves as the energy deposition bin of hard probes such as jets and heavy quarks. It is important to understand to what extent the propagation of the deposited energy can be described within hydrodynamics. We investigate the universality and validity of hydrodynamic theory by studying the propagation of energy-momentum perturbations in kinetic theories from microscopic to macroscopic scales. By comparing results for different microscopic theories, we find a remarkable degree of universality, where the evolution of energy-momentum perturbations of the QGP is rather well described by a pair of sound and nonhydrodynamic modes.

In this work [1], we first examine these analytical methods for isotropic as well as anisotropic two-body scatterings. We confirm that the Chapman-Enskog method is the most accurate while correcting the typos in an earlier work on this subject. 

We then apply the Chapman-Enskog method to study the shear viscosity of the parton matter in the center cell of central and midcentral Au+Au collisions at 200AGeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76ATeV from a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model. At the parton scattering cross section of 3 mb that enables the transport model to reproduce bulk observables including the elliptic flow, the average eta/s of the parton matter is found to be very small, between one to three times 1/(4pi). In addition, as a result of using a constant Debye mass or cross section for parton scatterings, the eta/s ratio from the AMPT model increases with time (as the effective temperature decreases), contrary to the pQCD results that use temperature-dependent Debye masses. This can be a direction for future model improvements.

Poster Session,poster,Momentum transport coefficients with chiral dependent quark masses in thermal QCD medium,"Panday, Pushpa",Unknown,Unknown,"We have studied the momentum transport coefficients, viz. shear and 
bulk viscosity, in a weakly magnetized ($eB << T^2$) deconfined thermal 
QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential ($\mu$). The magnetic 
field generates anisotropy in the medium, causing the previously 
isotropic scalar transport coefficients to become anisotropic and separate into several components. Depending upon the direction of the magnetic field and current, we can have three possible components, namely, longitudinal, transverse, and Hall. We have obtained five shear ($\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3$ and $\eta_4$) and two bulk viscous components ($\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$) using relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under relaxation time approximation. Interaction among partons is incorporated through the quasiparticle mass of quarks and gluons (T, $\mu$, B dependent), calculated using oneloop perturbative thermal QCD.
It is observed that the magnetic field acts differently on left (L) and 
right (R)-handed chiral modes of quark. This leads to the lifting of degeneracy in mass of those modes, in contrast to the strong magnetic field case ($eB >> T^2$), where these modes are degenerate. The magnetic field dependence of L and R modes of $\eta_0$, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_3$ is opposite in nature, viz. the L mode magnitude decreases whereas the R mode magnitude increases, with the magnetic field. This is in contrast to $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$, for which, both the L and R mode magnitudes
increase with the magnetic field. The bulk viscous coefficients, $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ increase with magnetic field for both L and R mode. Also, these shear and bulk viscosities get amplified with quark chemical potential for both modes. Shear viscosity to entropy density ratios are found to be greater than $1/(4\pi)$ for $\eta_0, \eta_1$ and $\eta_3$, but less than $1/(4\pi)$ for $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$. The ratio of bulk viscosity to entropy density for $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ exhibits a non-monotonic behaviour with temperature, showing minima or maxima around $T\sim$ 200 MeV. Furthermore, the Reynolds number for L mode is found to be greater than 
that for R mode due to a difference in mass densities.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pushpa', 'last_name': 'Panday', 'fullName': 'Panday, Pushpa', 'id': '7884487', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'd43b9cb231e5da8bd35d6ed067a5bac7', 'db_id': 7884487, 'person_id': 7540517}"

Poster Session,poster,The direct photon puzzle and the weak magnetic photon emission,"Sun, Jing-an",Fudan University,Unknown,"In heavy ion collisions, the measured spectrum of direct photons at RHIC and the LHC has been found as azimuthally anisotropic as pions. In particular, a large elliptic flow of the direct photos has been observed, which strongly contradicts conventional theoretical predictions, leading to the well-known “direct photon puzzle”. 

In this talk, instead of a strong magnetic field assumption which has been considered previously, we propose the effect of weak magnetic photon emission, originated from the interplay of a weak external magnetic field and the longitudinal dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. The weak magnetic photon emission results in an extra source of photon production from the quark-gluon plasma, with a large elliptic flow. In cases of Bjorken flow and more realistic 3+1D hydrodynamical evolution simulated via MUSIC, the effects of weak magnetic photon emission are justified. Given this novel effect, under realistic conditions with respect to heavy-ion collisions carried out at RHIC and the LHC, especially that a weak magnetic field satisfying $|eB|\ll m_\pi^2$, the experimentally measured direct photon elliptic flow can be well reproduced. 

Accordingly, we found that the direct photon elliptic flow can be used as a magnetometer for the expanding QGP. For the top energy of RHIC collisions, through event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations with respect to Trento 3D initial conditions, the averaged magnetic field strength can be extracted to be a few percent of the pion mass square. Moreover, a significant increase in $v_3$ of direct photons is observed as well from the weak magnetic photon emission.

Diffusion wake accompanying this Mach-cone provides a unique probe of the properties of quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by $\gamma$-triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. Using a two-Gaussian fit, we extract the diffusion wake and MPI contributions to the double peak. The diffusion wake valley is found to increase with the azimuthal angle away from the jet.

Poster Session,poster,Hyperon reconstruction method with machine learning in Pb-Pb collisions at ALICE,"Tokumoto, Ryoka",Hiroshima University (JP),Unknown,"Reconstructing hyperons with high purity and high reconstruction efficiency is essential for measurements of hyperon-hyperon correlation and searches for exotic strange hadrons, which are both presently discussed topics in the QCD community. Hyperons can be abundantly produced in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC. However, achieving high purity of reconstructed hyperons with high efficiency is particularly challenging in high charged-particle multiplicity environments.
  The conventional reconstruction method of ALICE rejects many hyperon candidates by using topological cuts. To improve the detector performance, we studied the reconstruction of all hyperon candidates based on their decay vertex using the Kalman Filter (KF) technique. Furthermore, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) algorithm is applied to the LHC Run 2 Pb-Pb collision data based on the training by the combinatorial background and Monte Carlo simulation. By inputting many parameters for decay vertex reconstruction, we can make finer adjustments than would be possible by simply applying topological cuts manually. Therefore, BDT may help optimize cuts to better separate signal and background. This poster will report the current status of the reconstruction of Λ, Ξ, and Ω with the KF approach, discussing its performance and prospects for the future. These developments are important for the high-luminosity Pb-Pb data-taking campaign foreseen at the end of 2023.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ryoka', 'last_name': 'Tokumoto', 'fullName': 'Tokumoto, Ryoka', 'id': '7824294', 'affiliation': 'Hiroshima University (JP)', 'emailHash': 'd77c9450ca35ed0080db89d876fc3f5d', 'db_id': 7824294, 'person_id': 7541929}"

The modification of the high-virtuality parton shower in the QGP compared to that in proton-proton collisions offers insight into the nature of the medium's interactions with colored probes. To study the path-length dependence of hard partons traveling through the QGP, we apply a technique known as event-shape engineering to data from heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200\ \mathrm{GeV}$ at STAR. Within a given eccentricity and centrality class, charged hadrons traveling in the event plane direction (having shorter path length) are compared to those traveling perpendicular to it (having longer path length).

Measurements of the elliptic flow and nuclear modification factor of charmed mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide ample evidence of strong interactions between charm quarks and the QGP. However, a complete understanding of the nature of the charm-medium interaction is yet to be achieved. Thus, new observables are needed to constrain theoretical models and the charm quark diffusion coefficient in the QGP.

Measurements of azimuthal and femtoscopic correlations involving charmed mesons can provide such new insights. Azimuthal correlations of charmed mesons can help to pin down the relative role of radiative and collisional energy losses for charm quarks. On the other hand, femtoscopic correlations, i.e., two-particle correlations at the low relative momentum, are sensitive to the final-state interactions and the extent of the region from which correlated particles are emitted. Therefore,  a study of femtoscopic correlations between charmed mesons and identified charged hadrons could shed light on their interactions in the hadronic phase and the interaction of charm quarks with the bulk partons.

We will present the azimuthal correlations of $\mathrm{D^0-{\bar{D}} ^{0}}$  pairs and femtoscopic correlations of charmed mesons with identified hadrons measured by the STAR experiment at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200}$ GeV using high-statistics data collected in 2014 and 2016.

The latest has important applications, especially in cosmic antinuclei studies for indirect dark matter searches.

Chiral symmetry restoration can manifest itself in two different ways: a pole-mass shift or a broadening of the spectral function.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of jet $v_{2}$ in medium-sized systems at STAR,"Protzman, Tristan",Lehigh University,Unknown,"Hard partonic scatterings, occurring at the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, produce jets, which experience the full evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).  As they traverse through the QGP, jets lose energy through collisional and radiative processes, collectively known as the jet quenching.  In semi-central heavy-ion events, the QGP takes an approximately elliptical shape in the transverse plane whose mean in-plane and out-of-plane distances differ.  This fact can be used to vary the average path length for jets traversing the QGP, and those traveling in-plane should experience less quenching effects than those traveling out-of-plane.  This differential quenching manifests as a suppression of jet yield out-of-plane relative to in-plane, quantified by jet $v_2$, the second order Fourier coefficient.  In this poster, jet $v_2$ will be presented from Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr, and O+O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=200\hbox{ GeV}$ with multiple jet resolution parameters.

Jet showering processes, with and without the quenching effect, are simulated with the JEWEL model, and are embedded with thermal backgrounds. Sequential substructure variables are extracted from the jet clustering history following an angular-ordered sequence, and are used in the training of a neural network built on top of a long short-term memory network.

Poster Session,poster,Adiabatic hydrodynamization in the bottom-up thermalization scenario,"Scheihing Hitschfeld, Bruno Sebastian",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"We demonstrate that the early stages of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [1] are well described by the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework, thus providing novel analytic results on the thermalization process of QCD in a heavy ion collision. These results provide an intuitive explanation of why a gas of quarks and gluons can relax so quickly towards equilibrium, and provide a starting point for a systematic exploration of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in QCD. All of the qualitative features exhibited in QCD effective kinetic theory (EKT) simulations at weak coupling [2] are captured by the emergence of an effective low-energy instantaneous ground state for the 1-particle gluon distribution function, which defines the early-time kinetic theory attractor. This ground state may be pulled back to arbitrarily early times, where it represents a free-streaming solution, and at later times it integrally describes the BMSS fixed point, including the recently observed deviations from the original predictions for the scaling exponents [2].

To find this instantaneous ground state it is necessary to elucidate the deep connections between scaling and adiabaticity in expanding gluon plasmas [3]. We first solve the Boltzmann equation for gluons in the small-angle scattering approximation numerically and find that it features time-dependent scaling, reproducing the QCD EKT scaling of hard gluons [2]. By studying this equation analytically, we find that an appropriate momentum rescaling allows the scaling distribution to be identified as the instantaneous ground state of the operator describing the evolution of the distribution function, and the approach to the scaling function is described by the decay of the excited states. That is to say, the system evolves adiabatically, and the instantaneous ground state describes the early-time kinetic theory attractor. We obtain this ground state analytically. Corrections to the BMSS fixed point exponents agree quantitatively with those found previously in QCD EKT.

Recently, proton cumulants from central Au+Au $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV collisions were reported, which implies that hadronic interactions are dominant at 3 GeV and the QCD critical point could exist at the collision energies higher than 3 GeV. The baryon-strangeness correlation is expected to deviate from the QGP expectation for the hadronic gas at high baryon-chemical potential region, which can be used to confirm the turning-off signal of the QGP.  Previously, the STAR measurement of baryon-strangeness correlation using (anti)protons and $\rm K^{\pm}$ shows no strong signal compared with theoretical prediction. So it is suggested to include hyperons in the measurement to study QCD phase transition.

Poster Session,poster,Empirical Characteristics of Light and Heavy Flavor Parton Energy Loss Dynamics at the LHC and RHIC,"MARSHALL, THOMAS",UCLA,Unknown,"Nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles provide valuable information about the flavor dependent magnitude and characteristics of parton energy loss in $A+A$ collisions. Experimental measurements of $R_{AA}$ exhibit a distinct different dependence on transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Previous analyses of RHIC data treated the difference in the $p_{T}$ spectrum between $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions as a leading parton $p_{T}$ loss and empirically concluded that the flat $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ corresponds to a constant fractional $p_{T}$ loss ($\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}$) [1]. This feature of $\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $p_{T}$ can be understood via elastic collisions in classical dynamics. We analyze LHC measurements of the strong $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for light and heavy flavor leading particles. Our analyses indicate that LHC data for a variety of leading particle species are consistent with $\Delta p_{T}$ proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$, in contrast to proportional to $p_{T}$ at RHIC. In addition, Charm hadrons exhibit differing behavior compared to the other species studied, revealing possible unique heavy flavor dynamics. These distinct features are consistent with the scenario of increased contributions from radiative energy loss at LHC energies compared with stronger collisional energy loss dominance at RHIC energies. Moreover, linear trends between fractional energy loss and initial parton density at varying $p_{T}$ magnitudes indicate that the amount of parton energy loss does not depend strongly on the traversing geometrical path length of the parton during collision evolutions, which is in agreement with previous empirical findings at RHIC despite significant different initial parton densities formed at LHC and RHIC. We will also discuss further implications of the observed proportionality in LHC data and differences in fractional energy loss at varying $p_{T}$ scales.

Following this line of thought, we assume each non-dependent collective motion modulates the probability of particle emission with a single-harmonic Fourier expansion, and then express the final-state particle azimuthal distribution as the product of these expansions, 
$\frac{2\pi}{N^\pm}\frac{dN^\pm}{d\varphi} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1+2\tilde{a}_n^\pm\sin n\Delta \varphi) \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1+ 2\tilde{v}_n^\pm\cos n\Delta \varphi)$, instead of a long linear Fourier series. Here, $\Delta\varphi$ is the particle azimuthal angle with respect to the reaction plane. This scheme may better capture the genuine strength of each collectivity mode ($\tilde{a_n}$ and $\tilde{v_n}$), and results in non-leading cross terms between collectivity modes, with significant impacts on experimental observables.  We explore the possibility that the chiral magnetic effect (CME) [1] and elliptic flow can evolve separately, thereby their convolution affecting not only the observable that is sensitive to the CME, but also that to the shear-induced CME [2]. We employ the event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics model to showcase the implications of this scenario on searches for the CME. In addition, we also propose practical experimental tests using conventional flow harmonics and exploit a multiphase transport model to demonstrate the emergence of non-leading cross terms, such as the rapidity-odd component of triangular flow. The universality of the assumption regarding factorized actions can be investigated by analyzing real data collected from RHIC and the LHC, which will enhance our understanding of the collective motions.

Such an excess of net baryon number at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions manifests effective mechanisms of baryon number transport over a large rapidity gap. Gluon junction has been proposed as a possible structure allowing for baryon number transport over large rapidity gaps. We also argue that the net $\Omega^{-}$ production on the proton-going side of $p$+Au collisions may provide a sensitive probe of the gluon junction mechanism. We will present AMPT model simulations of $\Omega$-$K$, $\Omega$-$\Xi$, and $\Omega$-$\Lambda$ correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.6 GeV and 7.7 GeV as well as $p$+Au collisions at 62 GeV. These correlations reflect the effects of strangeness conservation and baryon number transport in nuclear collisions. In particular, the $\Omega$-hadron correlations in AMPT show distinct dependence on baryon densities indicating quantitative sensitivity to details of the baryon number transport dynamics. Results from the default and string-melting versions of the AMPT calculations are used to examine the imprints on such correlations left by the hadronization schemes of string fragmentation and quark coalescence, respectively. AMPT calculations predict very significant differences in the correlations at 7.7 GeV between these hadronization schemes, which can be used experimentally to investigate the extent of roles played by partonic degrees of freedom in Au+Au collisions at this energy.

These jets lose energy and have their shower structures modified relative to that in the vacuum due to jet-medium interaction — known as `jet quenching'.

The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) fraction of the jet carried by hadrons along the jet axis ($z = \vec{p}_{\rm T, hadron}\textbf{.}\hat{p}_{\rm T, jet}/|\vec{p}_{\rm T, jet}|$) is related to the jet fragmentation function, and connects the production of quarks and gluons in the perturbative regime with the hadronized final-state particles in the non-perturbative regime. In the QGP medium, modifications to the fragmentation function compared to that in a vacuum can provide insights into the underlying mechanism of jet quenching. A study of the fragmentation function for charm meson tagged jets can reveal further details about the flavor dependence of the medium-induced parton energy loss.

In this poster, we report measurements of $\rm D^{0}$ meson tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$, collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC. We show the nuclear modification factors as a function of $p_{\rm T, jet}$ and $z$ for $\rm D^{0}$ jets. Additionally, we report the radial profile of the $\rm D^{0}$ mesons in these tagged jets.

The coefficients associated with the charge and heat transport, such as the electrical conductivity, Hall conductivity, thermal conductivity and Hall-type thermal conductivity are determined using the nonextensive Tsallis framework within the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory. The Tsallis distribution function encodes the effect of the nonextensivity, where the deviation of parameter $q$ from unity signifies the extent of the nonextensivity. The matter produced in heavy ion collisions may not be exactly in the locally equilibrated state, and for understanding the properties of such matter to a greater degree, the nonextensive Tsallis framework is a relevant approach to follow. Our observation shows that the electrical and thermal conductivities as well as their Hall components increase with the nonextensivity and this implies an increased deviation of both charge and heat transports from their counterparts at $q=1$. It is observed that the deviations of the abovementioned transport coefficients from their respective equilibrated values get further increased at finite magnetic field, whereas these deviations become decreased at finite chemical potential.

In this model, if the nucleons at kinetic freezeout are close in phase space and match their spin state they can bind and form a nucleus. More advanced coalescence model uses the Wigner formalism for the bound state.

With $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV $pp$ collision data recorded by the STAR experiment, we reconstruct full jets to measure CollinearDrop$-$SoftDrop jet correlation and the charge correlation ratio ($r_c$) with hadrons in jets, which probe the dynamics of the parton shower and hadronization, respectively.

The interplay between different stages of the parton shower can be explored with the correlation between SoftDrop and CollinearDrop groomed jet observables, the latter of which have an enhanced sensitivity to the soft radiation within jets. We present the first measurements of CollinearDrop jet mass and its correlation with SoftDrop groomed jet observables, such as the opening angle $R_{\mathrm{g}}$ and the shared momentum fraction $z_{\mathrm{g}}$. They are fully corrected for detector effects with a novel machine learning method, MultiFold, which preserves the correlations in the multi-dimensional observable phase space.

Precision measurements sensitive to the hadronization process are crucial for testing phenomenological models and furthering our understanding of non-perturbative QCD.

We will show the yields and central-to-peripheral nuclear modification factors as functions of $p_{\rm{T}}$ and centrality.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Veronika', 'last_name': 'Prozorova', 'fullName': 'Prozorova, Veronika', 'id': '7824481', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'emailHash': '85a12640f31de917271059f954336d35', 'db_id': 7824481, 'person_id': 7535820}"
Poster Session,poster,QCD mesonic screening masses using Gribov quantization,"N/A, SUMIT",IIT Roorkee,Unknown,"Chiral symmetry is lost at low temperatures, and pions are massless in the chiral limit;  there is no longer any screening mass. The screening mass of mesons approaches the standard value of $2 \pi T$ at high temperatures. The screening masses of mesons provide a gauge invariant and definite order parameter of chiral symmetry restoration. Different mesonic correlation lengths for flavor non-singlets, at least up to NLO, are well-defined gauge invariant physical quantities calculated earlier using the perturbative resummation techniques. It was found that these NLO corrections are small and come with a positive sign. The lattice simulation results match the existing perturbative results only in the high-temperature regime. There needs to be more clarity between the lattice results and the theoretical calculations at low temperatures, as the perturbative expansion fails at low temperatures. One of the ways to probe the low-temperature region is by using the non-perturbative Gribov resummation. We have studied the spatial correlation lengths $\zeta$ of various mesonic observables using the Gribov action in quenched QCD and for $(2+1)$ flavor QCD. In particular, we have calculated the non-perturbative NLO correction to the meson screening mass using the Gribov propagator. This correction has been calculated by following the analogies with the NRQCD effective theory, a well-known theory for studying heavy quarkonia at zero temperature.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'SUMIT', 'last_name': 'N/A', 'fullName': 'N/A, SUMIT', 'id': '7884476', 'affiliation': 'IIT Roorkee', 'emailHash': 'fdc59d58954242514c4bc8df8a0b7c69', 'db_id': 7884476, 'person_id': 7536040}"

Recent measurements of the baryon-to-meson (${\Lambda^+_{\rm{c}}/\rm{D}^0}$, ${{\Sigma^{0,++}_{\rm{c}}}/\rm{D}^0}$, ${\Xi^{0,+}_{\rm{c}}/\rm{D}^0}$ and ${\rm{BR\times\Omega^0_c/{D}^0}}$) ${p_{\rm{T}}}$-differential yield ratios in pp collisions are inconsistent with corresponding measurements in $\rm{e^+e^-}$ collision, indicating that the hadronisation of charm quarks is not a universal process among different collision systems. From measurements of the ${p_{\rm{T}}}$-differential ${\rm{\Lambda^+_c/D^0}}$ yield ratio as a function of the event multiplicity in pp collisions, the modificaion of the hadronisation mechanism is found to be multiplicity dependent. The measurement of the multiplicity dependence of the ${\rm{\Xi^0_c/\rm{D}^0}}$ yield ratio can provide further constraints on the study of charm hadronisation.

Small Systems,parallel,Insights on strange quark hadronization measuring (multi)strange hadron production in small collision systems with ALICE,"Pucillo, Sara",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Among the most iconic results of Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC is the observation of enhanced production of (multi-)strange to non-strange particles, gradually rising from low-multiplicity to high-multiplicity pp or p-Pb collisions and reaching values close to those measured in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. More insightful information about the production mechanism could be provided by measuring the full Probability Density Function (PDF) for the production of each strange particle specie and investigating if any deviation from pure uncorrelated statistical behavior is observed. Using this novel method, we can determine whether strangeness enhancement is connected to the high-multiplicity tail of the PDF or to a progressive increase in the number of events with few strange particles produced. In this contribution, we present new results on the full PDF for the production of $K^{0}_{\rm S}$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Omega$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 5.02 TeV as a function of the multiplicity as well as single and pair production of the $\phi$ meson in pp collisions at 13 TeV.

Small Systems,parallel,Multiplicity Dependence of Strange Hadron Production in Small Systems using the STAR detector,"Aggarwal, Ishu",Unknown,Unknown,"Strangeness enhancement has long been considered a signature of the quark-gluon plasma formation in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, strangeness enhancement has also been observed in small systems at the LHC, but the underlying physics is not yet fully understood. This motivates studies of strange hadron production in small systems at RHIC, where the energy density of system is expected to be smaller than that at the LHC and therefore a hot and deconfined medium is less likely to be created. Investigating the multiplicity dependence of strange hadron production in small systems can naturally connect to peripheral heavy-ion collisions, and contribute to understanding the role of event multiplicity in strange hadron production. Furthermore, such studies will serve as a baseline for similar measurements in central heavy-ion collisions.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Temperature and Strong Magnetic Field Effects in Dense Matter,"Dexheimer, Veronica",Kent State Universtity,Unknown,"We study consistently the effects of magnetic field on hot and dense matter. In particular, we look for differences that arise due to assumptions that reproduce the conditions produced in particle collisions or astrophysical scenarios, such as in the core of fully evolved neutron stars. We assume the magnetic field to be either constant or follow a profile extracted from general relativity calculations of magnetars and make use of two realistic models that can consistently describe chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement to quark matter, the CMF and the PNJL models. We find that net isospin, strangeness, and weak chemical equilibrium with leptons can considerably change the effects of temperature and magnetic fields on particle content and deconfinement in dense matter. This could be important for detecting quark matter e.g. in neutron star mergers.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Microscopic encoding of macroscopic universality: How do the universal behaviors near the QCD transition arise from quarks and gluons?,"Petreczky, Peter",BNL,USA,"The core goal of heavy-ion collision experiments is to shed light on how the phases and properties of strong-interaction matter arise from the fundamental constituents and interactions of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  To this end, heavy-ion collision experiments are searching for universal signs of criticality in the QCD phase diagram by measuring various macroscopic quantities. When those signatures of criticality are observed the ultimate scientific question will still remain unanswered— how do these universal behaviors at the macroscale arise from the microscopic degrees of freedom, quarks and gluons? In this talk we will answer this question. 
 
Macroscopic properties of the strong interaction near its chiral phase transition exhibit scaling behaviors, which are the same as those observed close to the magnetic transition in a 3-dimensional classical spin system with $O(4)$ symmetry. We show the universal scaling properties of the chiral phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We first establish a connection between the cumulants of the chiral order parameter, i.e. the chiral condensate, and the correlations among the energy levels of quarks in the background of gluons, i.e. the eigenspectra of the massless QCD Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to generalizations of the Banks–Casher relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations with varying light quark masses near the QCD chiral transition, we demonstrate the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses. Our study reveals how the hidden scaling features at the microscale give rise to the macroscopic universal properties of QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peter', 'last_name': 'Petreczky', 'fullName': 'Petreczky, Peter', 'id': '7819071', 'affiliation': 'BNL', 'emailHash': '9e86ae285689f7141a31c6ea60f4bdfd', 'db_id': 7819071, 'person_id': 7410258}"

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Two-particle femtoscopy at the HADES experiment,"Grunwald, Mateusz",Warsaw Universty of Technology,Unknown,"Over the past decades, the properties of dense matter have been widely concerned in connection with hypernuclei and hyperons. Their existence inside neutron stars softens the Equation of State (EoS), consequently limiting their masses to be lower than two solar masses (known as the ""hyperon puzzle""). The limited number of experimental references in the region of high baryon chemical potential poses significant challenges for constructing an EoS. The matter under conditions similar to neutron star cores can be obtained with low-energy heavy-ion collisions. The strong interactions for hyperons and clusters can be studied with two-body systems, for example, nucleon-hyperon (e.g., $p-\Lambda$) or nucleon-cluster (e.g., $p-d$, $p-t$, or $p-{}^{3}He$) as their interaction is not fully understood. Studies of two-particle correlations with clusters enable one to search for ground state of  ${}^{4}Li$, or the excited state of ${}^{4}He$. Created hadrons and clusters carry information available after thermal freeze-out. Therefore, photons with a relatively long mean free path and being emitted through the whole system's evolution are considered for studying earlier collision stages. 

Femtoscopy is a technique of measuring two-particle correlations in momentum space, proven to be a powerful tool for determining parameters of interactions and lifetimes in heavy-ion physics. It allows for the investigation of collision-generated system's spacetime features, having a lifespan of $10^{-23}$ seconds and a lifetime of femtometers ($10^{-15}$ m). One can study the two-body interactions, geometry, and dynamics by conducting such measurements experimentally.

The analysis uses the HADES detector at GSI/FAIR (Germany). Using detectors included in the spectrometer (among others, electromagnetic calorimeters, capable of detecting neutral particles) combined with specially created software, a dedicated framework, and reconstruction algorithm, one can identify $\gamma$ particles, $\Lambda$ hyperons, and clusters.

Our framework, the 2PI effective action, is non-perturbative and derived directly from the underlying quantum-field theory.

New Theory,parallel,Charge-dependent anisotropic flow in relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic expansion,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"We have investigated the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, using relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD). For the description of time evolution of the ultraintense electromagnetic fields produced just after the collisions, construction of the relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD) is indispensable 
We construct a relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) numerical simulation code for high-energy heavy-ion collisions as a first designed code in the Milne coordinates. Then we confirm that our code reproduces well the results of standard RRMHD tests in the Cartesian coordinates. Also, we verify the semi-analytic solutions of the accelerating longitudinal expansion of relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in a comparison with our numerical result.
Next, we apply our RRMHD code to analysis of the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We consider the optical Glauber model as an initial model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the solution of the Maxwell equations with source term of the charged particles in two colliding nuclei as initial electromagnetic fields. The RRMHD simulation is performed with these initial conditions in Au-Au and Cu-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV. We have calculated the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow $\Delta v_1$ and elliptic flow $\Delta v_2$ in both collisions based on electric charge distributions as a consequence of RRMHD. Our results show that the directed and elliptic flows are approximately proportional to the electrical conductivity of the medium in both collisions. In the highly resistive case, our results of the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow are consistent with STAR data in Au-Au collisions. Furthermore, in Cu-Au collisions, the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow has a non-zero value at η = 0 which is also proportional to electrical conductivity of the medium. We conclude that the charge-dependent anisotropic flow is a good probe to extract the electrical conductivity of the QGP medium in high-energy heavy-ion experiments.

We use Boltzmann's H-function to formulate 'maximum-entropy hydrodynamics', a far-off-equilibrium macroscopic theory that can describe both free-streaming and near-equilibrium regimes of quark-gluon plasma in a single framework. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic theories but conceptually similar to anisotropic hydrodynamics which it generalizes and with which we compare, this formulation incorporates contributions to all orders in shear and bulk inverse Reynolds numbers, allowing it to handle large dissipative fluxes that characterize the early evolution stage in heavy-ion collisions.

New Theory,parallel,Studying exotic hadrons in high energy nuclear collisions,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University,Unknown,"For heavy ion collisions in the TeV beam energy region, the large number of initial hard scatterings create a richly ""doped"" hot quark-gluon plasma containing many charm quarks/anti-quarks, thus providing a uniquely ""charming"" environment for the massive production of heavy flavor exotic hadrons such as the $\chi_{c1}$ (also known as X(3872)), X(6900) and Tcc states. While such exotic states have been studied for decades in hadron physics, many questions about their basic properties and intrinsic structures (e.g. large hadron molecules versus compact tetraquarks) are not understood. High energy nuclear collisions show promise as a new test ground that has the potential to help resolve some of these challenges, with fresh experimental data from LHCb and CMS indicating nontrivial partonic medium effects on their production. As an example to demonstrate such opportunity, we report recent calculations of the yield of $\chi_{c1}$ state based on two popular models of its possible configurations: a loose hadronic molecule or a compact tetraquark. It turns out that the two different structures have rather different sensitivity to the fireball volume in heavy ion collisions. By scanning centrality and thus systematically tuning the fireball volume, our dynamical simulations have indeed found about 2-order-of-magnitude difference in the $\chi_{c1}$ yield and a markedly different centrality dependence between hadronic molecules and compact tetraquarks. This offers a novel approach for using fireball size as a “yardstick”  to calibrate the size of exotic hadrons and thus distinguishing the two scenarios. Lastly, the talk will discuss the ongoing progress in the recently formed ExoHad Topical Collaboration to integrate hadronic physics inputs with medium environment and examine exotic hadron properties both in quark-gluon phase and in hot hadron gas, which would be crucial for a successful program of studying their production in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jinfeng', 'last_name': 'Liao', 'fullName': 'Liao, Jinfeng', 'id': '7819120', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '83f6cd04fabc597b1565a1290a8015ab', 'db_id': 7819120, 'person_id': 7540278}"

Thanks to its wide acceptance, ATLAS can measure several probes that can help characterize these effects over a wide kinematic range. By analyzing the centrality dependence of dijet production, it is possible to investigate the suppression of dijet events in central events compared to peripheral ones and correlate it to the kinematic of the parton-parton scattering, accessible thanks to the measurement of both jets in the final state. In 2016, the ATLAS experiment collected 165 nb$^{-1}$ of proton-lead collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV per nucleon pair. In this talk, we will present a new measurement of the centrality dependence of dijet production obtained using this dataset. We will also present the first measurement of the inclusive cross-section for top-quark pair production in dilepton and lepton+jet decay modes.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Quarkonium transport in weakly and strongly coupled plasmas,"Scheihing Hitschfeld, Bruno Sebastian",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Suppression of open heavy flavors and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions is among the most informative probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Only in the past few years, systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP have been carried out in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size.

Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known [1] heavy quark diffusion coefficient. In this talk, we will describe its calculation at weak coupling in QCD up to next-to-leading order [2] and at strong coupling in N=4 Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. While it resembles the open heavy quark case, it has some crucial differences that highlight the relevance of quantum color correlations. Crucial insights are obtained by studying them in temporal axial gauge, where these correlators would naively be equal [4]. Furthermore, we will discuss the necessary setup to evaluate the quarkonium transport coefficients from lattice QCD, which, at present, is the only tool we have to study QCD in the non-perturbative regime. Finally, we will discuss the phenomenological implications that can be extracted from this correlator, with emphasis on the implications of the novel N=4 SYM results at strong coupling.

The pertinent T-matrix results can semi-quantitatively describe the lQCD data for Wilson line correlators but refinements of the input parameters are necessary to improve the agreement, providing new insights.

The variety of binding energies within the charmonium and bottomonium families offers an experimental tool to characterize the phenomena at play. Moreover, measuring the excited states is crucial as they represent significant feed-down contributions to the production of the ground states in proton-proton collisions and must be accounted for in the interpretation of proton-nucleus data. We report studies of the relative suppression of quarkonia in pPb collisions performed in CMS.

Heavy-flavour jets provide a unique experimental tool to probe these flavour dependencies, particularly at low and intermediate transverse momenta where mass effects are significant. The ALICE detector has excellent particle tracking and PID performance to tag jets with reconstructed heavy-flavour hadrons. These capabilities are essential for jet substructure studies as they remove significant contamination from heavy-flavour hadron decay products and allows us to trace the quark flavour through the splitting tree. We report a series of heavy-flavour jet substructure measurements tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. These include first measurements of the jet axes differences between different recombination and grooming schemes and the jet angularities where the angular exponent can tune the sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects. Additionally, the groomed momentum fraction and opening angle of the first splitting are reported, which link to fundamental ingredients of the splitting functions. Comparisons with flavour-untagged jets probe flavour dependencies from the charm quark mass and the high purity quark nature of the $\rm{D}^{0}$-tagged jet sample.

However, a simultaneous modeling of $v_{n}$ and $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is still challenging.

Compared to the prompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ results, the nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ $v_{2}$ flow coefficients are systematically lower and show less dependence on particle $p_\mathrm{T}$ and centrality. An indication of nonzero $v_{3}$ coefficient of the nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ is observed. The wide $p_\mathrm{T}$ range enables the study of various flow generation mechanisms, like diffusion at low $p_\mathrm{T}$ and path-dependent parton energy loss at low and high $p_\mathrm{T}$, respectively.

We also present results at zero chemical potential for the isothermal speed of sound and isothermal compressibility. We show that in the vicinity of the crossover temperature, the speed of sound at fixed $s/n_B$ has a well localized minimum or ""soft point"" at large $s/n_B$, which  appears to vanish as $s/n_B$ decreases. We show that this is consistent with hadron resonance gas model calculations at low temperature and reflects the increasing importance of the baryon sector at low temperature. A similar behavior is found for the isothermal speed of sound, which decreases monotonically at low temperature for all $s/n_B$. Furthermore, we show that in the entire range of $s/n_B$ relevant for the beam energy scan at RHIC, the specific heat, compressibility, and thermal expansion coefficient show no indication for an approach to critical behavior that one would expect close to a possibly existing critical endpoint.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'David', 'last_name': 'Clarke', 'fullName': 'Clarke, David', 'id': '7818815', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '3e6e1fd7aec5118ed4739fd668386b95', 'db_id': 7818815, 'person_id': 7541748}"

An alternative model is the baryon junction: a Y-shaped configuration of nonperturbative gluons that is connected to all three valence quarks and carries the baryon number.  Neither of these theories has been experimentally verified.  Because valence quarks carry the baryon's electric charge, we can test if they also carry the baryon number by comparing baryon stopping to charge stopping. This is done to high precision using the STAR isobar dataset of ${}^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru} + {}^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$ and ${}^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr} + {}^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\rm{GeV}$.  Results show that at mid-rapidity the ratio of the net-baryon yield, $B$, to the difference in net-charge yield, $\Delta Q = Q(\rm{Ru}) - \textit{Q}(\rm{Zr})$, is roughly twice as large in central collisions  as would be expected if the valence quarks carry the baryon number.  Another observable that is sensitive to the carrier of the baryon number is the net-proton yield in semi-inclusive photonuclear collisions, a type of ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision where one nucleus emits a quasi-real photon interacting with the other colliding nucleus.   We observe significant baryon stopping at low transverse momentum in photonuclear processes using $\rm{Au}+\rm{Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4~\rm{GeV}$.

Even an isotropic thermal medium can exhibit nontrivial anisotropies in the angular distributions of the produced lepton pairs. While the total yield and observable spectra are proportional to the sum of the longitudinal and transverse components of the spectral function, the polarization depends on their difference. As the processes that drive the medium effects in the spectral function change with invariant mass and momentum, this becomes a powerful tool to study the composition and degrees of freedom of the hot and dense medium.

In this contribution, we utilize a coarse-grained hadronic transport approach to model the space-time evolution of the fireball. We calculate the polarization observables of thermal virtual photons as a function of mass and momentum and compare the results to existing measurements from HADES and NA60. Finally, we discuss the prospects of using an excitation function of virtual photon polarization to disentangle the contributions to the thermal dilepton radiation of hadronic and partonic origin.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Seck', 'fullName': 'Seck, Florian', 'id': '7818827', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'cb1e8c854b5cdde704e4cb9bb2637839', 'db_id': 7818827, 'person_id': 7561272}"

I will first present a simplified model of heavy-ion collisions in which a well-defined temperature profile of the plasma can be related to the inverse slope of the photon spectrum, providing a connection between the spectrum's inverse slope $T_{eff}$, the QGP's size and *maximum* temperature, as well as the range of $p_T$ used to determine $T_{eff}$ from the photon spectrum.

EM Probes,parallel,Fate of the $\rho$ - $a_1$ mixing in dilepton production,"Sakai, Azumi",Sophia University,Unknown,"In-medium modifications of vector spectral functions are anticipated to carry imprints of restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature/baryon density. Strong modifications have been indeed measured via dimuon production at the CERN SPS, whereas it remains inconclusive how to quantify those changes as the direct consequence of chiral symmetry restoration. Given the difficulty that it is elusive to construct the axial-vector spectrum in heavy-ion experiments, the key phenomenon is that the vector meson mixes with the axial-vector meson in a medium via pion loops, known as chiral mixing. The chiral mixing effect can be quantified as a model-independent theorem at low temperature [1], whereas at the critical temperature the chiral symmetry restoration compels the vanishing chiral-mixing [2]. On-going experiments and recent development of hydrodynamic model bring us a unique opportunity to get insight into chiral symmetry restoration from investigation of the dilepton invariant mass spectra.
In this work, a case study is carried out by utilizing the following 3 scenarios: (A) chiral restoration absent, (B) chiral restoration present and (C) false chiral restoration. The scenario-B describes the in-medium spectral function of the rho meson from zero to the chiral crossover temperature [2]. The scenario-C is often argued to generate an increase of the dilepton yield, which is incorrect since the procedure does not capture the change of QCD ground state.
We combine the in-medium spectral function in the chiral effective field theory with state-of-the-art fluid dynamical simulations with temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities [3]. We find an increase of the yield at 1.2-1.4 GeV due to the degenerate $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons, whereas the scenario of false restoration leads to a substantial overestimate at 1.2 GeV and this also causes an underestimate below and above the $\rho$ peak.

Critical Point,parallel,Exploring the Critical Points in QCD with Multi-Point Pade and Machine Learning Techniques in (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Goswami, Jishnu",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Our ability to predict thermodynamic observables and determine the QCD critical point at real values of chemical potentials is severely limited by the infamous sign problem. To address this issue, there are two common approaches: expanding the QCD partition function in a Taylor series with respect to the charge chemical potentials ($\mu_{B,Q,S}$) or analytically continuing from imaginary chemical potentials. However, both methods have limitations, particularly for larger values of the baryon chemical potential. Recently, we proposed a multi-point Pade approach[1] based on a (2+1)-flavor Lattice QCD simulation that uses multiple imaginary chemical potentials with temporal extents of $N_{\tau}=4,6,8$. This method combines the benefits of the aforementioned approaches and is expected to provide more reliable quantitative predictions for small to intermediate values of the baryon chemical potential. Another, advantage we can use this method to estimate different critical points of QCD by examining the singularities of the Pade series.

In this presentation, we will focus on two critical points, well known Roberge-Weiss critical point, which arises when the baryon chemical potential is purely imaginary, and the QCD critical point, which will emerge at a real value of the baryon chemical potential. We use the multi-point Pade approach to locate the Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, which are obtained from lattice QCD simulated data. Our results demonstrate that the scaling of these singularities corresponds to the expected scaling of the well-known Roberge-Weiss transition. The universal scaling of singularities in the vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint is also investigated. Lee-Yang edge singularities associated with the QCD critical point at the real chemical potential for various temperatures are calculated. As the temperature decreases, the imaginary part of the singularities becomes smaller, hinting at a possible existence of a critical point at low temperatures. A machine learning technique is used to model the probability density of the singularities and interpolate the real and imaginary parts of the singularities between different temperatures. By employing a suitable scaling ansatz, the singularities are extrapolated towards the real axis, and the possible location of the QCD critical point is estimated. Preliminary results of ($T_{CEP},\mu_B^{CEP}$) are consistent with model predictions and other lattice QCD calculations.

The unique capability of RHIC to provide both longitudinally and transversely polarized hadronic collisions at various energies opened new avenues in studying the internal structure of the proton with unprecedented depth and precision. Significant progress has been made in the last few years through various measurements at STAR.

The longitudinal spin measurements have contributed significantly to our understanding of the quark and gluon helicity distributions inside the proton. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, from STAR inclusive jet and dijet measurements, provides the first evidence of a positive gluon polarization with partonic momentum fraction $x > 0.05$. The reconstruction of $W^{\pm}/Z$ in longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions indicates that there is a flavor separation of the light sea quark helicity distributions. In transversely polarized proton collisions, $W^{\pm}/Z$-bosons provide the first constraint on the sea-quark Sivers function and contributes to the tests of the predicted sign change. The tilt of the dijet opening angle provides a direct access to the first Mellin momentum of the Sivers function and avoids the spin-correlated fragmentation contributions. The novel measurements of the azimuthal distributions of identified hadrons in jets and spin-dependent dihadron correlations directly probe the collinear quark transversity in the proton, with the former coupled to the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) Collins fragmentation function and the latter to the dihadron interference fragmentation function. These measurements shed lights on Sivers function, quark transversity and spin-dependent fragmentation functions in both collinear and TMD formalism. When combined with data from the future EIC, they will establish the validity and limits of factorization and universality, thus enabling a deeper understanding of fundamental QCD.

In search of this, the QCD effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore

the theory also for phenomenology we introduce ALPACA [2], a Lorentz invariant parton 
cascade which is a representation of the AMY effective kinetic theory in the form of 
a Monte Carlo event generator. It solves the Boltzmann equation with the full AMY
kernels (elastic scattering and splitting/merging processes) by explicitly simu-
lating the evolution of parton ensembles corresponding to single events. It is
constructed in a fully Lorentz invariant way by using a method pioneered in [3],
which also underlies the parton cascade PCPC [4]. A complication arises from
quantities like the screening mass, that enter the AMY kernels and are defined
as integrals over the phase space densities. We develop a method for extracting
these locally from the parton ensemble without the need for further informa-
tion. We perform an extensive validation of the framework in thermal equilibrium

For charged constituents within a reconstructed jet of cone radius 0.8, two-particle correlations as functions of relative azimuthal angle ($\Delta\phi*$) and pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta*$) are performed in a novel ``jet frame'', where constituent kinematics are re-defined relative to the jet direction being the $z$ axis. The correlation functions are studied in classes of in-jet charged multiplicity up to nearly 100 for different ranges of transverse momentum in the jet frame. Anisotropy Fourier harmonics are extracted from long-range azimuthal correlation functions for $\left|\Delta\eta*\right|>2$. The long-range elliptic anisotropy harmonic in data is compared to Monte Carlo event generators without including any long-range collective effects such as PYTHIA8 and Sherpa.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Parker', 'last_name': 'Gardner', 'fullName': 'Gardner, Parker', 'id': '7977356', 'affiliation': 'Rice University (US)', 'emailHash': '8aaa8f4658e7ba0e6c8cc7b6678b3e15', 'db_id': 7977356, 'person_id': 7690227}"
Small Systems,parallel,Hot spots in a proton,"Lappi, Tuomas",University of Jyvaskyla,Unknown,"We explore consequences of the existence of gluonic hot spots inside the proton for the initial eccentricities in a proton-nucleus collision [1], and the constraints on the parameters describing these hot spots from coherent and incoherent exclusive vector meson production cross sections in deep inelastic scattering [2].

The eccentricities are calculated by calculating correlation functions of the energy density field of the glasma immediately after the collision event at proper time t=0+. We separately consider the effects of color charge and geometrical hot spot fluctuations, analytically performing the averages over both in a dilute-dense limit. We show that geometric fluctuations of hot spots inside the proton are the dominant source of eccentricity whereas color charge fluctuations only give a negligible correction. The size and number of hot spots are the most important parameters characterizing the eccentricities.

By employing a nonrelativistic vector meson wave function and working in the dilute limit of the Color Glass Condensate framework we are able to analytically calculate cross sections for vector meson production in our hot spot model. We find that the coherent cross section is sensitive to both the size of the target and the structure of the probe. The incoherent cross section is dominated by color fluctuations at small transverse momentum transfer (t), by proton and hot spot sizes as well as the structure of the probe at medium t and again by color fluctuations at large t. While the t-dependence of the cross section is well reproduced in our model, the relative normalization between the coherent and the incoherent cross sections points to the need for additional fluctuations in the proton.

Small Systems,parallel,Measurement of charged and full jet production and nuclear modification factor in pp and p−Pb collisions with ALICE,"Schmier, Austin",University of Tennessee (US),USA,"The study of jet production in small collision systems is essential for testing our understanding of perturbative and non perturbative QCD and cold nuclear matter effects. In addition, studies at high multiplicity in small collision systems exhibit signatures of collectivity, which is still not fully understood within a unified picture across system size. Jet quenching in small systems is not observed within current measurement precision, calling for more precise jet measurements.

This talk presents new results of charged and full jet production in pp and p--Pb collisions, and the corresponding nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$, $8$, and 13~TeV. These results are expected to be the most precise measurements of the $R_{\rm pPb}$ by ALICE to date. To investigate whether jet energy is redistributed in cold nuclear matter, the cross-section ratios for different jet resolution parameters ($R$) are compared between pp and p--Pb collisions, as well as within each collision system. Finally, comparisons between data and model predictions are discussed. This result extends to lower jet transverse momentum than previously measured at the LHC, constraining hard parton production and fragmentation mechanisms applied in model calculations, and the impact of the nuclear-modified parton distribution function on jet production. This measurement also provides new constraints on jet quenching in small collision systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Austin', 'last_name': 'Schmier', 'fullName': 'Schmier, Austin', 'id': '7977323', 'affiliation': 'University of Tennessee (US)', 'emailHash': '606c61039f18c9421599601bcc68fc07', 'db_id': 7977323, 'person_id': 7580472}"

The charged-particle multiplicity is one of the most interesting observables in these kind of studies. On the one hand, the pseudorapidity dependence of charged-particle production provides information on the partonic structure of the colliding hadrons and is sensitive to non-linear QCD evolution in the initial state. Measurements of charged-particle pseudorapidity densities in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV and in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$= 5.36 TeV will be presented, for the first time with the wider pseudorapidity coverage achieved by ALICE in Run 3 thanks to newly installed central and forward trackers. On the other hand to understand the thermal-like behavior and the particle yields in pp collisions, a possible approach is to address the principles of quantum states and their entanglement in the produced system. The entanglement in the initial state has a measurable effect on the evolution of the system and is the driving mechanism behind the thermal-like behavior and particle yields observed. We will show equivalence in a calculation of the initial state entropy (calculated using PDF’s) and the final state entropy (calculated using multiplicity distributions) studying primary charged particles produced in pp collisions at 13 TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alek', 'last_name': 'Hutson', 'fullName': 'Hutson, Alek', 'id': '7977322', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston (US)', 'emailHash': 'd647c8d7868a3e88a9a7eacd7dfeb000', 'db_id': 7977322, 'person_id': 7682292}"
Jets,parallel,Exploring perturbative QCD splittings in heavy-ion collisions,"Takacs, Adam",University of Bergen,Unknown,"We propose a novel approach to investigate the evolution of jets in heavy-ion collisions by employing a combination of jet substructure measurements. Our method focuses on isolating the perturbative regime of jet evolution. As a proof of concept, we analyze the distribution of the hardest splitting above a transverse momentum scale, $k_{t,cut}$, in high-$p_t$ jets. For a $k_{t, cut}$ that is significantly greater than any medium scale, the observable is determined by vacuum-like emissions. Therefore, it serves as a unique baseline independent of the medium modeling. Furthermore, a moderate $k_{t,cut}$ enhances the sensitivity to energy loss, specifically highlighting the presence of a critical resolution angle. Finally, at low $k_{t,cut}$, the observable becomes sensitive to induced emissions and medium response. We validate the generality of our findings using various heavy-ion event generators, including Hybrid, JetMed, Jewel, and Matter+LBT/MARTINI  models. Consequently, these substructure measurements can serve as a valuable guideline for future model developments, effectively disentangling different medium contributions. Our study paves the way for the definition of jet observables that can be calculated from first principles, dominated by perturbative QCD, and within the experimental reach of Run3 at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adam', 'last_name': 'Takacs', 'fullName': 'Takacs, Adam', 'id': '7819196', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen', 'emailHash': '409c082a3f5dcb5f15459869dff17efc', 'db_id': 7819196, 'person_id': 7562689}"

These modifications can be measured using observables like jet momentum profile and generalized angularities to study the details of jet-medium interactions. Jet momentum profile ($\rho(r)$) encodes radially differential information about jet broadening and has shown migration of charged energy towards the jet-periphery in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Measurements of generalized angularities (girth $g$ and momentum dispersion $p_T^D$) and LeSub (difference between leading and subleading constituents) from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC show harder, or more quark-like jet fragmentation, in the presence of the medium. Measuring these distributions in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC will help us further characterize the jet-medium interactions in a phase-space region complimentary to that of the LHC. 

In this talk, we present the first measurements of fully corrected $\rho(r)$, $g$, $p_T^D$ and LeSub observables using hard-core jets (jets constructed using constituents with $p_T > 2$ GeV/c to suppress the combinatorial background) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, collected by the STAR experiment at RHIC.

One example of such property is the medium resolution length, which is related to the smallest angle of emission where the medium can still resolve the daughter particles as individual particles. This can be probed for example through the energy-energy correlator. The medium resolution length has implications to parton energy loss, since two particles will emit energy more vigorously compared to one. Also other details of the parton energy loss, like the path-length dependency, could use precision measurements to provide better discriminating power between available theoretical models. Jets are a good observable to experimentally tackle these questions.

The proposed experimental apparatus is composed of a vertex telescope located close to the target and a muon spectrometer located downstream of a hadron absorber. The vertex telescope will consist of several planes of ultra-thin, large area Monolithic Active Pixel  sensors (MAPS) embedded in a dipole magnetic field. The muon spectrometer will utilize large area gaseous detectors for muon tracking and a toroidal magnet based on a new light-weight and general-purpose concept.

It will cover a pseudorapidity interval of $3.4 < \eta < 5.8$, allowing to explore QCD at unprecedented low Bjorken-$x$ of down to $\approx 10^{-6}$ -- a regime where non-linear QCD dynamics are expected to be sizable.
It consists of a compact silicon-tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) with pad and pixel longitudinal and transverse segmented readout layers to achieve high spatial resolution for discriminating between isolated photons and decay photon pairs. Its hadronic component (FoCal-H) is constructed from copper capillary tubes filled with scintillator fibers and used for isolation energy measurement and jets.

The FoCal detector extends the ALICE physics program with the capability, unique at the LHC, to investigate gluon Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in the low-$x$ regime. This not only enables the study of non-linear QCD effects such as gluon saturation, but also allows to provide experimental constrains for (nuclear) PDFs in a region of phasespace where experimental data is scarce.The detector design allows carrying out these explorations using a multitude of probes, including direct photons, jets, as well as photo-production of vector mesons such as the J/$/psi$ in proton-Pb and Pb-Pb ultra-peripheral collisions.In addition, correlations of different probes can be studied, including gamma-jet, jet--jet and $\pi^0$--$\pi^{0}$ correlations.

We demonstrate that the magnetohydrodynamical equations of motion become dramatically different for this more realistic system. The shear stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation: it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field  each evolving according to different dynamical equation. For large magnetic fields we further show that the solutions of this theory display oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory. Finally, we investigate the derived equations in a Bjorken flow scenario.

Astrophysics,parallel,Far-from-equilibrium relativistic hydrodynamics in neutron-star mergers,"Yang, Yumu",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Unknown,"In binary neutron-star mergers, violent changes in density drive the proton fraction out of equilibrium at timescales of milliseconds, comparable to those required by weak interactions to restore beta equilibrium. As a result, the pressure evolves out of phase with the density oscillations, giving rise to dissipative work that can be modeled as an effective bulk-viscous correction [1,2]. Near beta equilibrium, the correction to the pressure is known to follow an Israel-Stewart-like equation of motion, with transport coefficients determined by the equation of state outside beta equilibrium and weak-interaction rates [2]. However, it is not clear if that is the regime that actually occurs in neutron star mergers [3]. In this work, we shed new light on this problem in the following way. First, we show how this hydrodynamic description can be extended far from equilibrium, without approximations, allowing us to model neutron star matter that is arbitrarily far from beta equilibrium. We find that for realistic equations of state [4], the linear approximation in deviations from equilibrium commonly assumed in the field [1] has very limited applicability and, thus, realistic neutron star mergers are indeed in the far-from-beta equilibrium regime. We calculate the resulting far-from-equilibrium transport coefficients for equations of state that satisfy the latest constraints from multi-messenger observations from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. Our results pave the way for novel systematic studies of viscous effects in numerical simulations of binary mergers [3].

Astrophysics,parallel,Bayesian analysis of nontrivial features in the speed of sound inside neutron stars in light of astrophysical and pQCD constraints,"Mroczek, Débora",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Functional forms of the neutron star Equation of State (EoS) are required to extract the viable EoS band from neutron star observations. Realistic nuclear EoSs, containing deconfined quarks or hyperons, present nontrivial features in the speed of sound such as bumps, kinks, and plateaus. Using modified Gaussian processes to model EoSs with nontrivial features, we show in a fully Bayesian analysis incorporating measurements from X-ray sources, gravitational wave observations, and perturbative QCD results that these features are compatible with current constraints. We find nontrivial behavior in the EoS plays a role in understanding the possible phase structure of neutron stars at densities around 2 $n_{\rm sat}$ [1]. Lastly, we perform a large-scale systematic analysis of the impact of perturbative QCD constraints when they are applied beyond the maximal central densities realized in realistic neutron star EoSs.

The measured p-d correlation function can only be explained if the three nucleons are considered as explicit degrees of freedom in the calculations, demonstrating the sensitivity of the correlation function to the full three-nucleon dynamics. Additionally, the measurement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}\mathrm{d}$K+d and $\mathrm{K}^{-}\mathrm{d}K$-d correlations in Pb--Pb collisions at different centralities has made it possible to extract for the first time the scattering lengths and the source radii of such pairs, which have been awaited for more than 40 years.

Jet deflection via multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents may broaden the azimuthal correlation between the trigger hadron and the recoiling jet. In addition, the tail of this azimuthal correlation may be sensitive to single-hard Moli`ere scatterings off quasi-particles in the medium. The R-dependence of recoil jet yield probes jet energy loss and intra-jet broadening. In inclusive jet populations, the principle axis of energy flow in the plane transverse to the jet axis examines the correlation of particles outside the jet cone with the energy of the jet. This and the hadron+jet results may be sensitive to wake effects due to jet-medium energy transfer at low $p_\mathrm{T}$. 
This talk presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a trigger hadron in pp and Pb--Pb collisions.

The multi-differential measurement of the high momentum two-particle correlations can probe a particular space-time window as a function of energy transfer. Comparing the correlations with the prompt photon triggered hadron spectra, one can extract the property of the medium from various aspects and contribute to distinct models. The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has collected its highest statistics of the $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ triggered hadron events in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV in the RHIC Year-2014 run, and measured not only the inclusive spectra of the triggered hadrons but also the angle and energy dependent $I_{AA}$ and $D_{AA}$.

Jets,parallel,Studies of jet quenching and medium response using photon+jet events with ATLAS,"Mc Ginn, Christopher",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Partons traversing the hot and dense medium of deconfined color charges produced in collisions of heavy nuclei are expected to lose their energy primarily through medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung.

In this talk, photon+jet events taken with the ATLAS detector in Pb+Pb and pp are used to constrain the color-charge dependence of jet energy loss. First, ATLAS presents the finalized result on the nuclear modification factor RAA for photon-tagged jets. By comparing this measurement to the RAA for inclusive jets, one can exploit the known difference in the quark-/gluon-initiated jet fraction between these two samples and extract the QCD color-charge dependence. Second, ATLAS presents a new measurement of photon plus two jet production in Pb+Pb collisions as compared to $pp$, where the configuration of quark+gluon jet pair is expected to dominate. Measurements of the total jet-to-photon $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ratio, the two-jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ asymmetry, and the jet opening angle are presented, providing novel information on the parton-QGP interaction.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,A fluid-dynamic approach to heavy-quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma,"Capellino, Federica",GSI Darmstadt,Unknown,"Heavy quarks (i.e. charm and beauty) are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Although they are initially produced out of kinetic equilibrium via hard partonic scattering processes, recent measurements of anisotropic flow of charmed hadrons pose the question regarding the possible thermalization of heavy quarks in the medium. Our recent work [1] has provided new insights on the level of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP. In particular, exploiting a mapping between transport theory and fluid-dynamics, we have shown how a fluid-dynamic description of the dynamics of charm quarks in the QCD plasma is feasible. Inspired by recent lattice-QCD calculations [2], we will show how a partial thermalization within the lifetime of the QGP is expected also for beauty quarks.
We will present results for spectra of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic code (FluiduM [3]) coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current in the QGP. We will also show preliminary calculations for beauty spectra. We compare our calculations with the most recent experimental data providing further constraints on the heavy-quark spatial diffusion coefficient [4].

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Heavy-flavor transport and hadronization in proton-proton collisions,"Beraudo, Andrea","INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)",Italy,"Recent experimental results on the Λ+c/D0 ratio in proton-proton collisions – strongly enhanced compared to expectations relying on universal fragmentation fractions/functions in different colliding system, from e+e− to pp – led to speculations about possible medium effects affecting hadronization, previously considered a distinctive feature only of heavy-ion collisions. Here we show how the assumption of the formation of a small, deconfined and expanding fireball also in pp collisions, in which charm quarks can undergo rescattering and hadronization, allows one to qualitative reproduce unexpected experimental findings in the heavy-flavor particle ratios and distributions. For this purpose we apply to the proton-proton case the same in-medium hadronization mechanism previously developed to address heavy-ion collisions and based on local color-neutralization via recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite color charges from the background fireball. In our model the presence of diquark excitations in the hot medium favors the formation of charmed baryons and the recombination process, involving quite collinear partons from the same fluid cell, turns out to be an efficient mechanism to transfer the collective flow of the system to the final charmed hadrons.
The model -- described in detail in EPJC 82 (2022) 7, 607 -- allowed us to provide a good description of the charmed-hadron ratios and momentum-distribution in nucleus-nucleus collision. Its extension to the proton-proton case provides a consistent explanation for the enhanced Λ+c/D0 ratio observed in these collisions and leads to other interesting results for the charmed-hadron momentum distributions -- entering into the definition of the R_AA, in which the pp result can no longer be considered as the no-final-state-effect benchmark -- and for their elliptic-flow coefficient, reflecting the initial deformation of the fireball.
Having validated our modelling of the initial state of the fireball and its hydrodynamic evolution against the measured soft-particle multiplicity in pp collisions, we believe our results are pretty robust and provide a unified picture of heavy-flavor production from pp to AA collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '7819064', 'affiliation': 'INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 7819064, 'person_id': 7538364}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Event-by-event heavy-flavour dynamics: estimating the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s$ from charm to the infinite mass limit,"Minissale, Vincenzo",Unknown,Unknown,"In the past years, a Quasi-Particle Model (QPM) has been developed to study charm quark dynamics in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions supplying a satisfactory description of both the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of D mesons and leading to a first evaluation of the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$ from the phenomenology [1,2]. Within an event-by-event full Boltzmann transport approach followed by a hybrid hadronization via coalescence plus fragmentation, we will discuss for the first time $R_{AA}(p_T), v_2(p_T)$ and $v_3(p_T)$ predictions down to $p_T \rightarrow 0$ for D and B mesons as well as $\Lambda_c$ and $\Lambda_b$ at both RHIC-sPHENIX and LHC energies [3]. Furthermore the analysis is extended to higher order anisotropic flows $v_n$ of D mesons, also evaluated by using the Event-Shape-Engineering (ESE) technique [4]. We find that QPM approach is able to correctly predict not only the new observables related to charm quark sector, but also the first available data on $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of single-electron from B mesons decays measured by ALICE. The role of the large  $\Lambda_c$ and $\Lambda_b$ production is relevant especially in the low $p_T$ region that is becoming accessible to sPHENIX and ALICE.
A significant breaking of the expected scaling of the thermalization time $\tau_{th}$ with $M_Q/T$ is found, studying the evolution with mass of $D_s(T)$ to better assess the comparison to lQCD calculations. Charm quark $D_s(T)$ is about $50\%$ larger than the asymptotic value for $M_Q\rightarrow \infty$, while bottom $D_s(T)$ is only $20\%$ higher. Such a behaviour entails for $M_Q\rightarrow \infty$, a $D_s(T)$ which is consistent within the current uncertainty to the most recent lattice QCD calculations with dynamical quarks and allows to envisage for bottom quark a thermalization time smaller than the one from $M_Q/T$ scaling.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Microscopic Model for Quarkonia Production in Heavy-Ion collisions,"Aichelin, Joerg",SUBATECH,Unknown,"Quarkonia are a very interesting probe for the study of thequark gluon plasma (QGP), created in ultrarelativisitc heavy-ion collisions. They can elucidate several features of the QGP, which are not accessible to other probes. These include the energy loss of color neutral states and open heavy flavour partons in the QGP, the possible recombination of heavy quarks during the expansion of the QGP and the influence of the potential between c(b) and $\bar c(\bar b)$, which is modified in the QGP environment, on the production of quarkonia. 

We present the first microscopic approach for the study of quarkonia. It follows the heavy quarks from their initial production to the detection as a part of a quarkonium or as open heavy flavour hadron. After being produced in EPOS4 by (shadowing modified) initial collisions, the heavy quarks interact mutually by a potential, calculated on the lattice. When the temperature of the surrounding QGP environment falls below the dissociation temperature of the quarkonia species, a density matrix, based quantum approach of Remler [1], describes the formation and destruction of quarkonia due to its interaction with the QGP medium while the QGP medium expands.
The expanding QGP is described by the EPOS4 approach, which has shown to reproduce a multitude of experimental observables in the light hadron sector. At freeze out the free heavy quarks combine through hadronization to open heavy flavour partons, which are well reproduced in this approach. We compare the J/$\psi$ as well as the $\psi'$, produced in Remler approach with the available data on transverse momentum spectra, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ and analyse, including feed down corrections, how the above processes influence the production of quarkonia. First results of this approach have been published in [2].

Heavy Flavor,parallel,First energy-energy correlators measurements for inclusive and heavy-flavour tagged jets with ALICE,"Fan, Wenqing",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. (US),USA,"Many new jet substructure observables have been studied in recent years, with particular attention to those which can be calculated by perturbative QCD. N-point energy correlators are currently attracting both theoretical and experimental interest. To comprehensively study the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of jet structure, we measured the energy-energy correlators (EEC) that emphasize the angular structure of the energy flow within jets. Defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs inside jets, the EECs as a function of pair distance show a distinct separation of the perturbative from the non-perturbative regime, revealing parton flavor dependent dynamics of jet formation as well as the confinement of the partons into hadrons. The projected 3-point correlator (E3C) is the first step in observing multi-particle correlations in jets. They encodes the shape dependence of energy flow in jets and supplement the EEC to cleanly access the pQCD region.
We present first measurements of the EECs for D0-tagged and inclusive (gluon-dominated) jets in pp and p--Pb collisions at 13 TeV and 5.02 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. By comparing our results with perturbative QCD predictions, we can measure the modification in the radiation pattern of jets due to mass effects and due to the presence of a cold nuclear medium. We also perform the first E3C measurement for inclusive jets in pp collisions at 13 TeV.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Probing parton formation times with $g\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ splitting,"Van Der Schee, Wilke",CERN,Switzerland,"In vacuum, the spacetime location where a gluon splits into a quark-antiquark pair is not a well defined observable. In heavy-ion collisions, the `formation time’ of a splitting takes on meaning due to interactions with the medium and is a critical feature for the phenomenology of medium-modified parton showers. The $g\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ splitting is especially suited to study this formation time, as the $c\bar{c}$ virtuality is of the same order as medium effects and since the typical time is of the same order as the quark-gluon plasma lifetime. In this talk we demonstrate how to study this process from hadron distributions inside jets containing two D mesons. In particular, we show how the virtuality distribution of the original splitting depends characteristically on the formation time.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wilke', 'last_name': 'Van Der Schee', 'fullName': 'Van Der Schee, Wilke', 'id': '7819079', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'ac9ef8d18cffa0dd05c90d0070af15d6', 'db_id': 7819079, 'person_id': 7539924}"
Small Systems,parallel,Measurements of azimuthal anisotropies in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $\gamma$+Au collisions from STAR,"Huang, Shengli",Stony Brook University,United States,"Collectivity in small systems is a crucial area of study in high-energy nuclear physics, as it provides valuable insights into initial conditions and pre-equilibrium stages in heavy-ion collisions. The small system collision scan at RHIC, including both symmetric and asymmetric small systems (O+O $>$ $^{3}$He$+$Au $>$ $d$$+$Au $>$ $p$$+$Au $>$ $\gamma+$Au), provides a better understanding of how collectivity emerges and evolves with system size.

We analyze a large sample of minimum bias and central triggered $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and inclusive $\gamma$+Au processes (center-of-mass energy around 40 GeV) by triggering ultra-peripheral events in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Using two- and four-particle correlation methods, we present the first measurements of azimuthal anisotropies, $v_2$ and $v_3$, in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O and $\gamma$+Au collisions as a function of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and multiplicity. We compare our measurements with STAR measurements of $v_n$ in $p/d/^3$He+Au collisions and hydrodynamic model calculations. 

New $v_{n}$ measurements in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions provide insight into the impact of system symmetry on initial condition and pre-equilibrium dynamics, compared to the previously studied asymmetric systems $p/d/^3$He+Au. We also investigate the ratio $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ and correlations between $v_n$ and mean $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ as a function of multiplicity, which are sensitive to initial momentum anisotropy, subnucleon fluctuations, and clustering in the $^{16}$O nucleus. In addition, $v_{n}$ measurements in $\gamma$+Au processes play an important role in understanding the origin of collectivity and lay the foundation for searching for many-body systems exhibiting collective behavior in photon-induced processes at the EIC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shengli', 'last_name': 'Huang', 'fullName': 'Huang, Shengli', 'id': '7976941', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'a29485ad741f0a83800763f4d5933fb4', 'db_id': 7976941, 'person_id': 7695872}"
Small Systems,parallel,Flowing to the future: Simulating the tiniest fluids in 3+1 dimensions,"Schenke, Bjoern",Brookhaven National Lab,USA,"Employing a dynamical initial state model coupled to (3+1)D viscous relativistic hydrodynamics, we explore the rapidity dependence of anisotropic flow in the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) small system scan at 200 GeV center of mass energy. We demonstrate that approximately 50% of the pT-differential triangular flow difference between the measurements by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations can be explained by the use of reference flow vectors from different rapidity regions. This emphasizes the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelation for anisotropic flow measurements in asymmetric nuclear collisions, and the need for (3+1)D simulations. We further present results for the beam energy scan of d+Au collisions and compare to PHENIX data. The same framework is used to describe p+Pb collisions and photo-nuclear events in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We compare to experimental data on momentum anisotropies from the ATLAS Collaboration and find good agreement with the measured elliptic flow. Again, the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelations is highlighted, as they dominate the elliptic flow hierarchy between p+Pb and γ+Pb collisions. Our results imply that QCD fluids can be created at the future Electron Ion Collider, where they could be studied in great detail.

This analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on inclusive hadron suppression data.

JETSCAPE is a modular framework for multi-stage modeling of in-medium jet evolution and medium response, with rigorous data-model comparison using a Bayesian formalism. The theoretical model in the current study utilizes virtuality-dependent in-medium partonic energy loss coupled to a detailed dynamical model of QGP evolution.

The $\hat{q}$ analysis presented in this talk includes, for the first time, all reported hadron and jet inclusive yield suppression measurements at RHIC and the LHC. The uncertainty covariance of the data is estimated, where not reported. We explore the tension in this determination of $\hat{q}$ between the hadron and the various jet measurements, and between different kinematic regions. In addition we examine the additional information that jet substructure observables provide beyond that contained in inclusive jet and hadron suppression observables. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of jet interactions in matter, and point to next steps in the field for comprehensive understanding of jet quenching as a probe of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raymond', 'last_name': 'Ehlers', 'fullName': 'Ehlers, Raymond', 'id': '7884909', 'affiliation': 'University of California Berkeley (US)', 'emailHash': '74d5703256a0a2ac12ed83af54d47972', 'db_id': 7884909, 'person_id': 7708080}"

One of the most recognized signatures of the QGP, the jet quenching phenomenon, has been evidenced by a wide range of LHC measurements from lead-lead collisions. More recently, experimental results through multiparticle correlation techniques provided some evidence of possible QGP formation in the smaller colliding systems, such as high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-lead collisions, but confirmation of the jet quenching expected for QGP remains elusive for such collisions.

To investigate the phase diagram of the QCD matter, the Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider (RHIC) started the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program in  2010, delivering Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 62.4 GeV.  The success of the BES-I program justified the second phase of Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) with higher statistics and detector upgrades.  Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$= $7.7-54.4$ $\text{GeV}$ were collected during $2017-2021$, covering a large area of the QCD phase diagram in temperature and baryon chemical potential by varying the collision energy, centrality, and rapidity.

To model the dynamics of the collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV, we employ a (3+1)D dynamical initialization model coupled with the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade hybrid framework [1]. To account for shear and bulk viscous effects at RHIC BES energies, we derive the out-of-equilibrium corrections to particle distributions with multiple conserved charge currents using Grad's moment and Chapman-Enskog methods. A fast model emulator is then trained in a 22-dimensional parameter space to accurately predict identified particle yields, average transverse momenta, and charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients. By carrying out a joint Bayesian analysis of the RHIC BES phase I measurements for Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 19.6, and 200 GeV, we set robust constraints on initial-state baryon stopping and the $\mu_B$ and $T$ dependence of the QGP shear and bulk viscosity. Our results show that the Bayesian inference approach with our full (3+1)D hybrid framework effectively extracts the QGP properties and the 3D dynamics of the collision events from the RHIC BES measurements and provides quantitative insights into the QCD matter in a baryon-rich environment.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,QCD based equation of state at finite density with a critical point from an alternative expansion scheme,"Kahangirwe, Micheal ",Unknown,Unknown,"Our study presents a family of Equations of State (EoS) that enable hydrodynamical simulations at unprecedentedly large baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) and finite temperature ($T$), thus helping to constrain the critical point's location by comparing it to experimental data from the Second Beam Energy Scan.
In Ref.  [1], a family of equations of state was constructed by combining Taylor expansion QCD lattice results with 3D Ising model critical behavior. However, the applicability of this family was limited to the range of $ 0 \leq \mu_B \leq 450$ MeV. In recent work, [2,3],  a resummation scheme was proposed that extrapolates lattice QCD results to the range of chemical potentials $\frac{\mu_B}{T} = 3.5 $.
In this work, we combine these approaches to obtain equations of state in the range $0 \leq \mu_B \leq 700$ MeV and 5 MeV $\leq T \leq 800$ MeV, which match lattice QCD results at low density and contain a 3D Ising model critical point. We impose stability and causality constraints and discuss the possible ranges of free parameter choices arising from the 3D Ising model to QCD mapping. We present thermodynamic observables, including baryon density, pressure, entropy, energy density, susceptibility, and speed of sound that cover a wide range in the QCD phase diagram.

A crucial theoretical input for achieving this goal is mapping the QCD equation of state in the presence of baryon chemical potential (mu) which at the moment is limited to small values of mu, away from the critical point. I present a new framework for reconstructing the equation of state from a truncated Taylor series expansion for small mu by using novel resummation techniques. I show how this resummation method can be used to (i) determine the location of the critical point and (ii) constrain the form of the critical contribution to the QCD equation of state which has a direct impact on the shape of the experimental signatures of the critical point.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gokce', 'last_name': 'Basar', 'fullName': 'Basar, Gokce', 'id': '7818820', 'affiliation': 'University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill', 'emailHash': '1d4435d08ec66dccd412e26bf8baaa05', 'db_id': 7818820, 'person_id': 7559638}"
New Theory,parallel,Applicability of higher-order hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions,"Jaiswal, Sunil",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,Unknown,"We study the boost-invariant non-conformal Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation using special moments of the distribution function and investigate how hydrodynamical behavior emerges as the plasma transits from the far-off-equilibrium free-streaming regime to the hydrodynamic regime. The infinite hierarchy of moments can be truncated by keeping only the three lowest moments that correspond to the three independent components of the energy-momentum tensor. By comparing the moment equations with the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations, we demonstrate that the latter are able to capture the early-time, collisionless dynamics, albeit approximately, due to their relaxation-type structure [1]. We also derive second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics from the three-moment truncation and find that there are ambiguities in the definition of some second-order transport coefficients. In order to understand the nature of these ambiguities, we derive the full second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics by employing Chapman-Enskog expansion and also from a novel entropy approach and show that such ambiguities are inherent when defining some of the second-order transport coefficients [2]. We show that these ambiguities affect the ability of the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics to reproduce the results of kinetic theory. The implications of these results in the context of heavy-ion collisions will be discussed.

We explore the effect of including these and other TMDs on the production of high-$p_T$ (unpolarized) hadron production from (unpolarized) proton-proton scattering. The resulting initial state anisotropies, coupled with similar final state effects, may account for the observed azimuthal anisotropy of the produced high transverse momentum hadrons, without modification to the angle integrated spectra ($R_{AA} \simeq 1$).

New Theory,parallel,A new approach to stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics from information flow,"Mullins, Nicki",Illinois Urbana Champaign,Unknown,"The study of thermal fluctuations in relativistic hydrodynamics is essential for understanding physics near the expected critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram. Furthermore, the incorporation of stochastic fluctuations may be important for the modeling of hydrodynamics in small systems such as proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. We present a new general formalism for introducing thermal fluctuations in relativistic hydrodynamics which incorporates the recent developments on the causality and stability of relativistic hydrodynamic theories. Our approach is based on the recently introduced information current [1], which measures the net amount of information carried by perturbations around equilibrium in a relativistic many-body system. The resulting noise correlators are guaranteed to be observer-independent for thermodynamically stable models, which differs from previous approaches employed in the literature. We obtain a Martin-Siggia-Rose [2] action principle within our formalism and compare it to previous proposals for hydrodynamic effective actions. Finally, we present a few applications, which include the Israel-Stewart theory in a general hydrodynamic frame [3]. We find the adoption of a general hydrodynamic frame introduces new independent structures to the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor which are not present in previous calculations done in the Landau or Eckart hydrodynamic frames.

Initial State,parallel,Using new methods for systematic study of nuclear structure in high-energy collisions to probe the effect of short-range correlations,"William Luzum, Matthew",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"There is increasing interest in using high-energy collisions to probe the structure of nuclei, in particular with the high-precision data made possible by collisions performed with pairs of isobaric species. A systematic study requires a variation of parameters representing nuclear properties such as radius, skin thickness,  angular deformation, and short-range correlations, to determine the sensitivity of the various observables on each of these properties. In this work we propose a method for efficiently carrying out such study, based on the shifting of positions of nucleons in Monte-Carlo samples.  We show that by using this method, statistical demands can be dramatically reduced --- potentially reducing the required number of simulated events by orders of magnitude --- paving the way for systematic study of nuclear structure in high-energy collisions.

As an application, we perform a systematic study of short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations and their effects on heavy-ion observables.  Using our methods these effects, though small, can be precisely studied without the need for large numbers of simulations.  In particular, we illustrate the limitations of a simple exclusion radius as a proxy for realistic nucleon-nucleon correlation functions.

Initial State,parallel,Adiabatic Hydrodynamization: a Natural Framework to Find and Describe Prehydrodynamic Attractors,"Steinhorst, Rachel",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"One of the main challenges in the theory of heavy ion collisions is understanding how an initial state of two highly Lorentz-contracted nuclei acquires the features of a hydrodynamic plasma in a characteristic time of 1 fm/c. Arguably, the most successful descriptions of this out-of-equilibrium stage have been established by finding so-called “attractor” solutions in the various (simplified) theories that attempt to capture out-of-equilibrium dynamics of QCD. These attractors are characterized by a loss of sensitivity to the initial conditions, which is achieved because the kinetic theory is dynamically driven to a preferred “attractor surface” in the phase space of the theory, often well before hydrodynamization in weakly coupled kinetic theory.

In this context, the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework [1,2] is a promising candidate to describe and characterize attractors in a model-independent formulation. In principle, all that needs to be done is to establish the dominance of an effective ground state in the dynamics of the system. This was done analytically in [2] for the first stage of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [3], demonstrating a dynamical reduction in the number of active degrees of freedom much earlier than the hydrodynamic regime. A key observation made in [2] was that such effective ground states may require a time-dependent change of coordinates for their dominance to be manifest. Ultimately, such a change of coordinates is one of the defining characteristics of the sought attractor solution, and therefore it becomes imperative to define a procedure to find the “optimal” coordinate transformation for a given theory. In this talk, we will lay out a candidate for such a procedure and will consider the example of collision-driven dynamics in the Bjorken-expanding kinetic theory of a dilute gluon gas to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to describe attractor solutions. We will then lay out the path to explore more realistic descriptions of the expanding QGP, including the later stages of bottom-up thermalization, and the transverse expansion of the medium.

For the pressure ratio $P_T/P_L$, we observe that its late-time evolution becomes universal in units of the kinetic relaxation time for sufficiently large couplings signaling the onset of a hydrodynamical attractor. In contrast, at weak couplings, it converges earlier to a bottom-up attractor in terms of the thermalization time scale $\tau_{\text{BMSS}} = \alpha_s^{-13/5}/Q_s$. We interpret these as two limiting attractors. The dynamics of the occupancy of hard modes, the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient, and the jet quenching parameter are better described by a bottom-up limiting attractor even for moderate couplings. Therefore, the previous conjecture that the hydrodynamical attractor governs the late-time approach toward hydrodynamization is not complete. Our results rather indicate that a weak coupling attractor emerges additionally in the coupling regime relevant for heavy-ion collisions for certain observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Lindenbauer', 'fullName': 'Lindenbauer, Florian', 'id': '7818900', 'affiliation': 'TU Wien', 'emailHash': '6f56c18325322a7029f9290f37c89bd4', 'db_id': 7818900, 'person_id': 7537240}"
Initial State,parallel,Investigating the early magnetic field of QGP via heavy-flavour polarisation studies with ALICE,"Micheletti, Luca",CERN,Switzerland,"Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are produced at the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions, on a time scale shorter than the medium formation time, and are sensitive to the large initial magnetic field produced perpendicular to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter direction and beam direction) in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised. The quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron in the hadronisation process. Experimentally, the heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring the spin density matrix element of spin 1 hadrons (as the  $\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson). Any deviation of ρ00 parameter from ⅓ can be attributed to the spin alignment of $\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson.

A comparison with the $J/\psi$ polarisation measurement will also be reported to investigate the effect of the magnetic field. In this study, one of the main background sources is represented by the feed-down contribution from B-meson decays, as vector mesons which decay from scalar B mesons are expected to be longitudinally polarized due to the helicity conservation in weak decays.

The rate of the dielectron emission is proportional to the medium's electromagnetic spectral function.

Meanwhile, the low energy range of the spectral function provides information about the medium’s electrical conductivity. Therefore, by measuring thermal dielectron production, we can study the microscopic interactions between the electromagnetic current and the medium.

They are produced at all stages of the collision with negligible final-state interactions. At intermediate dielectron invariant mass ($m_{\rm ee} > 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$), thermal radiation from the quark-gluon plasma carries information about the early temperature of the medium. At LHC energies, it is however dominated by a large background from correlated heavy-flavour hadron decays. At smaller $m_{\rm ee}$, thermal radiation from the hot hadronic phase contributes to the dielectron spectrum via decays of $\rho$ mesons, whose spectral function is sensitive to chiral-symmetry restoration. Finally, at vanishing $m_{\rm ee}$, the real direct photon fraction can be extracted from the dielectron data. In pp collisions, such measurement in minimum bias events serves as a baseline and a fundamental test for perturbative QCD calculations, while studies in high charged-particle multiplicity events allow one to search for thermal radiation in small colliding systems. The latter show surprising phenomena similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions.

EM Probes,parallel,Coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction and polarization in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Shatat, Afnan",Université Paris-Saclay (FR),Unknown,"Photonuclear reactions are induced by the strong electromagnetic field generated by ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. These processes have been extensively studied in ultraperipheral collisions, in which the impact parameter is larger than twice the nuclear radius. In recent years, the observation of coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction has been claimed in nucleus--nucleus (A--A) collisions with nuclear overlap, based on the measurement of an excess (with respect to hadroproduction expectations) in the very low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) J/$\psi$ yield. Such quarkonium measurements can help constraining the nuclear gluon distribution at low Bjorken-x and high energy. In addition, they can shed light on the theory behind photon induced reactions in A--A collisions with nuclear overlap, including possible interactions of the measured probes with the formed and fast expanding quark-gluon plasma. In order to confirm the photoproduction origin of the very low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ J/$\psi$ yield excess, polarization measurement is a golden observable. It is indeed expected that the produced quarkonium would keep the polarization of the incoming photon due to s-channel helicity conservation. ALICE can measure inclusive and exclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum, at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\it{y}$|< 0.9). In this contribution, we will report on the new preliminary measurement of the $\it{y}$-differential cross section and the new first polarization analysis at LHC of coherently photoproduced J/$\psi$ in peripheral Pb--Pb collisions.

We discuss in detail the quantum mechanics of forming excited states, utilizing the Wigner distribution functions of angular momentum eigenstates of isotropic 3-D harmonic oscillators. We describe how resonance decays can be handled, based on a set of minimal assumptions, by creating an extension of hadron decays in PYTHIA 8.

However, it is essential to investigate their performance with rapidity-dependent measurements at low collision energies, where boost-invariance is expected to be strongly violated. In this study, we calibrate a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic framework using rapidity distributions of charged particles and net protons for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7–200$ GeV. We observe significant rapidity dependences in thermodynamic properties at the hadronization process near the chemical freeze-out. The effects on the rapidity dependence of particle production due to longitudinal flow and system size are also highlighted. A rapidity-dependent thermal model is developed, incorporating the dynamical features of the multistage framework. We evaluate the performance of different thermal model scenarios in extracting the freeze-out profiles, using the rapidity-dependent yields of the multistage framework and comparing them to the hydrodynamic freeze-out hypersurface as a closure test [1]. Bayesian analysis is applied to constrain the longitudinal flow, system size in rapidity space, and thermodynamic properties for nuclear matter created at low beam energies. Our Bayesian model selection analysis reveals a longitudinal flow stronger than Bjorken in the experimental measurements as beam energy decreases. Our study provides a simple numerical approach for extracting rapidity-dependent thermodynamic parameters at freeze-out for low-beam energy collisions. Furthermore, analyzing freeze-out profiles through data-driven methods using this model offers quantitative guidance to computationally-demanding hybrid approaches [2].

Both approaches omit or approximate essential properties of quantum mechanical systems including coherence and entanglement. An alternative paradigm of understanding thermalization of an isolated quantum system is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which states that matrix elements of local observables in the energy eigenstate basis are equal to the corresponding microcanonical ensemble values, up to random corrections that decrease exponentially with the system size. In this talk, we will show results of testing this hypothesis for the 2+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory on a lattice.

Measurements from the first phase of the BES program have indicated potential changes in the medium properties with decreasing collision energy.

This isolation of final state effects is achieved by approximating the nuclear modification factor by the double ratio $R_{xA}=(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{pp}/(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{xA}$. While the cold-nuclear-matter effects in $x+$A collisions cancel in the ($\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{xA}$ ratio, the effective number of binary collisions is given by $N_{\mathrm{coll}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = \gamma^{dir}_{xAu}/\gamma^{dir}_{pp}$, which eliminates the dependence on the Glauber model.

In addition, we observe an accelerated entropy growth due to the larger phase space being explored by the quark and that the quantum and classical quark entropies converge at late times. We further observe that the quark state loses all memory of the initial condition. Combined with the fact that the reduced density matrix satisfies Boltzmann-diffusion transport, we conclude that the quark reduced density matrix can be interpreted as a classical phase space distribution.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Measurements of Charm Quark Interaction with the QGP in Heavy-Ion Collisions at STAR,"Su, Yuan",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Heavy flavor quarks (charm and bottom), produced in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, serve as excellent probes to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). When traversing the medium, charm quarks suffer from `jet quenching' thanks to the interactions with the QGP. It can manifest as degradation of charm quark energy and modifications to the fragmentation pattern, both of which are predicted to depend on parton flavor and quark mass. The energy loss can be quantified by comparing yields of charmed mesons or tagged charm jets in heavy-ion collisions to those in $p$+$p$ collisions. On the other hand, medium-induced modifications to the jet shower can be studied using the jet fragmentation function, i.e., the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) fraction of the jet carried by hadrons along the jet axis ($z = \vec{p}_{\rm T, hadron}\textbf{.}\hat{p}_{\rm T, jet}/|\vec{p}_{\rm T, jet}|$).

In this contribution, we report the first measurement of the $\rm D^{0}$ meson production yield at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 1$) in isobar collisions (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$, with the STAR experiment at RHIC. We present nuclear modification factors as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ for different centrality classes, and compare them to similar measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$. We complement the $\rm D^{0}$ meson studies with measurements of $\rm D^{0}$ meson tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$. For the first time, we show measurements of charm jet fragmentation function in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, and the nuclear modification factor as a function of $z$. Additionally, we report the yield modifications of $\rm D^{0}$-tagged jets as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ and the radial profile of the $\rm D^{0}$ mesons in these tagged jets. These reported measurements can help constrain theoretical calculations of parton flavor, parton mass and system size dependencies of parton interactions with the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuan', 'last_name': 'Su', 'fullName': 'Su, Yuan', 'id': '7974505', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China', 'emailHash': '771bd980c5719d252523231d405e4a12', 'db_id': 7974505, 'person_id': 7535817}"

The latest PHENIX runs contains a large data set which allows, for the first time, the study of heavy flavor and J/$\psi$ flow at the large rapidity region in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV.

Jets,parallel,ATLAS measurements of $b$-jet suppression and heavy-flavor azimuthal correlations in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions,"Sickles, Anne Marie",Univ. Illinois at Urbana Champaign (US),USA,"The suppression of jets in heavy-ion collisions can provide detailed information about the hot, dense plasma formed in these collisions at the LHC. Jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the mass of the fragmenting parton. For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy-quark-initiated jets, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. This energy loss mechanism can be studied by measuring differences in the suppression of $b$-tagged and inclusive jets in $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions. Besides the $b$-tagged jet measurements, an alternative method for probing the interactions of heavy quarks with the plasma is the study of the correlations between heavy-quark pairs, which is sensitive to the relative importance of collisional versus radiative scattering processes. In this talk, we report new ATLAS measurements of $b$-tagged and inclusive jet production as well as the measurement of the yield of correlated muon pairs from heavy-flavor decays in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_\textrm{NN}}~=~5.02$~TeV. For $b$-tagged and inclusive jet, the transverse momentum distributions in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions, as well as the nuclear modification factors, $R_{AA}$, in Pb+Pb collisions, are presented together with comparisons to theoretical calculations. The measurement of correlated muon pairs from heavy-flavor decays includes per-event yields, scaled by the nuclear thickness function, $T_{AA} $ will be discussed.

Jets,parallel,Scanning the initial jet production points with dijet tomography in heavy-ion collisions,"He, Yayun",South China Normal University,China,"Jet energy loss and transverse momentum broadening are controlled by the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in the QGP medium. Specifically, jet energy loss correlates with jet propagation length, while transverse momentum asymmetry caused by the gradient of $\hat{q}$ depends on the initial transverse coordinates. We study both the longitudinal and transverse jet tomography in dijet events by triggering the leading jet propagating along the direction of the event plane in heavy-ion collisions. Simulations are performed using the linear Boltzmann transport model with event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds. We find that the initial jet production positions in the transverse plane can be simultaneously located by combining the dijet transverse momentum imbalance $x_{J} = p^\mathrm{subleading}_{T} / p^\mathrm{leading}_{T}$ and jet transverse momentum asymmetry perpendicular to the initial jet directions for different leading jet $p_{T}$ regions.

Jets,parallel,Identifying jet observables which can see the short-length structure of QGP,"Rajagopal, Krishna",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Quark-gluon plasma, which is a strongly coupled liquid at its natural length scales, must at the same time feature weakly coupled quark and gluon quasiparticles that appear only in hard processes that can resolve its short-length structure. In particular, high-energy partons in a jet shower can scatter off, and kick, the quark and gluon quasiparticles within a droplet of QGP when these Moliere scattering processes occur with a large enough momentum transfer. Here, we implement this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jets in heavy ion collisions. 

Throughout its evolution within the expanding cooling droplet of QGP, the shower of jet and recoil partons inject energy and momentum into the QGP, producing wakes. The large impact of the wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the medium on jet observables makes finding distinctive signatures of scattering off QGP quasiparticles challenging.

The hybrid model is particularly valuable for identifying observables that are more/less sensitive to consequences of scattering off quasiparticles and less/more sensitive to consequences of wakes in the QGP because when we turn Moliere scattering off the model contains no effects of scattering — energy loss in the model arises from strongly coupled physics, not from scattering.  

We show that jet shapes and fragmentation functions are more sensitive to the contribution of the wake to the reconstructed, and identify various groomed jet observables (eg soft drop splitting angle, leading $k_T$, and girth) that are insensitive to this contribution and that show reasonable sensitivity to scattering off quasiparticles, with those in gamma-jet events of particular interest. We also investigate Z-hadron correlation observables and Z-jet acoplanarity observables constructed with the winner-take-all definition of the jet direction. We construct several promising observables from inclusive subjets within jets, and show that Moliere scattering increases the number of subjets and yields subjets which are more widely distributed and more widely separated.  These observables are unaffected by the wake; they are directly sensitive to “sprouting a new subjet”, the intrinsic feature of Moliere scattering which makes its effects different from those of the wake.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Krishna', 'last_name': 'Rajagopal', 'fullName': 'Rajagopal, Krishna', 'id': '7818836', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '2c68a5f0ec1dce250f21eee4b240232f', 'db_id': 7818836, 'person_id': 7542994}"

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Global angular momentum generation in heavy-ion reactions within a hadronic transport approach,"Sass, Nils",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"In 2017, the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured finite global angular momentum in heavy-ion collisions through a spin polarization measurement of $\Lambda$ hyperons. This measurement revealed a high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence for vorticity in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for the first time. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of angular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is applied to study the generation of global angular momentum by the interaction of two nuclei. As SMASH provides access to the whole phase-space evolution of every particle at any given time, it allows to assess the fraction of angular momentum generated in the fireball by all participants. We confirm the previous modeling by Becattini \textit{et al} within a geometric Glauber model approach, which found that the angular momentum transfer reaches a unique maximum in mid-central collisions during time evolution [arXiv:2212.14385v1]. The corresponding impact parameter is around $b=4-6$ fm for all beam energies from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.41-200$ GeV. 
Even though angular momentum is not conserved locally in the transport approach a priori, we identify the contributions to the conservation violation and propose optimal setups for different energy regimes that recover conservation, based upon the test particle method and the treatment of Fermi motion. Furthermore, the system size and centrality dependence are investigated.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nils', 'last_name': 'Sass', 'fullName': 'Sass, Nils', 'id': '7884861', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c05b593fcf58b652c1e685f74848feba', 'db_id': 7884861, 'person_id': 7552353}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Measurements of charm quark production and hadronization at CMS,"Chandra, Soumik",Purdue University (US),USA,"The study of charm quark hadrons is an important probe to the processes of hadronization of heavy quarks. More specifically, we present results on the production of $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryon, the nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$), and the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}/\mathrm{D}^{0}$ yield ratios at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV in proton-proton (pp) collisions and in different centrality regions in lead-lead (PbPb) collisions, using data recorded with the CMS detector in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The reported $R_\mathrm{AA}$ for $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ provides useful information regarding the energy loss mechanism of charm quark in the quark-gluon plasma. Its $p_\mathrm{T}$-dependence is similar to that of other charm and beauty hadrons but with its minimum shifted towards higher $p_\mathrm{T}$. Comparing the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}/\mathrm{D}^{0}$ production ratio in pp and PbPb collisions suggests that coalescence as an hadronization process is not significant for $p_\mathrm{T} > 10$~GeV/c. The ratio becomes comparable to the measurements in $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ collisions for $p_\mathrm{T} > 30$~GeV/c. We also present results of the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryon and $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ meson production and their ratios in proton-lead (Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 8.16$~TeV as a function of $p_\mathrm{T}$ and final-state multiplicity using the data recorded by the CMS experiment in 2016.

Critical Point,parallel,Location of the QCD critical point predicted by holographic Bayesian analysis,"Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Predictions for the QCD critical point are made using Bayesian inference techniques within the holographic gauge/gravity correspondence. For that, we employ a Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model capable of reproducing the latest lattice QCD results at zero and finite baryon density, known to predict a high-density critical endpoint. For the first time, we numerically find the posterior probability distribution for holographic model parameters from the lattice data at zero chemical potential, and extract their most likely values. This is possible thanks to new numerical developments which, by boosting the performance of our calculations, allow us to sample a large number of fits to the data via Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we find the maximum a posteriori estimate for the location of the critical point, as well as estimates for the corresponding statistical error bands. We determine the linear combination of model parameters which is the most relevant for these uncertainties and investigate its role for the equation of state at lower densities. Our analysis is performed for two competing model parametrizations, one of which may or may not present a critical point for samples of the prior distribution. We use the posterior distribution for this parametrization to infer the probability that a QCD critical point exists and is situated in a region of the phase diagram that can be probed by ongoing and future heavy ion collision experiments. Preliminary results favor a critical point around a baryon chemical potential of $570 - 650$ MeV and a temperature of $99 - 107$ MeV, with most of the uncertainty concentrated along a single line.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mauricio', 'last_name': 'Hippert Teixeira', 'fullName': 'Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio', 'id': '7818851', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'emailHash': '22b7a8899e5b8f2b4152e676a052d67a', 'db_id': 7818851, 'person_id': 7531715}"

One of the parameters, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, is of particularly importance. It describes the shape of the source, which, in the vicinity of the critical point of the phase diagram, may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$. Its measurement hence may contribute to the search for and characterization of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram.

Moreover, one of the most important goals of NA61/SHINE is to investigate and understand the phase structures of this matter. The investigation of the phase-diagram can be achieved by varying the beam momentum (13A-150(8)A GeV/c) or by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb).

Critical Point,parallel,Critical Expectations: Non-Gaussian Cumulants of Particle Multiplicities Near the Critical Point,"Sushama Pradeep, Maneesha",Unknown,Unknown,"It has long been understood that non-monotonic variation of non-Gaussian cumulants of particle multiplicities as a function of decreasing collision energy and, hence, increasing baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ can yield tell-tale signatures of the presence of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram. In this talk, we shall present quantitative estimates for the magnitude and $\mu_B$-dependence of the skewness and kurtosis of the proton multiplicity as a function of the separation $\Delta T$ between the temperature at a critical point and at freezeout.  These provide a modern update of estimates first attempted in [1], for the first time including the effects of the change in the sign of the critical contribution to the kurtosis discovered in [2] in a way that incorporates the mapping between the universal physics around an Ising critical point onto the QCD phase diagram [3,4].  

Several of us have recently quantified the reduction in the magnitude of the Gaussian cumulant of the proton multiplicity relative to equilibrium expectations, arising because both critical slowing down and baryon number conservation limit the growth of critical fluctuations [5].  In this talk, we describe how the dynamics in the critical regime (including critical slowing down and baryon number conservation) limit the growth of the non-Gaussian cumulants.  It has been understood since they were first proposed as signatures of a critical point that dynamical effects make the actual cumulants much smaller than they would be in equilibrium; for the first time, we estimate how much smaller.  We close by using the newly developed maximum entropy freezeout procedure [6] to make estimates of the magnitude of the skewness and kurtosis of proton multiplicity that can be expected in RHIC BES data if nature places a critical point near where these collisions freeze out.

Critical Point,parallel,Probing the nature of the QCD phase transition with higher-order net-proton number fluctuation and local parton density fluctuation measurements at RHIC-STAR,"Neff, Dylan",CEA-Saclay,Unknown,"Higher-order cumulants ($C_n$) of net-baryon distributions are sensitive to the nature of the QCD phase transition. Recent lattice QCD calculations [1] suggest a negative $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in the crossover regime at small baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B \leq$ 110 MeV). In addition, lattice QCD predicts a special ordering of cumulant ratios for systems of thermalized QGP [2]: $C_3/C_1 > C_4/C_2 > C_5/C_1 > C_6/C_2$. Both predictions can be tested in heavy-ion collision experiments by measuring higher-order cumulants of the net-proton multiplicity distributions.

In the high $\mu_B$ region of the QCD phase diagram, proton multiplicity distributions are utilized to probe characteristics of the phase transition. The variance of proton multiplicity within azimuthal subvolumes of phase space may provide insight into local parton density fluctuations. The deviation of this variance from a binomial baseline along with proton factorial cumulants over the full azimuth [3] may be observables sensitive to a possible first-order phase transition. 

In this talk, we report measurements of net-proton $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in Au+Au collisions with center-of-mass energies from 3 GeV to 200 GeV, where the 3 GeV data are from the fixed-target program and the other data sets are from the Beam Energy Scan program phase I at RHIC-STAR. Proton factorial cumulants and the variance of proton multiplicities in azimuthal partitions are also presented. The cumulant measurements are compared with a QCD-based FRG model, UrQMD, and HRG calculations as well as lattice QCD calculations. The AMPT and MUSIC+FIST models are used as non-critical references in the search for local density fluctuations.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Thermalization of QGP through transverse momentum fluctuation in ultra-central Pb+Pb collision,"Samanta, Rupam","AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland and Institute of Theoretical Physics, CEA, Paris-Saclay University,  Gif-sur-Yvette, France",Unknown,"We report the first direct evidence of thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision, by studying the fluctuation of mean transverse momentum per particle ($\langle p_t \rangle$) in ultra-central Pb+Pb collision. The recent experimental data from the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), provides measurement of variance of $\langle p_t \rangle$ at fixed multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and a steep fall of the variance is observed over a narrow range of $N_{ch}$, for most of the central collision events (Fig. 14 and 15, \href{https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HION-2021-01/}{ATLAS : HION-2021-01}). Such a behaviour cannot be reproduced by previously existing models, such as HIJING which treats Pb+Pb collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. However, our model results can accurately reproduce the peculiar pattern in the variance of $\langle p_t \rangle$ that is observed by ATLAS. To explain such a novel phenomenon, we argue that at a given multiplicity, the impact parameter ($b$) fluctuation plays an important role; the transverse momentum per particle increases with the increasing impact parameter. A larger $b$ corresponds to a smaller collision volume resulting in a higher density. In relativistic thermodyanimcs, a higher density corresponds to a higher initial temperature which implies a larger energy per particle leading to a larger $\langle p_t  \rangle$. Thus at a fixed $N_{ch}$, a higher $\langle p_t  \rangle$  at a larger b is the effect of the thermalization of the system at a higher temperature. To illustrate this point further, we provide results for Pb+Pb collision from hydrodynamic simulation with TRENTO + MUSIC at b=0 and compare with corresponding HIJING results. From the hydro results, we find a very strong correlation between $\langle p_t \rangle$ and $N_{ch}$ at fixed impact parameter, which is not observed in HIJING where there is no thermalization.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,What carries baryon number? Simulations of baryon and electric charge stopping in isobar collisions.,"Pihan, Gregoire",Unknown,Unknown,"It is a fundamental question to understand what is the effective carrier of conserved quantum charges inside a proton at high energy. The net baryon and electric charge rapidity distributions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can elucidate how different 
conserved charges are transported along the longitudinal direction during the collision. Recent preliminary measurements in isobar collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) show that the scaled net-baryon to net-electric charge number ratio at midrapidity ($B/\Delta Q * \Delta Z/A$) is between 1.2 and 2, in line with predictions from the string junction model. This measurement is compatible with the picture where the baryon number is carried by gluon junctions. In this work, we develop a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework with multiple conserved charge currents. We employ the 3D MC-Glauber model for the initial conditions, which allows for modeling baryon stopping separately from electric charge stopping within the string junction picture. Simulating the coupled propagation of net baryon and electric charge currents including the charge-dependent lattice-QCD-based equation of state, we study how net baryon and electric charges are evolved during different stages of heavy-ion collisions. We make predictions of net baryon and net electric charge rapidity distributions for Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV, which can be compared with STAR measurements.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gregoire', 'last_name': 'Pihan', 'fullName': 'Pihan, Gregoire', 'id': '7818944', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'ba6e7abd5512e8011f8012bc78f4de37', 'db_id': 7818944, 'person_id': 7545692}"

Higher order flow harmonics probe the initial geometry of heavy ion collisions as well as the viscous damping of flow coefficients during the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). By extending the study of flow harmonics to higher orders, we can access information about the QGP's transport properties that is complementary to existing measurements. In this talk, we will present the centrality dependence of flow harmonics up to order 10 and compare them to theory calculations and previous measurements at lower orders.

We find that hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate description of collective flow when the average inverse Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}^{−1}$ is sufficiently small and the early pre-equilibrium stage is properly accounted for. By determining the breakdown of hydrodynamics as a function of system size and energy, we find that it is quantitatively accurate in central lead-lead collisions at LHC energies, but should not be used in typical proton-lead or proton-proton collisions, where the development of collective flow can not accurately be described within hydrodynamics.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Can we observe using the collective flow effects of the early nonequilirium dynamics,"Bozek, Piotr",AGH University of Science and Technology,Poland,"The early dynamics in heavy-ion collisions involves a rapid, far from equilibrium evolution. This early pre-equilibrium stage of the dynamics can be modeled using kinetic equations. The effect of this pre-equilibrium stage on final observables derived from transverse momenta of emitted particles is negligible. Therefore, the kinetic equations in the relaxation time approximation for a non-boost invariant system are solved (P.Bozek     Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 034916). The asymmetry of the flow with respect to the reaction plane at different rapidities is found to be very sensitive to the degree of non-equilibrium in the evolution. This suggests that the rapidity odd directed flow is a sensitve probe of the  occurrence of non-equilibrium effects and could be used to estimate the asymmetry of the pressure between the longitudinal and transverse directions. The study of kinetic evolution in the longitudinal direction allows also a modelling of the early pre-Bjorken flow stage of the equilibration.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Piotr', 'last_name': 'Bozek', 'fullName': 'Bozek, Piotr', 'id': '7818921', 'affiliation': 'AGH University of Science and Technology', 'emailHash': '28a7ce84819af788c07a345f60a73401', 'db_id': 7818921, 'person_id': 7532684}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Quenching minijets in a concurrent jet+hydro evolution and its consequences for extracting transport coefficients of QGP,"Singh, Mayank",University of Minnesota,USA,"Intermediate pT jets (minijets) are created by initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collision experiments. They can constitute a significant portion of the particle multiplicity but do not lend themselves to hydrodynamic treatment as their transverse momenta are larger than the typical saturation scale of the bulk matter.Their orientation is independent of the underlying event and they can significantly reduce flow in the collective motion of the bulk medium. They also introduce an additional source of fluctuations.

We study minijets in a new jet+hydro concurrent framework where jet quenching leads to energy and momentum injection in the QGP. Minijets are sampled using PYTHIA and hydro is initialized using the IPGlasma framework. Both of these are concurrently evolved using MUSIC with the minijet quenching being governed by the Hybrid Model. Both the jet and thermal hadrons do hadronic cascade through UrQMD after the freezeout.

We find that this effort requires substantial recalibration of the transport coefficients in hydrodynamic simulations to explain the data. As extraction of transport properties is one of the major goals of the heavy-ion program, we posit that this significant contribution needs to be accounted for. We will also discuss the effect of these minijets on observables like pT-spectra, flow vn and correlations between different vn_s. We also look at the relation between initial state spatial anisotropy and the final state momentum anisotropy in the presence of minijets.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mayank', 'last_name': 'Singh', 'fullName': 'Singh, Mayank', 'id': '7819040', 'affiliation': 'University of Minnesota', 'emailHash': '3a1b6b23e1a6c356253be63cdd8eda48', 'db_id': 7819040, 'person_id': 7559986}"

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Probing initial baryon stopping and equation of state with rapidity-dependent directed flow of identified particles,"Du, Lipei",McGill University,Unknown,"Using a (3+1)-dimensional hybrid framework with parametric initial conditions, we study the rapidity-dependent directed flow  $v_1(y)$ of identified particles, including pions, kaons, protons, and lambdas in heavy-ion collisions. Cases involving Au+Au collisions are considered, performed at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamics in the beam direction is constrained using the measured pseudo-rapidity distribution of charged particles and the net proton rapidity distribution. Within this framework, the directed flow of mesons is driven by the sideward pressure gradient from the tilted source, and that of baryons mainly due to the initial asymmetric baryon distribution with respect to the beam axis driven by the transverse expansion. Our approach successfully reproduces the rapidity- and beam energy-dependence of $v_1$ for both mesons and baryons. We find that the $v_1(y)$ of baryons has strong constraining power on the initial baryon stopping, and together with that of mesons, the directed flow probes the equation of state of the dense nuclear matter at finite chemical potentials. We also provide predictions for the upcoming STAR Beam Energy Scan II measurements of the pseudo-rapidity dependent $v_1$ for charged particles at 27 GeV.

However, much information about the dynamics is encoded in rapidity-dependent behavior, and there exists a large amount of experimental data available to constrain this rapidity dependence. To leverage this information, we perform a systematic model-to-data comparison using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of multiple collision systems --- large and small,  symmetric and asymmetric, at different collision energies, from both RHIC and the LHC. Specifically, we perform fully 3D multi-stage hydrodynamic simulations initialized by a parameterized model for rapidity-dependent energy deposition [1] and we calibrate on a range of observables such as hadron multiplicity, anisotropic flow vectors, and mean transverse momentum --- including their rapidity-dependent fluctuations and correlations. We utilize Bayesian inference to constrain properties of the early- and late-time dynamics of the system, and further harness the results to do experimental design and study the effectiveness of various potential measurements (e.g. from upgraded detectors) at improving these constraints.

Chirality,parallel,Post-blind Analysis of Isobar Collisions and Background-controlled Upper Limit on the Chiral Magnetic Effect from STAR,"Feng, Yicheng",Purdue University,USA,"The STAR Collaboration has reported results from a blind analysis of isobar collisions (${^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}+{^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}$, ${^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}+{^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}$) at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV on the search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Significant differences were observed in the measured multiplicity ($N$) and elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$) between the two isobar systems [1]. The isobar ratio (Ru/Zr) of CME-sensitive observable, $v_2$-scaled charge separation ($\Delta\gamma/v_2$) is close to but systematically larger than the inverse multiplicity ($1/N$) ratio. This indicates the potential existence of a CME signal, as well as the presence of remaining background that is different between the isobars [2]. In this contribution, we present two post-blind analyses of the isobar data that address the remaining backgrounds and attempt to extract any possible CME signal. One of the analysises applies a weighting procedure such that the two isobar systems have identical distributions of $N$ and $v_{2}$, and then compares the CME-sensitive observables ($\Delta\gamma$ correlator and signed Balance Functions [3]) between two isobars with matched $N$ and $v_{2}$. The other analysis examines the two- and three-particle nonflow contributions to the isobar ratio of $\Delta\gamma / v_{2}$ using real data as well as HIJING simulation. This allows the estimation of a modified background baseline for the $\Delta\gamma/v_2$ ratio.  The overall contribution of nonflow is found to be positive, resulting in a background baseline larger than the inverse multiplicity ratio and generally consistent with the isobar measurements. We extract an upper limit of the CME signal in isobar collisions.

Chirality,parallel,Impact of globally spin-aligned vector mesons on the search for the chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions,"Shen, Diyu",Fudan University,Unknown,"In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is predicted to arise from the interplay between the chirality imbalance of quarks in the nuclear medium and the intense magnetic field, and will cause a charge separation along the magnetic field direction. While the search for the CME is still ongoing in experiments at  Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),  the CME-sensitive observables need to be scrutinized to exclude the non-CME contributions. In this work, we examine the influence of globally spin-aligned $\rho$ mesons on the   $\gamma_{112}$ correlator, the $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ correlator, and the signed balance functions, via a toy model and a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The global spin alignment of vector mesons could originate from non-CME mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions, and is  characterized by the 00-component of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$. We find that the CME observables show similar dependence on $\rho_{00}$, and could receive  a positive (negative) contribution from $\rho$-decay pions,  if the $\rho_{00}$ of $\rho$ mesons is larger (smaller) than 1/3. Since pions are the most abundant particles in such collisions, the $\rho_{00}$ measurements for $\rho$ mesons become crucial to the interpretation of the CME data.

Chirality,parallel,A new stable and causal theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics,"Abboud, Nick",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Over the past decade, considerable research effort has focused on investigating macroscopic consequences of anomalies in quantum field theories. In particular, chiral matter is expected to exhibit novel transport phenomena arising from the interplay between quantum anomalies and electromagnetic and vortical fields [1]. In order to study these effects in fluid systems like the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions, it is important to develop consistent theories of relativistic chiral hydrodynamics which capture the underlying anomaly and include dissipation. Attempts to develop such theories--even their dissipationless counterparts--have suffered from fundamental issues of acausality, instability, and ill-posedness of the initial value problem [2]. Following an effective field theory approach [3-7], we have constructed a first-order relativistic chiral hydrodynamic theory which is stable and causal within a range of values of transport coefficients. This is the first viscous theory of relativistic chiral hydrodynamics that can be used in numerical simulations of heavy-ion collisions.

The STAR collaboration recently observed a large global spin alignment of $\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions using the data from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program (BES-I) [1]. This cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms but may be attributable to the influence of vector meson force fields. In this contribution, we present new measurement of $\rho^0$ global spin alignment as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality for Au+Au, Ru+Ru, and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We discuss the implications of our results for the search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect, as the global spin alignment of $\rho^0$ mesons can effectively influence the measurement of charge separation across the reaction plane. Additionally, we present new precision and differential measurements of $\phi$-meson global spin alignment as a function of $p_T$, centrality, and rapidity (y) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, using higher-statistics data from the BES-II program.

Chirality,parallel,QGP vortex rings as a new probe for jet-induced medium response and longitudinal dynamics,"Matioli Serenone, Willian",Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamics provides quantitative descriptions of various flow measurements in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting the strongly-coupled nature of the hot QCD matter. A ubiquitous phenomenon in fluid dynamics is the formation of vortex rings. In heavy-ion collisions, different conditions can give rise to toroidal vortex structure in the QGP medium, such as the medium's response to jet thermalization [1] and the early-stage longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collisions [2]. Considering these scenarios, in this talk, we will present a systematic study of how $\Lambda$ hyperon's polarization can probe these toroidal vortex structures in QGP. We define a ""ring observable"" in terms of the $\Lambda$ production plane polarization [2]. It represents a measure of the effects caused by the vorticity induced in the ring formation. By conducting event-by-event analysis with the state-of-the-art (3+1)D theoretical framework [3, 4], we demonstrate that this ring observable is a highly sensitive probe for thermalizing energy-momentum currents deposited from high-energy jets and for the early-time longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collision systems. An experimental indication of such ``smoke rings'' formed in the QGP would represent a significant advancement in studying the emergent phenomena of many-body QCD at multiple length scales.

Chirality,parallel,Hyperon Polarization in Heavy Ion Collisions from STAR,"Gou, Xingrui",Shandong University,Unknown,"The observation of hyperon polarization has revealed the existence of large vorticities in the medium created by heavy-ion collisions. Global polarization indicates vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to the system's orbital angular momentum. The difference of global polarization between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon can provide essential insights into the late-stage magnetic field sustained by the QGP.

With the high-statistics data collected by the STAR experiment for isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, we present the measurements of global polarization for $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, and $\Xi^{\pm}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azimuthal angle relative to the event plane. In addition, we present the correlation between the initial tilt of the system and the vorticity through the dependence of the $\Lambda$ global polarization and directed flow on the first-order flow vector ($q_1$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 19.6$ GeV.

The local polarization indicates vorticities along the beam direction due to anisotropic transverse expansion of the medium. We present the first measurements of $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon local polarization in isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 19.6, 27 GeV.  Comparisons with previous measurements in Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and LHC provide important insights into the collision system size and energy dependence of the vorticities. Furthermore, the local polarization measurements at lower beam energies can probe the predicted baryonic spin hall effect in a dense baryonic environment in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xingrui', 'last_name': 'Gou', 'fullName': 'Gou, Xingrui', 'id': '7979484', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'eddba9a89970f9b76f45c24a734b4da0', 'db_id': 7979484, 'person_id': 7792473}"

UPC,parallel,Exclusive $J/\psi$ Photoproduction and Entanglement-Enabled Spin Interference in Ultra-Peripheral Collisions at STAR,"Sheikh, Ashik Ikbal",Unknown,Unknown,"In ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs), exclusive vector meson photoproduction, e.g., $\rho^{0}$ and $J/\psi$, has been considered one of the most sensitive probes to the gluon structure in heavy nuclei. Recently, it was discovered that the linear polarization of the photons involved in these processes can enable measurements of the nuclear geometry through the so-called entanglement-enabled spin interference with the $\rho^{0}$ meson. However, the possibility that the interference can happen at the level of vector mesons cannot be falsified using $\rho^{0}$ data. The longer lifetime and non-localized wave function of $J/\psi$ at the time of its decay would not result in an interference pattern similar to the $\rho^0$ unless the entanglement occurs between the photon and the Pomeron phases emitted from each nucleus, providing an opportunity to study the source of the entanglement.

In this talk, we will report first measurements of the differential cross sections of photoproduced $J/\psi$ as functions of rapidity $y$ and $p^{2}_{T} \approx -t$ (up to $2.25~\rm{(GeV/c)^2}$) in Au+Au UPCs at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV recorded by STAR. The results will be presented for different combinations of neutron emission detected in zero degree calorimeters, which can be used to resolve the photon energy ambiguity. These data provide important constraints for nuclear parton distribution functions and sub-nucleonic shape fluctuations in heavy nuclei in the kinematic range $x_{\rm{parton}}\sim0.015-0.03$. We also present the first measurement of the interference pattern for those photoproduced  $J/\psi$. The observation of a positive $\cos(2\Delta \phi)$ modulation in the angular separation between the $J/\psi$ and one of its decay daughters is predicted to be a signature of entanglement between the photon and Pomeron phases.

UPC,parallel,Probing small-$x$ nuclear gluonic structure via coherent charmonium photoproduction in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at CMS,"Lin, Jiazhao",Rice University (US),USA,"Gluons are found to become increasingly dominant constituents of nuclear matter when being probed at higher energies or smaller Bjorken-$x$ values. This has led to the question of the ultimate fate of nuclear gluonic structure at extreme density. In ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions, the coherent heavy-flavor vector meson production via photon-nuclear interactions is of particular interest, since its cross section is sensitive to the nuclear gluon density. However, in symmetric UPCs, a two-way ambiguity in determining the photon-emitter and the target prevents the extraction of contributions involving high- and low-energy photon-nucleus interactions. This limitation, therefore, had so far reduced our capability to probe the extremely small-$x$ regime. In this talk, we will present the first measurement of coherent charmonium photoproduction, where the two-way ambiguity is solved by implementing a forward neutron tagging technique using UPC lead-lead collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at 5.02 TeV.

Light Flavor,parallel,$\Sigma^0$ reconstruction in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV with the HADES experiment,"Becker, Marten",Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen,Unknown,"In this contribution we will discuss the production of $\Sigma^0$ baryons in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV beam energy measured by HADES. Although, the High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES) at GSI was primarily designed to measure Di-Electrons, it also features a very rich program measuring hadronic probes in the region of moderate temperature and high-baryon density in the QCD phase diagram. Recently, the spectrometer was upgraded with a new RICH photon detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter. While the first allows for a strongly improved electron identification, the latter allows for photon measurements in HADES for the first time without involving the conversion process.

Those experimental upgrades allow for a clear reconstruction of the $\Sigma^0$ baryon in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV beam energy in the electromagnetic decay to Lambda and photon. This collision energy is right at threshold for Lambda production, however it's below for the Sigma0. In p+p collisions a rise of the $\Lambda/\Sigma^0$ ratio is measured, which, if also existent for A+A collisions, would have strong impact on the extraction of ($T,\mu_B$) values from thermal models as the $\Lambda/\Sigma^0$ is usually fixed following isospin symmetry. The analysis presented in this work allows for a $\Sigma^0$ signal with a significance of roughly 10 in the $\Lambda \gamma$ channel while no signal is observed in the $\Lambda e^{\pm}$ channel reconstructing conversion photons and, if existing, Dalitz decays. Full acceptance and efficiency studies allow for a fully corrected $\Sigma^0$ production yield, extracting a $(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)/\Sigma^0$ ratio. This value is compared to and used in thermal models applied to HADES data or GiBUU analyzing the influence of the NN threshold in Ag+Ag.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marten', 'last_name': 'Becker', 'fullName': 'Becker, Marten', 'id': '7887466', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '801b537ca6972741de65f52a94881830', 'db_id': 7887466, 'person_id': 7538454}"
Light Flavor,parallel,Cluster formation near midrapidity - can the mechanism be identified experimentally?,"Bratkovskaya, Elena","GSI, Darmstadt",Germany,"Authors: G. Coci, S. Glässel, V. Kireyeu, J. Aichelin, C. Blume, V. Kolesnikov, V. Voronyuk and E. Bratkovskaya


The formation of weakly bound clusters and hypernuclei in the hot and dense environment at midrapidity is one of the surprising phenomena observed experimentally in heavy-ion collisions from low SIS to ultra-relativistic LHC energies. This is also known as the `ice in a fire' puzzle. Three approaches have been advanced to describe the formation of clusters:  cluster formation during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interactions between nucleons  ('potential mechanism') and deuteron production by catalytic hadronic reactions ('kinetic mechanism') as well as by coalescence at  kinetic freeze-out. 

We present here results from PHQMD [1,2], a novel microscopic n-body transport model based on the QMD propagation of the baryonic degrees of freedom with density dependent 2-body potential interactions. The clusters, formed via 'potential' mechanism, are recognized by the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm  which is identifying bound clusters by correlations of baryons in coordinate space.
The PHQMD approach allows for studying in the same framework the two above mentioned mechanisms,  to investigate  how and when clusters are formed and finally for comparing the results with present data from GSI to RHIC energies. 

We report on our recent findings, in particular that:

- The clusters produced via coalescence and potential mechanisms are created after the fast hadrons are escaped from the reaction zone, i.e.  clusters remain in transverse direction closer to the center of the heavy-ion collision than free nucleons. Thus, since the 'fire' is not at the same place as the 'ice', cluster can survive which explains the ice in the fire puzzle. Our PHQMD results for deuteron production by potential mechanism agree quantitatively with results of UrQMD for coalescence deuterons, thus, this finding doesn't depend on the transport model involved.
            
- For the `kinetic' deuterons the PHQMD results agrees with those from SMASH - if one limits the catalytic hadronic reaction channels to those realized in SMASH, however, accounting for all isospin channels of the various $\pi NN\leftrightarrow \pi d$, $NNN\leftrightarrow N d$ reactions leads to an enhanced production of deuterons.
      
- On the other hand, we find that considering the quantum nature of the deuteron --  by taking into account  the finite size properties of the deuteron by means of an excluded volume in coordinate space and by the projection onto the deuteron wave function in momentum space -- reduces substantially the kinetic deuteron production in a dense medium as encountered in heavy-ion collisions. This makes the 'kinetic' mechanism sub-dominant compared to the deuteron formation by potential interactions between nucleons. 
 
- The sum of kinetic deuterons and that produced in by potential interactions reproduces well the experimental data from SIS to RHIC energies
      
- The coalescence deuterons and potential deuterons have only about 20\% of the nucleons in common. This leads to a different rapidity distribution and to a different $p_T$-distribution at low $p_T$. This difference can be used to identify experimentally the production mechanism which is realized in nature.

- Heavier clusters like $t$, $^3He$ and $^4He$ as well has hypernuclei are also well reproduced by the potential mechanism

Some of the presented result have been published in Refs. [3,4,5].

We find that the short path length corrections to final state radiative energy loss for light flavor hadrons predict nontrivial enhancement such that high multiplicity $R_{pA} > 1$, consistent with data. We further systematically check the consistency of the assumptions—such as collinearity, softness, and large formation time—made in the derivation of radiative energy loss, with the final numerical model. We find that the large formation time approximation breaks down at modest to high momenta $p_T \geq 30~\mathrm{GeV}$. Comparison to data at higher momenta thus requires a rederivation of GLV, DGLV, and short path length correction results; with the large formation time assumption relaxed. We also show that the usual elastic energy loss treatment vastly overpredicts the suppression in small systems; thus, small path length corrections to elastic energy loss are required for quantitative comparison to data in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cole', 'last_name': 'Faraday', 'fullName': 'Faraday, Cole', 'id': '7819112', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '9bee6c8b536a93abf5e931ee559443ce', 'db_id': 7819112, 'person_id': 7563161}"

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Simulating collectivity in dense baryon matter with multiple fluids,"Tomasik, Boris",Univerzita Mateja Bela (SK),Unknown,"We present a novel multi-fluid approach to simulate heavy-ion collisions in the region of RHIC Beam Energy Scan and FAIR experiments. This region of collision energies from few to few tens of GeV is particularly interesting for the exploration of dense baryon matter and search of the critical point of QCD. However, fluid-dynamical modelling here poses notable challenges. Contraction of the incoming nuclei is much weaker, which results in a long inter-penetration phase and a complex initial-state geometry. Conventional hydrodynamic models, where the fluid phase starts at a fixed proper time τ0, therefore miss the compression stage of the collision. Hence, they miss the key sensitivity to the EoS of the dense medium.
In our approach [1], we circumvent this issue by representing the incoming nuclei as two cold, baryon-rich fluids with appropriate energy and baryon densities. The newly produced matter is represented by a third baryon-free fluid, which is generated by the friction between the two colliding fluids. Our MUlti Fluid simulation for Fast IoN collisions (MUFFIN) model is implemented from scratch using a versatile 3+1 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. We present benchmark calculations for Au-Au collisions at different RHIC BES energies and discuss the challenges in constructing the approach.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions*,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,Unknown,"Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions do not become reliable until $O(1)$ fm/$c$ after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration of a multi-stage dynamical evolution model built around a VAH fluid dynamic core with experimental data for $p_T$-integrated observables from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of constraining the specific viscosities of the QGP at higher temperatures than other previously used models [1]. We also find that the model has fewer tensions with the $p_T$-integrated input data than the previously calibrated JETSCAPE SIMS model [2]. Finally, we use the calibrated VAH and JETSCAPE SIMS models, with the four different particlization models studied in [2], to predict a number of $p_T$- *differential* observables, including $p_T$-spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_{2,3,4}\{2\}(p_T)$ for several identified hadron hadron species. We find [3] that the $p_T$-dependence of the anisotropic flow coefficients is *very sensitive* to the choice of particlization model, and that the VAH predictions agree with available data much better than all available calibrated variants of the JETSCAPE SIMS model. We therefore propose the VAH approach as a superior framework for describing the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,First-Order Event Plane Correlated Directed and Triangular Flow in BES-II Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Liu, Xiaoyu",Rice University,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, the measurements of anisotropic flow coefficient ($v_n$) offer insights into collective hydrodynamic expansion and transport properties of the produced medium at higher collision energies, while they are sensitive to the compressibility of the nuclear matter and nuclear equation of state at lower collision energies. The second phase of the Beam Energy Scan program (BES-II) was carried out at RHIC to focus on the most crucial energy range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =7.7$ GeV to $27$ GeV in collider mode and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV to $7.7$ GeV in fixed-target mode, providing an ideal lever-arm to explore $v_n$. For such energies, the STAR BES-II upgrades enable us to measure $v_n$ in a wide pseudorapidity ($\eta$) range with high precision.

Directed flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles and nuclear fragments in heavy-ion collisions, and it is sensitive to early non-equilibrium dynamics. The measurement of $v_1$ in a wide $\eta$ range allows us to test the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation and provides insights into the baryon-stopping mechanism. On the other hand, triangular flow ($v_3$) in nuclear collisions is often mentioned as being developed from event-by-event geometrical fluctuations in the participant region which has no correlation to the first-order event plane ($\Psi_{1}$). However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and $\Psi_1$.

In this contribution, we will show the measurement of charged particle $v_1$ over six units of $\eta$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ and $19.6$ GeV and compare with transport and hydrodynamic model calculations. We will also show the results of $v_3$ in fixed-target mode for identified hadrons and light nuclei with respect to $\Psi_1$, comparing with theoretical models to identify the source of nonzero $v_3\{\Psi_1\}$ and to demonstrate its vital connection to the equation of state.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaoyu', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Xiaoyu', 'id': '7909002', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'abd75cf11050470993789907feb6e43b', 'db_id': 7909002, 'person_id': 7548558}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Chasing the onset of QCD thermalisation with ALICE,"Ciacco, Mario",Politecnico di Torino and INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"Deciphering the process of hadronization has long been a formidable challenge, in part due to its non-perturbative nature. Over the years, various phenomenological models have emerged, all attempting to unravel the complexity of hadron production. Despite their different theoretical foundations, many of these models successfully account for the average yield of hadrons. This has spurred the scientific community to search for innovative observables capable of discerning the fundamental principles governing these models. In pursuit of this goal, the ALICE Collaboration has studied an extensive array of event-by-event Pearson correlations between hadrons with distinct quantum numbers. Conducting a system size scan of these measurements unveils a powerful means to identify and analyze emerging QCD phenomena in small collision systems. In this presentation, ALICE will show the latest findings on antiproton--antideuteron and net-kaon--net-Xi correlations in various collision systems (pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb). These observables offer the advantage of being unaffected by resonance or weak decays. The measurements will be compared to various hadronization models, delving into the intriguing topic of the onset of thermalization in QCD matter.

Thus, particles from different rapidity slices will have flow vectors that differ in magnitude and orientation due to the longitudinal variation, longitudinal decorrelation, which grows with increasing particle rapidity separation. For flow harmonic $n$, such longitudinal decorrelations have been characterized, for large systems, in terms of $r_n$, the ratio of large-rapidity-gap to small-rapidity-gap correlations. This analysis performs the first measurements of $r_n$ in $pp$ collisions at 5~TeV and 13~TeV. The analysis is carried out via a two-particle correlation method, utilizing charged tracks of varying $\eta$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ and topo-clusters of $4.0<|\eta_\mathrm{ref}|<4.9$. Because non-flow effects are more significant in $pp$ collisions, non-flow template subtraction procedures are applied. Final results are quoted for $r_2$ and its slope $F_2$, over a range of multiplicities. Similar non-flow subtraction techniques are applied to the full multiplicity range of Xe+Xe collision data and the results are compared to the two $pp$ energies at appropriate multiplicities. This gives some of the first detailed information on the correlation between longitudinal and transverse energy deposition in $pp$ collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Blair Daniel', 'last_name': 'Seidlitz', 'fullName': 'Seidlitz, Blair Daniel', 'id': '7908987', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '90fc7ffff90066b7c1bcf7b0841a4653', 'db_id': 7908987, 'person_id': 7555439}"
