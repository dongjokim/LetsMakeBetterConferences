Small Systems,parallel,Pinning down the origin of collectivity in small systems with ALICE (remote),"Zhao, Mingrui",China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN),China,"While the formation of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions has been confirmed by characteristic patterns of flow measurements, it remains unclear what is the smallest possible collision system that can generate a similar medium exhibiting partonic collectivity. In this talk, we will present the new preliminary results of anisotropic flow in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions that, for the first time, encompass all the data collected by ALICE. The highlights include the flow of charged and identified particles ($\pi^{\pm}$, K$^{\pm}$, p ($\overline{\rm {p}}$), K$^0_S$, $\Lambda$ ($\overline \Lambda$), $\varphi$), correlations and fluctuations of flow vectors and correlations between the mean transverse momentum and flow coefficients, $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$. Multiparticle cumulants with the subevent method, ultra-long-range azimuthal correlations with the template fit method, and a novel jet veto approach have been implemented to effectively suppress short-range non-flow contamination.  We compare our results to state-of-the-art theoretical models, which will allow us to study contributions from initial momentum anisotropies to final anisotropic flow, and to understand how anisotropic flow in small collision systems developed from the initial geometry through the dynamic evolution including the understanding of the role of mass and constituent-quark numbers.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mingrui', 'last_name': 'Zhao', 'fullName': 'Zhao, Mingrui', 'id': '7976916', 'affiliation': 'China Institute of Atomic Energy (CN)', 'emailHash': '474c000b999310db901e6c96af4864f0', 'db_id': 7976916, 'person_id': 7681659}"
Initial State,parallel,Pursuing the Precision Study for Color Glass Condensate in Forward Hadron Productions,"Shi, Yu",Shandong University,Unknown,"With the tremendous accomplishments of RHIC and the LHC experiments and the advent of the future electron-ion collider on the horizon, the quest for compelling evidence of the color glass condensate (CGC) has become one of the most aspiring goals in the high energy quantum chromodynamics research. Pursuing this question requires developing the precision test of the CGC formalism. By systematically implementing the threshold resummation, we significantly improve the stability of the next-to-leading-order calculation in CGC for forward rapidity hadron productions in pp and pA collisions, especially in the high pT region, and obtain reliable descriptions of all existing data measured at RHIC and the LHC across all pT regions. Consequently, this technique can pave the way for the precision studies of the CGC next-to-leading-order predictions by confronting them with a large amount of precise data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'Shi', 'fullName': 'Shi, Yu', 'id': '7819031', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University', 'emailHash': '3e879828623ce53a7632aed8b8718ec2', 'db_id': 7819031, 'person_id': 7551724}"
Jets,parallel,Jet-flow coupling in heavy-ion collisions and the jet-induced diffusion wake,"Yang, Zhong",CCNU,Unknown,"Diffusion wake accompanying jet-induced Mach-cone is a unique feature of jet-medium interaction in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We explore the 3D structure of the diffusion wake induced by triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy within the coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model. We identify a valley structure caused by the diffusion wake on top of a ridge from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) in jet-hadron correlation as a function of rapidity and azimuthal angle. This leads to a double-peak structure in the rapidity distribution of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the jets as an unambiguous signal of the diffusion wake. The interaction between the jet and QGP fluid will also deflect partons  associated with the jet from their initial direction. Such deflection depends on the energy of the jet constitutes and the velocity of the flow, leading to an angular intra-jet asymmetry of particle distribution inside the jet. We also study the intra-jet asymmetry and its dependence on jet path length and fluid viscosity in both transverse and longitudinal directions. Our methods can be further used to localize the initial production position of the jet without specified requirements of the jet direction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhong', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Zhong', 'id': '8015988', 'affiliation': 'CCNU', 'emailHash': '19367007456f1b280bacec249ba089a2', 'db_id': 8015988, 'person_id': 7541117}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Quarkonia as probes of initial and final states in small systems with ALICE (remote),"Choudhury, Subikash",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"Measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions, so-called small systems, besides serving as baseline for studying vacuum production and cold-nuclear matter effects, respectively, have recently shown intriguing features. In particular, measurements in high-multiplicity events have revealed striking similarities with heavy-ion collisions, where the formation of a quark-gluon plasma is expected. One of the possible scenarios proposed for describing these findings, which include among others collective effects, is the presence of multiple parton-parton interactions (MPIs). At LHC energies, MPIs affect both the soft component of the event, as well as the hard scales responsible for heavy-quark production. Quarkonium associated production, such as double J/$\psi$ production in the same event, provides a direct way to study MPIs. Conversely, quarkonium measurements which correlate soft and hard components of the event, such as multiplicity dependent production or azimuthal correlations between quarkonia and hadrons produced in the same event, represent an indirect method to investigate MPIs. In addition, these studies can reveal any other potential underlying mechanisms taking place in the final state, such as possible dissociation effects for loosely bound excited quarkonia. In case of charmonia, the corresponding measurements for the non-prompt component, originating from beauty hadron decays, allows for extending such correlations studies to the open beauty hadron sector.

In this talk, new published measurements of double J/$\psi$ production at forward rapidity, as well as new preliminary multiplicity dependent measurements of non-prompt J/$\psi$ fractions at midrapidity, in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, will be shown. Recent multiplicity dependent measurements of $\psi$(2S) and $\Upsilon$($n$S) states ($n$ = 1,2,3), along with excited-to-ground state ratios,  carried out at forward rapidity in pp and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV, will be presented. Furthermore, recently published prompt and non-prompt J/$\psi$ production at midrapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16, will be discussed. The status of ongoing analyses on J/$\psi$ production as a function of multiplicity or spherocity at central and forward rapidity, in pp and p--Pb collisions, will also be shown. Results will be compared to available model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Subikash', 'last_name': 'Choudhury', 'fullName': 'Choudhury, Subikash', 'id': '7974507', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': 'b1023c994193c053c3a60e4089566e5a', 'db_id': 7974507, 'person_id': 7681795}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Modification of heavy quark hadronization in high multiplicity collisions at LHCb (remote),"Gu, Chenxi",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),Unknown,"The differences in hadron chemistry observed at e+e- machines versus hadron
colliders may indicate that the mechanisms by which partons evolve into visi-
ble matter are not universal. In particular, the presence of many other quarks
produced in the underlying event may affect the hadronization process. With
full particle ID, precision vertexing, and a high rate DAQ, the LHCb detector
is uniquely well suited to study the hadronization of heavy quarks. This con-
tribution will present LHCb data on hadronization of heavy charm and bottom
quarks, including the first results on the b baryon-to-meson production ratio

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Elliptic and triangular flow of light (anti-)nuclei in Au+Au collisions in the BES-II energies using the STAR detector (remote),"Sharma, Rishabh ",Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati,Unknown,"The formation of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions can be explained by two models: the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model proposes that light nuclei originate from a thermal source where they are in equilibrium with other particles in the fireball. However, due to their low binding energies, the formed nuclei are unlikely to survive the high-temperature conditions of the fireball. In contrast, the coalescence model suggests that light nuclei are formed later in time by the coalescence of protons and neutrons near the kinetic freeze-out surface. The final-stage coalescence of nucleons would lead to the mass number scaling, where the anisotropic flow of light nuclei scaled by their mass numbers follows closely the anisotropic flow of nucleons. Therefore, comparing the anisotropic flow of light nuclei with protons will help us experimentally test the coalescence model hypothesis. Moreover, compared to elliptic flow ($v_2$), triangular flow ($v_3$) of light nuclei has a better sensitivity to the fluctuating initial conditions as well as the properties of the created systems. This information will provide us with  tighter constraints on the theoretical models that describe the production mechanism of light nuclei.

In this talk, we will present the transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality dependence of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of $d$, $t$, and $^3$He, as well as their corresponding antinuclei, in Au+Au collisions at energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ -- 54.4 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan phase II (BES-II) program at RHIC-STAR. We will discuss the mass number scaling study of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of light nuclei in the BES-II energies. Additionally, we will compare the experimental results with model calculations that use specific initial conditions and/or nucleon coalescence.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rishabh ', 'last_name': 'Sharma', 'fullName': 'Sharma, Rishabh ', 'id': '7908960', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati', 'emailHash': '704dca1928ae543bebe94bd6ffb9b641', 'db_id': 7908960, 'person_id': 7695846}"
Light Flavor,parallel,Exploring the hadron gas phase of relativistic heavy-ion collisions with ALICE (remote),"Agrawal, Neelima","Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",Unknown,"Hadronic resonances have typical lifetimes that are comparable to that of the hadron gas phase created in the late stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. Therefore, a significant fraction of resonances decays inside a high-density medium and their decay daughters may rescatter with other hadrons destroying their initial kinematic correlations. A competing effect is resonance regeneration via pseudo-elastic interactions of hadrons. The interplay between these effects, which may modify the measured yields and transverse-momentum spectra of hadronic resonances, can be studied by measuring the yield ratio of resonances to the corresponding long-lived particle as a function of the hadronic lifetime, i.e. charged-particle multiplicity. In addition, measurements of the differential yields of resonances with different masses, quark content, and quantum numbers help in understanding particle production mechanisms, strangeness production, and parton energy loss.

In this presentation, recent measurements of hadronic resonances in Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions as a function of multiplicity will be presented. Collisions between Xe nuclei provide the ultimate test for validating the picture of the smooth evolution of hadronic rescattering across different collision systems by filling the gap between p--Pb and Pb--Pb multiplicities. Furthermore, the measured resonance yields in Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb collisions are used as an experimental input in a partial chemical equilibrium-based thermal model to constrain the kinetic freeze-out temperature. This is a novel procedure that is independent of assumptions on the flow velocity profile and the freeze-out hypersurface.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Neelima', 'last_name': 'Agrawal', 'fullName': 'Agrawal, Neelima', 'id': '7974647', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)', 'emailHash': '261aba0db2f0844d37d637cc045e06fc', 'db_id': 7974647, 'person_id': 7681778}"
Light Flavor,parallel,Particle production and collective flow measurements with CMS Run 3 PbPb data (remote),"Wang, Jing",CERN,Switzerland,"The pseudorapidity distributions and anisotropic flow coefficients of charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions are key observables that characterize the initial conditions and subsequent hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. Recent LHC Run 3 lead-lead (PbPb) data collected at a center-of-mass per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$~TeV allow the study of these effects at a record collision energy. We present the first measurements of the midrapidity charged particle $\mathrm{d}N/\mathrm{d}\eta$ as a function of collision centrality, as well as the Fourier harmonics, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$, with two- and four-particle correlations in PbPb collisions recorded at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.36$~TeV with the CMS experiment. Taken together, these measurements constrain models of the collision-energy and centrality-dependence of charged particle production, and also shed light on the initial collision geometry and importance of event-by-event fluctuations. These data are compared to similar measurements at different energies, including PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$ and xenon-xenon collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.44$~TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jing', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Jing', 'id': '7974631', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '84443556008b60ce45b46683f5c26d2b', 'db_id': 7974631, 'person_id': 7787712}"
Jets,parallel,Looking for the dead-cone in heavy-ion collisions with energy correlators (remote),"Moult, Ian James",Unknown,Unknown,"In this talk we use the recently introduced energy correlator framework for jet substructure in heavy-ion collisions to show how the radiation pattern of heavy quarks is modified by the presence of the QGP. We present an analytical calculation of the medium-modified 2-point energy correlator of a heavy quark jet determining how the dead-cone is populated by medium-induced radiation. We identify two regimes: the near-massless limit where the deadcone is not affected by the QGP, and the large-mass limit where the in-medium radiation begins to fill the deadcone. This study provides the first illustration of the ability of energy correlators to disentangle complicated competing jet dynamics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ian James', 'last_name': 'Moult', 'fullName': 'Moult, Ian James', 'id': '7819163', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '22f8a50c072dc2a0f43baed11a680c33', 'db_id': 7819163, 'person_id': 7558299}"
Jets,parallel,Revealing the medium-recoil effect with high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Z boson tagged underlying event distribution in PbPb collisions at CMS (remote),"Chou, Pin-Chun",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Extensive studies of dijet momentum balance, inclusive jet shapes, and photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions have revealed a significant contribution of low transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) particles to the energy momentum balance of dijet and photon-jets. Effects such as medium-induced radiation and medium response could contribute to the enhancement of low-$p_\mathrm{T}$ particles. In this presentation, we utilize the Z boson reconstructed within the dimuon channel, which does not interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) throughout the decay chain before interacting with the detector. Moreover, Z bosons are high precision probes, and their reconstruction does not introduce bias into the underlying event distribution near them, unlike the isolation requirement of photons. This feature enables the selection of a single quark-enriched high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ parton and study the modification of the underlying events associated with this probe. We present the first measurement of the Z boson-tagged underlying event spectra over a large acceptance with respect to the Z boson, using lead-lead data recorded by the CMS detector at 5.02 TeV. This new result can provide an unambiguous signal of the medium-recoil effect, and it could be sensitive to the equation of state and the speed of sound of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pin-Chun', 'last_name': 'Chou', 'fullName': 'Chou, Pin-Chun', 'id': '7974465', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '977c4bb20b7d72412e5ba0df4c0a8d81', 'db_id': 7974465, 'person_id': 7690216}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Probe parton propagation in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE heavy-flavour measurements (remote),"Singh, Ravindra",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are valuable probes for investigating the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are mainly produced through hard-scattering processes prior to the formation of the QGP, and their number is conserved during the subsequent QGP evolution. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ of charm and beauty hadrons allow the characterisation of the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks while traversing the QGP. Information on their diffusion and degree of participation in the medium collective motion can be obtained by measuring the elliptic-flow coefficient $v_2$ of heavy-flavour particles. Complementary insights into heavy-quark fragmentation and energy redistribution can be obtained by measuring angular correlations involving heavy-flavour particles.
In this contribution, the newly published results on the non-prompt $v_2$ coefficient of D$^0$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be shown and compared to measurements of prompt D-meson $v_2$ in the same system. These will be supplemented by recent results of the $v_2$ of heavy-flavour decay muons in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, providing new insights into possible collective effects in smaller systems. The recent final results of the heavy-flavour decay electron $R_{\rm AA}$ in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will also be reported, together with measurements of prompt and non-prompt D mesons and $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons. New Pb-Pb results of angular correlations of heavy-flavour decay electrons with charged particles in the same collision system will also be discussed. In view of a better understanding of the in-medium heavy-quark dynamics, the reported ALICE measurements will be compared to predictions from models including different implementations of heavy-quark interaction and hadronisation with the QGP constituents.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ravindra', 'last_name': 'Singh', 'fullName': 'Singh, Ravindra', 'id': '7974412', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': 'b9c0a45b25a0222a5b1f703a1d18775a', 'db_id': 7974412, 'person_id': 7681809}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Recent charmonium measurements in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE (remote),"Bai, Xiaozhi",University of Science and Technology of China (USTC),Unknown,"Charmonia have long been recognized as a valuable probe of the nuclear matter in extreme conditions, such as the strongly interacting medium created in heavy-ion collisions and known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP). At LHC energies, the regeneration process due to the abundantly produced charm quarks, was found to considerably affect measured charmonium observables. Comprehensive production measurements of charmonia, including both ground and excited states, are crucial to discriminate among different regeneration scenarios assumed in theoretical calculations. Charmonia can also be sensitive to the initial state of the heavy-ion collision. In particular, their spin-alignment can be affected by the strong magnetic field generated in the early phase, as well as by the large angular momentum of the medium in non-central collisions. The determination of the component originating from beauty hadron decays, known as non-prompt charmonium, grants a direct insight into the nuclear modification factor of beauty hadrons, which is expected to be sensitive to the energy loss experienced by the ancestor beauty quarks inside the QGP. Furthermore, once it is subtracted from the inclusive charmonium production, it allows for a direct comparison with prompt charmonium models. 

In this contribution, newly published results of inclusive J/$\psi$ production, including yields, average transverse momentum and nuclear modification factors, obtained at central and forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, will be presented.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Bottom hadro-chemistry in $pp$ and PbPb collisions at the LHC (remote),"He, Min",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,Unknown,"The hadro-chemistry of bottom quarks produced in hadronic collisions encodes valuable information on the mechanism of color-neutralization in these reactions. We first compute the chemistry of bottom-hadrons in high-energy $pp$ collisions employing statistical hadronization with a largely augmented set of states beyond the currently measured spectrum. This enables a comprehensive prediction of fragmentation fractions of weakly decaying bottom hadrons for the first time and a satisfactory explanation of the existing measurements in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Utilizing the bottom hadro-chemistry thus obtained as the baseline, we then perform transport simulations of bottom quarks in the hot QCD matter created in PbPb collisions at the LHC energy and calculate the pertinent bottom-hadron observables. We highlight the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependent enhancement of the ratios (relative to their $pp$ counterparts) between different species of bottom hadrons ($\bar{B}_s^0/B^-$, $\Lambda_b^0/B^-$ and $\Xi_b^{0-}/B^-$) as a result of bottom quark diffusion and hadronization in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Anisotropic flow of identifed particles in Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 - 19.6 GeV (remote),"Liu, Zuowen",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Directed and elliptic flow ($v_{1}$, $v_{2}$) are sensitive to the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at the early stage of the system evolution and the equation of state (EoS) of the medium. The $v_1$ slope ($dv_1/dy$) at mid-rapidity of net-baryons is expected to be sensitive to the first-order phase transition. Also, triangular flow ($v_3$) provides valuable information on the initial geometry fluctuations and transport properties of the medium. Studying these flow harmonics for various identified particles at different energies provides insights into the medium going through QCD phase transition. In particular, (multi-) strange hadrons with small hadronic cross-sections are cleaner probes of the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. A comprehensive study of light and (multi-) strange hadrons provides valuable insights into the subsequent stages of the medium evolution.

In this talk, the measurements of $v_1$, $v_2$,  and $v_3$ for both light and (multi-) strange hadrons at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, 7.7, 9.2, 11.5, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, utilizing the enhanced capabilities of the STAR detectors and datasets with increased statistics from the second phase of the RHIC beam energy scan (BES-II) program, will be presented.

Critical Point,parallel,Spinodal enhancement of fluctuations in nucleus-nucleus collisions (remote),"Poberezhnyuk, Roman",Bogolubov Institute for Theoretical Physics,Unknown,"Subensemble Acceptance Method (SAM) [1,2] is an essential link between measured event-by-event fluctuations and their grand canonical theoretical predictions such as lattice QCD. The method allows quantifying the global conservation law effects in fluctuations. In its basic formulation, SAM requires a sufficiently large system such as created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions and sufficient space-momentum correlations. Directly in the spinodal region of the First Order Phase Transition (FOPT) different approximations should be used that account for finite size effects. Thus, we present the generalization of SAM applicable in both the pure phases, metastable and unstable regions of the phase diagram [3]. Obtained analytic formulas indicate the enhancement of fluctuations due to crossing the spinodal region of FOPT and are tested using molecular dynamics simulations. A rather good agreement is observed. Using transport model calculations with interaction potential we show that the spinodal enhancement of fluctuations survives till the later stages of collision via the memory effect [4]. However, at low collision energies the space-momentum correlation is not strong enough for this signal to be transferred to second and third order cumulants measured in momentum subspace.  This result agrees well with recent HADES data on proton number fluctuations at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.4$ GeV which are found to be consistent with the binomial baseline of non-interacting hadrons [5].  It indicates that the large fluctuations observed in HADES data do not signal the presence of phase transition and their origin is yet to be identified. We suggest a crosscheck of this picture based on calculating the correlation between proton multiplicities in two non-overlapping rapidity intervals.

Performing these measurements in intervals of charged particle multiplicities provides sensitivity to understand whether different hadronisation mechanisms are at play in small and large hadronic colliding systems.

In this contribution, ALICE will present a selection of the latest charm and beauty production measurements in proton-proton (pp) collisions, which can shed light on the modification of the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanisms. New published results of the production of all prompt charm ground states in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, which allowed us to measure the charm fragmentation fractions and the $\mathrm{c\bar{c}}$ production cross section at midrapidity, will be shown. The new final measurement of non-prompt $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^+$ baryons in the same collision system will be discussed to provide a quantitative comparison between the hadronisation properties of beauty and charm hadrons.  
New measurements of $\Xi_\mathrm{c}^{0,+}$ production as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, of $\Xi_\mathrm{c}^{0}$ production in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and the first measurement of $\Xi_\mathrm{c}^{0}$ production in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be also presented, shedding further light on the hadronisation of charm-strange baryons in different colliding systems.

New Theory,parallel,Sound of rigidly moving fluids: on linear waves in inhomogeneous equilibrium configurations (remote),"Shokri, Masoud","Goethe University, ITP",Unknown,"We propose a method to find local plane wave solutions to linearized equations of motion of relativistic hydrodynamics in inhomogeneous backgrounds, i.e., when fluid is rigidly moving with nonzero thermal vorticity in equilibrium. Our method is based on extending the conserved currents to the tangent bundle, using Wigner transforms. The Wigner-transformed conserved currents can then be Fourier transformed into the cotangent bundle to obtain the dispersion relations for space-time-dependent eigenfrequency. We show that the connection between the stability of hydrodynamics and the evolution of plane waves is not as straightforward as in the homogeneous case and is restricted to the equilibrium-preserving subspace of the cotangent bundle, which is determined by thermal vorticity. We apply this method to MIS theory and show that the interplay between the bulk viscous pressure and the shear stress tensor with acceleration and rotation leads to novel modes, as well as modifications of the already known ones.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Masoud', 'last_name': 'Shokri', 'fullName': 'Shokri, Masoud', 'id': '7818874', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University, ITP', 'emailHash': '9931bbf824507435f6505164e4926e46', 'db_id': 7818874, 'person_id': 7553313}"
Chirality,parallel,Search for anomalous chiral effects in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Wang, Chunzheng",Fudan University (CN),Unknown,"The interplay of the chiral anomaly and the strong magnetic or vortical field created in the off-central heavy-ion collisions can give rise to anomalous chiral effects in the quark--gluon plasma. These include the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), the Chiral Magnetic Wave (CMW) and the Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE). The study of these novel phenomena is of fundamental significance since they may reveal the topological structure of vacuum gauge fields, as well as the possible local violation of P and/or CP symmetries in strong interactions.

In this talk, we present comprehensive measurements of anomalous chiral effects in Xe--Xe and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively, with ALICE. The CME is studied using the charge-dependent two- and three-particle correlators. The Event Shape Engineering (ESE) technique, together with the Monte Carlo Glauber and T$_{\rm R}$ENTo simulations of the magnetic field are employed to derive an upper limit on the CME signal. The ESE technique is also adopted to quantitatively constrain the strength of the CMW signal, which is examined by the correlation between the charge asymmetry and the elliptic flow. The CVE is studied using several combinations of azimuthal correlations between baryon pairs at different kinematic windows, such as $\Lambda-p$, $\Lambda-\Lambda$ or $p-p$.

EM Probes,parallel,Direct photon production and correlations in Pb--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Arata, Carolina",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),Unknown,"Measurements of direct photons provide valuable information on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) because they are colour-neutral and created during all phases of the collision. Sources of photons include initial hard scatterings, Bremsstrahlung and the fragmentation process, jet-medium interactions, and radiation from the medium. 

Direct thermal photons, produced by the plasma, are sensitive to the collective flow at photon production time. Their exponential spectral shape gives access experimentally to an effective medium temperature.
Furthermore, Bose-Einstein correlations can be used to study the space-time evolution of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions with Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry. The correlation function is sensitive to the source size and the direct photon fraction.

Direct prompt photons produced in hadronic collisions through annihilation and Compton processes have minimal event activity from the hard process, allowing the isolation method to suppress background photons from parton fragmentation and neutral meson electromagnetic decays. 
Isolated photon measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can constrain NLO pQCD predictions. Hadrons correlated with isolated photons are a promising channel to study the energy loss in heavy-ion collisions and to constrain the $Q^{2}$ of the initial hard scattering, obtaining information on the amount of energy lost by the parton recoiling off the photon. 

The ALICE experiment reconstructs photons from conversion photons using its excellent tracking capabilities and directly in calorimeters. Combining these methods, ALICE can measure direct photons at mid-rapidity with transverse momentum from 0.4 GeV/$c$, where direct thermal photons should dominate until few GeV, then direct prompt photons take over and can be measured until about 100 GeV/$c$.

Jets,parallel,Unveiling the Interplay of Multi-Partonic Structures and Strongly-Interacting Media via R-dependent Jet Modifications in Heavy-Ion Collisions (remote),"Mehtar-Tani, Yacine",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Jets provide a powerful tool to study the properties of hot nuclear matter and its effect on quantum processes. The degree of modification of jets by the medium depends on how well the medium can resolve the internal jet structure. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the multi-partonic structure of jets and their interaction with a strongly-interacting medium. Specifically, we focus on the R-dependence of the jet $v_2$ coefficients as a function of collision centrality, which provides a unique handle on coherence physics.
Using resummed quenching weights that incorporate both elastic and state-of-the-art radiative energy loss and embedding the system into a realistic heavy-ion environment, we compute the R-dependence of jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC. We observe a very mild R-dependence at RHIC kinematics, similar to what was found at the LHC. Our predictions are in excellent agreement with existing experimental data.
Finally, we present results for the jet azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ as a function of R, which shows a sequential collapse of $v_2$ for moderate R jets towards the result for small R=0.1 as centrality is decreased. This behavior is due to the strong dependence of the decoherence angle $\theta_c$ on the in-medium traversed length, which affects the size of the resolved phase-space over which quenching weights are resummed. Our results highlight the sensitivity of $v_2(R)$ to the typical value of $\theta_c$ at a given centrality.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yacine', 'last_name': 'Mehtar-Tani', 'fullName': 'Mehtar-Tani, Yacine', 'id': '7819203', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': 'ccfab5687e96802d8cffe3401603ec08', 'db_id': 7819203, 'person_id': 7533614}"
Jets,parallel,Enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios around jets as a signature of medium response (remote),"Qin, Guang-You",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We present a unique signal of jet-induced medium excitations: the enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios around the quenched jets [1]. To illustrate this, we study jet-particle correlations and the distributions of jet-induced identified particles with respect to the jet direction in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC via a multi-phase transport model. We find a strong enhancement of baryon-to-meson ratios for associated particles at intermediate transverse momentum around the triggered jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions, due to the coalescence of jet-excited medium partons. Since the lost energy from jets can diffuse to large angles, such baryon-to-meson-ratio enhancement is more pronounced for larger relative distance from the jet axis. We argue that the experimental confirmation of the enhancement of jet-induced baryon-to-meson ratios around the jets will provide an unambiguous evidence for the medium response to jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

In this talk, we will present the first results on the energy dependence of directed flow $v_1$ of light and hyper-nuclei (p, d, $^3$He, and $\Lambda$, $^3_\Lambda$H, $^4_\Lambda$H) in mid-central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 3.0, 3.2, 3.5, and 3.9 GeV, along with new results on elliptic flow $v_2$ for light nuclei. All data have been collected by the STAR experiment in the fixed-target mode during the second phase of the RHIC beam energy scan program. The directed flow of hypernuclei shows a similar collision energy and mass dependence to light nuclei, as seen in the slope of $v_1$ at mid-rapidity $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$. This suggests that the two types of nuclei are formed in a similar way. We also observe that the slope $dv_1/dy|_{y=0}$ decreases with increasing energy, with a stronger energy dependence for heavier nuclei. For light nuclei, the elliptic flow results indicate an out-of-plane expansion ($v_2 < 0$) at the lowest collision energy, whereas in-plane expansions ($v_2 > 0$) are evident at all other collision energies.

We will discuss these new results within the framework of a hadronic transport model in combination with coalescence after-burner calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chengdong', 'last_name': 'Han', 'fullName': 'Han, Chengdong', 'id': '7909004', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '642603b391184e9594436ba51523b404', 'db_id': 7909004, 'person_id': 7560208}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,"Local and global polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons across RHIC-BES energies: The roles of spin hall effect, initial condition, and baryon diffusion (remote)","Wu, Xiang-Yu",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We perform a systematic study on the local and global spin polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at beam energy scan energies via the (3+1)-dimensional CLVisc hydrodynamics model with AMPT and SMASH initial conditions. Following the quantum kinetic theory, we decompose the polarization vector as the parts induced by thermal vorticity, shear tensor and the spin Hall effect (SHE). We find that the polarization induced by SHE and the total polarization strongly depends on the initial conditions.  At $7.7$GeV, SHE gives a sizeable contribution and even flips the sign of the local polarization along the beam direction for AMPT initial condition, which is not observed for SMASH initial condition. Meanwhile, the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction induced by SHE with AMPT initial condition does not always increase with decreasing collision energies. Next, we find that the polarization along the beam direction is sensitive to the baryon diffusion coefficient, but the local polarization along the out-of-plane direction is not.  Our results for the global polarization of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ agree well with the STAR data. Interestingly, the global polarization of $\overline{\Lambda}$ is not always larger than that of $\Lambda$ due to various competing effects.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Beam energy dependence of heavy flavor production in Au+Au collisions at STAR,"Wang, Yan",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Quarkonia and open heavy-flavor hadrons are important probes to study the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are primarily generated at initial hard platonic scatterings and undergo the whole QGP evolution. Therefore, they are excellent probes of the QGP properties.Production of quarkonia depends on the dissociation and regeneration processes in the QGP, and also on the cold nuclear matter effect. To disentangle these effects and infer QGP properties, it is important to carry out differential precision measurements for various quarkonium states at different collision energies and system sizes. The STAR experiment offers opportunity to study the energy and colliding system size dependence of heavy-flavor production through large statistics samples of isobaric collisions ($^{96}_{44}{\rm Ru}+^{96}_{44} \rm Ru$ and $^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}+^{96}_{40}{\rm Zr}$) at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, as well as Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 14.6, 19.6, 27 GeV and 54 GeV collected in the phase II of Beam Energy Scan program.

Centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the ratio of $\psi(2\rm{S})$ yield over that of $J/\psi$ will be shown. These results together with measurements of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ states yield suppression allow a comprehensive study of binding energy dependent modifications to the quarkonium production in the medium. $J/\psi$ polarization measurement provides a new angle for studying QGP properties and the $J/\psi$ production mechanism.

Initial State,parallel,Exploring electromagnetic field effects and constraining transport parameters of QGP using STAR BES II data,"DASH, ADITYA PRASAD",University of California Los Angeles,USA,"Constraining the initial strong electromagnetic field effects, three-dimensional structure of the initial state, and the transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) at different temperatures ($T$), and baryon chemical potentials ($\mu_B$) are critical objectives of the heavy-ion program at RHIC. The dominance of Faraday+Coulomb effect during the initial stages of non-central heavy ion collisions is predicted to result in a negative $\Delta v_1$, defined by the difference in rapidity-odd directed flow ($v_1$) between positively and negatively charged particles. With the large dataset accumulated in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) phase II of STAR, we probe the beam energy dependence of $\Delta v_{1}$  for charged pions, kaons, and protons as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum ($p_T$), and centrality at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6 - 7.7 GeV. Our results support the notion of stronger $\Delta v_{1}$ at lower collision energies, expected due to the longer lifetime of the electromagnetic field and shorter lifetime of the fireball and a stronger effect with increasing $p_T$.

The flow angular decorrelations ($r_n(\eta)$) are sensitive to the 3D initial state,  and new observables such as the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$ and flow-magnitude and flow angular correlations are sensitive to the  %the viscous attenuation in the final state  transport parameters of the evolution. We present new measurements of the beam energy dependence of higher-order flow-angular de-correlations $r_n(\eta)(n=2,3)$, the transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}(\Delta\eta, \Delta\varphi)$, higher-order flow-angular correlation $\langle\cos(a_{1}n_{1}\Psi_{n1}+\cdots+a_{k}n_{k}\Psi_{nk})\rangle$ and higher-order flow-magnitude correlations $SC(n,m)\{4\}$ and $SC(n,m)\{6\}$ for various event-shape and centrality selections of Au+Au collisions in different BES energies ( $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 - 11.5 GeV) at RHIC.

Photon-tagged jets, which correspond to a quark-enriched sample, can significantly reduce this potential selection bias and the effect coming from the change in the quark versus gluon fraction. They also allow for a selection on the degree of quenching. In this presentation, we show new photon-tagged jet results using proton-proton and lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV recorded with the CMS detector in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We present the decorrelation of jet axes calculated with energy-weighted and winner-take-all recombination schemes and compare the results between photon-tagged jets and inclusive jets.

Recently, strangeness enhancement has also been observed in small systems at the LHC, but the underlying physics is not yet fully understood. This motivates studies of strange hadron production in small systems at RHIC, where the energy density of system is expected to be smaller than that at the LHC and therefore a hot and deconfined medium is less likely to be created. Investigating the multiplicity dependence of strange hadron production in small systems can naturally connect to peripheral heavy-ion collisions, and contribute to understanding the role of event multiplicity in strange hadron production.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Temperature and Strong Magnetic Field Effects in Dense Matter,"Dexheimer, Veronica",Kent State Universtity,Unknown,"We study consistently the effects of magnetic field on hot and dense matter. In particular, we look for differences that arise due to assumptions that reproduce the conditions produced in particle collisions or astrophysical scenarios, such as in the core of fully evolved neutron stars. We assume the magnetic field to be either constant or follow a profile extracted from general relativity calculations of magnetars and make use of two realistic models that can consistently describe chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement to quark matter, the CMF and the PNJL models. We find that net isospin, strangeness, and weak chemical equilibrium with leptons can considerably change the effects of temperature and magnetic fields on particle content and deconfinement in dense matter. This could be important for detecting quark matter e.g. in neutron star mergers.

Moreover, we obtain the baryon charge transport coefficients, the bulk and shear viscosities as well as the drag force and Langevin diffusion coefficients associated with heavy quark jet propagation and the jet quenching parameter of light quarks in the baryon dense plasma, with a particular focus on the behavior of these observables on top of the critical endpoint and the line of first-order phase transitions predicted by the model [2].

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Microscopic encoding of macroscopic universality: How do the universal behaviors near the QCD transition arise from quarks and gluons?,"Petreczky, Peter",BNL,USA,"The core goal of heavy-ion collision experiments is to shed light on how the phases and properties of strong-interaction matter arise from the fundamental constituents and interactions of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  To this end, heavy-ion collision experiments are searching for universal signs of criticality in the QCD phase diagram by measuring various macroscopic quantities. When those signatures of criticality are observed the ultimate scientific question will still remain unanswered— how do these universal behaviors at the macroscale arise from the microscopic degrees of freedom, quarks and gluons? In this talk we will answer this question. 
 
Macroscopic properties of the strong interaction near its chiral phase transition exhibit scaling behaviors, which are the same as those observed close to the magnetic transition in a 3-dimensional classical spin system with $O(4)$ symmetry. We show the universal scaling properties of the chiral phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental constituents, the quarks. We first establish a connection between the cumulants of the chiral order parameter, i.e. the chiral condensate, and the correlations among the energy levels of quarks in the background of gluons, i.e. the eigenspectra of the massless QCD Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to generalizations of the Banks–Casher relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD calculations with varying light quark masses near the QCD chiral transition, we demonstrate the correlations among the infrared part of the Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling behaviors extend up to the physical values of the up and down quark masses. Our study reveals how the hidden scaling features at the microscale give rise to the macroscopic universal properties of QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peter', 'last_name': 'Petreczky', 'fullName': 'Petreczky, Peter', 'id': '7819071', 'affiliation': 'BNL', 'emailHash': '9e86ae285689f7141a31c6ea60f4bdfd', 'db_id': 7819071, 'person_id': 7410258}"

The two-particle correlation, which reveals valuable information about the space-time evolution of the particle-emitting source and final state interactions involving hyperons, is the primary observable of interest. The measurements of $\it p$-$\Lambda$ and $\it d$-$\Lambda$ correlations can shed light on the N-Y two body and the N-N-Y three body interactions, which are important to understand the inner structure and equation of state of neutron stars. Further, the measurement of $\it d$-$\Lambda$ correlations provides insight into the internal structure and binding energy of light hypernuclei.

In this talk, we present the precise measurement of $\it p$-$\Lambda$ correlation using high statics data and the first measurement of $\it d$-$\Lambda$ correlation with $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=$ 3 GeV Au+Au collisions from the fixed-target program at the STAR experiment. The correlation functions are analyzed within the Lednicky-Lyuboshitz formalism in order to characterize the emission source size, the scattering length, and the effective range of $\it p$-$\Lambda$ and $\it d$-$\Lambda$ interactions. The extracted parameters will be compared to those from other baryon correlations ($\it p$-$\it p$, $\it d$-$\it d$, $\Lambda$-$\Lambda$) and various effective theory model calculations.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Two-particle femtoscopy at the HADES experiment,"Grunwald, Mateusz",Warsaw Universty of Technology,Unknown,"Over the past decades, the properties of dense matter have been widely concerned in connection with hypernuclei and hyperons. Their existence inside neutron stars softens the Equation of State (EoS), consequently limiting their masses to be lower than two solar masses (known as the ""hyperon puzzle""). The limited number of experimental references in the region of high baryon chemical potential poses significant challenges for constructing an EoS. The matter under conditions similar to neutron star cores can be obtained with low-energy heavy-ion collisions. The strong interactions for hyperons and clusters can be studied with two-body systems, for example, nucleon-hyperon (e.g., $p-\Lambda$) or nucleon-cluster (e.g., $p-d$, $p-t$, or $p-{}^{3}He$) as their interaction is not fully understood. Studies of two-particle correlations with clusters enable one to search for ground state of  ${}^{4}Li$, or the excited state of ${}^{4}He$. Created hadrons and clusters carry information available after thermal freeze-out. Therefore, photons with a relatively long mean free path and being emitted through the whole system's evolution are considered for studying earlier collision stages. 

Femtoscopy is a technique of measuring two-particle correlations in momentum space, proven to be a powerful tool for determining parameters of interactions and lifetimes in heavy-ion physics. It allows for the investigation of collision-generated system's spacetime features, having a lifespan of $10^{-23}$ seconds and a lifetime of femtometers ($10^{-15}$ m). One can study the two-body interactions, geometry, and dynamics by conducting such measurements experimentally.

The analysis uses the HADES detector at GSI/FAIR (Germany). Using detectors included in the spectrometer (among others, electromagnetic calorimeters, capable of detecting neutral particles) combined with specially created software, a dedicated framework, and reconstruction algorithm, one can identify $\gamma$ particles, $\Lambda$ hyperons, and clusters. The $p-\Lambda$, $p-d$, $p-t$, $p-{}^{3}He$, and $\gamma-\gamma$ correlation functions will be presented for the first time.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mateusz', 'last_name': 'Grunwald', 'fullName': 'Grunwald, Mateusz', 'id': '7887467', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw Universty of Technology', 'emailHash': 'bbd3f3c69ad90c89eb9a91f90f0683cc', 'db_id': 7887467, 'person_id': 7543634}"

New Theory,parallel,Isotropization of a longitudinally expanding plasma with the 2PI effective action,"Hauksson, Sigtryggur",IPhT - CEA,Unknown,"A central question in heavy-ion collisions is how the initial far-from-equilibrium medium evolves and thermalizes. In this work we use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action for the first time to answer this question. This requires including the fast longitudinal expansion that characterizes heavy-ion collisions. Our framework, the 2PI effective action, is non-perturbative and derived directly from the underlying quantum-field theory. It encompasses existing descriptions of the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions, such as classical-statistical field theory and kinetic theory, in different limits, and therefore gives a unified, microscopic picture of the initial stages. In this talk we focus on \(\phi^4\) theory (which shares many features with QCD) in the 2PI framework truncated at three loops.  We calculate the evolution of energy density and pressure anisotropy, as well as the momentum distribution of quasiparticles in the medium and their thermal mass. This allows us to see for the first time the onset of isotropization in quantum field theory in a geometric setup relevant for heavy-ion collisions. We address open questions in the field that the 2PI effective action can answer rigorously, such as how strong classical fields become quasiparticles, the role of vacuum fluctuations and the dynamics of soft modes throughout the initial stages.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sigtryggur', 'last_name': 'Hauksson', 'fullName': 'Hauksson, Sigtryggur', 'id': '7819051', 'affiliation': 'IPhT - CEA', 'emailHash': '99f708067fe82a022b8e3fcf6c5172c4', 'db_id': 7819051, 'person_id': 7538458}"
New Theory,parallel,Charge-dependent anisotropic flow in relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic expansion,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"We have investigated the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, using relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD). For the description of time evolution of the ultraintense electromagnetic fields produced just after the collisions, construction of the relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (RRMHD) is indispensable 
We construct a relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) numerical simulation code for high-energy heavy-ion collisions as a first designed code in the Milne coordinates. Then we confirm that our code reproduces well the results of standard RRMHD tests in the Cartesian coordinates. Also, we verify the semi-analytic solutions of the accelerating longitudinal expansion of relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in a comparison with our numerical result.
Next, we apply our RRMHD code to analysis of the charge-dependent anisotropic flow in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We consider the optical Glauber model as an initial model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the solution of the Maxwell equations with source term of the charged particles in two colliding nuclei as initial electromagnetic fields. The RRMHD simulation is performed with these initial conditions in Au-Au and Cu-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV. We have calculated the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow $\Delta v_1$ and elliptic flow $\Delta v_2$ in both collisions based on electric charge distributions as a consequence of RRMHD. Our results show that the directed and elliptic flows are approximately proportional to the electrical conductivity of the medium in both collisions. In the highly resistive case, our results of the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow are consistent with STAR data in Au-Au collisions. Furthermore, in Cu-Au collisions, the charge-odd contribution to the directed flow has a non-zero value at η = 0 which is also proportional to electrical conductivity of the medium. We conclude that the charge-dependent anisotropic flow is a good probe to extract the electrical conductivity of the QGP medium in high-energy heavy-ion experiments.

We provide an in-depth microscopic understanding of this apparently anomalous macroscopic phenomenon in terms of the novel concept of *viscous cooling* and establish its thermodynamic consistency. We use Boltzmann's H-function to formulate 'maximum-entropy hydrodynamics', a far-off-equilibrium macroscopic theory that can describe both free-streaming and near-equilibrium regimes of quark-gluon plasma in a single framework. Unlike traditional hydrodynamic theories but conceptually similar to anisotropic hydrodynamics which it generalizes and with which we compare, this formulation incorporates contributions to all orders in shear and bulk inverse Reynolds numbers, allowing it to handle large dissipative fluxes that characterize the early evolution stage in heavy-ion collisions. By considering flow profiles relevant for nuclear collisions at very high energies, we demonstrate that 'maximum-entropy hydrodynamics' provides excellent agreement with underlying kinetic theory throughout the fluid's evolution, especially in out-of-equilibrium regimes where traditional hydrodynamics breaks down.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chandrodoy', 'last_name': 'Chattopadhyay', 'fullName': 'Chattopadhyay, Chandrodoy', 'id': '7818965', 'affiliation': 'North Carolina State University', 'emailHash': '815cbb2200fce9e6652d29a63da945c9', 'db_id': 7818965, 'person_id': 7540088}"
New Theory,parallel,Studying exotic hadrons in high energy nuclear collisions,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University,Unknown,"For heavy ion collisions in the TeV beam energy region, the large number of initial hard scatterings create a richly ""doped"" hot quark-gluon plasma containing many charm quarks/anti-quarks, thus providing a uniquely ""charming"" environment for the massive production of heavy flavor exotic hadrons such as the $\chi_{c1}$ (also known as X(3872)), X(6900) and Tcc states. While such exotic states have been studied for decades in hadron physics, many questions about their basic properties and intrinsic structures (e.g. large hadron molecules versus compact tetraquarks) are not understood. High energy nuclear collisions show promise as a new test ground that has the potential to help resolve some of these challenges, with fresh experimental data from LHCb and CMS indicating nontrivial partonic medium effects on their production. As an example to demonstrate such opportunity, we report recent calculations of the yield of $\chi_{c1}$ state based on two popular models of its possible configurations: a loose hadronic molecule or a compact tetraquark. It turns out that the two different structures have rather different sensitivity to the fireball volume in heavy ion collisions. By scanning centrality and thus systematically tuning the fireball volume, our dynamical simulations have indeed found about 2-order-of-magnitude difference in the $\chi_{c1}$ yield and a markedly different centrality dependence between hadronic molecules and compact tetraquarks. This offers a novel approach for using fireball size as a “yardstick”  to calibrate the size of exotic hadrons and thus distinguishing the two scenarios. Lastly, the talk will discuss the ongoing progress in the recently formed ExoHad Topical Collaboration to integrate hadronic physics inputs with medium environment and examine exotic hadron properties both in quark-gluon phase and in hot hadron gas, which would be crucial for a successful program of studying their production in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jinfeng', 'last_name': 'Liao', 'fullName': 'Liao, Jinfeng', 'id': '7819120', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '83f6cd04fabc597b1565a1290a8015ab', 'db_id': 7819120, 'person_id': 7540278}"

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Quarkonium transport in weakly and strongly coupled plasmas,"Scheihing Hitschfeld, Bruno Sebastian",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Suppression of open heavy flavors and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions is among the most informative probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. Only in the past few years, systematic theoretical studies of quarkonium time evolution in the QGP have been carried out in the regime where the temperature of the QGP is much smaller than the inverse of quarkonium size.

Such calculations require the evaluation of a gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is similar to, but different from, the correlation used to define the well-known [1] heavy quark diffusion coefficient. In this talk, we will describe its calculation at weak coupling in QCD up to next-to-leading order [2] and at strong coupling in N=4 Yang-Mills theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence [3]. While it resembles the open heavy quark case, it has some crucial differences that highlight the relevance of quantum color correlations. Crucial insights are obtained by studying them in temporal axial gauge, where these correlators would naively be equal [4]. Furthermore, we will discuss the necessary setup to evaluate the quarkonium transport coefficients from lattice QCD, which, at present, is the only tool we have to study QCD in the non-perturbative regime. Finally, we will discuss the phenomenological implications that can be extracted from this correlator, with emphasis on the implications of the novel N=4 SYM results at strong coupling.

The variety of binding energies within the charmonium and bottomonium families offers an experimental tool to characterize the phenomena at play. Moreover, measuring the excited states is crucial as they represent significant feed-down contributions to the production of the ground states in proton-proton collisions and must be accounted for in the interpretation of proton-nucleus data.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Heavy-flavor jet substructure for probing the flavour dependences of QCD parton showers with ALICE,"Zardoshti, Nima",CERN,Switzerland,"Properties of partonic fragmentation in QCD depend on parton flavours in $1\rightarrow2$ splitting processes in parton showers due to the different Casimir factors of quarks and gluons, and to the different masses of light- and heavy-flavour quarks. Heavy-flavour jets provide a unique experimental tool to probe these flavour dependencies, particularly at low and intermediate transverse momenta where mass effects are significant. The ALICE detector has excellent particle tracking and PID performance to tag jets with reconstructed heavy-flavour hadrons. These capabilities are essential for jet substructure studies as they remove significant contamination from heavy-flavour hadron decay products and allows us to trace the quark flavour through the splitting tree. We report a series of heavy-flavour jet substructure measurements tagged with a reconstructed $\rm{D}^{0}$ meson. These include first measurements of the jet axes differences between different recombination and grooming schemes and the jet angularities where the angular exponent can tune the sensitivity to mass and Casimir effects.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Measurements of prompt and nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ mesons production and collective flow with CMS at 5.02 TeV,"Stojanovic, Milan",Purdue University (US),USA,"The interaction of heavy quarks with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) affects their azimuthal distribution and transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) spectrum, hence azimuthal anisotropy coefficients ($v_{n}$) and nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) of heavy flavor hadrons are important probes of the QGP. However, a simultaneous modeling of $v_{n}$ and $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is still challenging. This talk reports the first nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ measurements of the azimuthal anisotropy elliptic ($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) coefficients in large systems, using lead-lead (PbPb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}} = 5.02$~TeV, collected with the CMS apparatus. The measurements are performed as a function of transverse momentum, spanning 1--30 GeV/c, in three centrality classes, from central to midcentral collisions. Compared to the prompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ results, the nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ $v_{2}$ flow coefficients are systematically lower and show less dependence on particle $p_\mathrm{T}$ and centrality. An indication of nonzero $v_{3}$ coefficient of the nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ is observed. The wide $p_\mathrm{T}$ range enables the study of various flow generation mechanisms, like diffusion at low $p_\mathrm{T}$ and path-dependent parton energy loss at low and high $p_\mathrm{T}$, respectively. In addition, measurements of both prompt and nonprompt $\mathrm{D}^{0}$ mesons cross sections in PbPb and proton-proton collisions, as well as $R_\mathrm{AA}$, will be shown.

In this work, we implement BSQ charge dynamics in a fully integrated framework. We propagate these conserved charges within an upgraded version of the hydrodynamic model, v-USPhydro, that conserves the BSQ charge densities exactly.

In particular we compute the specific heat, speed of sound, compressibility, and the thermal expansion coefficient along lines of constant $s/n_B$. We also present results at zero chemical potential for the isothermal speed of sound and isothermal compressibility. We show that in the vicinity of the crossover temperature, the speed of sound at fixed $s/n_B$ has a well localized minimum or ""soft point"" at large $s/n_B$, which  appears to vanish as $s/n_B$ decreases. We show that this is consistent with hadron resonance gas model calculations at low temperature and reflects the increasing importance of the baryon sector at low temperature. A similar behavior is found for the isothermal speed of sound, which decreases monotonically at low temperature for all $s/n_B$. Furthermore, we show that in the entire range of $s/n_B$ relevant for the beam energy scan at RHIC, the specific heat, compressibility, and thermal expansion coefficient show no indication for an approach to critical behavior that one would expect close to a possibly existing critical endpoint.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'David', 'last_name': 'Clarke', 'fullName': 'Clarke, David', 'id': '7818815', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '3e6e1fd7aec5118ed4739fd668386b95', 'db_id': 7818815, 'person_id': 7541748}"

With this input, we employ the JIMWLK evolution for the proton and nucleus geometry from HERA to LHC energies. We then do the hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the various hydrodynamic observables obtained using this setup with evolved geometry parameters with full JIMWLK evolution.

Further more, the JIMWLK evolution doesn’t wash out this effects. We systematically study the deformations effects of Uranium (U), Gold (Au), Oxygen-16 ($^{16}O$), and Neon ($^{20}Ne$) on the diffractive $J/\Psi$ productions.

Out of the latter two quantities, an effective baryon (net quark) chemical potential is defined, which equals the baryon chemical potential after thermal equilibration. We then study thermalization and the production of three flavors of massless quarks in spatially homogeneous systems initially filled only with gluons. A complete parametric understanding for thermalization and quark production is obtained for both initially very dense or dilute systems, which are confirmed by detailed numerical simulations.

Initial State,parallel,Search for evidence of the baryon junction in photonuclear processes and heavy-ion collisions at STAR,"Tsang, Chun Yuen",Kent State University,Unknown,"Baryon number is a strictly conserved quantity in QCD and is conventionally assumed to be divided equally among the three valence quarks in baryonic matter.  An alternative model is the baryon junction: a Y-shaped configuration of nonperturbative gluons that is connected to all three valence quarks and carries the baryon number.  Neither of these theories has been experimentally verified.  Because valence quarks carry the baryon's electric charge, we can test if they also carry the baryon number by comparing baryon stopping to charge stopping. This is done to high precision using the STAR isobar dataset of ${}^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru} + {}^{96}_{44}\rm{Ru}$ and ${}^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr} + {}^{96}_{40}\rm{Zr}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\rm{GeV}$.  Results show that at mid-rapidity the ratio of the net-baryon yield, $B$, to the difference in net-charge yield, $\Delta Q = Q(\rm{Ru}) - \textit{Q}(\rm{Zr})$, is roughly twice as large in central collisions  as would be expected if the valence quarks carry the baryon number.  Another observable that is sensitive to the carrier of the baryon number is the net-proton yield in semi-inclusive photonuclear collisions, a type of ultraperipheral heavy-ion collision where one nucleus emits a quasi-real photon interacting with the other colliding nucleus.   We observe significant baryon stopping at low transverse momentum in photonuclear processes using $\rm{Au}+\rm{Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 54.4~\rm{GeV}$.

EM Probes,parallel,Understanding the properties of the fireball with the polarization signature of thermal dileptons,"Seck, Florian",TU Darmstadt,Unknown,"As dileptons are radiated from the extreme states of matter created in heavy-ion collisions with negligible final-state interactions, they retain the information imprinted on them at the time of their creation. Multi-differential measurements of dilepton invariant mass, momentum, and angular distributions can therefore serve as a unique tool to characterize the properties of matter in the interior of the hot and dense fireball.

An important property of virtual photons is their spin polarization defined in the rest frame of the virtual photon with respect to a chosen quantization axis. Even an isotropic thermal medium can exhibit nontrivial anisotropies in the angular distributions of the produced lepton pairs. While the total yield and observable spectra are proportional to the sum of the longitudinal and transverse components of the spectral function, the polarization depends on their difference. As the processes that drive the medium effects in the spectral function change with invariant mass and momentum, this becomes a powerful tool to study the composition and degrees of freedom of the hot and dense medium.

In this contribution, we utilize a coarse-grained hadronic transport approach to model the space-time evolution of the fireball. We calculate the polarization observables of thermal virtual photons as a function of mass and momentum and compare the results to existing measurements from HADES and NA60.

EM Probes,parallel,Fate of the $\rho$ - $a_1$ mixing in dilepton production,"Sakai, Azumi",Sophia University,Unknown,"In-medium modifications of vector spectral functions are anticipated to carry imprints of restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature/baryon density. Strong modifications have been indeed measured via dimuon production at the CERN SPS, whereas it remains inconclusive how to quantify those changes as the direct consequence of chiral symmetry restoration. Given the difficulty that it is elusive to construct the axial-vector spectrum in heavy-ion experiments, the key phenomenon is that the vector meson mixes with the axial-vector meson in a medium via pion loops, known as chiral mixing. The chiral mixing effect can be quantified as a model-independent theorem at low temperature [1], whereas at the critical temperature the chiral symmetry restoration compels the vanishing chiral-mixing [2]. On-going experiments and recent development of hydrodynamic model bring us a unique opportunity to get insight into chiral symmetry restoration from investigation of the dilepton invariant mass spectra.
In this work, a case study is carried out by utilizing the following 3 scenarios: (A) chiral restoration absent, (B) chiral restoration present and (C) false chiral restoration. The scenario-B describes the in-medium spectral function of the rho meson from zero to the chiral crossover temperature [2]. The scenario-C is often argued to generate an increase of the dilepton yield, which is incorrect since the procedure does not capture the change of QCD ground state.
We combine the in-medium spectral function in the chiral effective field theory with state-of-the-art fluid dynamical simulations with temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities [3]. We find an increase of the yield at 1.2-1.4 GeV due to the degenerate $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons, whereas the scenario of false restoration leads to a substantial overestimate at 1.2 GeV and this also causes an underestimate below and above the $\rho$ peak.

Critical Point,parallel,Exploring the Critical Points in QCD with Multi-Point Pade and Machine Learning Techniques in (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Goswami, Jishnu",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Our ability to predict thermodynamic observables and determine the QCD critical point at real values of chemical potentials is severely limited by the infamous sign problem. To address this issue, there are two common approaches: expanding the QCD partition function in a Taylor series with respect to the charge chemical potentials ($\mu_{B,Q,S}$) or analytically continuing from imaginary chemical potentials. However, both methods have limitations, particularly for larger values of the baryon chemical potential. Recently, we proposed a multi-point Pade approach[1] based on a (2+1)-flavor Lattice QCD simulation that uses multiple imaginary chemical potentials with temporal extents of $N_{\tau}=4,6,8$. This method combines the benefits of the aforementioned approaches and is expected to provide more reliable quantitative predictions for small to intermediate values of the baryon chemical potential. Another, advantage we can use this method to estimate different critical points of QCD by examining the singularities of the Pade series.

In this presentation, we will focus on two critical points, well known Roberge-Weiss critical point, which arises when the baryon chemical potential is purely imaginary, and the QCD critical point, which will emerge at a real value of the baryon chemical potential. We use the multi-point Pade approach to locate the Lee-Yang edge singularities in the complex chemical potential plane, which are obtained from lattice QCD simulated data. Our results demonstrate that the scaling of these singularities corresponds to the expected scaling of the well-known Roberge-Weiss transition. The universal scaling of singularities in the vicinity of the QCD critical endpoint is also investigated. Lee-Yang edge singularities associated with the QCD critical point at the real chemical potential for various temperatures are calculated. As the temperature decreases, the imaginary part of the singularities becomes smaller, hinting at a possible existence of a critical point at low temperatures. A machine learning technique is used to model the probability density of the singularities and interpolate the real and imaginary parts of the singularities between different temperatures. By employing a suitable scaling ansatz, the singularities are extrapolated towards the real axis, and the possible location of the QCD critical point is estimated. Preliminary results of ($T_{CEP},\mu_B^{CEP}$) are consistent with model predictions and other lattice QCD calculations.

However, this enhancement subsides with increasing collision centrality, and the resulting almost flat centrality dependence of $tp/d^2$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$ GeV can also be used as a signal for the first-order phase transition.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'KaiJia', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, KaiJia', 'id': '7818988', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Modern Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China', 'emailHash': '2e132dd95185baf2c04021a64d830f8b', 'db_id': 7818988, 'person_id': 7556100}"
Critical Point,parallel,Fluctuations near the liquid-gas and chiral phase transitions in hadronic matter,"Marczenko, Michał",University of Wrocław,Unknown,"In this talk I discuss the fluctuations of the net-baryon number density in dense hadronic matter. Chiral dynamics is modeled via the parity doublet Lagrangian, and the mean-field approximation is employed to account for chiral criticality. I explain the qualitative properties and systematics of the second-order susceptibility of the net-baryon number density for individual positive- and negative-parity nucleons whose masses become degenerate at the chiral restoration. I argue that the second-order susceptibility of the positive-parity state can become negative when the chiral symmetry is restored, as a natural consequence of the unique relationship of the mass to the order parameter and are indicative of approaching the critical point on the chiral phase boundary. The results may have consequences for the interpretation of the experimental data on net-proton fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.

This feature makes the heavy flavor product an ideal probe to explore how a heavy flavor hadron is formed from a heavy flavor quark, which is referred to as the heavy quark hadronization. A series of heavy flavor hadron and jet simulation studies have been carried out with the newly developed EIC project detector conceptual designs.

Spin/EIC Physics,parallel,Exploring the Spin Structure of the Nucleon at STAR,"Lin, Ting",Shandong University,Unknown,"Understanding the internal spin structure of the nucleon remains a challenge in strong interaction physics. The unique capability of RHIC to provide both longitudinally and transversely polarized hadronic collisions at various energies opened new avenues in studying the internal structure of the proton with unprecedented depth and precision. Significant progress has been made in the last few years through various measurements at STAR.

The longitudinal spin measurements have contributed significantly to our understanding of the quark and gluon helicity distributions inside the proton. The longitudinal double-spin asymmetry, $A_{LL}$, from STAR inclusive jet and dijet measurements, provides the first evidence of a positive gluon polarization with partonic momentum fraction $x > 0.05$. The reconstruction of $W^{\pm}/Z$ in longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions indicates that there is a flavor separation of the light sea quark helicity distributions. In transversely polarized proton collisions, $W^{\pm}/Z$-bosons provide the first constraint on the sea-quark Sivers function and contributes to the tests of the predicted sign change. The tilt of the dijet opening angle provides a direct access to the first Mellin momentum of the Sivers function and avoids the spin-correlated fragmentation contributions. The novel measurements of the azimuthal distributions of identified hadrons in jets and spin-dependent dihadron correlations directly probe the collinear quark transversity in the proton, with the former coupled to the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) Collins fragmentation function and the latter to the dihadron interference fragmentation function. These measurements shed lights on Sivers function, quark transversity and spin-dependent fragmentation functions in both collinear and TMD formalism. When combined with data from the future EIC, they will establish the validity and limits of factorization and universality, thus enabling a deeper understanding of fundamental QCD.

Small Systems,parallel,AMY Lorentz invariant parton cascade,"Zapp, Korinna",Lund University,Unknown,"The observation of signs of collectivity in small systems has highlighted the need
for a better understanding of equilibration in small and large collisions systems.
In search of this, the QCD effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore
and Yaffe (AMY) [1] has emerged as a promising candidate. In order to fully exploit 
the theory also for phenomenology we introduce ALPACA [2], a Lorentz invariant parton 
cascade which is a representation of the AMY effective kinetic theory in the form of 
a Monte Carlo event generator. It solves the Boltzmann equation with the full AMY
kernels (elastic scattering and splitting/merging processes) by explicitly simu-
lating the evolution of parton ensembles corresponding to single events. It is
constructed in a fully Lorentz invariant way by using a method pioneered in [3],
which also underlies the parton cascade PCPC [4]. A complication arises from
quantities like the screening mass, that enter the AMY kernels and are defined
as integrals over the phase space densities. We develop a method for extracting
these locally from the parton ensemble without the need for further informa-
tion. We perform an extensive validation of the framework in thermal equilibrium 
and present first results for out-of-equilibrium simulations for collisions of 
light nuclei down to protons. Here we focus on harmonic flow response to initial 
geometry deformations and the question to what extent such systems equilibrate.

The eccentricities are calculated by calculating correlation functions of the energy density field of the glasma immediately after the collision event at proper time t=0+. We separately consider the effects of color charge and geometrical hot spot fluctuations, analytically performing the averages over both in a dilute-dense limit. We show that geometric fluctuations of hot spots inside the proton are the dominant source of eccentricity whereas color charge fluctuations only give a negligible correction. The size and number of hot spots are the most important parameters characterizing the eccentricities.

By employing a nonrelativistic vector meson wave function and working in the dilute limit of the Color Glass Condensate framework we are able to analytically calculate cross sections for vector meson production in our hot spot model. We find that the coherent cross section is sensitive to both the size of the target and the structure of the probe. The incoherent cross section is dominated by color fluctuations at small transverse momentum transfer (t), by proton and hot spot sizes as well as the structure of the probe at medium t and again by color fluctuations at large t. While the t-dependence of the cross section is well reproduced in our model, the relative normalization between the coherent and the incoherent cross sections points to the need for additional fluctuations in the proton.

As a proof of concept, we analyze the distribution of the hardest splitting above a transverse momentum scale, $k_{t,cut}$, in high-$p_t$ jets. For a $k_{t, cut}$ that is significantly greater than any medium scale, the observable is determined by vacuum-like emissions. Therefore, it serves as a unique baseline independent of the medium modeling. Furthermore, a moderate $k_{t,cut}$ enhances the sensitivity to energy loss, specifically highlighting the presence of a critical resolution angle. Finally, at low $k_{t,cut}$, the observable becomes sensitive to induced emissions and medium response. We validate the generality of our findings using various heavy-ion event generators, including Hybrid, JetMed, Jewel, and Matter+LBT/MARTINI  models. Consequently, these substructure measurements can serve as a valuable guideline for future model developments, effectively disentangling different medium contributions.

Future Experiments,parallel,Overview of the NA60+ experiment at the CERN SPS,"Alocco, Giacomo","Universita e INFN, Cagliari (IT)",Italy,"NA60+ is a new proposed experiment designed to study the phase diagram of the strongly interacting matter at high baryochemical potential from 200 to 550 MeV at the CERN SPS. It is focused on precision studies of thermal dimuons, heavy quark and strangeness production in Pb--Pb collisions at center of mass energies ranging from 6 to 17 GeV.

The proposed experimental apparatus is composed of a vertex telescope located close to the target and a muon spectrometer located downstream of a hadron absorber. The vertex telescope will consist of several planes of ultra-thin, large area Monolithic Active Pixel  sensors (MAPS) embedded in a dipole magnetic field. The muon spectrometer will utilize large area gaseous detectors for muon tracking and a toroidal magnet based on a new light-weight and general-purpose concept.

An ambitious physics program is foreseen, which includes the search for chiral symmetry restoration effects through the $\rho$-$a_{1}$ mixing, the study of the order of the phase transition at large baryochemical potential through the measurement of a caloric curve, the onset of the deconfinement through the measurement of $J/\psi$ suppression. Finally the measurement of the transport properties of the medium via open charm states and the study of hadrochemistry via detection of strange hadrons and hypernuclei is also part of the physics program.
A letter of intent was submitted at the end of 2022 and the goal is to start data taking in 2029.

This talk will focus on the experimental apparatus, including the technical aspects and the R&D status, as well as the physics program and its competitiveness and complementarity to other experiments.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Giacomo', 'last_name': 'Alocco', 'fullName': 'Alocco, Giacomo', 'id': '7977303', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Cagliari (IT)', 'emailHash': 'aee2fb408e0c2a2b3161eb515d08e27e', 'db_id': 7977303, 'person_id': 7562456}"

It will cover a pseudorapidity interval of $3.4 < \eta < 5.8$, allowing to explore QCD at unprecedented low Bjorken-$x$ of down to $\approx 10^{-6}$ -- a regime where non-linear QCD dynamics are expected to be sizable.
It consists of a compact silicon-tungsten sampling electromagnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) with pad and pixel longitudinal and transverse segmented readout layers to achieve high spatial resolution for discriminating between isolated photons and decay photon pairs. Its hadronic component (FoCal-H) is constructed from copper capillary tubes filled with scintillator fibers and used for isolation energy measurement and jets.

The FoCal detector extends the ALICE physics program with the capability, unique at the LHC, to investigate gluon Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in the low-$x$ regime. This not only enables the study of non-linear QCD effects such as gluon saturation, but also allows to provide experimental constrains for (nuclear) PDFs in a region of phasespace where experimental data is scarce.The detector design allows carrying out these explorations using a multitude of probes, including direct photons, jets, as well as photo-production of vector mesons such as the J/$/psi$ in proton-Pb and Pb-Pb ultra-peripheral collisions.In addition, correlations of different probes can be studied, including gamma-jet, jet--jet and $\pi^0$--$\pi^{0}$ correlations.

In this presentation, we give an overview of the small-x physics program of the FoCal detector, as well as an overview of the expected performance of the detector for various observables. The latter is quantified using recent experimental results of ever-improving prototypes of the detector, which were operated at the Test Beam facilities of CERN in the years 2021--2023.

The aim of this upgrade is to replace the three innermost tracking layers with truly cylindrical wafer-scale Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). By adopting this innovative technology, ALICE will further reduce the material budget and the distance from the interaction point, thus significantly improving its tracking and vertexing capabilities. The R&D program for ITS3 includes several advancements, such as operability of bent MAPS, validation of the 65nm CMOS technology and employment of the stitching process to produce wafer-scale sensors.

In addition to the ITS3 upgrade, ALICE is designing a completely new apparatus, ALICE 3, planned for LHC Run 5 and 6. The detector consists of a large MAPS-based tracking system covering eight units of pseudorapidity, complemented by multiple systems for particle identification, including silicon time-of-flight layers, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, a muon identification system, and an electromagnetic calorimeter. The vertex detector will be based on an evolution of the ITS3 concept aiming at a track pointing resolution of better than 10 micron for $p_{\rm T}$>200 MeV/c through the integration of the tracking layers in a retractable structure inside the beam pipe. ALICE 3 will, on the one hand, enable novel studies of the quark-gluon plasma and, on the other hand, open up important physics opportunities in other areas of QCD and beyond.

Astrophysics,parallel,Causal and Stable Magnetohydrodynamics,"Kushwah, Khwahish","Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Unknown,"We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. We generalize the references [1, 2] and consider a fluid to be a locally neutral system composed of a particle with opposite charges, with vanishing dipole moment or spin, so that the fluid has vanishing magnetization and polarization.

We demonstrate that the magnetohydrodynamical equations of motion become dramatically different for this more realistic system. The shear stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation: it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field  each evolving according to different dynamical equation. For large magnetic fields we further show that the solutions of this theory display oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory. Finally, we investigate the derived equations in a Bjorken flow scenario.

While some equations of state contain just nucleons and up, down-quarks, others also contain hyperons, Delta baryons, and strange quarks. The hybrid equations of state, together with corresponding hadronic ones, are available on the CompOSE repository and can be used for different astrophysical applications. Besides studying first-order phase transitions, we also explore the possibility of higher-order phase transitions and investigate possible astrophysical implications, e.g., for neutron-star mergers.

Astrophysics,parallel,Far-from-equilibrium relativistic hydrodynamics in neutron-star mergers,"Yang, Yumu",University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,Unknown,"In binary neutron-star mergers, violent changes in density drive the proton fraction out of equilibrium at timescales of milliseconds, comparable to those required by weak interactions to restore beta equilibrium. As a result, the pressure evolves out of phase with the density oscillations, giving rise to dissipative work that can be modeled as an effective bulk-viscous correction [1,2]. Near beta equilibrium, the correction to the pressure is known to follow an Israel-Stewart-like equation of motion, with transport coefficients determined by the equation of state outside beta equilibrium and weak-interaction rates [2]. However, it is not clear if that is the regime that actually occurs in neutron star mergers [3]. In this work, we shed new light on this problem in the following way. First, we show how this hydrodynamic description can be extended far from equilibrium, without approximations, allowing us to model neutron star matter that is arbitrarily far from beta equilibrium. We find that for realistic equations of state [4], the linear approximation in deviations from equilibrium commonly assumed in the field [1] has very limited applicability and, thus, realistic neutron star mergers are indeed in the far-from-beta equilibrium regime. We calculate the resulting far-from-equilibrium transport coefficients for equations of state that satisfy the latest constraints from multi-messenger observations from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER. Our results pave the way for novel systematic studies of viscous effects in numerical simulations of binary mergers [3].

In inclusive jet populations, the principle axis of energy flow in the plane transverse to the jet axis examines the correlation of particles outside the jet cone with the energy of the jet.

The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has collected its highest statistics of the $\gamma$ and $\pi^0$ triggered hadron events in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV in the RHIC Year-2014 run, and measured not only the inclusive spectra of the triggered hadrons but also the angle and energy dependent $I_{AA}$ and $D_{AA}$. We will discuss the in-medium modification of the energy-space structure of the jets at the RHIC energies with the results obtained.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Megan', 'last_name': 'Connors', 'fullName': 'Connors, Megan', 'id': '7977091', 'affiliation': 'Georgia State University', 'emailHash': '666645c0d7f7bf21f633aabb3ac84d8e', 'db_id': 7977091, 'person_id': 7726237}"
Jets,parallel,Studies of jet quenching and medium response using photon+jet events with ATLAS,"Mc Ginn, Christopher",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Partons traversing the hot and dense medium of deconfined color charges produced in collisions of heavy nuclei are expected to lose their energy primarily through medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung. As a result, the amount of induced energy loss is expected to depend on the QCD color charge carried by the parton, i.e. depend on whether it is a quark- or a gluon-initiated jet. In this talk, photon+jet events taken with the ATLAS detector in Pb+Pb and pp are used to constrain the color-charge dependence of jet energy loss. First, ATLAS presents the finalized result on the nuclear modification factor RAA for photon-tagged jets. By comparing this measurement to the RAA for inclusive jets, one can exploit the known difference in the quark-/gluon-initiated jet fraction between these two samples and extract the QCD color-charge dependence. Second, ATLAS presents a new measurement of photon plus two jet production in Pb+Pb collisions as compared to $pp$, where the configuration of quark+gluon jet pair is expected to dominate. Measurements of the total jet-to-photon $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ratio, the two-jet $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ asymmetry, and the jet opening angle are presented, providing novel information on the parton-QGP interaction. Finally, the study of photon+jet+hadron correlations in angular space, expected to be sensitive to medium response, is presented for the first time.

New measurements of inclusive jet suppression ($R_{AA}$) in heavy-ion collisions are presented for jets reconstructed with different radii ($R$=0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) in Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,A fluid-dynamic approach to heavy-quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma,"Capellino, Federica",GSI Darmstadt,Unknown,"Heavy quarks (i.e. charm and beauty) are powerful tools to characterize the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions. Although they are initially produced out of kinetic equilibrium via hard partonic scattering processes, recent measurements of anisotropic flow of charmed hadrons pose the question regarding the possible thermalization of heavy quarks in the medium. Our recent work [1] has provided new insights on the level of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP. In particular, exploiting a mapping between transport theory and fluid-dynamics, we have shown how a fluid-dynamic description of the dynamics of charm quarks in the QCD plasma is feasible. Inspired by recent lattice-QCD calculations [2], we will show how a partial thermalization within the lifetime of the QGP is expected also for beauty quarks.
We will present results for spectra of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic code (FluiduM [3]) coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current in the QGP. We will also show preliminary calculations for beauty spectra. We compare our calculations with the most recent experimental data providing further constraints on the heavy-quark spatial diffusion coefficient [4].

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Heavy-flavor transport and hadronization in proton-proton collisions,"Beraudo, Andrea","INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)",Italy,"Recent experimental results on the Λ+c/D0 ratio in proton-proton collisions – strongly enhanced compared to expectations relying on universal fragmentation fractions/functions in different colliding system, from e+e− to pp – led to speculations about possible medium effects affecting hadronization, previously considered a distinctive feature only of heavy-ion collisions. Here we show how the assumption of the formation of a small, deconfined and expanding fireball also in pp collisions, in which charm quarks can undergo rescattering and hadronization, allows one to qualitative reproduce unexpected experimental findings in the heavy-flavor particle ratios and distributions. For this purpose we apply to the proton-proton case the same in-medium hadronization mechanism previously developed to address heavy-ion collisions and based on local color-neutralization via recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite color charges from the background fireball. In our model the presence of diquark excitations in the hot medium favors the formation of charmed baryons and the recombination process, involving quite collinear partons from the same fluid cell, turns out to be an efficient mechanism to transfer the collective flow of the system to the final charmed hadrons.
The model -- described in detail in EPJC 82 (2022) 7, 607 -- allowed us to provide a good description of the charmed-hadron ratios and momentum-distribution in nucleus-nucleus collision. Its extension to the proton-proton case provides a consistent explanation for the enhanced Λ+c/D0 ratio observed in these collisions and leads to other interesting results for the charmed-hadron momentum distributions -- entering into the definition of the R_AA, in which the pp result can no longer be considered as the no-final-state-effect benchmark -- and for their elliptic-flow coefficient, reflecting the initial deformation of the fireball.
Having validated our modelling of the initial state of the fireball and its hydrodynamic evolution against the measured soft-particle multiplicity in pp collisions, we believe our results are pretty robust and provide a unified picture of heavy-flavor production from pp to AA collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '7819064', 'affiliation': 'INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 7819064, 'person_id': 7538364}"
Heavy Flavor,parallel,Event-by-event heavy-flavour dynamics: estimating the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s$ from charm to the infinite mass limit,"Minissale, Vincenzo",Unknown,Unknown,"In the past years, a Quasi-Particle Model (QPM) has been developed to study charm quark dynamics in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions supplying a satisfactory description of both the $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of D mesons and leading to a first evaluation of the spatial diffusion coefficient $D_s(T)$ from the phenomenology [1,2]. Within an event-by-event full Boltzmann transport approach followed by a hybrid hadronization via coalescence plus fragmentation, we will discuss for the first time $R_{AA}(p_T), v_2(p_T)$ and $v_3(p_T)$ predictions down to $p_T \rightarrow 0$ for D and B mesons as well as $\Lambda_c$ and $\Lambda_b$ at both RHIC-sPHENIX and LHC energies [3]. Furthermore the analysis is extended to higher order anisotropic flows $v_n$ of D mesons, also evaluated by using the Event-Shape-Engineering (ESE) technique [4]. We find that QPM approach is able to correctly predict not only the new observables related to charm quark sector, but also the first available data on $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ of single-electron from B mesons decays measured by ALICE. The role of the large  $\Lambda_c$ and $\Lambda_b$ production is relevant especially in the low $p_T$ region that is becoming accessible to sPHENIX and ALICE.
A significant breaking of the expected scaling of the thermalization time $\tau_{th}$ with $M_Q/T$ is found, studying the evolution with mass of $D_s(T)$ to better assess the comparison to lQCD calculations. Charm quark $D_s(T)$ is about $50\%$ larger than the asymptotic value for $M_Q\rightarrow \infty$, while bottom $D_s(T)$ is only $20\%$ higher. Such a behaviour entails for $M_Q\rightarrow \infty$, a $D_s(T)$ which is consistent within the current uncertainty to the most recent lattice QCD calculations with dynamical quarks and allows to envisage for bottom quark a thermalization time smaller than the one from $M_Q/T$ scaling.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Microscopic Model for Quarkonia Production in Heavy-Ion collisions,"Aichelin, Joerg",SUBATECH,Unknown,"Quarkonia are a very interesting probe for the study of thequark gluon plasma (QGP), created in ultrarelativisitc heavy-ion collisions. They can elucidate several features of the QGP, which are not accessible to other probes. These include the energy loss of color neutral states and open heavy flavour partons in the QGP, the possible recombination of heavy quarks during the expansion of the QGP and the influence of the potential between c(b) and $\bar c(\bar b)$, which is modified in the QGP environment, on the production of quarkonia. 

We present the first microscopic approach for the study of quarkonia. It follows the heavy quarks from their initial production to the detection as a part of a quarkonium or as open heavy flavour hadron. After being produced in EPOS4 by (shadowing modified) initial collisions, the heavy quarks interact mutually by a potential, calculated on the lattice. When the temperature of the surrounding QGP environment falls below the dissociation temperature of the quarkonia species, a density matrix, based quantum approach of Remler [1], describes the formation and destruction of quarkonia due to its interaction with the QGP medium while the QGP medium expands.
The expanding QGP is described by the EPOS4 approach, which has shown to reproduce a multitude of experimental observables in the light hadron sector. At freeze out the free heavy quarks combine through hadronization to open heavy flavour partons, which are well reproduced in this approach. We compare the J/$\psi$ as well as the $\psi'$, produced in Remler approach with the available data on transverse momentum spectra, $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ and analyse, including feed down corrections, how the above processes influence the production of quarkonia. First results of this approach have been published in [2].

Heavy Flavor,parallel,First energy-energy correlators measurements for inclusive and heavy-flavour tagged jets with ALICE,"Fan, Wenqing",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. (US),USA,"Many new jet substructure observables have been studied in recent years, with particular attention to those which can be calculated by perturbative QCD. N-point energy correlators are currently attracting both theoretical and experimental interest. To comprehensively study the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of jet structure, we measured the energy-energy correlators (EEC) that emphasize the angular structure of the energy flow within jets. Defined as the energy-weighted cross section of particle pairs inside jets, the EECs as a function of pair distance show a distinct separation of the perturbative from the non-perturbative regime, revealing parton flavor dependent dynamics of jet formation as well as the confinement of the partons into hadrons. The projected 3-point correlator (E3C) is the first step in observing multi-particle correlations in jets. They encodes the shape dependence of energy flow in jets and supplement the EEC to cleanly access the pQCD region.
We present first measurements of the EECs for D0-tagged and inclusive (gluon-dominated) jets in pp and p--Pb collisions at 13 TeV and 5.02 TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC. By comparing our results with perturbative QCD predictions, we can measure the modification in the radiation pattern of jets due to mass effects and due to the presence of a cold nuclear medium. We also perform the first E3C measurement for inclusive jets in pp collisions at 13 TeV. This suite of measurements will serve as a baseline for future studies in heavy-ion collisions, allowing for disentanglement of the dynamics of the dead cone from interactions with the quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wenqing', 'last_name': 'Fan', 'fullName': 'Fan, Wenqing', 'id': '7977021', 'affiliation': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Probing parton formation times with $g\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ splitting,"Van Der Schee, Wilke",CERN,Switzerland,"In vacuum, the spacetime location where a gluon splits into a quark-antiquark pair is not a well defined observable. In heavy-ion collisions, the `formation time’ of a splitting takes on meaning due to interactions with the medium and is a critical feature for the phenomenology of medium-modified parton showers. The $g\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ splitting is especially suited to study this formation time, as the $c\bar{c}$ virtuality is of the same order as medium effects and since the typical time is of the same order as the quark-gluon plasma lifetime. In this talk we demonstrate how to study this process from hadron distributions inside jets containing two D mesons. In particular, we show how the virtuality distribution of the original splitting depends characteristically on the formation time.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wilke', 'last_name': 'Van Der Schee', 'fullName': 'Van Der Schee, Wilke', 'id': '7819079', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'ac9ef8d18cffa0dd05c90d0070af15d6', 'db_id': 7819079, 'person_id': 7539924}"

The small system collision scan at RHIC, including both symmetric and asymmetric small systems (O+O $>$ $^{3}$He$+$Au $>$ $d$$+$Au $>$ $p$$+$Au $>$ $\gamma+$Au), provides a better understanding of how collectivity emerges and evolves with system size.

We analyze a large sample of minimum bias and central triggered $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and inclusive $\gamma$+Au processes (center-of-mass energy around 40 GeV) by triggering ultra-peripheral events in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

We compare our measurements with STAR measurements of $v_n$ in $p/d/^3$He+Au collisions and hydrodynamic model calculations. 

New $v_{n}$ measurements in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions provide insight into the impact of system symmetry on initial condition and pre-equilibrium dynamics, compared to the previously studied asymmetric systems $p/d/^3$He+Au. We also investigate the ratio $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ and correlations between $v_n$ and mean $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ as a function of multiplicity, which are sensitive to initial momentum anisotropy, subnucleon fluctuations, and clustering in the $^{16}$O nucleus.

We demonstrate that approximately 50% of the pT-differential triangular flow difference between the measurements by the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations can be explained by the use of reference flow vectors from different rapidity regions. This emphasizes the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelation for anisotropic flow measurements in asymmetric nuclear collisions, and the need for (3+1)D simulations. We further present results for the beam energy scan of d+Au collisions and compare to PHENIX data. The same framework is used to describe p+Pb collisions and photo-nuclear events in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We compare to experimental data on momentum anisotropies from the ATLAS Collaboration and find good agreement with the measured elliptic flow. Again, the importance of longitudinal flow decorrelations is highlighted, as they dominate the elliptic flow hierarchy between p+Pb and γ+Pb collisions. Our results imply that QCD fluids can be created at the future Electron Ion Collider, where they could be studied in great detail.

To investigate the phase diagram of the QCD matter, the Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider (RHIC) started the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program in  2010, delivering Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 62.4 GeV.  The success of the BES-I program justified the second phase of Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) with higher statistics and detector upgrades.  Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}$= $7.7-54.4$ $\text{GeV}$ were collected during $2017-2021$, covering a large area of the QCD phase diagram in temperature and baryon chemical potential by varying the collision energy, centrality, and rapidity.  In particular, the installed Event Plane Detector (EPD) enables the measurement of charged particle production at far-backward pseudorapidity.

In this talk, we  present pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 27 GeV with the EPD ($2.15 < |\eta| < 5.09$).  We will also present the transverse momentum spectra of identified hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$  = 7.7 to 54.4 GeV within mid-rapidity ($|y| < 1$). The mid-rapidity yields of identified hadrons show the expected signatures of large baryon stopping at lower energies and the dominance of pair production at higher energies. The centrality dependence of integrated yields (dN/dy and dN/d$\eta$), average transverse momenta ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios,  chemical and kinetic freeze-out parameters will also be presented.  These results will be compared to published results at other collision energies and the new insights to the QCD phase diagram will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew', 'last_name': 'Harasty', 'fullName': 'Harasty, Matthew', 'id': '7976637', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Davis', 'emailHash': '732f438454053ad18f421cf130767efc', 'db_id': 7976637, 'person_id': 7559333}"

To model the dynamics of the collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV, we employ a (3+1)D dynamical initialization model coupled with the relativistic viscous hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade hybrid framework [1]. To account for shear and bulk viscous effects at RHIC BES energies, we derive the out-of-equilibrium corrections to particle distributions with multiple conserved charge currents using Grad's moment and Chapman-Enskog methods. A fast model emulator is then trained in a 22-dimensional parameter space to accurately predict identified particle yields, average transverse momenta, and charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients. By carrying out a joint Bayesian analysis of the RHIC BES phase I measurements for Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 19.6, and 200 GeV, we set robust constraints on initial-state baryon stopping and the $\mu_B$ and $T$ dependence of the QGP shear and bulk viscosity. Our results show that the Bayesian inference approach with our full (3+1)D hybrid framework effectively extracts the QGP properties and the 3D dynamics of the collision events from the RHIC BES measurements and provides quantitative insights into the QCD matter in a baryon-rich environment.

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,QCD based equation of state at finite density with a critical point from an alternative expansion scheme,"Kahangirwe, Micheal ",Unknown,Unknown,"Our study presents a family of Equations of State (EoS) that enable hydrodynamical simulations at unprecedentedly large baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B$) and finite temperature ($T$), thus helping to constrain the critical point's location by comparing it to experimental data from the Second Beam Energy Scan.
In Ref.  [1], a family of equations of state was constructed by combining Taylor expansion QCD lattice results with 3D Ising model critical behavior. However, the applicability of this family was limited to the range of $ 0 \leq \mu_B \leq 450$ MeV. In recent work, [2,3],  a resummation scheme was proposed that extrapolates lattice QCD results to the range of chemical potentials $\frac{\mu_B}{T} = 3.5 $.
In this work, we combine these approaches to obtain equations of state in the range $0 \leq \mu_B \leq 700$ MeV and 5 MeV $\leq T \leq 800$ MeV, which match lattice QCD results at low density and contain a 3D Ising model critical point. We impose stability and causality constraints and discuss the possible ranges of free parameter choices arising from the 3D Ising model to QCD mapping. We present thermodynamic observables, including baryon density, pressure, entropy, energy density, susceptibility, and speed of sound that cover a wide range in the QCD phase diagram.

By comparing the moment equations with the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations, we demonstrate that the latter are able to capture the early-time, collisionless dynamics, albeit approximately, due to their relaxation-type structure [1]. We also derive second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics from the three-moment truncation and find that there are ambiguities in the definition of some second-order transport coefficients. In order to understand the nature of these ambiguities, we derive the full second-order non-conformal hydrodynamics by employing Chapman-Enskog expansion and also from a novel entropy approach and show that such ambiguities are inherent when defining some of the second-order transport coefficients [2]. We show that these ambiguities affect the ability of the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics to reproduce the results of kinetic theory.

We explore the effect of including these and other TMDs on the production of high-$p_T$ (unpolarized) hadron production from (unpolarized) proton-proton scattering.

Our approach is based on the recently introduced information current [1], which measures the net amount of information carried by perturbations around equilibrium in a relativistic many-body system. The resulting noise correlators are guaranteed to be observer-independent for thermodynamically stable models, which differs from previous approaches employed in the literature. We obtain a Martin-Siggia-Rose [2] action principle within our formalism and compare it to previous proposals for hydrodynamic effective actions. Finally, we present a few applications, which include the Israel-Stewart theory in a general hydrodynamic frame [3].

Initial State,parallel,Using new methods for systematic study of nuclear structure in high-energy collisions to probe the effect of short-range correlations,"William Luzum, Matthew",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"There is increasing interest in using high-energy collisions to probe the structure of nuclei, in particular with the high-precision data made possible by collisions performed with pairs of isobaric species. A systematic study requires a variation of parameters representing nuclear properties such as radius, skin thickness,  angular deformation, and short-range correlations, to determine the sensitivity of the various observables on each of these properties. In this work we propose a method for efficiently carrying out such study, based on the shifting of positions of nucleons in Monte-Carlo samples.  We show that by using this method, statistical demands can be dramatically reduced --- potentially reducing the required number of simulated events by orders of magnitude --- paving the way for systematic study of nuclear structure in high-energy collisions.

As an application, we perform a systematic study of short-range nucleon-nucleon correlations and their effects on heavy-ion observables.  Using our methods these effects, though small, can be precisely studied without the need for large numbers of simulations.  In particular, we illustrate the limitations of a simple exclusion radius as a proxy for realistic nucleon-nucleon correlation functions.

Initial State,parallel,Adiabatic Hydrodynamization: a Natural Framework to Find and Describe Prehydrodynamic Attractors,"Steinhorst, Rachel",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"One of the main challenges in the theory of heavy ion collisions is understanding how an initial state of two highly Lorentz-contracted nuclei acquires the features of a hydrodynamic plasma in a characteristic time of 1 fm/c. Arguably, the most successful descriptions of this out-of-equilibrium stage have been established by finding so-called “attractor” solutions in the various (simplified) theories that attempt to capture out-of-equilibrium dynamics of QCD. These attractors are characterized by a loss of sensitivity to the initial conditions, which is achieved because the kinetic theory is dynamically driven to a preferred “attractor surface” in the phase space of the theory, often well before hydrodynamization in weakly coupled kinetic theory.

In this context, the adiabatic hydrodynamization framework [1,2] is a promising candidate to describe and characterize attractors in a model-independent formulation. In principle, all that needs to be done is to establish the dominance of an effective ground state in the dynamics of the system. This was done analytically in [2] for the first stage of the bottom-up thermalization scenario [3], demonstrating a dynamical reduction in the number of active degrees of freedom much earlier than the hydrodynamic regime. A key observation made in [2] was that such effective ground states may require a time-dependent change of coordinates for their dominance to be manifest. Ultimately, such a change of coordinates is one of the defining characteristics of the sought attractor solution, and therefore it becomes imperative to define a procedure to find the “optimal” coordinate transformation for a given theory. In this talk, we will lay out a candidate for such a procedure and will consider the example of collision-driven dynamics in the Bjorken-expanding kinetic theory of a dilute gluon gas to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to describe attractor solutions. We will then lay out the path to explore more realistic descriptions of the expanding QGP, including the later stages of bottom-up thermalization, and the transverse expansion of the medium.

For the pressure ratio $P_T/P_L$, we observe that its late-time evolution becomes universal in units of the kinetic relaxation time for sufficiently large couplings signaling the onset of a hydrodynamical attractor. In contrast, at weak couplings, it converges earlier to a bottom-up attractor in terms of the thermalization time scale $\tau_{\text{BMSS}} = \alpha_s^{-13/5}/Q_s$. We interpret these as two limiting attractors. The dynamics of the occupancy of hard modes, the heavy-quark diffusion coefficient, and the jet quenching parameter are better described by a bottom-up limiting attractor even for moderate couplings. Therefore, the previous conjecture that the hydrodynamical attractor governs the late-time approach toward hydrodynamization is not complete. Our results rather indicate that a weak coupling attractor emerges additionally in the coupling regime relevant for heavy-ion collisions for certain observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Lindenbauer', 'fullName': 'Lindenbauer, Florian', 'id': '7818900', 'affiliation': 'TU Wien', 'emailHash': '6f56c18325322a7029f9290f37c89bd4', 'db_id': 7818900, 'person_id': 7537240}"
Initial State,parallel,Investigating the early magnetic field of QGP via heavy-flavour polarisation studies with ALICE,"Micheletti, Luca",CERN,Switzerland,"Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are produced at the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions, on a time scale shorter than the medium formation time, and are sensitive to the large initial magnetic field produced perpendicular to the reaction plane (defined by the impact parameter direction and beam direction) in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In the presence of a large initial magnetic field, the charm quark can be polarised. The quark polarisation is expected to be transferred to the hadron in the hadronisation process. Experimentally, the heavy-flavour polarisation can be probed by measuring the spin density matrix element of spin 1 hadrons (as the  $\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson). Any deviation of ρ00 parameter from ⅓ can be attributed to the spin alignment of $\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson.
We will present the first measurement of the $\rho_{00}$ parameter of  $\rm{D}^{*+}$ meson in Pb–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02~$TeV, exploiting the large data sample collected by the ALICE Collaboration during the LHC Run 2 in 2018. A comparison with the $J/\psi$ polarisation measurement will also be reported to investigate the effect of the magnetic field. In this study, one of the main background sources is represented by the feed-down contribution from B-meson decays, as vector mesons which decay from scalar B mesons are expected to be longitudinally polarized due to the helicity conservation in weak decays. In this context, the final measurement of the spin alignment of prompt and non-prompt $\rm{D}^{*+}$ mesons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 13~$TeV, used to quantify the effect of the feed-down in the Pb–Pb measurements, will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Luca', 'last_name': 'Micheletti', 'fullName': 'Micheletti, Luca', 'id': '7974804', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '46958f39ea72c1bd6aac84d4921d7701', 'db_id': 7974804, 'person_id': 7681796}"

These processes provide strong constraints on the nuclear photon flux and its dependence on the impact parameter and photon energy. Comparisons of the measured cross-sections to QED predictions from the Starlight and SuperChic models are also presented. Tau-pair production measurements can constrain the tau lepton's anomalous magnetic dipole moment (g-2), and a recent ATLAS measurement using muonic decays of tau leptons in association with electrons and tracks provides one of the most stringent limits available to date.

The rate of the dielectron emission is proportional to the medium's electromagnetic spectral function. In the dielectron mass range from $400$ MeV/$c^{2}$ to $800$ MeV/$c^{2}$, the spectral function probes the in-medium $\rho$ meson propagator which is sensitive to the medium’s properties including the total baryon density and the temperature. Meanwhile, the low energy range of the spectral function provides information about the medium’s electrical conductivity. Therefore, by measuring thermal dielectron production, we can study the microscopic interactions between the electromagnetic current and the medium.

The STAR experiment has recorded large datasets of Au+Au collisions during the Beam Energy Scan Phase-II (BES-II) program, spanning center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) from 3.0 to 19.6 GeV with detector upgrades that benefit the dielectron measurement via extended transverse momentum and rapidity coverages as well as enhanced particle identification capability.

They are produced at all stages of the collision with negligible final-state interactions. At intermediate dielectron invariant mass ($m_{\rm ee} > 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$), thermal radiation from the quark-gluon plasma carries information about the early temperature of the medium. At LHC energies, it is however dominated by a large background from correlated heavy-flavour hadron decays. At smaller $m_{\rm ee}$, thermal radiation from the hot hadronic phase contributes to the dielectron spectrum via decays of $\rho$ mesons, whose spectral function is sensitive to chiral-symmetry restoration. Finally, at vanishing $m_{\rm ee}$, the real direct photon fraction can be extracted from the dielectron data. In pp collisions, such measurement in minimum bias events serves as a baseline and a fundamental test for perturbative QCD calculations, while studies in high charged-particle multiplicity events allow one to search for thermal radiation in small colliding systems. The latter show surprising phenomena similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions.
In this talk, final ALICE results, using the full data sample collected during the LHC Run 2, will be presented. They include measurements of the dielectron and direct-photon production in central Pb--Pb at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pairs, $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, of 5.02 TeV, as well as of direct photons in minimum bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

The underlying emission rates, which include baryon chemical potential dependence for the first time, are implemented from perturbation theory in a manner which smoothly interpolates between the strict next-to-leading order and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regimes. By comparing the slope of the invariant mass spectrum with the average temperature of the fluid (at different evolution times), we assess the efficacy of this observable as a thermometer of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Furthermore, we are able to explore the capability of dileptons as a QGP `baryometer' via their sensitivity to the dynamical evolution and dissipation of baryon charge included in the simulations. We also investigate the correlation between the medium lifetime and the integrated dilepton yields in central and peripheral Au+Au collisions across the different beam energies.

These processes have been extensively studied in ultraperipheral collisions, in which the impact parameter is larger than twice the nuclear radius. In recent years, the observation of coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction has been claimed in nucleus--nucleus (A--A) collisions with nuclear overlap, based on the measurement of an excess (with respect to hadroproduction expectations) in the very low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) J/$\psi$ yield. Such quarkonium measurements can help constraining the nuclear gluon distribution at low Bjorken-x and high energy. In addition, they can shed light on the theory behind photon induced reactions in A--A collisions with nuclear overlap, including possible interactions of the measured probes with the formed and fast expanding quark-gluon plasma. In order to confirm the photoproduction origin of the very low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ J/$\psi$ yield excess, polarization measurement is a golden observable. It is indeed expected that the produced quarkonium would keep the polarization of the incoming photon due to s-channel helicity conservation. ALICE can measure inclusive and exclusive quarkonium production down to zero transverse momentum, at forward rapidity (2.5 <$\it{y}$< 4) and midrapidity (|$\it{y}$|< 0.9). In this contribution, we will report on the new preliminary measurement of the $\it{y}$-differential cross section and the new first polarization analysis at LHC of coherently photoproduced J/$\psi$ in peripheral Pb--Pb collisions.

However, it is essential to investigate their performance with rapidity-dependent measurements at low collision energies, where boost-invariance is expected to be strongly violated. In this study, we calibrate a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic framework using rapidity distributions of charged particles and net protons for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7–200$ GeV. We observe significant rapidity dependences in thermodynamic properties at the hadronization process near the chemical freeze-out. The effects on the rapidity dependence of particle production due to longitudinal flow and system size are also highlighted. A rapidity-dependent thermal model is developed, incorporating the dynamical features of the multistage framework. We evaluate the performance of different thermal model scenarios in extracting the freeze-out profiles, using the rapidity-dependent yields of the multistage framework and comparing them to the hydrodynamic freeze-out hypersurface as a closure test [1]. Bayesian analysis is applied to constrain the longitudinal flow, system size in rapidity space, and thermodynamic properties for nuclear matter created at low beam energies. Our Bayesian model selection analysis reveals a longitudinal flow stronger than Bjorken in the experimental measurements as beam energy decreases. Our study provides a simple numerical approach for extracting rapidity-dependent thermodynamic parameters at freeze-out for low-beam energy collisions. Furthermore, analyzing freeze-out profiles through data-driven methods using this model offers quantitative guidance to computationally-demanding hybrid approaches [2].

In this talk, we will present new STAR measurements of strange hadron ($K_s^0$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi$, $\bar{\Xi}$, $\Omega$, $\bar{\Omega}$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, 19.6 GeV from BES-II and $\Omega$($\bar{\Omega}$) production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, including transverse-momentum and rapidity spectra, nuclear modification factors, baryon-to-meson and antibaryon-to-baryon ratios. New insights on the collision dynamics will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yi', 'last_name': 'Fang', 'fullName': 'Fang, Yi', 'id': '7974617', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '24f8a5cbe1d686ac3c04c168ee374621', 'db_id': 7974617, 'person_id': 7549948}"
Jets,parallel,Isolating final state effects in high $p_T$ $\pi^0$ production using direct photons in small system collisions with PHENIX,"Firak, Daniel",Unknown,Unknown,"PHENIX observed a 20\% suppression in the production of high $p_T$ neutral pions
in the most central (0-5\%) $d+$Au collisions at 200 GeV. Through the simultaneous measurement of high $p_T$ direct photons ($\gamma^{dir}$) and $\pi^0$ production for event samples selected by event activity, the final state effects could be disentangled from cold-nuclear-matter effects and event-selection biases that are inherent in using the standard Glauber model. This isolation of final state effects is achieved by approximating the nuclear modification factor by the double ratio $R_{xA}=(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{pp}/(\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{xA}$. While the cold-nuclear-matter effects in $x+$A collisions cancel in the ($\gamma^{dir}/\pi^{0})_{xA}$ ratio, the effective number of binary collisions is given by $N_{\mathrm{coll}}^{\mathrm{exp}} = \gamma^{dir}_{xAu}/\gamma^{dir}_{pp}$, which eliminates the dependence on the Glauber model. In addition, many systematic uncertainties cancel in the double ratio. To shed light on the origin of the observed final state suppression and to test if it is consistent with energy loss in droplets of QGP, the results from $d+$Au collisions are compared to preliminary data from smaller ($p+$Au) and larger ($^3$He$+$Au) collision systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Firak', 'fullName': 'Firak, Daniel', 'id': '7974597', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'b870350e889f8c9dbb95cdc6fb9a66bc', 'db_id': 7974597, 'person_id': 7563162}"
Jets,parallel,Quantum to classical parton evolution in the QGP,"Barata, João",Unknown,Unknown,"We study the time evolution of the density matrix of a high energy quark in the presence of a dense QCD background that is modeled as a stochastic Gaussian color field. At late times, we find that only the color singlet component of the quark’s reduced density matrix survives the in-medium evolution and that the density matrix becomes asymptotically diagonal in both transverse position and momentum spaces. In addition, we observe an accelerated entropy growth due to the larger phase space being explored by the quark and that the quantum and classical quark entropies converge at late times. We further observe that the quark state loses all memory of the initial condition. Combined with the fact that the reduced density matrix satisfies Boltzmann-diffusion transport, we conclude that the quark reduced density matrix can be interpreted as a classical phase space distribution. Finally, we comment on how this approach can offer a generic way to study parton evolution in the QGP and establish a strong connection to initial stage physics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'João', 'last_name': 'Barata', 'fullName': 'Barata, João', 'id': '7819038', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fe4acb8d1beeb5499f57f94d4f131590', 'db_id': 7819038, 'person_id': 7533616}"

Therefore, photon-triggered jets can be used to study the jet quenching in the QGP medium. In this work, photon-triggered jets are studied through different jet and jet substructure observables for different collision systems and energies using the JETSCAPE framework. Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies. These JETSCAPE results are used to predict upcoming sPHENIX results.

This approach extends the jet $R_{\rm AA}$ to lower jet $p_{\mathrm T}$ than previously achievable, providing significant kinematic overlap with RHIC jet measurements. 
In addition to explorations of the low-$p_{\rm T}$ frontier, we report the inclusive charged-particle jet $v_2$ in semi-central Pb--Pb collisions, thereby quantifying the yield dependence relative to the event-plane orientation and probing the pathlength dependence of jet energy loss.

ALICE has carried out new systematic measurements of these and other perturbatively-calculable angularities using consistent definitions for the first time, resolving the long-standing girth-mass problem, and revealing quenching effects at broad angles. Concurrently, applying soft drop grooming isolates the narrowing in the core of quenched jets. Grooming can also be employed to resolve medium scattering centers, with varying methods to focus on regions of the splitting phase space. 
We present the first application of dynamical grooming in heavy-ion collisions to search for excess $k_{\mathrm{T,g}}$ emissions as a signature of point-like scatters, providing new constraints on searches for in-medium Molière scattering. We also present a new approach for studying jet-medium opacity, based on a time-like rather than angular perspective.

A unified description of both vacuum and medium-induced emissions is therefore lacking.
In this work, we build a toy Monte-Carlo parton shower ordered in formation time, virtual mass, and opening angle, representing equivalent formulations at leading logarithmic accuracy.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Measurements of Charm Quark Interaction with the QGP in Heavy-Ion Collisions at STAR,"Su, Yuan",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Heavy flavor quarks (charm and bottom), produced in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, serve as excellent probes to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). When traversing the medium, charm quarks suffer from `jet quenching' thanks to the interactions with the QGP. It can manifest as degradation of charm quark energy and modifications to the fragmentation pattern, both of which are predicted to depend on parton flavor and quark mass. The energy loss can be quantified by comparing yields of charmed mesons or tagged charm jets in heavy-ion collisions to those in $p$+$p$ collisions. On the other hand, medium-induced modifications to the jet shower can be studied using the jet fragmentation function, i.e., the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) fraction of the jet carried by hadrons along the jet axis ($z = \vec{p}_{\rm T, hadron}\textbf{.}\hat{p}_{\rm T, jet}/|\vec{p}_{\rm T, jet}|$).

In this contribution, we report the first measurement of the $\rm D^{0}$ meson production yield at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 1$) in isobar collisions (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$, with the STAR experiment at RHIC. We present nuclear modification factors as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ for different centrality classes, and compare them to similar measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$. We complement the $\rm D^{0}$ meson studies with measurements of $\rm D^{0}$ meson tagged jets in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$. For the first time, we show measurements of charm jet fragmentation function in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, and the nuclear modification factor as a function of $z$. Additionally, we report the yield modifications of $\rm D^{0}$-tagged jets as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ and the radial profile of the $\rm D^{0}$ mesons in these tagged jets.

Illinois at Urbana Champaign (US),USA,"The suppression of jets in heavy-ion collisions can provide detailed information about the hot, dense plasma formed in these collisions at the LHC. Jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the mass of the fragmenting parton. For light partons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung is expected to dominate, while for heavy-quark-initiated jets, collisional energy loss may play a more important role. This energy loss mechanism can be studied by measuring differences in the suppression of $b$-tagged and inclusive jets in $pp$ and Pb+Pb collisions. Besides the $b$-tagged jet measurements, an alternative method for probing the interactions of heavy quarks with the plasma is the study of the correlations between heavy-quark pairs, which is sensitive to the relative importance of collisional versus radiative scattering processes.

Simulations are performed using the linear Boltzmann transport model with event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds.

Jets,parallel,Identifying jet observables which can see the short-length structure of QGP,"Rajagopal, Krishna",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Quark-gluon plasma, which is a strongly coupled liquid at its natural length scales, must at the same time feature weakly coupled quark and gluon quasiparticles that appear only in hard processes that can resolve its short-length structure. In particular, high-energy partons in a jet shower can scatter off, and kick, the quark and gluon quasiparticles within a droplet of QGP when these Moliere scattering processes occur with a large enough momentum transfer. Here, we implement this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model for jets in heavy ion collisions. 

Throughout its evolution within the expanding cooling droplet of QGP, the shower of jet and recoil partons inject energy and momentum into the QGP, producing wakes. The large impact of the wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the medium on jet observables makes finding distinctive signatures of scattering off QGP quasiparticles challenging.

The hybrid model is particularly valuable for identifying observables that are more/less sensitive to consequences of scattering off quasiparticles and less/more sensitive to consequences of wakes in the QGP because when we turn Moliere scattering off the model contains no effects of scattering — energy loss in the model arises from strongly coupled physics, not from scattering.  

We show that jet shapes and fragmentation functions are more sensitive to the contribution of the wake to the reconstructed, and identify various groomed jet observables (eg soft drop splitting angle, leading $k_T$, and girth) that are insensitive to this contribution and that show reasonable sensitivity to scattering off quasiparticles, with those in gamma-jet events of particular interest. We also investigate Z-hadron correlation observables and Z-jet acoplanarity observables constructed with the winner-take-all definition of the jet direction. We construct several promising observables from inclusive subjets within jets, and show that Moliere scattering increases the number of subjets and yields subjets which are more widely distributed and more widely separated.  These observables are unaffected by the wake; they are directly sensitive to “sprouting a new subjet”, the intrinsic feature of Moliere scattering which makes its effects different from those of the wake.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Krishna', 'last_name': 'Rajagopal', 'fullName': 'Rajagopal, Krishna', 'id': '7818836', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '2c68a5f0ec1dce250f21eee4b240232f', 'db_id': 7818836, 'person_id': 7542994}"

QCD at finite T and density,parallel,Global angular momentum generation in heavy-ion reactions within a hadronic transport approach,"Sass, Nils",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"In 2017, the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured finite global angular momentum in heavy-ion collisions through a spin polarization measurement of $\Lambda$ hyperons. This measurement revealed a high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence for vorticity in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for the first time. In order to investigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of angular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium transport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is applied to study the generation of global angular momentum by the interaction of two nuclei. As SMASH provides access to the whole phase-space evolution of every particle at any given time, it allows to assess the fraction of angular momentum generated in the fireball by all participants. We confirm the previous modeling by Becattini \textit{et al} within a geometric Glauber model approach, which found that the angular momentum transfer reaches a unique maximum in mid-central collisions during time evolution [arXiv:2212.14385v1]. The corresponding impact parameter is around $b=4-6$ fm for all beam energies from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.41-200$ GeV.

Its $p_\mathrm{T}$-dependence is similar to that of other charm and beauty hadrons but with its minimum shifted towards higher $p_\mathrm{T}$. Comparing the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}/\mathrm{D}^{0}$ production ratio in pp and PbPb collisions suggests that coalescence as an hadronization process is not significant for $p_\mathrm{T} > 10$~GeV/c. The ratio becomes comparable to the measurements in $\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}$ collisions for $p_\mathrm{T} > 30$~GeV/c.

Heavy Flavor,parallel,Studies of heavy quark dynamics using B mesons with the CMS experiment,"Sheng, Tzu-An",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Heavy quarks are one of the most powerful probes to study the properties of quark-gluon plasma.

The measured B meson nuclear modification factors over an extended transverse momentum range provide important information about the diffusion of beauty quarks and the flavor dependence of in-medium energy loss. In addition, understanding the hadronization mechanism is crucial for extracting the transport properties of the QGP. The $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{s}^{0}/\mathrm{B}^{+}$ yield ratio in pp and PbPb can thus shed light on beauty hadronization mechanisms from small to large systems and on the relevance of parton recombination in the medium. We also report the first observation of the $\mathrm{B}_\mathrm{c}^{+}$ meson in PbPb collisions. Given the low production cross-section in pp collisions, its production could be significantly enhanced by the recombination of beauty with charm quarks present in the hypothesized medium, providing additional insights into the recombination mechanism.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tzu-An', 'last_name': 'Sheng', 'fullName': 'Sheng, Tzu-An', 'id': '7974410', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': '177bd4854c6d63f17366cfa8661817f2', 'db_id': 7974410, 'person_id': 7690214}"
Critical Point,parallel,Location of the QCD critical point predicted by holographic Bayesian analysis,"Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Predictions for the QCD critical point are made using Bayesian inference techniques within the holographic gauge/gravity correspondence. For that, we employ a Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model capable of reproducing the latest lattice QCD results at zero and finite baryon density, known to predict a high-density critical endpoint. For the first time, we numerically find the posterior probability distribution for holographic model parameters from the lattice data at zero chemical potential, and extract their most likely values. This is possible thanks to new numerical developments which, by boosting the performance of our calculations, allow us to sample a large number of fits to the data via Monte Carlo methods. Thus, we find the maximum a posteriori estimate for the location of the critical point, as well as estimates for the corresponding statistical error bands. We determine the linear combination of model parameters which is the most relevant for these uncertainties and investigate its role for the equation of state at lower densities. Our analysis is performed for two competing model parametrizations, one of which may or may not present a critical point for samples of the prior distribution. We use the posterior distribution for this parametrization to infer the probability that a QCD critical point exists and is situated in a region of the phase diagram that can be probed by ongoing and future heavy ion collision experiments. Preliminary results favor a critical point around a baryon chemical potential of $570 - 650$ MeV and a temperature of $99 - 107$ MeV, with most of the uncertainty concentrated along a single line.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mauricio', 'last_name': 'Hippert Teixeira', 'fullName': 'Hippert Teixeira, Mauricio', 'id': '7818851', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign', 'emailHash': '22b7a8899e5b8f2b4152e676a052d67a', 'db_id': 7818851, 'person_id': 7531715}"

The measurements are based on alpha-stable symmetric L\'evy sources, and we discuss the average pair transverse mass dependence of the source parameters. One of the parameters, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, is of particularly importance. It describes the shape of the source, which, in the vicinity of the critical point of the phase diagram, may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$. Its measurement hence may contribute to the search for and characterization of the critical endpoint of the phase diagram.

Moreover, one of the most important goals of NA61/SHINE is to investigate and understand the phase structures of this matter. The investigation of the phase-diagram can be achieved by varying the beam momentum (13A-150(8)A GeV/c) or by changing the collision system (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). This method enables to perform a two-dimensional scan of the phase diagram of QCD. Investigating HBT correlations are related to the critical exponent $\eta$, describing the spatial correlation.

Critical Point,parallel,Critical Expectations: Non-Gaussian Cumulants of Particle Multiplicities Near the Critical Point,"Sushama Pradeep, Maneesha",Unknown,Unknown,"It has long been understood that non-monotonic variation of non-Gaussian cumulants of particle multiplicities as a function of decreasing collision energy and, hence, increasing baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ can yield tell-tale signatures of the presence of a possible critical point in the QCD phase diagram. In this talk, we shall present quantitative estimates for the magnitude and $\mu_B$-dependence of the skewness and kurtosis of the proton multiplicity as a function of the separation $\Delta T$ between the temperature at a critical point and at freezeout.  These provide a modern update of estimates first attempted in [1], for the first time including the effects of the change in the sign of the critical contribution to the kurtosis discovered in [2] in a way that incorporates the mapping between the universal physics around an Ising critical point onto the QCD phase diagram [3,4].  

Several of us have recently quantified the reduction in the magnitude of the Gaussian cumulant of the proton multiplicity relative to equilibrium expectations, arising because both critical slowing down and baryon number conservation limit the growth of critical fluctuations [5].  In this talk, we describe how the dynamics in the critical regime (including critical slowing down and baryon number conservation) limit the growth of the non-Gaussian cumulants.  It has been understood since they were first proposed as signatures of a critical point that dynamical effects make the actual cumulants much smaller than they would be in equilibrium; for the first time, we estimate how much smaller.  We close by using the newly developed maximum entropy freezeout procedure [6] to make estimates of the magnitude of the skewness and kurtosis of proton multiplicity that can be expected in RHIC BES data if nature places a critical point near where these collisions freeze out.

Critical Point,parallel,Probing the nature of the QCD phase transition with higher-order net-proton number fluctuation and local parton density fluctuation measurements at RHIC-STAR,"Neff, Dylan",CEA-Saclay,Unknown,"Higher-order cumulants ($C_n$) of net-baryon distributions are sensitive to the nature of the QCD phase transition. Recent lattice QCD calculations [1] suggest a negative $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in the crossover regime at small baryon chemical potential ($\mu_B \leq$ 110 MeV). In addition, lattice QCD predicts a special ordering of cumulant ratios for systems of thermalized QGP [2]: $C_3/C_1 > C_4/C_2 > C_5/C_1 > C_6/C_2$. Both predictions can be tested in heavy-ion collision experiments by measuring higher-order cumulants of the net-proton multiplicity distributions.

In the high $\mu_B$ region of the QCD phase diagram, proton multiplicity distributions are utilized to probe characteristics of the phase transition. The variance of proton multiplicity within azimuthal subvolumes of phase space may provide insight into local parton density fluctuations. The deviation of this variance from a binomial baseline along with proton factorial cumulants over the full azimuth [3] may be observables sensitive to a possible first-order phase transition. 

In this talk, we report measurements of net-proton $C_5/C_1$ and $C_6/C_2$ in Au+Au collisions with center-of-mass energies from 3 GeV to 200 GeV, where the 3 GeV data are from the fixed-target program and the other data sets are from the Beam Energy Scan program phase I at RHIC-STAR. Proton factorial cumulants and the variance of proton multiplicities in azimuthal partitions are also presented. The cumulant measurements are compared with a QCD-based FRG model, UrQMD, and HRG calculations as well as lattice QCD calculations. The AMPT and MUSIC+FIST models are used as non-critical references in the search for local density fluctuations.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Thermalization of QGP through transverse momentum fluctuation in ultra-central Pb+Pb collision,"Samanta, Rupam","AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow, Poland and Institute of Theoretical Physics, CEA, Paris-Saclay University,  Gif-sur-Yvette, France",Unknown,"We report the first direct evidence of thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision, by studying the fluctuation of mean transverse momentum per particle ($\langle p_t \rangle$) in ultra-central Pb+Pb collision. The recent experimental data from the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), provides measurement of variance of $\langle p_t \rangle$ at fixed multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and a steep fall of the variance is observed over a narrow range of $N_{ch}$, for most of the central collision events (Fig. 14 and 15, \href{https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HION-2021-01/}{ATLAS : HION-2021-01}). Such a behaviour cannot be reproduced by previously existing models, such as HIJING which treats Pb+Pb collisions as a superposition of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. However, our model results can accurately reproduce the peculiar pattern in the variance of $\langle p_t \rangle$ that is observed by ATLAS. To explain such a novel phenomenon, we argue that at a given multiplicity, the impact parameter ($b$) fluctuation plays an important role; the transverse momentum per particle increases with the increasing impact parameter. A larger $b$ corresponds to a smaller collision volume resulting in a higher density. In relativistic thermodyanimcs, a higher density corresponds to a higher initial temperature which implies a larger energy per particle leading to a larger $\langle p_t  \rangle$. Thus at a fixed $N_{ch}$, a higher $\langle p_t  \rangle$  at a larger b is the effect of the thermalization of the system at a higher temperature. To illustrate this point further, we provide results for Pb+Pb collision from hydrodynamic simulation with TRENTO + MUSIC at b=0 and compare with corresponding HIJING results. From the hydro results, we find a very strong correlation between $\langle p_t \rangle$ and $N_{ch}$ at fixed impact parameter, which is not observed in HIJING where there is no thermalization. The strong correlation is the consequence of the thermalization that is assumed in the hydro simulation.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,What carries baryon number? Simulations of baryon and electric charge stopping in isobar collisions.,"Pihan, Gregoire",Unknown,Unknown,"It is a fundamental question to understand what is the effective carrier of conserved quantum charges inside a proton at high energy.

This measurement is compatible with the picture where the baryon number is carried by gluon junctions. In this work, we develop a comprehensive (3+1)D relativistic hydrodynamic framework with multiple conserved charge currents. We employ the 3D MC-Glauber model for the initial conditions, which allows for modeling baryon stopping separately from electric charge stopping within the string junction picture. Simulating the coupled propagation of net baryon and electric charge currents including the charge-dependent lattice-QCD-based equation of state, we study how net baryon and electric charges are evolved during different stages of heavy-ion collisions.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Can we observe using the collective flow effects of the early nonequilirium dynamics,"Bozek, Piotr",AGH University of Science and Technology,Poland,"The early dynamics in heavy-ion collisions involves a rapid, far from equilibrium evolution. This early pre-equilibrium stage of the dynamics can be modeled using kinetic equations. The effect of this pre-equilibrium stage on final observables derived from transverse momenta of emitted particles is negligible. Therefore, the kinetic equations in the relaxation time approximation for a non-boost invariant system are solved (P.Bozek     Phys.Rev.C 107 (2023) 034916). The asymmetry of the flow with respect to the reaction plane at different rapidities is found to be very sensitive to the degree of non-equilibrium in the evolution. This suggests that the rapidity odd directed flow is a sensitve probe of the  occurrence of non-equilibrium effects and could be used to estimate the asymmetry of the pressure between the longitudinal and transverse directions. The study of kinetic evolution in the longitudinal direction allows also a modelling of the early pre-Bjorken flow stage of the equilibration.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Piotr', 'last_name': 'Bozek', 'fullName': 'Bozek, Piotr', 'id': '7818921', 'affiliation': 'AGH University of Science and Technology', 'emailHash': '28a7ce84819af788c07a345f60a73401', 'db_id': 7818921, 'person_id': 7532684}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Quenching minijets in a concurrent jet+hydro evolution and its consequences for extracting transport coefficients of QGP,"Singh, Mayank",University of Minnesota,USA,"Intermediate pT jets (minijets) are created by initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collision experiments. They can constitute a significant portion of the particle multiplicity but do not lend themselves to hydrodynamic treatment as their transverse momenta are larger than the typical saturation scale of the bulk matter.Their orientation is independent of the underlying event and they can significantly reduce flow in the collective motion of the bulk medium. They also introduce an additional source of fluctuations.

We study minijets in a new jet+hydro concurrent framework where jet quenching leads to energy and momentum injection in the QGP. Minijets are sampled using PYTHIA and hydro is initialized using the IPGlasma framework. Both of these are concurrently evolved using MUSIC with the minijet quenching being governed by the Hybrid Model. Both the jet and thermal hadrons do hadronic cascade through UrQMD after the freezeout.

We find that this effort requires substantial recalibration of the transport coefficients in hydrodynamic simulations to explain the data. As extraction of transport properties is one of the major goals of the heavy-ion program, we posit that this significant contribution needs to be accounted for. We will also discuss the effect of these minijets on observables like pT-spectra, flow vn and correlations between different vn_s.

Cases involving Au+Au collisions are considered, performed at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV. The dynamics in the beam direction is constrained using the measured pseudo-rapidity distribution of charged particles and the net proton rapidity distribution. Within this framework, the directed flow of mesons is driven by the sideward pressure gradient from the tilted source, and that of baryons mainly due to the initial asymmetric baryon distribution with respect to the beam axis driven by the transverse expansion. Our approach successfully reproduces the rapidity- and beam energy-dependence of $v_1$ for both mesons and baryons. We find that the $v_1(y)$ of baryons has strong constraining power on the initial baryon stopping, and together with that of mesons, the directed flow probes the equation of state of the dense nuclear matter at finite chemical potentials. We also provide predictions for the upcoming STAR Beam Energy Scan II measurements of the pseudo-rapidity dependent $v_1$ for charged particles at 27 GeV.

Chirality,parallel,Post-blind Analysis of Isobar Collisions and Background-controlled Upper Limit on the Chiral Magnetic Effect from STAR,"Feng, Yicheng",Purdue University,USA,"The STAR Collaboration has reported results from a blind analysis of isobar collisions (${^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}+{^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}$, ${^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}+{^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}$) at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV on the search for the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Significant differences were observed in the measured multiplicity ($N$) and elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$) between the two isobar systems [1]. The isobar ratio (Ru/Zr) of CME-sensitive observable, $v_2$-scaled charge separation ($\Delta\gamma/v_2$) is close to but systematically larger than the inverse multiplicity ($1/N$) ratio. This indicates the potential existence of a CME signal, as well as the presence of remaining background that is different between the isobars [2]. In this contribution, we present two post-blind analyses of the isobar data that address the remaining backgrounds and attempt to extract any possible CME signal. One of the analysises applies a weighting procedure such that the two isobar systems have identical distributions of $N$ and $v_{2}$, and then compares the CME-sensitive observables ($\Delta\gamma$ correlator and signed Balance Functions [3]) between two isobars with matched $N$ and $v_{2}$. The other analysis examines the two- and three-particle nonflow contributions to the isobar ratio of $\Delta\gamma / v_{2}$ using real data as well as HIJING simulation. This allows the estimation of a modified background baseline for the $\Delta\gamma/v_2$ ratio.  The overall contribution of nonflow is found to be positive, resulting in a background baseline larger than the inverse multiplicity ratio and generally consistent with the isobar measurements. We extract an upper limit of the CME signal in isobar collisions.

Chirality,parallel,Impact of globally spin-aligned vector mesons on the search for the chiral magnetic effect in heavy-ion collisions,"Shen, Diyu",Fudan University,Unknown,"In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the chiral magnetic effect (CME) is predicted to arise from the interplay between the chirality imbalance of quarks in the nuclear medium and the intense magnetic field, and will cause a charge separation along the magnetic field direction. While the search for the CME is still ongoing in experiments at  Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),  the CME-sensitive observables need to be scrutinized to exclude the non-CME contributions. In this work, we examine the influence of globally spin-aligned $\rho$ mesons on the   $\gamma_{112}$ correlator, the $R_{\Psi_2}(\Delta S)$ correlator, and the signed balance functions, via a toy model and a multiphase transport model (AMPT). The global spin alignment of vector mesons could originate from non-CME mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions, and is  characterized by the 00-component of the spin density matrix, $\rho_{00}$. We find that the CME observables show similar dependence on $\rho_{00}$, and could receive  a positive (negative) contribution from $\rho$-decay pions,  if the $\rho_{00}$ of $\rho$ mesons is larger (smaller) than 1/3. Since pions are the most abundant particles in such collisions, the $\rho_{00}$ measurements for $\rho$ mesons become crucial to the interpretation of the CME data.

Chirality,parallel,A new stable and causal theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics,"Abboud, Nick",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Over the past decade, considerable research effort has focused on investigating macroscopic consequences of anomalies in quantum field theories. In particular, chiral matter is expected to exhibit novel transport phenomena arising from the interplay between quantum anomalies and electromagnetic and vortical fields [1]. In order to study these effects in fluid systems like the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions, it is important to develop consistent theories of relativistic chiral hydrodynamics which capture the underlying anomaly and include dissipation. Attempts to develop such theories--even their dissipationless counterparts--have suffered from fundamental issues of acausality, instability, and ill-posedness of the initial value problem [2]. Following an effective field theory approach [3-7], we have constructed a first-order relativistic chiral hydrodynamic theory which is stable and causal within a range of values of transport coefficients. This is the first viscous theory of relativistic chiral hydrodynamics that can be used in numerical simulations of heavy-ion collisions.

The STAR collaboration recently observed a large global spin alignment of $\phi$-mesons in Au+Au collisions using the data from the first phase of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program (BES-I) [1]. This cannot be explained by conventional mechanisms but may be attributable to the influence of vector meson force fields. In this contribution, we present new measurement of $\rho^0$ global spin alignment as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and centrality for Au+Au, Ru+Ru, and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We discuss the implications of our results for the search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect, as the global spin alignment of $\rho^0$ mesons can effectively influence the measurement of charge separation across the reaction plane. Additionally, we present new precision and differential measurements of $\phi$-meson global spin alignment as a function of $p_T$, centrality, and rapidity (y) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 14.6, and 19.6 GeV, using higher-statistics data from the BES-II program. Furthermore, we have conducted a comparative study of the global spin alignment of $\phi(s,\bar{s})$, $\omega(u,\bar{u},d,\bar{d})$, and $J/\psi(c,\bar{c})$ through hadronic or leptonic decay modes in isobar collisions of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  These studies with more differential measurements and with vector mesons of various quark contents aim to understand the role of the strong field in nuclear structure and the evolution of nuclear matter.

Chirality,parallel,QGP vortex rings as a new probe for jet-induced medium response and longitudinal dynamics,"Matioli Serenone, Willian",Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamics provides quantitative descriptions of various flow measurements in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting the strongly-coupled nature of the hot QCD matter. A ubiquitous phenomenon in fluid dynamics is the formation of vortex rings. In heavy-ion collisions, different conditions can give rise to toroidal vortex structure in the QGP medium, such as the medium's response to jet thermalization [1] and the early-stage longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collisions [2]. Considering these scenarios, in this talk, we will present a systematic study of how $\Lambda$ hyperon's polarization can probe these toroidal vortex structures in QGP. We define a ""ring observable"" in terms of the $\Lambda$ production plane polarization [2]. It represents a measure of the effects caused by the vorticity induced in the ring formation. By conducting event-by-event analysis with the state-of-the-art (3+1)D theoretical framework [3, 4], we demonstrate that this ring observable is a highly sensitive probe for thermalizing energy-momentum currents deposited from high-energy jets and for the early-time longitudinal dynamics in asymmetric collision systems. An experimental indication of such ``smoke rings'' formed in the QGP would represent a significant advancement in studying the emergent phenomena of many-body QCD at multiple length scales.

Chirality,parallel,Hyperon Polarization in Heavy Ion Collisions from STAR,"Gou, Xingrui",Shandong University,Unknown,"The observation of hyperon polarization has revealed the existence of large vorticities in the medium created by heavy-ion collisions. Global polarization indicates vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to the system's orbital angular momentum. The difference of global polarization between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperon can provide essential insights into the late-stage magnetic field sustained by the QGP.

With the high-statistics data collected by the STAR experiment for isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200$ GeV, we present the measurements of global polarization for $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, and $\Xi^{\pm}$ as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and azimuthal angle relative to the event plane.

Recently, it was discovered that the linear polarization of the photons involved in these processes can enable measurements of the nuclear geometry through the so-called entanglement-enabled spin interference with the $\rho^{0}$ meson. However, the possibility that the interference can happen at the level of vector mesons cannot be falsified using $\rho^{0}$ data. The longer lifetime and non-localized wave function of $J/\psi$ at the time of its decay would not result in an interference pattern similar to the $\rho^0$ unless the entanglement occurs between the photon and the Pomeron phases emitted from each nucleus, providing an opportunity to study the source of the entanglement.

In this talk, we will report first measurements of the differential cross sections of photoproduced $J/\psi$ as functions of rapidity $y$ and $p^{2}_{T} \approx -t$ (up to $2.25~\rm{(GeV/c)^2}$) in Au+Au UPCs at $\sqrt{s_{_\mathrm{NN}}}=200$ GeV recorded by STAR.

We also present the first measurement of the interference pattern for those photoproduced  $J/\psi$. The observation of a positive $\cos(2\Delta \phi)$ modulation in the angular separation between the $J/\psi$ and one of its decay daughters is predicted to be a signature of entanglement between the photon and Pomeron phases.

In ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of relativistic heavy ions, the coherent heavy-flavor vector meson production via photon-nuclear interactions is of particular interest, since its cross section is sensitive to the nuclear gluon density. However, in symmetric UPCs, a two-way ambiguity in determining the photon-emitter and the target prevents the extraction of contributions involving high- and low-energy photon-nucleus interactions. This limitation, therefore, had so far reduced our capability to probe the extremely small-$x$ regime.

Light Flavor,parallel,$\Sigma^0$ reconstruction in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV with the HADES experiment,"Becker, Marten",Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen,Unknown,"In this contribution we will discuss the production of $\Sigma^0$ baryons in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV beam energy measured by HADES. Although, the High Acceptance DiElectron Spectrometer (HADES) at GSI was primarily designed to measure Di-Electrons, it also features a very rich program measuring hadronic probes in the region of moderate temperature and high-baryon density in the QCD phase diagram. Recently, the spectrometer was upgraded with a new RICH photon detector and an electromagnetic calorimeter. While the first allows for a strongly improved electron identification, the latter allows for photon measurements in HADES for the first time without involving the conversion process.

Those experimental upgrades allow for a clear reconstruction of the $\Sigma^0$ baryon in Ag+Ag collisions at 1.58 AGeV beam energy in the electromagnetic decay to Lambda and photon. This collision energy is right at threshold for Lambda production, however it's below for the Sigma0. In p+p collisions a rise of the $\Lambda/\Sigma^0$ ratio is measured, which, if also existent for A+A collisions, would have strong impact on the extraction of ($T,\mu_B$) values from thermal models as the $\Lambda/\Sigma^0$ is usually fixed following isospin symmetry. The analysis presented in this work allows for a $\Sigma^0$ signal with a significance of roughly 10 in the $\Lambda \gamma$ channel while no signal is observed in the $\Lambda e^{\pm}$ channel reconstructing conversion photons and, if existing, Dalitz decays. Full acceptance and efficiency studies allow for a fully corrected $\Sigma^0$ production yield, extracting a $(\Lambda+\Sigma^0)/\Sigma^0$ ratio.

Light Flavor,parallel,Cluster formation near midrapidity - can the mechanism be identified experimentally?,"Bratkovskaya, Elena","GSI, Darmstadt",Germany,"Authors: G. Coci, S. Glässel, V. Kireyeu, J. Aichelin, C. Blume, V. Kolesnikov, V. Voronyuk and E. Bratkovskaya


The formation of weakly bound clusters and hypernuclei in the hot and dense environment at midrapidity is one of the surprising phenomena observed experimentally in heavy-ion collisions from low SIS to ultra-relativistic LHC energies. This is also known as the `ice in a fire' puzzle. Three approaches have been advanced to describe the formation of clusters:  cluster formation during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interactions between nucleons  ('potential mechanism') and deuteron production by catalytic hadronic reactions ('kinetic mechanism') as well as by coalescence at  kinetic freeze-out. 

We present here results from PHQMD [1,2], a novel microscopic n-body transport model based on the QMD propagation of the baryonic degrees of freedom with density dependent 2-body potential interactions. The clusters, formed via 'potential' mechanism, are recognized by the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm  which is identifying bound clusters by correlations of baryons in coordinate space.
The PHQMD approach allows for studying in the same framework the two above mentioned mechanisms,  to investigate  how and when clusters are formed and finally for comparing the results with present data from GSI to RHIC energies. 

We report on our recent findings, in particular that:

- The clusters produced via coalescence and potential mechanisms are created after the fast hadrons are escaped from the reaction zone, i.e.  clusters remain in transverse direction closer to the center of the heavy-ion collision than free nucleons. Thus, since the 'fire' is not at the same place as the 'ice', cluster can survive which explains the ice in the fire puzzle. Our PHQMD results for deuteron production by potential mechanism agree quantitatively with results of UrQMD for coalescence deuterons, thus, this finding doesn't depend on the transport model involved.
            
- For the `kinetic' deuterons the PHQMD results agrees with those from SMASH - if one limits the catalytic hadronic reaction channels to those realized in SMASH, however, accounting for all isospin channels of the various $\pi NN\leftrightarrow \pi d$, $NNN\leftrightarrow N d$ reactions leads to an enhanced production of deuterons.
      
- On the other hand, we find that considering the quantum nature of the deuteron --  by taking into account  the finite size properties of the deuteron by means of an excluded volume in coordinate space and by the projection onto the deuteron wave function in momentum space -- reduces substantially the kinetic deuteron production in a dense medium as encountered in heavy-ion collisions. This makes the 'kinetic' mechanism sub-dominant compared to the deuteron formation by potential interactions between nucleons. 
 
- The sum of kinetic deuterons and that produced in by potential interactions reproduces well the experimental data from SIS to RHIC energies
      
- The coalescence deuterons and potential deuterons have only about 20\% of the nucleons in common. This leads to a different rapidity distribution and to a different $p_T$-distribution at low $p_T$. This difference can be used to identify experimentally the production mechanism which is realized in nature.

- Heavier clusters like $t$, $^3He$ and $^4He$ as well has hypernuclei are also well reproduced by the potential mechanism

Some of the presented result have been published in Refs. [3,4,5].

Light Flavor,parallel,High-$p_t$ suppression in small systems,"Faraday, Cole",University of Cape Town,Unknown,"We present first results for light and heavy flavor high-$p_T$ hadron suppression from a short path length corrected energy loss model in $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions at RHIC and the LHC. We find that the short path length corrections to final state radiative energy loss for light flavor hadrons predict nontrivial enhancement such that high multiplicity $R_{pA} > 1$, consistent with data. We further systematically check the consistency of the assumptions—such as collinearity, softness, and large formation time—made in the derivation of radiative energy loss, with the final numerical model. We find that the large formation time approximation breaks down at modest to high momenta $p_T \geq 30~\mathrm{GeV}$. Comparison to data at higher momenta thus requires a rederivation of GLV, DGLV, and short path length correction results; with the large formation time assumption relaxed. We also show that the usual elastic energy loss treatment vastly overpredicts the suppression in small systems; thus, small path length corrections to elastic energy loss are required for quantitative comparison to data in small systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cole', 'last_name': 'Faraday', 'fullName': 'Faraday, Cole', 'id': '7819112', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '9bee6c8b536a93abf5e931ee559443ce', 'db_id': 7819112, 'person_id': 7563161}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Constraining the medium properties with the anisotropic flow and its correlations in Pb--Pb collisions at the highest energy with ALICE,"Mordasini, Cindy",University of Jyvaskyla (FI),Germany,"Characterization of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions requires identifying observables sensitive to the different phases of the collision. Previous studies have shown that measurements of the azimuthal anisotropic flow and the complex interplay between its harmonics can provide valuable information on the QGP transport properties.

In this talk, we present the latest flow measurements done by ALICE in Pb--Pb collisions. We show the first results of the anisotropic flow coefficients of inclusive charged particles obtained at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.36$ TeV, which is the highest centre-of-mass energy reached in the laboratory for heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the first measurements of the newly developed asymmetric cumulants at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV indicate the existence of complex correlations between the different orders of the flow amplitudes. Finally, we highlight the first experimental results of the recent Gaussian Estimator, designed to measure correlations between symmetry planes more precisely. These results are compared with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cindy', 'last_name': 'Mordasini', 'fullName': 'Mordasini, Cindy', 'id': '7909005', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyvaskyla (FI)', 'emailHash': '31376ec954c4c1f5ca4c3983ba7382d6', 'db_id': 7909005, 'person_id': 7681663}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Simulating collectivity in dense baryon matter with multiple fluids,"Tomasik, Boris",Univerzita Mateja Bela (SK),Unknown,"We present a novel multi-fluid approach to simulate heavy-ion collisions in the region of RHIC Beam Energy Scan and FAIR experiments. This region of collision energies from few to few tens of GeV is particularly interesting for the exploration of dense baryon matter and search of the critical point of QCD. However, fluid-dynamical modelling here poses notable challenges. Contraction of the incoming nuclei is much weaker, which results in a long inter-penetration phase and a complex initial-state geometry. Conventional hydrodynamic models, where the fluid phase starts at a fixed proper time τ0, therefore miss the compression stage of the collision. Hence, they miss the key sensitivity to the EoS of the dense medium.
In our approach [1], we circumvent this issue by representing the incoming nuclei as two cold, baryon-rich fluids with appropriate energy and baryon densities. The newly produced matter is represented by a third baryon-free fluid, which is generated by the friction between the two colliding fluids. Our MUlti Fluid simulation for Fast IoN collisions (MUFFIN) model is implemented from scratch using a versatile 3+1 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE. We present benchmark calculations for Au-Au collisions at different RHIC BES energies and discuss the challenges in constructing the approach.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,Bayesian calibration of viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic simulations of heavy-ion collisions*,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,Unknown,"Due to large pressure gradients at early times, standard hydrodynamic model simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions do not become reliable until $O(1)$ fm/$c$ after the collision. To address this one often introduces a pre-hydrodynamic stage that models the early evolution microscopically, typically as a conformal, weakly interacting gas. In such an approach the transition from the pre-hydrodynamic to the hydrodynamic stage is discontinuous, introducing considerable theoretical model ambiguity. Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled macroscopically using the recently developed Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics (VAH). In high-energy heavy-ion collisions VAH is applicable already at very early times, and at later times transitions smoothly into conventional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH). We present a Bayesian calibration of a multi-stage dynamical evolution model built around a VAH fluid dynamic core with experimental data for $p_T$-integrated observables from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find that the VAH model has the unique capability of constraining the specific viscosities of the QGP at higher temperatures than other previously used models [1]. We also find that the model has fewer tensions with the $p_T$-integrated input data than the previously calibrated JETSCAPE SIMS model [2]. Finally, we use the calibrated VAH and JETSCAPE SIMS models, with the four different particlization models studied in [2], to predict a number of $p_T$- *differential* observables, including $p_T$-spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_{2,3,4}\{2\}(p_T)$ for several identified hadron hadron species. We find [3] that the $p_T$-dependence of the anisotropic flow coefficients is *very sensitive* to the choice of particlization model, and that the VAH predictions agree with available data much better than all available calibrated variants of the JETSCAPE SIMS model. We therefore propose the VAH approach as a superior framework for describing the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions at LHC energies.

Collective Dynamics,parallel,First-Order Event Plane Correlated Directed and Triangular Flow in BES-II Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Liu, Xiaoyu",Rice University,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, the measurements of anisotropic flow coefficient ($v_n$) offer insights into collective hydrodynamic expansion and transport properties of the produced medium at higher collision energies, while they are sensitive to the compressibility of the nuclear matter and nuclear equation of state at lower collision energies. The second phase of the Beam Energy Scan program (BES-II) was carried out at RHIC to focus on the most crucial energy range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =7.7$ GeV to $27$ GeV in collider mode and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV to $7.7$ GeV in fixed-target mode, providing an ideal lever-arm to explore $v_n$. For such energies, the STAR BES-II upgrades enable us to measure $v_n$ in a wide pseudorapidity ($\eta$) range with high precision.

Directed flow ($v_1$) describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles and nuclear fragments in heavy-ion collisions, and it is sensitive to early non-equilibrium dynamics. The measurement of $v_1$ in a wide $\eta$ range allows us to test the phenomenon of limiting fragmentation and provides insights into the baryon-stopping mechanism. On the other hand, triangular flow ($v_3$) in nuclear collisions is often mentioned as being developed from event-by-event geometrical fluctuations in the participant region which has no correlation to the first-order event plane ($\Psi_{1}$). However, recent measurements at lower collision energies show a correlation between $v_3$ and $\Psi_1$.

In this contribution, we will show the measurement of charged particle $v_1$ over six units of $\eta$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=27$ and $19.6$ GeV and compare with transport and hydrodynamic model calculations. We will also show the results of $v_3$ in fixed-target mode for identified hadrons and light nuclei with respect to $\Psi_1$, comparing with theoretical models to identify the source of nonzero $v_3\{\Psi_1\}$ and to demonstrate its vital connection to the equation of state.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaoyu', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Xiaoyu', 'id': '7909002', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'abd75cf11050470993789907feb6e43b', 'db_id': 7909002, 'person_id': 7548558}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Chasing the onset of QCD thermalisation with ALICE,"Ciacco, Mario",Politecnico di Torino and INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"Deciphering the process of hadronization has long been a formidable challenge, in part due to its non-perturbative nature. Over the years, various phenomenological models have emerged, all attempting to unravel the complexity of hadron production. Despite their different theoretical foundations, many of these models successfully account for the average yield of hadrons. This has spurred the scientific community to search for innovative observables capable of discerning the fundamental principles governing these models. In pursuit of this goal, the ALICE Collaboration has studied an extensive array of event-by-event Pearson correlations between hadrons with distinct quantum numbers. Conducting a system size scan of these measurements unveils a powerful means to identify and analyze emerging QCD phenomena in small collision systems. In this presentation, ALICE will show the latest findings on antiproton--antideuteron and net-kaon--net-Xi correlations in various collision systems (pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb). These observables offer the advantage of being unaffected by resonance or weak decays. The measurements will be compared to various hadronization models, delving into the intriguing topic of the onset of thermalization in QCD matter. The measured correlations are used to estimate the correlation volume between hadrons stemming from the conservation of baryon and strange quantum numbers.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mario', 'last_name': 'Ciacco', 'fullName': 'Ciacco, Mario', 'id': '7908994', 'affiliation': 'Politecnico di Torino and INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '77a75d727c4c1f5990ecfbe04958641f', 'db_id': 7908994, 'person_id': 7681767}"
Collective Dynamics,parallel,Longitudinal Decorrelation Measurements from pp to A+A with the ATLAS detector,"Seidlitz, Blair Daniel",Columbia University (US),USA,"This talk presents a measurement of longitudinal decorrelation in $pp$ collisions with ATLAS. The deposited energy in the transverse $(x,y)$ plane is expected to vary, depending on the longitudinal $(z)$ slice examined, which is correlated with the rapidity of the produced particles. Thus, particles from different rapidity slices will have flow vectors that differ in magnitude and orientation due to the longitudinal variation, longitudinal decorrelation, which grows with increasing particle rapidity separation. For flow harmonic $n$, such longitudinal decorrelations have been characterized, for large systems, in terms of $r_n$, the ratio of large-rapidity-gap to small-rapidity-gap correlations. This analysis performs the first measurements of $r_n$ in $pp$ collisions at 5~TeV and 13~TeV. The analysis is carried out via a two-particle correlation method, utilizing charged tracks of varying $\eta$ within $|\eta|<2.5$ and topo-clusters of $4.0<|\eta_\mathrm{ref}|<4.9$. Because non-flow effects are more significant in $pp$ collisions, non-flow template subtraction procedures are applied. Final results are quoted for $r_2$ and its slope $F_2$, over a range of multiplicities. Similar non-flow subtraction techniques are applied to the full multiplicity range of Xe+Xe collision data and the results are compared to the two $pp$ energies at appropriate multiplicities. This gives some of the first detailed information on the correlation between longitudinal and transverse energy deposition in $pp$ collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Blair Daniel', 'last_name': 'Seidlitz', 'fullName': 'Seidlitz, Blair Daniel', 'id': '7908987', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '90fc7ffff90066b7c1bcf7b0841a4653', 'db_id': 7908987, 'person_id': 7555439}"
