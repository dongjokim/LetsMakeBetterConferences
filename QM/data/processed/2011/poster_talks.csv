Pre-equilibrium and initial state physics,poster,Nuclear suppression at large pT and xF: Direct photons from RHIC to LHC,"Cepila, Jan",Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FNSPE)-Czech Technical University in Prague,UK,"We discuss a common feature of all known reactions on nuclear targets - a significant suppression at large Feynman xF and large transverse momenta pT of produced particles. The main emphasis is devoted to production of prompt photons since they are not expected to be accompanied by any final state interaction, either energy loss or absorption. Therefore, besides the Cronin enhancement at medium pT and small isotopic corrections at larger pT, one should not expect any nuclear effects. However, data from the PHENIX experiment demonstrate a significant large-pT suppression in central d+Au and Au+Au collisions that cannot be induced by coherence phenomena. We demonstrate that such an unexpected result is subject to the energy sharing problem in multiple initial state interactions. Using the colour dipole approach we describe first the large-pT production of direct photons in the RHIC kinematic region in agreement with available data. We study also a rise of nuclear effects with rapidity(xF) caused besides corrections for energy deficit by an increasing onset of coherence phenomena. In the LHC energy range we analyze relative manifestation of these effects presenting predictions for large-pT suppression at different rapidities. We analyze also a contribution of gluon shadowing as a leading twist shadowing correction modifying nuclear effects especially at small pT.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jan', 'last_name': 'Cepila', 'fullName': 'Cepila, Jan', 'id': '1897655', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering (FNSPE)-Czech Technical University in Prague', 'emailHash': '5d711c25063f3a6521f530f704b1a421', 'db_id': 1897655, 'person_id': 2047418}"
Electromagnetic probes,poster,Dimuon pairs from In-In collision at  $\sqrt {s_{NN}} = 17.3$ GeV at SPS energies,"Sinha, Bikash",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"The invariant mass and transverse momentum spectra of lepton pairs 
for In-In collision at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}=17.3$ GeV have been studied. 
We find that the broadening of the $\rho$ mesons spectral function 
due to its interaction with the thermal baryons  causes substantial
excess of dimuons at low mass region. Both the spectra agrees 
well with the experimental observations made by the NA60 collaborations. We argue that the non-monotonic variation of the slope parameter extracted from the transverse mass  spectra for various invariant mass
bins indicate the presence of two different phases during the evolution of the
fireball.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bikash', 'last_name': 'Sinha', 'fullName': 'Sinha, Bikash', 'id': '1897651', 'affiliation': 'Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre', 'emailHash': '005118f79dda3baf8c7c40585b974130', 'db_id': 1897651, 'person_id': 2046945}"
Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,poster,Using separated bottom and charm contribution to pin down the role of radiative energy loss for heavy quarks,"Vogel, Sascha",Subatech,Unknown,"One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  
Although various features of heavy quark physics have been understood, several challenges remain. To further study the energy loss mechanism it is not only necessary to separate charm and bottom quarks but also 
to separate the two sources of energy loss, collisional or radiative energy loss.

In this contribution we present a method for extracting the difference between collisional and radiative energy loss of heavy quarks.
By analyzing separated bottom and charm contributions to the heavy quark spectrum one can gain information about the relative strength of radiative and collisional energy loss. 

This talk will give a detailed explanation of how one can separate this information experimentally and what we can learn from this analysis with respect to heavy quark energy loss. By using existing experimental data we will constrain the parameter space of energy loss physics and rule out several model parametrizations. 

A systematic parameter check with regard to RHIC data is carried out and perspectives for RHIC upgrades and the LHC will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sascha', 'last_name': 'Vogel', 'fullName': 'Vogel, Sascha', 'id': '1897646', 'affiliation': 'Subatech', 'emailHash': '1d43957710b20269bbcbe04d6e97b46c', 'db_id': 1897646, 'person_id': 2047654}"

QCD phase diagram,poster,U(1)A anomaly effects on phase diagrams in chiral random matrix model,"Sano, Takashi",University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Incorporating the background instanton effects, we extend the chiral
random matrix model to include the anomaly effect. 
The anomaly effect appears naturally as the flavor mixing determinant interaction terms,
which are missed in the conventional random matrix models.
Due to the determinant interaction terms, the model shows
the second-order phase transition for two massless-quark flavors and
the first-order for three light-quark flavors at finite temperatures.
We investigate the phase diagram of this model at finite T/mu and furthermore
at finite isospin and hypercharge chemical potentials.
We find that the critical point exists on T-mu plane with physical quark masses. 
We also find that the determinant terms cause the mixing not only between
the chiral condensates but also between the chiral and meson condensates,
which results in an enlargement of the region where, for example, 
both of the pion and the strange-quark chiral condensates have finite values.
The anomaly effects enrich the phase structure and 
we expect that this is also the case in QCD.

Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,poster,Heavy Quark Energy Loss in High Multiplicity Proton Proton Collisions at LHC,"Vogel, Sascha",Subatech,Unknown,"One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable stopping in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  

In this exploratory investigation we study the energy loss of heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton-proton collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy leads to multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC. The high energy densities reached in LHC collisions might create a deconfined state of matter even in elementary reactions. The interaction of heavy quarks with this environment gives rise to a non-negligible suppression of high momentum heavy quarks in elementary collisions. 
This probe will allow to further pin down the physical quantities of the phase transition to the Quark-Gluon-Plasma at LHC energies.

Electromagnetic probes,poster,Low pT direct photon production in 200GeV d+Au collisions measured by the PHENIX detector,"Yamaguchi, Yorito",University of Tokyo,United States,"Direct photons in low pT region have been of great interest for a long time since thermal photons from Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are considered to contribute predominantly.
Attempts to measure low pT direct photons using EMCals could not succeed since a finite energy resolution of the EMCal prevents us from separating direct photon signal from a large amount of background of hadron decay photons, particularly pi0.

Recently, the PHENIX experiment demonstrated that direct photon yield can be obtained even in low pT region via the di-electron measurement since direct photon internal conversions make enhanced yield of di-electrons over the known hadron decay contributions.
Comparing direct photon yields in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200~$GeV p+p and Au+Au collisions, a significant excess over the binary scaled p+p result is seen in Au+Au for pT<3GeV/c.

However, it should be confirmed that the observed excess of direct photons is not due to nuclear effects such as Cronin effect, nuclear anti-shadowing and so on, since nuclear effects are involved in Au+Au collisions but not in p+p collisions.
d+Au collision data can contribute to quantify nuclear effects on direct photon production.
The latest results of low pT direct photons from d+Au data taken in the Year-2008 RHIC Run will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yorito', 'last_name': 'Yamaguchi', 'fullName': 'Yamaguchi, Yorito', 'id': '1897620', 'affiliation': 'University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '25c2233e43cd7e3531ed777f14f85b4b', 'db_id': 1897620, 'person_id': 2047652}"
"Experiments upgrade, future facilities and instrumentations",poster,Studies for an upgrade of the ALICE Inner Tracking System,"Terrevoli, Cristina","Universita degli Studi di Bari-Universita & INFN, Bari for ALICE ITS Collaboration",United States,"Heavy quarks are fundamental probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter
formed at the extreme energy densities reached in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC. The heavy quark pairs (cc_bar
and bb_bar), which are produced in the very initial stage of the collision, come out from the interaction
region as hadrons, possibly as a part of a jet, and carry out information about the properties of the
traversed medium. Such information can be obtained from the study of the open charm and beauty
hadrons in the final state and of the associated jet. Charm and beauty hadrons decay weakly with a mean
free path of the order of few hundred microns. Therefore, their identification relies on the possibility of
resolving a decay vertex at distances of such order from the production one. The inner tracker of the ALICE
experiment (ITS), made of six layers of silicon detectors, has been designed and built to this purpose and is
providing the first results on the above mentioned item, though with some limitations. A detector based on
today’s frontier technologies would certainly offer new exciting possibilities within the physics scope
described above.
This contribution will present the studies on the upgrade of the ALICE ITS detector. At the moment, several
possible scenarios for the new detector layout and technologies are being considered. With respect to the
current ITS, the baseline idea for the upgraded tracker is to have a detection layer closer to the beam line
(which implies a beam pipe with smaller radius) and a larger number of layers instrumented with silicon
pixels. The track position resolution at the primary vertex could be improved by a factor 2–3.
 Besides the natural improvement of the measurement capabilities on the channels already well measured
with the present ITS, the upgraded ITS will offer the possibility of exploring new physics items. Examples are
the heavy flavor baryons, the exclusive decay channels of B-mesons, the production mechanisms of
hadrons containing more than one heavy quark.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cristina', 'last_name': 'Terrevoli', 'fullName': 'Terrevoli, Cristina', 'id': '1897619', 'affiliation': 'Universita degli Studi di Bari-Universita & INFN, Bari for ALICE ITS Collaboration', 'emailHash': 'd73b9fbc5d6ab794e2111564fe857bea', 'db_id': 1897619, 'person_id': 2047651}"

The research program comprises the exploration of  basic landmarks of the QCD phase diagram like transitions from hadronic to partonic phase, the region of first order de-confinement as well as chiral phase transition, and the critical end point. The proposed key observables include the measurement of low mass vector mesons and charmonia, which can be detected via their decay into the di-lepton channel. As the  leptons leave the hot and dense fireball without further interactions, hence they provide almost unscathed information about the interior of the collision zone where they are being created.

Such a deflection is the strongest for hadron-triggered jets which are often produced close to the surface of a dense medium due to trigger bias and travel against or tangential to the radial flow.

QCD phase diagram,poster,Study of the expansion and the phase transition of a quark plasma to an hadron phase with the NJL model using a new QMD approach.,"Marty, Rudy",Subatech,Unknown,"One of the challenges of present day in nuclear physics is the understanding of the phase transition between the quark gluon plasma and the hadronic world. We can divide space into cells to create a lattice of partons, or describe the transformation of energy via the Cooper-Frye formula, but in these cases we miss some dynamical aspects.

That is why I will present a study of the expansion and the phase transition with a QCD inspired model : the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. This model is particularly useful to describe quark matter at low temperature (below Λ_QCD). It provides an effective mass at finite (T,μ), and then cross sections and decay widths for hadrons (possible mixed phase).

Recent results are presented using these data within a Quantum Molecular Dynamics (QMD) code. This code is designed for local interactions at finite (T,μ). It is a fully relativistic code which is Lorentz invariant and avoids the No Interaction Theorem in a different way than previous similar attempts.

Finally we know that there are correlations inside the plasma before the phase transition.

Electromagnetic probes,poster,Di-electron analysis in Au+Au collisions using the PHENIX Hadron Blind Detector,"Atomssa, Ermias T.",Stony Brook University,USA,"The di-electron spectrum is rich with physics signals that assist the characterisation of the medium created in A+A collisions. The measurement, especially at low mass, is however complex due to a very low signal to background ratio. PHENIX has shown in the past that despite this difficulty, it is possible to learn for example about open charm production [1] or direct photons [2].

The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was built, installed and operated by PHENIX with the objective of reducing the combinatorial background of the di-electron spectrum. This background comes mainly from conversions and Dalitz decay electrons, most significantly, when one leg of the pair was swept out of the acceptance by the magnetic field, and thus contributes only to the combinatorial background. Current

Pre-equilibrium and initial state physics,poster,Effects of parton radiative processes on Quark-Gluon Plasma thermalization,"Zhang, Bin",Arkansas State University,USA,"Radiative processes and dynamical screening are important for a precise description of the dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions. When evolutions from inside-outside and thermal initial conditions are compared, the parton system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is found to be able to overcome expansion and move toward thermalization via parton collisions. Scaling behaviors show up in both the pressure anisotropy and the energy density evolutions. In particular, the pressure anisotropy evolution shows an approximate coupling constant scaling when radiative processes are included. It approaches an asymptotic time evolution on a time scale of 1 to 2 fm/c. The energy density evolution approaches an asymptotic time evolution that decreases slower than the ideal hydro evolution. These observations indicate that partial thermalization can be achieved and viscosity is important for the evolution during the early longitudinal expansion phase of a relativistic heavy ion collision.

Radiative processes are the driving force behind gluon chemical equilibration. The effects of these processes, or of chemical equilibration, on kinetic equilibration can be studied by comparing the evolution with only the elastic process to that including radiative processes. When the initial condition is close to chemical equilibrium, the opening up of the inelastic channels leads to more kinetic equilibration. If the initial condition is highly undersaturated, the additional production of particles quickly leads to smaller cross sections that counteract the increase in the particle number. Then kinetic equilibration is less sensitive to whether there are radiative processes. On the other hand, kinetic equilibration also affects chemical equilibration. As expected, when there are only elastic processes, the system goes farther and farther away from chemical equilibrium. It is interesting to see that systems with the same initial fugacity but different initial pressure anisotropies have different early fugacity evolutions.

In addition to the interplay between chemical equilibration and kinetic equilibration, the pressure anisotropy difference evolution for systems starting from different initial pressure anisotropies is studied to gain better insight into the approach to the asymptotic evolution. The difference evolution is found to follow an exponential proper time dependence after a short period of time. In the case that includes radiative processes, the larger the coupling constant or the larger the initial energy density, the faster the difference decreases. The evolution curves for different coupling constants and initial energy densities appear to come from the same point. Pressure anisotropy evolutions from thermal initial conditions and Color Glass Condensate motivated initial conditions are compared to study the effects of initial particle momentum distribution. Radiative processes are again shown to make a big difference in system evolution. When only the gluon elastic process is included, kinetic equilibration is sensitive to the initial momentum distribution. If radiative processes are included, the pressure anisotropy evolution is robust against changes in the initial momentum distribution.

New theoretical developments,poster,Understanding the equilibration of matter from time-dependent correlator,"Lin, Shu","MPI for Physics, Munich",United States,"The fast thermalization of Quark Gluon Plasma, as suggested by hydrodynamical simulation, is one of the central questions of heavy ion collisions. Theoretical understanding of the mechanism involves field theory out of equilibrium. While the perturbative method becomes less effective due to the strong coupling, the gauge/gravity duality can play an important role. In [1], we studied a gravitational collapse model, which is dual to an equilibration process of a homogeneous QGP. We found that the near-equilibrium correlators of different operators approach their thermal counterpart in a universal fashion. As a first step to explore the far from equilibrium regime, we studied a model with a moving mirror in AdS space [2]. We solved the spatially integrated time-dependent correlator in the dual field theory and found that the singularities of the correlator are consistent with the bulk-cone singularities conjecture [3]. Furthermore, we found a recursive relation among the leading order divergence of the singularities, which allow us to determine the divergences without solving the correlator explicitly [4]. Possible extension to a more realistic equilibration model will be discussed.

Pre-equilibrium and initial state physics,poster,Highly-anisotropic and strongly-dissipative hydrodynamics for early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.,"Ryblewski, Radoslaw",Institute of Nuclear Physics PAN,UK,"A new framework of highly-anisotropic hydrodynamics is introduced [1] that includes dissipation effects. Dissipation is defined by the form of the entropy source that depends on the pressure anisotropy and vanishes for the isotropic fluid. With a simple ansatz for the entropy source obeying general physical requirements, we are led to a non-linear equation describing the time evolution of the anisotropy in purely-longitudinal boost-invariant systems. Matter that is initially highly anisotropic approaches naturally the regime of the perfect fluid. Thus, the resulting evolution agrees with the expectations about the behavior of matter produced at the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. 



The equilibration is identified with the processes of entropy production. For purely longitudinal, boost-invariant expansion with small anisotropy, the proposed model agrees with the Israel-Stewart theory and Martinez-strickland model [2,3,4]. However, the model is designed
 to describe highly anisotropic systems where the standard dissipative hydrodynamics is not applicable. 





The proposed model of isotropization may be also used to describe non-boost-invariant systems [5] and boost-invariant systems with asymmetric transverse expansion [6]. In the latter case, we find that as long as the initial energy density profile is unchanged the calculated soft hadronic observables remain practically the same. This result indicates the insensitivity of the analyzed observables to the initial pressure anisotropy and suggests that the complete thermalization of the system may be delayed to easily acceptable times of about 1 fm/c.

We report on the results of charged kaon femtoscopy analysis of the 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC in the ALICE experiment. KK correlation functions are constructed in 3 multiplicity and 4 kt bins. The KK source parameters are extracted by fitting the
correlation functions with Gaussian, describing the source, multiplied by a polynomial background function with free coefficients (baseline). The contributions to the systematic
errors from the baseline choice have been studied. The weak increase of the KK Rinv with multiplicity and some evidence on the decrease with kt was observed in kt range (0.2-0.8) GeV/c. For the kt dependence, the charged kaons are found to be complimentary to the neutral ones in their coverage of a larger range in kt (0.2-2.0) GeV/c and a decrease in the Rinv is observed for increasing kt as it is also seen in identical two-pion correlations in these collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ludmila', 'last_name': 'Malinina', 'fullName': 'Malinina, Ludmila', 'id': '1897518', 'affiliation': 'Joint Inst. for Nuclear Research (JINR)-Unknown-Unknown', 'emailHash': '3df8349538f2e077a75abb57416d0bcb', 'db_id': 1897518, 'person_id': 2047584}"

The study shows that a significant part (60%) of the high-pT hadron attenuation seen experimentally can be attributed to inelastic interactions of 'leading' pre-hadrons with the dense hadronic environment. The presence of partonic phase leads to larger suppression of 'far-side' correlations which agrees with available data. We find also a fair description of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons as a function of the energy of the reaction, its centrality and the transverse momentum pT within PHSD approach.

One of characteristics of these electric fields is its boost-invariance in the longitudinal beam direction. In an ideal situation where two nuclei run at exactly the speed of light, the electric fields span only inside the forward light cone and their configuration is symmetric under the longitudinal boost transformation. 

We study the dynamics of nonperturbative particle pair creation in such boost-invariantly expanding electric fields. The proper-time evolution of momentum distributions of created particles, which preserve the boost invariance of the background field, will be presented. The particles have the same velocity distributions as the flow velocity of the Bjorken flow from the first instance they are created. 

We will also present the results on the calculation of the two-particle correlation between particles produced in the boost-invariant field. The correlation is short-range with respect to the transverse momentum, which originates in the Bose-Einstein correlation, and is long-range with respect to the longitudinal rapidity. This long-range rapidity correlation arises because the particles are created not as an eigenstate of a longitudinal momentum, which violates the boost-symmetry, but as a superposition of several momentum modes preserving the boost-symmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Naoto', 'last_name': 'Tanji', 'fullName': 'Tanji, Naoto', 'id': '1897466', 'affiliation': 'High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, KEK', 'emailHash': '0cff61343d0dad337d6b1091dfeca8b1', 'db_id': 1897466, 'person_id': 2047555}"

We argue that via the interaction of the produced streams the spatial anisotropy is translated into an anisotropy of the collective expansion of the bulk matter.

QCD at high temperature and density,poster,Suppression of the repulsive force in nuclear interactions near the chiral phase transition,"Sasaki, Chihiro",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"One of the issues in hot/dense QCD is to understand the state 
of matter in the vicinity of phase transition from hadronic 
matter to quark matter expected to be created in heavy-ion collisions, or to be present in the interior of compact stars. 
In nuclear physics, a scalar meson plays an essential role as 
known from Walecka model that works fairly well for phenomena 
near nuclear matter density. On the other hand, at high density, the relevant Lagrangian that has correct symmetry is the linear sigma model, and the scalar needed there is the sigma that is the fourth component of the chiral four-vector. Thus in order to 
probe highly hot/dense matter, we have to figure out how the 
chiral scalar at low temperature/density transmutes to the fourth component of the four-vector.

In this talk, we introduce a chiral scalar as a dilaton associated
with broken conformal symmetry and responsible for the trace anomaly of QCD and discuss the properties of nuclear matter at 
high density [1]. As the ""dilaton limit"" is taken, which drives a system from nuclear matter density to near chiral restoration density, a linear sigma model emerges from the highly nonlinear
structure with the omega meson decoupling from the nucleons.
A striking prediction of this procedure is that as the dilaton limit is approached as density increases, the omega-nucleon interaction known to be repulsive at low density gets strongly suppressed at high density. The omega-mediated short-range repulsion gets also suppressed. This occurs in the rho-meson exchanged repulsion too. Consequently the symmetry energy which plays a crucial role in the structure of compact stars gets suppressed. An immediate consequence would be that the equation 
of state (EoS) of dense matter will be softened at high density 
and would accommodate the EoS without any exotica consistent with the recent measurement of a 2-solar-mass neutron star.

A thermal field theory approach enables the direct evaluation of the source term from the divergence of the QCD energy momentum tensor.  This approach is more general than previously used Boltzmann transport techniques and allows for the coupling of realistic external quark and gluon currents to the Lagrangian of soft QCD matter.  Specifically, I consider for the first time the medium response to back-to-back jets and jets + medium-induced gluon bremsstrahlung.  The calculation includes the effects of quantum interference between the interactions of the multiple fast partons with the medium, and demonstrates that the energy absorbed by the medium is enhanced in a non-trivial way due to the presence and formation time of medium induced radiation.

Quarkonia, bound states of heavy (charm or bottom) quarks such as the J/ψ, are crucial probes of the QGP. Before drawing conclusions on QGP-induced phenomena all non-QGP effects influencing quarkonia yields have to be understood.

ALICE has measured the charged particle multiplicity distribution at √s = 7 TeV pp collisions [1]. A good fraction of events feature multiplicities that are of the same order as in central heavy-ion collisions at SPS energies. Thus, final-state effects present in heavy-ion collisions, such as a possible interaction with comovers [2], might be unveiled at LHC energies studying the multiplicity dependence of J/ψ production in pp collisions.

We will present first results of the multiplicity dependence of J/ψ production in √s = 7 TeV pp collisions. The analysis is based on the reconstruction of the channel J/ψ→e+e− using the central barrel detectors of ALICE.

In ultra-peripheral collisions, with impact parameters larger than the sum of the nuclear radii, hadronic interactions are strongly suppressed but the cross sections for electromagnetic or photon-induced interactions are large. The interactions can be purely electromagnetic (two-photon interaction) or a photon from the field of one of the nuclei may interact with the other nucleus (photonuclear interaction). Exclusive interactions, where both nuclei remain in their ground state, are dominated by coherent photonuclear vector meson production and two-photon production of di-lepton pairs. 

During the heavy-ion run at the LHC in 2010 where Pb-Pb collisions at an energy of sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV were studied, the ALICE Experiment had triggers enabled for exclusive particle production in ultra-peripheral collisions. These included trigger information from the Time-of-Flight, Silicon Pixel, and V0 Detectors. A trigger for ultra-peripheral collisions was also enabled in the muon arm. The integrated luminosity for the ultra-peripheral triggers corresponds to about 3.6 microb^-1.

Coherent rho0 production at mid-rapidity at the LHC corresponds to a photon-nucleon center of mass energy of 45 GeV, roughly a factor of 4 higher than has been studied before.

The initial fireball density is constructed as a sum of contributions from forward and backward going participants. This asymmetry in the 
emission from the individual participants leads to a tilt of the source. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed negative directed flow in a wide range of central pseudorapidities and reproduces correctly the  scaling of the directed flow when going from Au-Au to Cu-Cu systems [1]. We also propose to measure the thermalization time in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions using the directed flow of particles. We show that the directed flow
is a very sensitive measure of the pressure equilibration in the first fm/c of the evolution. We demonstrate in hydrodynamic calculations that the directed flow is strongly reduced in the presence of even a very  short pressure anisotropy. Our calculations show that the system must thermalize fast (<0.25fm/c). This suggests that the matter behaves as a strongly coupled system already at the first stages [2].

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Directed Flow in event-by-event hydrodynamics,"Gardim, Fernando",USP,Unknown,"Fluctuations in the initial geometry of a nucleus-nucleus
collision have been recently shown to produce the correlation
structures known as ``ridge"" and ``shoulder"". These event-by-event
fluctuations result in new types of anisotropic flow, such as
triangular flow $v_3$ and a new type of directed flow $v_1$,
which, unlike the usual directed flow, is also present at
midrapidity. The anisotropic flows due to the fluctuations in the
initial density profile result in different reference angles
$\Psi_n$ for every harmonic $n$, which are not necessarily
correlated with the event plane angle $\Psi_2$ (the elliptic flow
reference angle), used by the experimentalists to measure the
anisotropic flows, as $v_1$, $v_2$ and $v_4$. Unlike triangular
flow, this new $v_1$ has not been studied in a hydrodynamic
framework.

This work is based on the first quantitative predictions for this
new $v_1$ in Au-Au collisions at the top RHIC energy, using the
hydrodynamic code NEXSPheRIO. NEXSPheRIO solves the relativistic
ideal hydrodynamics using initial conditions provided by the event
generator NeXus, providing good description for several
observables, like elliptic flow. Shear viscosity is not
implemented in this computation, though its effect should be
smaller than higher harmonics, for instance $v_2$.

First, we compute this new $v_1$ versus transverse momentum and
centrality for Au-Au collisions at RHIC using the hydrodynamic
code NeXSPheRIO. Even without dedicated analysis of this new
$v_1$, indirect evidence has been obtained from recent STAR
correlation data, and we compared our results with those inferred
data, finding remarkable agreement.

As the fluctuations in the initial geometry break the symmetry of
the initial density profile, there will be one direction where the
profile is steepest. This effect can be quantified by the
magnitude dipole asymmetry $\varepsilon_1$, and by the steepest
direction for a smooth profile $\Phi_1$. For smooth initial
conditions, one expects $\Psi_1=\Phi_1$ and $v_1\propto
\varepsilon_1$ in each event. We compute those features for our
bumpy initial conditions and compare with the directed flow
quantities.  We find that the event plane of $v_1$ is correlated
with the angle of the initial dipole of the distribution, as
predicted, though with a large dispersion, but it is uncorrelated
with the reaction plane. This shows that the dipole asymmetry is
indeed the mechanism to create $v_1$.

Pre-equilibrium and initial state physics,poster,Strong color fields effects and baryon/meson anomaly  in p+p and central Pb+Pb collisions at L H C energies(*).,"TOPOR POP, VASILE","McGill University, Montreal, Canada",Unknown,"With the HIJING/BBar v2.0 event generator, we explore the phenomenological consequences of the suppression of perturbative quantum chromo-dynamics (pQCD) mini-jet production and of enhanced ""in medium"" strong longitudinal color field. Nuclear effects like shadowing and parton energy loss (""jet quenching"") are included.
This analysis focuses on p+p collisions at centre of mass energy
(sqrt(sNN)) 0.900, 2.36 and 7 TeV, and 
on central Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV, where recent data
have been reported by LHC Collaborations (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS). 
The effective energy-dependent string tension values are constrained by p+p data from Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the Tevatron, and recent Large Hadron Collider (LHC) runs. The pQCD cut-off value p0(s) is constrained by Au+Au collisions data from RHIC. Data on charged hadron multiplicity and charged hadron nuclear modification factor (RAA) in central (0-5%) Pb+Pb collisions from the ALICE experiment at the LHC are used to constrain the main parameters of the ""jet quenching"" phenomena (energy loss and mean free path of initial  parton-parton interactions). Predictions for the energy and centrality dependence of rapidity densities (2dNch/dy/Npart) and the hadron flavor dependence(mesons and baryons) of the nuclear modification factor RAA are presented. By studying baryon/meson ratios, we show that the jet quenching in central collisions suppresses the hard pQCD component of the particle spectra, thereby exposing a novel component of baryon dynamics that we attribute to (gluonic) baryon-anti-baryon junctions (JJbar). We predict that a baryon/mesons anomaly at intermediate transverse momentum values will persist at LHC energies, with a moderate centrality dependence.

We try to constrain these cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects by fitting the EPS09 parametrization plus a break-up cross section to the PHENIX data in each rapidity range. In contrast to previous work, a stronger than linear dependence of initial-state shadowing on the nuclear thickness is employed to better fit the d+Au data. We extrapolate our results to predict the CNM effects on $J/\psi$ production in Au+Au collisions and compare with the PHENIX results.

The possibility of shock formation or discontinuity is an important

We have developed a computational code on the basis of Chakravarthy-Osher scheme, which is one of flux-vector splitting schemes and is known to reproduce shock waves well in numerical simulations for a variety of situations. When equation of states with a first order phase transition is employed, our simulation reveals the manifestations of shock wavesand shock-like structures having a sharp edge, which are blurred by numerical viscosity in previous analyses, during the time evolution of fireballs. In particular, we find a high temperature region surrounded by sharp edges owing to the reheating of matter at early stage, and the formation of incoming shock-wave induced by this high temperature region.

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Initial state fluctuations and their effect on the flow,"Magas, Volodymyr",University of Barcelona,Unknown,"Substantial collective flow is observed in collisions between Lead nuclei at LHC as evidenced by the azimuthal correlations in the transverse momentum distributions of the produced particles [1].

We perform simulations of the Pb+Pb heavy ion collisions at LHC at 1.38 + 1.38 TeV/nucl within the three module model. Our calculations, in particular, show that the v1-flow, which was rather weak at RHIC and SPS, becomes stronger at LHC. Another even more important change in the v1 behaviour with respect to the similar simulations for RHIC [2] is that the v1 now peaks in the ""forward"" direction [3], i.e. positive v1 peak appears now at positive rapidity, and correspondingly negative peak at negative rapidity, contrary to what was observed at RHIC. 

However, it also appears that v1 flow is extremely sensitive to the initial state fluctuations, due to the sharp change around y=0.
One has to take into account that the Center of Mass (CM) rapidity is not exactly the same for all collisions, due to random fluctuations in the initial state, where the numbers of participant nucleons from projectile and target may not be exactly the same. This leads to considerable y_{CM} fluctuations at large impact parameters, where the flow asymmetry is the strongest, while total number of participants is the smallest. 

To analyze the consequences of these fluctuations, we assumed a Gaussian 
y_{CM} distribution, centered at y_{CM}=0, with variance of 1 or 2 units of rapidity. Such fluctuations strongly reduce v1(y) at central rapidities, however, it still stays large enough to be observed and to demonstrate the ""rotation effect"" discussed above [3].

It is also important to take into account experimental rapidity cuts of ALICE detector. These cuts together with initial state CM rapidity fluctuations result also into some increase of the elliptic flow, v2(pt), putting it in better agreement with the ALICE data.

Recently, ALICE collaboration measured   (differential) elliptic flow in √s=2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collision [1]. We have analyzed the elliptic flow data to obtain an estimate of viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta$/s  at LHC energy. Details can be found in [2]. In Israel-Stewart's second order theory of hydrodynamics, we have simulated elliptic flow in   2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. We have assumed that initial Pb+Pb collisions produces a 
QGP fluid which thermalizes in the time scale, $\tau_i$=0.6 fm/c. Hydrodynamical evolution of the fluid is governed by a lattice motivated equation of state with confinement-deconfinement cross-over transition at Tc=174 MeV. The initial condition of the fluid was fixed to reproduce ALICE measurements for charged particles multiplicity in 0-5% collisions. Ideal QGP fluid require rather large initial energy density, ei=90 GeV/fm^3. Initial energy density is reduced if the fluid is viscous, e.g. ei =78, 70, 60 GeV/fm^3 for viscosity to entropy ratio η/s=0.08, 0.12 and 0.16 respectively.  ALICE data for charged particles elliptic flow in 20-30%, 30-40% and 40-50% collision are best explained for fluid viscosity η/s=0.08. In very central 10-20% collisions however, ALICE data prefer ideal fluid rather than a viscous fluid.  We conclude that     nearly perfect fluid is consistent with the ALICE data for elliptic flow in  2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions.

Using transport models AMPT [2] and UrQMD [3], we study the energy dependence of the identified hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions. While in high-energy collisions where hadrons are formed dominantly via the process of parton coalescence, we find the observed number of quark scaling in v2 [1] for all hadrons, the violation of the scaling is evident for collisions at lower energies where the hadronic interactions become dominant. Due to the high baryon density, the violation is particularly strong for the case of proton and anti-proton. In this talk we will discuss the boundaries of the region of beam energy, above which partonic interactions clearly dominate and below which hadronic interactions dominate. Other thermodynamic parameters, extracted around the energy region, like freeze-out temperature and baryonic chemical potential will also be discussed.

Using the usual methods from statistics and probability theory, we introduce a linear correlation coefficient for the longitudinal and transverse momentum components and for rapidity and transverse momentum for all charged particles ( , ,   and  ) produced and detected with the BRAHMS experiment. For proving the existence of anomalous states in nuclear matter, unusual correlations between the longitudinal and transverse momenta should be observed in the rapidity range -0.1 < y < 3.5.  It is, also, proposed that the change in pT spectra at high rapidities could be one of the possible signals of QGP formation. These results are compared with others obtained in a large energy range, from the JINR Dubna Synchrophasotron, up to CERN SPS, for symmetric and asymmetric collisions. Interesting anomal states of the nuclear matter can be observed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stefania', 'last_name': 'Velica', 'fullName': 'Velica, Stefania', 'id': '1896904', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest', 'emailHash': 'd79af6d01cc9398f8a65a9400a5020d0', 'db_id': 1896904, 'person_id': 2047164}"
Global and collective dynamics,poster,V1 flow componet at LHC,"Csernai, Laszlo Pal",University of Bergen,Unknown,"Substantial collective flow is observed in collisions between Lead nuclei at LHC as evidenced by the azimuthal correlations in the transverse momentum distributions of the produced particles.

We perform simulations [1] of the Pb+Pb heavy ion collisions at LHC at 1.38 + 1.38 TeV/nucl within the three module model. The initial stages of the reaction, before the thermal equilibrium is reached, are simulated in terms of effective string rope model [2], based on longitudinally expanding strings of the color-magnetic field.  The produced initial state is tilted, and, thus, the direction of the largest pressure gradient is pointing in the ""anti-flow"" direction, what resulted in anti-flow peaks in simulations for RHIC and SPS [3]. However, one should not forget that this initial state also has a flow velocity distribution, which tends to further rotate it, and, thus, the direction of the strongest pressure gradient will change with time. The intermediate stages of the reaction are simulated with a (3+1)-dimensional fluid dynamical model, using the Particle in Cell (PIC) method adapted to ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The matter expands until it reaches freeze-out, which is treated in the third module of our model.  

The resulting elliptic flow, v2, is in reasonable agreement with the data [4]. Furthermore, our calculations also indicate that the v1-flow, which was rather weak at RHIC and SPS, and peaked at negative rapidities (named as 3rd flow component or anti-flow), now at LHC is expected to peak at forward rapidities (at the same side and direction as the projectile residue), and it may become stronger [1].

Thus, v1-flow provides a sensitive barometer to estimate the pressure and transport properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma.  In order to better study the transverse momentum flow dependence we suggest a new ""symmetrized v1s"" flow component, and make predictions for it.

Its powerful DAQ and trigger systems are normally configured to handle very high frequency of relatively low multiplicity pp events. To reduce data volume the CMS sub-detectors are read out using zero suppression algorithms optimized for pp. 

The large multiplicities expected in PbPb collisions required a different optimization of the zero suppression algorithms. The optimization could only be done after the data was taken. To make sure that the collected data is of highest quality the CMS collaboration decided to disable the zero suppression algorithms for the silicon strip tracker and the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters for the duration of the first PbPb run. This resulted in event size of about 12MB of data, corresponding to about 11 million channels recorded for each event. CMS was recording data at up to 180 Hz and with a bandwidth to tape of over 2GB/s, well beyond of what it was designed for (more than 6 times the data volume per second recorded during the pp running). 

The excellent luminosity delivered by the LHC required that CMS trigger system reduces the rate of minimum bias events written to tape while maintaining the rate of interesting physics events. The trigger algorithms operating at Level-1 and High Level Trigger were optimized to provide maximum selectivity and data writing rates for jets, muons and photons. The fraction of minimum bias events was adjusted during running to maximize the available bandwidth. 

In just few weeks CMS collected about 890 TB of data. After the run was over, CMS developed a new zero suppression algorithms optimized for heavy ions and the data was compressed offline to about 190TB.

We observe about 30 events containing a pair of electrons which were reconstructed to form distinctive Z boson candidates. Z boson reconstruction in the electron channel is challenging due to the complexity of electron reconstruction in the high-occupancy environment of heavy-ion (HI) collisions. The reconstruction of electrons in CMS uses information from the pixel detector, the silicon strip tracker and the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The measurement of electron energy in the ECAL is degraded by the significant tracker material in front of the calorimeter, and by the presence of a strong magnetic field aligned with the beam axis, giving an azimuthal spread of electromagnetic clusters within the ECAL. Despite this challenging reconstruction environment, we are able to reconstruct electrons with dedicated heavy ion tracking and tuned clustering algorithms.

By utilizing the CSR heavy-ion beam on an external target, dense QCD matter can be created. The equation of state (EOS) of the strongly coupled matter can be studied via properly chosen physical observables, among which the π-/π+ production ratio probes the symmetry energy of the asymmetrical nuclear matter at high densities. An External Target Experiment (ETE) is currently proposed for this study based on first-stage simulation and experimental work. To provide precise measurements and solid constraint to theory and models, experiment design and systematic requirements must be carefully studied.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,System-size dependence of particle ratio fluctuations in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 AGeV,"Kresan, Dmytro","GSI, Germany",Germany,"According to the QCD calculations on the lattice, the dynamical fluctuations of, for example, strangeness to entropy ratio could be enhanced in the co-existance region of the first order phase transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom and in the vicinity of the critical point.
The energy dependence of the K/pi ratio fluctuations measured by the
NA49 experiment in central Pb+Pb collisions shows increase towards
lower energies, which is not reproduced by the UrQMD model. One of
the possible explanations is the scaling of the dynamical fluctuations with average kaon multiplicity. In order to study this hypothesis one would like to fix the acceptance of the detector and measure the event-by-event fluctuations as a function of centrality at fixed beam energy.
In this poster, the centrality dependence of event-by-event fluctuations of K/pi, p/pi and K/p ratios measured by the NA49 experiment in Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV will be presented. For all considered ratios, dynamical fluctuations are found to increase in absolute value by 7 - 10% with decreasing centrality. Comparing the centrality and energy dependence of the particle ratio fluctuations, they are found to scale with the particle number dominating the fluctuation measure. I.e. in particular the event-by-event K/pi fluctuations are found to scale with the number of kaons. For p/pi fluctuations the observed scaling supports the interpretation that the measured dynamical fluctuations are a remnant of nucleon resonance feeddown.

"Experiments upgrade, future facilities and instrumentations",poster,New experiments for study of in-medium vector mesons at J-PARC,"Ozawa, Kyoichiro",KEK,Japan,"The origin of the hadron mass has been drawing strong interests in nuclear and particle physics. Especially in QCD, mass of hadrons is composed of a sum of the effective mass of valence quarks, known as constituent quark mass, and their interaction term. According to theoretical models, the effective mass of valence quarks is determined by chiral property of QCD vacuum. This mechanism is understood as a consequence of the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. In hot and/or dense matter, this broken symmetry will be restored either partially or completely and, hence, properties of hadrons, such as mass, decay modes and life time, can be modified. Therefore, we can study the origin of hadron mass and chiral properties of QCD medium by measuring in-medium properties of mesons. Especially, mass spectra of vector mesons are directly connected to anti-quark quark condensates, which is an order parameter of chiral symmetry. Thus, it is important to measure mass spectra of vector mesons in QCD medium, such as Quark Gluon Plasma or nuclear matter. 
Even at nuclear matter density, relatively large mass modification is predicted and several experimental efforts using cold nucleus targets are already performed. Among these activities, KEK-E325 reported significant mass modifications for rho and phi mesons and CLAS G7 experiment report only mass broadening for rho meson. Obtained results are different and physics behind these experimental results are not clearly understood. 
To understand the physics, clear and high statistics experimental data are essential. We are preparing new experiments to obtain such data at J-PARC. One experiment is an upgrade of E325 and aims to collect 100 times larger statistics in phi going to e+e- decays.

Our  derivation is based on the renormalization group method[3] as a powerful reduction theory of the dynamics. We have identified some drawbacks in our previous derivation 
of the casusal equations[4]. Our improved equation is a natural extension of the first-order equation derived by the present authors.[1] The relaxation times derived in our microscopic theory 
have forms which can be nicely interpreted in terms of correlation functions. Our equation in any local rest frame including the particle frame has a definite stable thermal equilibrium state and 
is completely free from the instability problem. 
 Our equation in the energy-frame is found quite different from the one by Denicol et al [5] which is derived on the basis of a moment method; but our equation can be well approximated
by it when the Rits approximatin is valid for a rarefied gas. On the basis of our derivation, we propose the correct moment method for the derivation of causal hydrodynamic equations without

During the hydrodynamic stage, the production of lepton pairs is described by radiation rates for a strongly interacting medium in thermal equilibrium. In the low mass region, hadronic thermal emission is evaluated assuming vector meson dominance including in-medium modifications of the rho meson spectral function through scattering from nucleons and pions in the heat bath. In the intermediate mass region, the hadronic rate is essentially determined by multi-pion annihilation processes. Emission from quark-antiquark annihilation in the quark gluon plasma is taken into account as well. When the system is sufficiently dilute, the hydrodynamic description breaks down and a transition to a final cascade stage is performed. In this stage dimuon emission is evaluated as commonly done in transport models. Focusing on the enhancement with respect to the contribution from long-lived hadron decays after freezout observed at the SPS in the low mass region of the dilepton spectra, the relative importance of the different thermal contributions and of the two dynamical stages is discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Elvira', 'last_name': 'Santini', 'fullName': 'Santini, Elvira', 'id': '1896845', 'affiliation': 'Goethe Universität Frankfurt', 'emailHash': '18f6e5f729a31b5a6b9290965c28f067', 'db_id': 1896845, 'person_id': 2047119}"

Quarks acquire their masses through their interaction with this modified quark condensate which is itself determined self-consistently by the equilibrium condition for the bag : the outward pressure due to both the motion of three quarks and the modified vacuum in the nucleon must be counterbalanced by the inward pressure of the vacuum outside the bag.

Charge separation could yield a dynamical charge multiplicity asymmetry with respect to the reaction plane.
In this poster, we report results on charge multiplicity asymmetry
correlations in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au and d+Au collisions by the STAR experiment, as well as from the RHIC beam energy scan.
We found that the correlation results could not be explained by CME alone.
To gain further insights, we study our results as a function of the

The results indicate that the charge separation effect appears to be
in-plane rather than out-of-plane.
We found that the charge separation effect is proportional to the
event-by-event $v_2$ and consistent with zero in events with $v_2

Charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of hadron gas with unit charged particles [1,2]. The study of charge fluctuations have been carried out by using the variable, ν+-,dyn [3] which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias, i.e., impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of charged particles within the detector acceptance.  The dependence of charge fluctuations on the rapidity windows for various centrality bins are analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN =2.76 TeV in the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC. A scaling behavior is observed as a function of increasing pseudo-rapidity window for the charge fluctuations, expressed in terms of Nch x ν+-,dyn, where Nch is the number of charged particles. The observed fluctuations are corrected for diffusion of fluctuations [4,5] in the hadronic medium. The results will be shown and discussed.

We present measurements, carried with the ALICE detector, of number ($R_2$) and transverse momentum ($\Delta p_t\Delta p_t$) correlation functions in Pb + Pb collisions. The two correlation functions are  studied as a function of collision centrality for ++, -\ -, and +- charged particle pairs in various momentum ranges.

QCD at high temperature and density,poster,Ultrasoft Fermionic Mode in QED and QCD plasmas,"Satow, Daisuke",RIKEN,Japan,"We discuss that the fermion spectrum at an ultrasoft energy region ($\ll$g^2T) in quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics at high temperature T, where g is the coupling constant. We show that the fermion propagator has a pole at v|p|-i\gamma, where p is the momentum, v=1/3 is the velocity, and \gamma is the damping rate of order g^2T log(1/g). The residue of the pole is weak of order g^2. When a system has conserved charges, soft modes called hydrodynamic modes appear in the bosonic sector. These hydrodynamic modes are zero mode, i.e., the dispersion of the poles is \omega=0 at p=0. The question is whether such a soft mode exists in the fermionic sector, when the system has a peculiar symmetry of the fermions. We show that the pole at the ultrasoft region is related to chiral symmetry, although it is not the exact zero mode. In order to obtain the correct pole, one have to sum over relevant diagrams beyond the hard thermal loop approximation even in the leading order of the coupling. This is similar to the calculation of transport coefficients [1]. We analytically obtain the pole of the fermion propagator and its residue in the leading order by solving a Bethe-Salpeter equation. Such pole was also suggested in Ref. [2], in which the self-consistent equation was shown; however it has not been solved. We also discuss whether this phenomena is robust in the fermion-boson system in the chiral limit.

While some models predict that J/Ψ produced through direct nucleon-nucleon process have very limited v2, J/Ψ produced by the recombination of c and cbar pairs could carry finite v2, depending on the interaction between charm quarks and the medium. Furthermore, due to their long relaxation time, heavy quarks are expected to thermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. Thus the study of J/Ψ v2 will also shed light on the extent to which the collision system is thermalized at RHIC.

The main role of VTX is precision measurement of heavy flavor.
 The VTX comprises a four-layer barrel detector built from two inner silicon pixel detector and two outer silicon strip detector. A silicon pixel ladder is the basic component of a silicon pixel detector. The two inner layers of the silicon pixel detectors are made up of 30 silicon pixel ladders. Each silicon pixel detector consists of four pixel hybrid sensors, two readout buses and a support board for cooling of sensor modules. Each components are glued with epoxy resin, and the pixel hybrid sensors and readout buses are connected electrically with bonding wires. In order to avoid increase of material budget, it is needed to reduce the thickness of resin. Furthermore, it is required to assemble with a precision less than 25 um. In satisfying these requirements, the mass production of silicon pixel detectors had been successfully completed.

Comparison of measurements in p+p and d+Au collisions can be further used to disentangle initial state effects from cold nuclear matter effects.

 Particles produced in p+p and d+Au collisions originate not only from hard scatterings, but soft and  semi-hard multiple parton interactions and initial- and final-state radiation combine to produce particles at mid-rapidity which constitute the so called underlying event. The STAR collaboration at RHIC recently presented first results on underlying event properties in p+p collisions  at $\sqrt{s_NN}$=200 GeV. We extend these studies and investigate in detail properties of underlying event in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,Femtoscopy of the proton-proton collisions at the LHC with pion-pion Bose-Einstein correlations in ALICE,"Kisiel, Adam",CERN,Switzerland,"We report on the results of identical pion femtoscopy of the pp collisions at the LHC with the Bose-Einstein correlations. We present the final analysis of the ALICE pp datasets at sqrt{s}= 0.9 TeV and 7 TeV and the preliminary results for sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV.

Detailed pion femtoscopy studies in heavy-ion collisions have shown
that emission region sizes (""HBT radii"") decrease with increasing pair momentum, which is understood as a manifestation of the collective behavior of matter. 3D radii were also found to universally scale with event multiplicity. In pp collisions at sqer{s} = 7 and 2.76 TeV one measures multiplicities which are comparable with those registered in peripheral Au-Au and Cu-Cu collisions at RHIC, so direct comparisons and tests of scaling laws are now possible.

We show the results of double-differential 3D pion Bose-Einstein
femtoscopic analysis, as a function of multiplicity and pair
momentum. The results for three collision energies are compared to
results obtained in the heavy-ion collisions at similar multiplicity
and pp collisions at lower energy. We identify the relevant scaling
variables for the femtoscopic radii and discuss the similarities and
differences to results from heavy-ions. The observed trends give
insight into the soft particle production mechanism in pp collisions

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Centrality dependence of observables in the core - corona model,"Aichelin, Joerg",subatech,Unknown,"To understand the centrality dependence of the measured observables, like the multiplicity  $<p_t>^$ and the elliptic flow of identified particles at midrapidity as well as the elliptic flow of charges hadrons, has been a challenge for theory since many years. Although the multiplicity of different particles in central collisions corresponds exactly to the expectation for a completely thermalized source the centrality dependence is incompatible with this assumption.

A while ago it has been realized that even in the most central collisions there remain particles (usually close to the surface of the interaction zone) which do not come to equilibrium (corona particles) whereas others come to a local equilibrium (core particles). Corona particles produce hadrons like pp collision. The relative fraction of corona particles can be calculated in the Glauber approach and increases with decreasing centrality? This variable core fraction is the origin of the centrality dependence of the observables. 

The approach has no free parameter and reproduces quantitatively the experimental results. Especially it explains an observations which have been unexplained since quite a while: the enhancement of (multi) strange baryons and the fact that this enhancement becomes smaller at larger beam energies.

Recently this model has been extended to dynamical variables like the centrality dependence of $<p_t>$ and $v_2$ of identified particles. The model reproduces quantitatively the centrality dependence of the elliptic flow of charged particles
without any new parameter which has been considered so far as an observable which allows to fix the viscosity of a plasma. Our model shows that this centrality dependence can also be predicted assuming the same  fraction of completely equilibrized core and not equilibrized corona particles which has been used to understand the centrality dependence of the multiplicity.

In the presentation we will display the model and make comparisons with the EPOS event generator which is based as well on the distinction between core and corona particles and describes the rapidity dependence of many observables. Then we demonstrate that the centrality dependence of all observables at midrapidity is well described in this approach, at SPS as at RHIC, and for CuCu as well as for AuAu. If data are available we will extend the model to LHC energies.
The interpretation of the results in physical terms concludes the presentation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joerg', 'last_name': 'Aichelin', 'fullName': 'Aichelin, Joerg', 'id': '1896730', 'affiliation': 'subatech', 'emailHash': 'ab58815ed65b505588e77e8d2196f46f', 'db_id': 1896730, 'person_id': 2047029}"
QCD phase diagram,poster,The realistic QCD equation of state in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and the early Universe,"Florkowski, Wojciech","Institute of nuclear Physics, Krakow",UK,"The realistic equation of state of strongly interacting matter [1,2], that has been successfully applied in the recent hydrodynamic studies of hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC [3,4], is used in the Friedmann equation to determine the precise time evolution of thermodynamic parameters in the early Universe [5]. A comparison with the results obtained with simple ideal-gas equations of state is made. The realistic equation of state describes a crossover rather than the first-order phase transition between the quark-gluon plasma and hadronic matter. The numerical calculations show that small inhomogeneities of strongly interacting matter in the early Universe are moderately damped during such crossover. 

The crossover character of the QCD transition indicates that there are small chances for observation of exotic phenomena connected with the first order phase transitions (quark nuggets, strangelets). Similarly, damping of the energy density perturbations suggests that no strong energy-density peaks are formed, that may lead to the formation of cold dark matter clumps discussed in earlier publications.

Multiple scatterings of the hard  scattered partons in cold nuclear matter may also alter the measured acoplanarity when compared to those in {\it p+p}. Studies in central {\it d+Au} collisions are therefore vital to disentangle medium-induced $k_t$ broadening from  initial state nuclear effects and any potential broadening due to jet quenching in the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. While full jet reconstruction is a direct way to study such acoplanarities, di-hadron correlations with respect to a high momentum leading particle can also be utilized as a complementary tool.

Two quantities commonly used to characterize the properties of jets are $j_t$, the transverse momentum of the jet fragments relative to the jet axis, and  $k_t$, the transverse component of the momentum of the hard scattered partons.

QCD at high temperature and density,poster,QGP viscosity coefficients: from weak to strong coupling,"Bluhm, Marcus",Laboratoire SUBATECH,Unknown,"By means of high energy nuclear collisions, the properties, such as 
the viscosity coefficients, of QCD matter under extreme conditions 
are intended to be experimentally revealed. One remarkable result 
from collisions at RHIC is that the produced hot matter is an 
almost ideal fluid, obeying the smallest shear viscosity to entropy 
density ratio observed in nature. Employing an effective kinetic 
theory for quasiparticle excitations featuring dynamically 
generated self-energies, we determine the temperature dependence 
of the viscosity coefficients of deconfined strongly interacting 
matter [1,2]. This knowledge may serve as input for the 
phenomenological description of heavy-ion collisions at LHC and 
RHIC. 

Exhibiting the parametric dependencies known from perturbative QCD 
at large temperatures, the extrapolation of our results into the 
non-perturbative region shows fairly nice quantitative agreement 
with lattice QCD results in the case of a pure gluon plasma. We 
find a minimum in the specific shear viscosity and a rapid increase 
of the specific bulk viscosity near the deconfinement transition 
temperature T_c. The ratio of bulk to shear viscosity comprises 
both, a quadratic dependence on the conformality measure at large 
temperatures as known from pQCD as well as a linear dependence 
near T_c as known from specific strongly coupled and nearly 
conformal theories based on gauge/string duality [3]. Thus, the 
exploited framework provides a systematic interpolation between 
both regimes of weak and strong coupling.

These photons get competing contributions from the quark and the hadronic phases. This competition gives rise to a unique structure, especially in the outward correlation function, due to the interference between the photons from the two sources. The temporal separation of the two sources provides the life time of the system and their strengths provide the relative contribution of the two phases. The results are found to be quite sensitive to the quark-hadron phase transition temperature and the formation time of the plasma.

Electromagnetic probes,poster,Equation of state of strongly interacting matter: spectra for thermal particles and intensity correlation of thermal photons,"Srivastava, Dinesh",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"We find that an equation of state for hot hadronic matter consisting of all baryons having $M < 2$ GeV and all mesons having $M < 1.5$ GeV, along with Hagedorn resonances in thermal and chemical equilibrium, matches rather smoothly with lattice equation of state (p4 action, ${N_\tau}=8$) for T up to $\approx 200$ MeV, when corrected for the finite volume of hadrons.
Next we construct two equations of state for strongly interacting matter; one, HHL, in which the above is matched to the lattice equation of state at $T=165$ MeV and the other, HHB, where we match it to a bag model equation of state with critical temperature $T_c=165$ MeV. We compare particle spectra, thermal photon spectra and histories of evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in the central collision of gold (lead) nuclei at RHIC (LHC) energies, considering ideal hydrodynamical expansion of the system. The particle and thermal photon spectra are seen to differ only marginally, for the two equations of state. The history of evolution shows differences in the evolution of temperature and radial velocity, as one might expect.
We calculate intensity interferometry of thermal photons and find it to be quite distinct for the two equations of state, especially for the outward correlation. The longitudinal correlation also shows a dependence on the equation of state, though, to a smaller extent.

Calculations of this nature will be presented (as detailed in arXiv:1011.4534) with different assumptions about the geometric dependence of the nuclear modifications, and the results will be compared to the latest PHENIX d+Au experimental data.

Within the formalism of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action the nonequilibrium dynamics of the sigma field coupled to the fluid dynamic expansion of quarks is obtained consistently. We derive the Langevin equation for the sigma field  with the explicit damping coefficient and the noise terms, which are similar to those we obtain from the influence functional method. The 2PI effective action in addition contains information about the local equilibrium properties of the quark fluid like the energy density and the pressure, which are needed for the equation of state. We go beyond existing studies of Langevin dynamics at the chiral phase transition by putting special emphasis on the properties and the evolution of the heat bath. The damping in the dynamics of the sigma field leads to energy dissipation from the field to the fluid. In the exact formalism of the 2PI effective action a conserved energy-momentum tensor can be constructed.

Previously, strong LRC have been measured at STAR in 200 GeV central Au+Au collisions, and were shown to decrease with decreasing centrality [3].  The Color Glass Condensate model, which describes sources as longitudinal flux tubes, predicts that the correlation will grow with centrality [4,5].  Furthermore, fluctuations in the number of gluons at early times will produce a long range correlation significantly larger for pions than protons [5].  We present the forward-backward correlation of identified

We find that AMPT with string melting predicts an increase of $S_3$ with increasing beam energy, and is consistent with experimental data, while AMPT with only hadronic scattering results in a low $S_3$ throughout the energy range from AGS to RHIC, and fails to describe the experimental data. And we analyzed coalescence parameters, $B_2$ and $B_3$, based on the production of deuteron, helium-3 and proton. The coalescence parameters of $B_2$ and $B_3$ decrease with increasing of beam energy or number of participant. The value of $B_2$ and $B_3$ in this model are consistent with the measurement by experiment collaboration in nucleus-nucleus collisions at different beam energy~\cite{NA49-07} or in different centralities~\cite{STAR09}. The freeze-out correlation volume, $V^{1-A}_f$ (A is atomic number), is calculated in AMPT model. The results of coalescence parameter and the freeze-out correlation volume follow the relation of $B_A$ $\propto$ $V^{1-A}_f$, which is from coalescence mechanism and observed in experiments~\cite{BAVf,STAR09,HLiu06}. This beam energy and system size dependences indicate the increase of source size in more high energy collisions and in more central collisions.

QCD at high temperature and density,poster,Spectrum of fermion coupled with massive vector boson at finite temperature in gauge invariant formalism,"Kunihiro, Teiji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We investigate the massless fermion spectral function coupled with a massive vector boson (mass: m) in the whole region of temperature (T) [1].  The massive vector boson is described as a U(1) gauge boson so that we can analyze the extremely high-T region where T/m $\gg$ 0, in contrast to the Proca formalism [2].  We show that a novel peak appears in the fermion spectral function for T~m in addition to the two peaks corresponding to the normal fermionic and anti-plasmino excitations obtained in the m=0 case [3].
We find that the novel peak seems to persist though with a small strength 
even for T$\gg$m, where the other two peaks remains robust and are smoothly connected to those obtained in the HTL approximation.  
Since our model has a U(1) gauge invariance, the poles of the fermion propagator must be gauge invariant.  We have confirmed the gauge invariance of the poles for T$\ll$m and T~m, while the gauge invariance of the poles are satisfied only for a restricted region of the gauge-fixing parameter for T$\gg$m.  We explicitly obtained the adequate region of the gauge-fixing parameter for T$\gg$m. Our results shows that the unitary gauge, which corresponds to the large gauge-fixing parameter limit, is found to be inadequate for the calculation of the fermion propagator in the T$\gg$m region, although the unitary gauge is often adopted in the literature.
The relevant physical systems of our analysis include the quark-gluon plasma phase near the phase transition temperature (T_c) since vector-type collective excitation may exist there and its mass may become very small (T$\gg$m) just above T_c.  The neutrino spectrum in the early universe is also relevant since the neutrino couples with the massive vector particles, W and Z boson.  The present work tells us that the analysis of the neutrino spectral function in the unitary gauge or in the Proca formalism [4] can
suffer from a strong gauge dependence in the T$\gg$m region.

Within PHSD the low mass dilepton sector (M<1 GeV) at SPS energies (measured by the NA60 and CERES Collaborations) is rather well described by hadronic degrees of freedom when a collisional broadening of the vector mesons (rho, omega) is incorporated; however, this no longer holds for higher masses. In the intermediate mass regime from 1 to 2 GeV, we find that the contribution from `massive' q+qbar annihilation in the sQGP phase  dominantes over the hadronic channels like pi+a1, pi+omega and rho+rho for In+In reactions at 160 A GeV. On the other hand, we find a quite different pattern of the dilepton production in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of sqrt(s)=200 GeV. Here the in-medium effects for the rho and omega vector mesons do not explain the large enhancement relative to p+p collisions observed in the invariant mass regime from 0.2 to 0.6 GeV by the PHENIX Collaboration.

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Charged particle production with respect to the Reaction Plane in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_NN}$= 2.76 TeV,"Kim, Dong Jo",University of Jyväskylä,FI,"The centrality dependence of nuclear modification factor($R_{AA}$) carries information about the path-length variation of partonic energy loss. However, the inclusive $R_{AA}$ for a given centrality emerges by averaging over different path lengths as the overlap zone of two colliding nuclei has typically a nearly elliptical shape in the transverse plane. The partons traversing the medium in the in-plane direction are expected to lose less energy than out-of-plane, because they, on the average, have shorter path length inside the medium. In this sense, azimuthal dependence of $R_{AA}$ w.r.t. reaction plane offers to get a tighter constraint on the actual path length traversed by the parton in medium.

Recently we published a paper on the charged particle $R_{AA}$[1], showing that the similar suppression as RHIC energy is observed, and moreover a rising trend for increasing $p_{T}$. Another interesting observation is the similarity of $p_{T}$-differential elliptic flow at low $p_{T}$ between at RHIC and the LHC [2]. Since then, we have extended the $p_{T}$ reach for $R_{AA}$ with better precision and elliptic flow measurement up to 20 $GeV/c$ with event plane, which allows us to study the path-length dependence of partonic energy loss with larger kinematic domain.

We present the latest ALICE results from Pb-Pb collisions at $sqrt{s_{NN}$=2.76TeV on charged particle yields with respect to reaction plane angle as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. These results allow for a detailed examination of the influence of geometry in the collision region and of the interplay between collective flow and jet-quenching effects.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,Distortion of photon HBT image by the vacuum birefringence in strong magnetic field,"Hattori, Koichi",High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK),Japan,"The experiment by the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has opened a novel insight into the extreme state of matter. Besides, it provides an opportunity to study the dynamics of strong Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. In peripheral collisions, an extremely strong Abelian magnetic field is created by two colliding heavy ions having large electric charges. The magnetic field has a much greater order of magnitude than those of ever observed astronomical objects. 

Such a strong magnetic field becomes not only the source of an exotic phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect but also a background field which allows for nonlinear QED phenomena, where the strong magnetic field interacts with photons emitted in the early stages of time evolution of the created matter. Even though photon self-interaction is diagrammatically a higher order process with a number of external photon legs intermediated by an electron loop, extraordinarily strong magnitude of the background magnetic field compensates the smallness of the coupling constant, and leads to intriguing nonperturbative effects. The interaction causes a modification of production and propagation of photon, which results in significant effects on the observable photon spectrum. It was discussed recently that the presence of magnetic fields also allows for the decay of a real photon into a particle-antiparticle (lepton, or quark) pair, yielding an elliptic flow of observed photons [1]. The study of such nonlinear QED phenomena provides a prevision of planned photon detection in the LHC experiment.

In this contribution, we examine the effect of the interaction, between an emitted photon and the background magnetic field, on Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry. Recently, one of the authors investigated effects of the hadronic final state mean field interaction on the pion interferometry in the central collisions [2,3]. We have found therein that the HBT images are distorted due to the phase shift of the pion amplitude propagating through the one-body mean field interaction region, which is computed by using the semi-classical approximation. The analysis was done on the basis of an analogue of eikonal approximation in the geometrical optics. In the present work, we incorporate the interaction of photon with the background magnetic field as a deviation of the refraction index from the unity, wherein the analogue is more evident. While the HBT interferometry by a photon pair is more promisingly accessible to the primordial image of the created matter than that by a pion pair, we have to take into account the distortion of image by the strong magnetic field. 

The refraction index of the vacuum in the presence of the magnetic field is obtained by incorporating the self-energy of photon, resummed with respect to the number of external photon legs, into the equation of motion for the Abelian gauge field. Depending on the two physical propagating modes of photon, two distinct refraction indices, called the vacuum birefringence, are obtained. Calculating the optical-path-length of the photon specified by the refraction indices, we have the images distorted depending on the helicity of photons. In addition to the conventionally discussed three HBT parameters, e.g. outward, sideward and longitudinal radii, we investigate the distortion of the outward-sideward cross parameter, which indicates the azimuthal-angle dependence of the image in the non-central collisions [4]. The magnitude of the distortion also depends on the azimuthal angle because the presence of the magnetic field provides a preferred orientation. We show how and to what extent the elliptic shape of the original image is distorted depending on the magnitude of momentum, helicity and azimuthal angle.

In this talk the transverse energy measurements from 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions as a function of centrality will be compared to similar CMS results from pp collisions and to our recently published multiplicity results. The pseudo rapidity dependence of the transverse energy per participant is susceptible to the longitudinal expansion of the system.

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Photonuclear interactions in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC,"Skjerdal, Kyrre",University of Bergen-Unknown-Unknown,Unknown,"The strong electromagnetic fields present in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN LHC accelerator lead to large cross sections for particle production in photonuclear interactions[1]. It will be shown that photonuclear processes may constitute a significant background to peripheral and semi-central hadronic nuclear collisions.

The cross sections for photonuclear interactions induced by photons from the electromagnetic fields of the nuclei have been calculated. The photon spectrum has been evaluated in impact parameter space. Thereby one can easily exclude collisions were the nuclei interact hadronically (b < 2R). For modelling the particle production, the DPMJET[2] Monte Carlo event generator has been used. Calculations have been done for photon energies from 6 GeV to 100 TeV in the rest frame of the target nucleus, which is the energy range contributing to particle production around mid-rapidity. The multiplicity, rapidity, and transverse momentum distributions of produced particles will be presented.

Two cases of photonuclear processes have been considered, single and double excitation. In the former case, one of the nuclei emits a photon which interacts with the other nucleus, whereas in the latter case both nuclei emit photons which interact with the other nucleus. The cross section for single excitation is much larger than that of double excitation. However, the topology of the double excitation events, where the rapidity distruction is more symmetrical, is simililar to that of hadronic interactions. Both processes may thus contribute significantly to the background of hadronic interactions, depending on the experimental event selection. 

The photon-nucleon energies that can be reached in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC are higher than for any earlier gamma+A or gamma+p collisions. In addition to being a background for hadronic interactions, such events have a physics interest in themselves. Photoproduction of heavy quarks (e.g. cc-bar through gamma-gluon fusion) and jets have large cross sections and probe the nuclear parton distribution functions.

In the 14-moment approximation [1,2], traditionally employed in the fluid-dynamical modeling of heavy-ion collisions, fluid dynamics is obtained by explicitly truncating the moment expansion of the single-particle distribution function. In contrast, in our approach all terms of the moment expansion are included and the exact equations of motion for these moments are derived. These exact equations still contain the degrees of freedom and microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation.  

We prove that in order to derive causal fluid-dynamical equations it is necessary to resolve at least the slowest microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation, in agreement with [3]. The truncation of the equations of motion in terms of only 14 dynamical variables is then implemented by a systematic power-counting scheme in Knudsen and Reynolds numbers, instead of the explicit truncation of the moment series, as in Israel-Stewart theory. The resulting fluid-dynamical equations and coefficients are different from the ones 
obtained via the 14-moment approximation and are in much better agreement with kinetic theory. This means that the fluid-dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions based on the 14-moment approximation is incomplete.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,Long-Range (Forward-Backward) Pt and Multiplicity Correlations in pp Collisions at 0.9 and 7 TeV,"Feofilov, Grigori",St. Petersburg State University,Unknown,"Long-Range (Forward-Backward) Pt and Multiplicity Correlations
in pp Collisions at 0.9 and 7 TeV

(Submitted by Grigory Feofilov)

Long-range rapidity and azimuthal correlations (LRC) of charged particles are a sensitive
tool to study the initial conditions for the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formation [1],[2],[3].
Measured in separated pseudorapidity intervals, these correlations, if they exist, mainly Pt-
Nch and Pt-Pt, could be the indication in case of pp collisions of processes like color string
fusion[2] or glasma flux tubes formation[3]. The event-by-event analysis of the long-range
Forward-Backward (FB) Nch-Nch, Pt-Nch and Pt-Pt correlations has been performed on
data of the ALICE experiment obtained in the pp runs at 0.9 and 7 TeV pp collision energies.
The following observables were defined: Pt (the average transverse momentum in the event)
and Nch (the event multiplicity of charged particles). Two pseudorapidity intervals (the
""forward"" and the ""backward"" windows) of the variable width from 0.2 to 0.8 rapidity units
were chosen. Correlations were studied as a function of the width of these windows and
on the gap between them, as well as for the different configurations of four pi/2 azimuthal
sectors relevant to these windows. Methods for separating the short-range correlations and to
measure the long-range correlations strength in the limited acceptance of the ALICE central
barrel (-0.8, 0.8) are discussed. Analysis results show a behaviour compatible with LRC
phenomena for these pp collisions. They are compared to PYTHIA and to the model with
independent emitters (strings) [4].

Abstract
         As a possible upgrade of the ALICE experiment the construction of the
Focusing Aerogel Ring Imaging Cherenkov (FARICH) detector is proposed.
The goal of the FARICH is to extend the working momentum range of the charged particle identification at ALICE for a high transverse momentum PT region up to 10 GeV/c for the pion–kaon separation and up to 15 GeV/c for kaon–proton separation. It will enable to provide better conditions for the investigation of the parton-medium effects at LHC energies. 
        In this report the FARICH detector concept and possible detector construction on the basis of a multi-layer aerogel radiator and photosensitive MRS APD focal plane are presented. 
       The main idea of the FARICH detector development is to employ a Cherenkov radiator composed of several aerogel layers with different index of refraction. Index of refraction of each layer is gradually increased along the particle direction, so that Cherenkov ring images produced by different layers coincide in the focal plane and form more narrow ring image.
       Simulation was made for a multi-layer radiator based on the Geant4 software toolkit. Results of the FARICH prototype test on the 6 GeV/c negative pion beam of the CERN PS T10 test channel are presented and discussed. 
       Taking into account the FARICH prototype geometrical efficiency the FARICH Cherenkov angle resolution  of about 2,1 mrad  was obtained.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alexeii', 'last_name': 'Kurepin', 'fullName': 'Kurepin, Alexeii', 'id': '1896485', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Nuclear Research (INR)', 'emailHash': '58e35988d088606d9d78191a05a4f711', 'db_id': 1896485, 'person_id': 2046816}"

To conduct this experimental study, it is necessary to know well the response fonction of the detectors used, in particular, the forward muon spectrometer to detect quarkonium and heavy flavour in their muonic channel. In this sense, the tracking efficiency integrated on the five stations of the spectrometer is a critical variable. Indeed, for cross-section calculations we have to apply a correction factor Acc∗ε. We use, for to evaluate this factor, realistic Monte Carlo simulations run by run. In heavy ions collisions, one of the main parameters is the centrality of the collision, directly related to the multiplicity and the occupancy of the detector. It is therefore crucial to know the centrality dependence of muon tracking efficiency.
Another aspect of J/ψ study is to obtain its contribution to the single muon spectrum. Simulations using J/ψ measured cross-section, pt and y distributions, allow to obtain this contribution. Similar evaluation will be done for the vector meson in order to get rid of the resonance contribution to the single muon spectrum.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Antoine', 'last_name': 'Lardeux', 'fullName': 'Lardeux, Antoine', 'id': '1896482', 'affiliation': 'SUBATECH, on behalf of the ALICE collaboration', 'emailHash': 'bfa6adc43717196071c2e16a5c92c560', 'db_id': 1896482, 'person_id': 2046813}"

In addition to this, it has been recently proposed that a certain set of mix-ratios of these moments can be measured to validate the occurrence of critical phenomena.  These ratios are constructed so as not to have any dependence on model parameters, including the correlation length. Their values after subtracting the statistical contribution should remain as unity even in presence of CP. Measurements of these mix-ratios are a vital step towards establishing a complete set of observables for the critical point program at RHIC.

QCD phase diagram,poster,Inhomogeneous phase during the chiral transition,"Tatsumi, Toshitaka",Kyoto U.,Unknown,"Recently there have been many works about the inhomogeneous phases accompanying the chiral transition, which should have implications on relativistic heavy-ion collisions as well as compact-star phenomena [1]. 

Among them we here concentrate on the emergence and properties of a special one called dual-chiral-density wave (DCDW) state, which enjoys interesting features such as parity-violating phase, liquid-crystalline structure and spin-density wave [2]. In particular, the one-dimensional order is quasi-long-range-order in this case such that the correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar densities decay algebraically, as in the smectic liquid crystal[3]: fluctuations in the DCDW phase exhibit the heterogeneous dispersion relation.
The symmetry breaking pattern is also characteristic in this phase transition: U(1) subgroup of chiral symmetry and one-dimensional translational symmetry are broken at the same time, but is still invariant under the specific combination of them. So, Nambu-Goldstone modes (phasons) should exhibit a hybrid features of phonons and ""pions"". Moreover, magnetization spatially modulates to pretend a spin density wave, which may be related with the magnetic activity of compact stars.

After briefly introducing DCDW in the chiral limit and discussing its salient features, we elucidate the physical mechanism of its emergence; we emphasize differences from the usual Overhauser effect or the nesting effect of the Fermi surface. 
Then we present a formalism to deform the original DCDW, to include the symmetry breaking effect [4]. Taking a variational method we show that the deformed DCDW can be described by a topological object: it is realized by embedding the chain of the sine-Gordon kinks in $1+1$ dimension into $1+3$ dimensional quark matter [5]. Thus we can generalize DCDW without losing the basic concepts.

Finally we briefly discuss the neutrino emission process by way of beta decay of quarks in the DCDW phase, as a definite example of implications of DCDW on compact-star phenomena [6].

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Viscous QCD matter at RHIC and LHC energies. Insights from viscous hydrodynamics + hadron cascade hybrid approach,"Song, Huichao",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,USA,"We present recent results from the newly developed hybrid code
VISHNU [1] which couples viscous hydrodynamics for the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with a hadron cascade model for the late hadronic stage. By describing the hadronic rescattering and freeze-out stage microscopically, we improve on earlier purely hydrodynamic models which required additional adjustable parameters to describe the transport and freeze-out characteristics of the hadron phase. By describing the QGP phase as a viscous rather than ideal fluid (as done in previous macroscopic + macroscopic hybrid codes), we account for the non-zero viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma which we can now determine empirically, without contamination from an incomplete treatment of the late hadronic dynamics, by comparing VISHNU results with experimental elliptic flow data.

Using the Monte-Carlo-Glauber or Monte-Carlo-KLN models to 
generate event by event fluctuating initial entropy density profiles and averaging these profiles either in the reaction-plane (i.e. directly) or in the participant-plane (i.e. after recentering and rotating each event so that the main axes of its entropy density align), we generate smooth average initial conditions for viscous hydrodynamics which account in different ways for the event by event fluctuations in shape and orientation of the initial state of the collision fireball [2]. We find that the eccentricity scaled elliptic flow $v_2/\epsilon$ is a universal function of charged multiplicity per unit overlap area $(1/S)(dN_{ch}/dy)$ that depends only on the QGP viscosity but not on the initialization models [3]. Comparing these universal curves with experimental measurements we find that the specific QGP viscosity $(\eta/s)_{QGP}$ is constrained to fall in the range $1<4\pi(\eta/s)_{QGP}<2.5$ where the width of this range is entirely dominated by model uncertainties for the initial eccentricities [3]. Compared to analysis based on pure viscous hydrodynamics this reduces the previously quoted robust upper limit for $(\eta/s)_{QGP}$ by a factor 2.5. The same $(\eta/s)_{QGP}$ values extracted in [3] from the centrality dependence of the $p_T$-integrated elliptic flow of all charged hadrons also provide, for the first time, a consistently good simultaneous description of the $p_T$ spectra and differential elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ for charged hadrons as well as identified pions and protons over the entire range of collision centralities in 200 A GeV Au+Au collisions [4].

Good agreement with the available experimental data, including the LHC data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, is
obtained and predictions are made for the collisions at top LHC energy
$\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV [1]. It is shown that within the examined energy
range one cannot distinguish between the ""standard"" logarithmic
dependence ($\propto \ln^2{s}$) and novel power-law approximation
($\propto E^\lambda$), employed for particle densities and for their
mean p_T in Regge theory and in theory of Color Glass Condensate,
respectively. The model indicates that Feynman scaling and extended longitudinal scaling remain valid in the fragmentation regions, whereas strong violation of Feynman scaling is observed at midrapidity. The KNO scaling in multiplicity distributions is violated at LHC also. The origin of both maintenance and violation of the scaling trends is traced to short range correlations of particles in the strings and interplay between the
multi-string processes at ultra-relativistic energies.
Long-range correlations between charged particles emitted in forward
(F) and backward (B) hemispheres are studied also, good agreement with
data at 546 GeV and 900 GeV is observed. The dependence looks pretty
linear and its slope increases with rising energy $\sqrt{s}$ [2].
The model is able to reproduce the effect of long-range near side
correlations, colloquially known as ridge [3]. In contrast to the F-B
correlations this effect is attributed to hard Pomeron exchange and
cannot be reproduced within the approach where only soft Pomerons are
taken into account. The experimental femtoscopic radii dependences  are well reproduced within Quark Gluon String Model.

New theoretical developments,poster,Exotic Matter-Antimatter Molecules,"Wong, Cheuk-Yin",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,Unknown,"In a nuclear collision at RHIC and LHC, a large number of particles
and antiparticles are produced.  The production of matter and
antimatter particles in close space-time proximity raises the
interesting question whether chance encounters of some of the produced
charged particles and antiparticles may lead to the formation of
exotic matter-antimatter molecules as debris of the collision.  The
detection of new matter-antimatter molecules may be a difficult task.
It is nonetheless an interesting theoretical question to investigate
the general factors affecting the stability of matter-antimatter
molecules. Using a formalism similar to the previous investigation of
the X(3872) as a heavy-quark molecular state [1], we find that
matter-antimatter molecules with charged constituents
(m1+,m2-,m2bar+,m1bar-) possess bound states if their constituent mass
ratio m1/m2 is greater than about 4 [2].  This stability condition
suggests that the binding of matter-antimatter molecules is a rather
common phenomenon.  We evaluate the binding energies of exotic
matter-antimatter molecules (mu+ e-)-(e+ mu-), (pi+ e-)-(e+ pi-), 
(K+ e-)-(e+ K-), (p e-)-(e+ pbar), (p mu)-(mu+ pbar), and 
(K+ mu-)-(mu+ K-), which satisfy the stability condition.  We estimate
the molecular annihilation lifetimes in their s states.

The ALICE experiment at LHC has collected, in March 2011, proton-proton data at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV. This energy in the center of mass allows to have a pp reference for the PbPb collisions that have been collected, at the end of 2010, at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV. 
In this poster, we show the first analysis, performed on the pp data sample at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV, concerning the detection of the J/ψ meson through its decay into μ+μ− pairs at forward rapidity ( 2.5 < y < 4 ) in the ALICE Muon Spectrometer.
We focus on the different steps required to obtain the integrated and differential cross-section for inclusive J/ψ production, the latter one as a function of the J/ψ transverse momentum pT and rapidity y.
First of all, details are provided concerning the criteria adopted to select runs and events used for the analysis. The different tecniques used for the extraction of the signal are discussed as well as the method followed to determine the acceptance and efficiency corrections.
Finally, we show some preliminary plots providing also some details about the alignment of the tracking chambers of the Muon Spectrometer.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Claudio', 'last_name': 'Geuna', 'fullName': 'Geuna, Claudio', 'id': '1896480', 'affiliation': ""IRFU-cea - Centre d'Etudes de Saclay"", 'emailHash': '5dad77bcb621fb17d45edee2a3b7d133', 'db_id': 1896480, 'person_id': 2046811}"

Many of them are rare so that high collision rates up to 10 MHz will have to be mastered at minimum bias. The central component is a silicon tracking system for the trajectory and momentum determination of the hundreds of charged particles created in the collisions. Their efficient reconstruction is prerequisite for essentially all CBM observables.

The up-to-date version of hydro-kinetic model include the realistic features of heavy ion collisions typical for RHIC and LHC energies in the way directed by the papers [3,4]:

 - The equation of state (EoS) is constructed for the case of crossover QGP-HG phase transition and combines lattice-QCD inspired results for QGP phase and ideal gas mixture of all hadron species, well-established by Particle Data Group (326 sorts).
 - Gradual decay of short-lived resonances into expanding hadronic system according to their widths define the composition of the gas and hence its EoS at each space-time points. The decays contribute also to emission function and hence to the particle spectra.
 - The cross-sections and collision rates in the hadronic gas are calculated in accordance with the UrQMD model.
 - Initial conditions for hydrodynamic evolution are taken from Glauber or CGC approaches.
 
  Switching to the transport code (UrQMD) is performed at the space-like hypersurface with essentially non-equilibrium hadron distribution functions calculated in hydro-kinetic approach. This essential extension of the model permits one to calculate the tails of hadron scatterings at low-density final stage.  
 With the model given, a reasonable description of transverse momentum spectra for several sorts of hadrons and pion HBT radii is achieved for top RHIC energy. The reproduction of recent ALICE LHC femtoscopic results is also presented.

         Fixed target operation with proton and lead beams of LHC provides new possibilities  for investigation of a mechanism of quarkonium production and suppression with good statistics at the energy interval between SPS and RHIC  
The dissociation of heavy quark resonances by colour screening in a deconfined medium  is one of the possible signature of Quark Gluon Plasma formation in high energy heavy ion collisions. Investigation of charmonium production by decay on two leptons (muons) was started at the CERN SPS [1], continued at RHIC [2,3] and now is going at  LHC, CERN. 
       The theoretical models without regeneration that could reproduce SPS results produce too strong J/ψ suppression at RHIC energies. At  LHC energy a process of charmonium production is different with respect to the SPS and even to the RHIC. The theoretical estimates   give different results, some predict strong suppression [4], some predict enhancement [5]. In addition to prompt production from hard scattering, charmonium states could be produced due to recombination which may give an enhancement instead of a suppression.
      The energy interval between  SPS and RHIC  is very important for a study of the mechanism of quarkonium production and suppression. If the proton and ion beams will be used at LHC with fixed targets, the energy for 7 TeV proton beam  will be  s = 114.6 GeV, for 2.75 TeV  Pb   beam    s = 71.8 GeV.
        In order to  separate normal and anomalous charmonium suppression we need to have data for  pp interaction and several target nuclei, which is easy to do with fixed target and very hard with colliding beams.
         As it was already used for the experiment on collider with a fixed target at HERA-B, the target in the form of thin ribbon could be placed around the main orbit of LHC.  The life time of the beam is determined by the beam-beam and beam-gas interactions.  Therefore after some time the particles will leave the main orbit and interact with the target ribbon. So for fixed target measurements only halo of the beam will be used and no deterioration of the main beam will be introduced. The experiments at different interaction points will not feel any presence of the fixed target.
        In order to study a capability of using the fixed target at LHC for charmonium production we calculate geometrical acceptances for J/ψ production, compare acceptances at collider experiments (RHIC and LHC) with existing fixed target experiments. Then we estimate the counting rates and show that  J/ψ production on fixed target at LHC could be measured with rather high statistics collected in several days of data taking.

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Centrality dependence of viscous quark gluon plasma at LHC,"Chaudhuri, Asis",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Extensive analysis of RHIC data at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=200 GeV Au+Au collisions has provided convincing evidence that Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in such a collision behaves almost like a perfect fluid with viscosity per specific enropy $\eta/s$ is around the lower bound as per AdS/CFT  $\eta/s=1/4\pi$. Recently, ALICE collaboration has come out with the data for elliptic flow as a function of $p_T$ as well as the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity in $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collision [1]. Curiously enough ALICE data for charged particles can be explained by using almost the same value of $\eta/s \approx$ 0.08 as in RHIC, except for very central collision where the data favors ideal fluid $\eta/s \approx$0 rather than a viscous fluid, although energy of collision at LHC is substantially higher than RHIC energy and expected to go up still further to $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=5.5 TeV. 
It is also expected, in general, that $\eta/s$ should go up for QGP as a function of temperature [2]. For RHIC, it is also expected that the hadron system is more relevant than QGP, whereas, for LHC QGP viscosity should be more important than the hadronic system [3]. So, it is quite natural to ask the question why $\eta/s$ for RHIC remain rather similar to LHC, around $\eta/s \approx$0.08.
We investigate this issue and came to the inevitable conclusion that this similarity is forced upon us by the dynamics related to the geometry of the collision. For central collision or near about a value of initial time of $\tau_i \approx$=0.2 fm and a temperature of 700 MeV is quite reasonable. However, taking into account peripheral collision (70-80%) one can not escape from $\tau_i \approx$ 0.6 fm with initial temperature of 500 MeV. Please note that even for $\tau_i$=0.6 fm the fitted energy density remains at ~126 $GeV/fm^3$, a factor of 3.5 larger than required for RHIV energy collision.
The role of peripheral collision has been overlooked by for and large; it is interesting to note that it is the peripheral collision which precipitates recent LHC data to behave rather closely to RHIC data. We need to know $\eta/s$ as a function of temperature to pin point the location of phase transition or rapid cross over from hadronic to quark gluon plasma. Data even at a higher energu $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$=5 TeV especially for photon and dilepton results will facilitate this idea.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,Status of the Search for Hadronic Squeezed Correlations at RHIC Energies,"Padula, Sandra S.","Instituto de Fisica Teorica (IFT)-Univ. Estadual Paulista, SP, Brazil",Brazil,"The hot and dense medium formed in high energy heavy ion collisions may induce shifts of hadronic masses from their asymptotic values. In case this mass modification indeed occurs, it was demonstrated that squeezed correlations of particle-antiparticle pairs, also known as Back-to-Back Correlations (BBC), should appear. They are expected either in the bosonic (bBBC) or in the fermionic (fBBC) cases [1], in both being positive correlations of unlimited intensity, even for finite-size systems expanding with moderate flow [2]. Although they could nicely probe the mass shift with asymptotic particles, these hadronic squeezed correlations are very sensitive to the functional form of their time emission distribution. This strong sensitivity was demonstrated in [1], by comparing the sudden emission with a Lorentzian distribution, which reduced the intensity of the effect by orders of magnitude. We show here that the reduction of the signal is even more dramatic if this time emission is parameterized  by a Levy-type of distribution [3], although it could still survive if the duration of the process is short and if we search for the effect with lighter mesons, such as kaons. 
 
To experimentally search for the  BBC signal, we have suggested to look for the particle-antiparticle squeezed correlation function, plotted in terms of the average momentum of the pair,  $\vec{K}_{12}=(\vec{k}_1+\vec{k}_2)/2$, for high values of their relative momentum, $\vec{q}_{12}=(\vec{k}_1-\vec{k}_2)$ [4]. The first experimental search for the squeezed particle-antiparticle correlations was shown for different hadron pairs in Ref. [5].  We compare here such preliminary results with predictions of our model for $K+ K-$ pairs, showing that the outcome of the experimental search may be still inconclusive, however it does not deny the existence of the squeezing effect on kaons produced at RHIC energies with in-medium modified masses.

"Experiments upgrade, future facilities and instrumentations",poster,Development of the CBM RICH detector,"Mahmoud, Tariq",Universität Gießen,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is the future heavy-ion experiment at FAIR being designed to explore the intermediate range of the QCD phase diagram in a beam energy interval of 10-45 AGeV. With its physics program CBM will investigate the properties of dense baryonic matter and the expected phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter. Among the key observables are low-mass vector mesons and charmonium decaying into lepton pairs. In CBM, electrons with energies lower than 8 GeV/c will be identified through a RICH detector being developed at several laboratories. In addition the detector will improve the kaon/pion separation at momenta higher than 4 GeV/c. 

The proposed concept of the RICH detector foresees CO2 as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors reflecting the Cerenkov radiation on an array of Multianode Photomultipliers (MAPMTs) as photo detectors. 
CO2 has been chosen because it has a Lorenz factor, gth, of 33.3, a radiation length of 183 m and a pion momentum threshold for Cerenkov light production of 4.65 GeV/c, it represents a very good compromise to fulfill the CBM RICH requirements.
The mirror system will be of approximately 11.8 m² with a curvature radius of 3 m and a thickness of 6 mm. For the reflective coating Al+MgF2 are foreseen. In order to cover a spherical mirror wall with a radius of 3 m, square mirror tiles of approximately 40×40cm²  will be used.
Regarding the photo detector investigations indicated that the 64 channel Hamamatsu H8500 MAPMT is one of the most promising candidates for the CBM RICH. The main criteria for the readout of this MAPMT are the high interaction rates (up to 10 MHz) and the challenging high level triggers in CBM. To cope with these facts a self triggered readout electronics is foreseen. The Front End Electronics (FEE) will be based on a further development of the so called n-XYTER chip which was developed for the readout of silicon detectors. The chip offers 128 channels at a readout speed of 32 MHz. As an intermediate solution the high gain of the MAPMT is currently matched to the existing chip via a charge attenuator board. 

These components were successfully tested in laboratories and in several test beams. Single photon counting and Cerenkov light detection confirmed the suitability of the FEE and MAPMT setup. The tests also show that uncorrelated noise can be well separated from the signal using available timing information. The usage of wavelength shifter films in order to enhance the quantum efficiency of the MAPMT for wavelengths below 300 nm is investigated. An industrial provider for mirror prototypes with promising  surface homogeneity and reflectivity has been found.

The concept of the RICH detector as well as results of several tests will be presented. They are valuable experience for the preparation of a full scale RICH prototype setup currently under construction and to be tested at CERN in fall 2011.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tariq', 'last_name': 'Mahmoud', 'fullName': 'Mahmoud, Tariq', 'id': '1897372', 'affiliation': 'Universität Gießen', 'emailHash': 'eed890d7284515f7fbca1eef9041075f', 'db_id': 1897372, 'person_id': 2047500}"

These values are 2.3 and 3.5  times the AdS/CFT conjectured lower bound $1/4\pi$. We compare the CSPM $\eta/s(T/T_{c})$ analytic expression with weak coupling (wQGP) and strong coupling (sQGP) calculations. This indicates that the QGP is a strongly coupled fluid in the phase transition region.

The track impact parameter, defined as the distance of closest

This is, in particular, the case for the detection of particles with open charm and open beauty, namely D0 (cτ ∼ 123μm) , D+ (cτ ∼ 315μm) and B mesons(cτ ∼ 500μm).

Global and collective dynamics,poster,Hydrodynamical analysis of centrality dependence of charged particle’s multiplicity in √sNN=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collision,"Chaudhuri, Asis",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Ongoing heavy ion collision at Large Hadron Collider, CERN is expected to settle the important issues like the possibility of formation of the lattice QCD predicted strongly interacting nuclear matter known as Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the important issue of thermalization and the time taken by the system to achieve the same. Recently ALICE collaboration [1] measured the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity in √sNN=2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collision. The viscous hydro was pretty successful to describe the experimental particle multiplicity and elliptic flow data at RHIC energy, from which the initial condition of the produced medium can also be traced back. We use 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic model  to explain  the centrality dependence of experimental charged particle multiplicity produced in Pb-Pb  √sNN=2.76 TeV collision and obtain the initial condition of the fluid produced. The space time evolution of the fluid is obtained by solving energy momentum conservation along with solving relaxation equation for shear viscous stresses obtained from Israel-Stewart’s 2nd order theory. The conservation equation were closed with an equation of state (EOS) constructed from recent lattice data [2] for QGP phase which undergoes a crossover transition to Hadronic phase (comprising all the resonances below mass 2.5 GeV) at crossover temperature Tco=174 MeV. It was assumed that initial energy density  was mostly scaled with number of binary collision and the system freezes out when the temperature at any space-time points reaches Tf=130 MeV. Our study [3] shows that hydrodynamical evolution of QGP fluid, with viscosity to entropy density ratio η/s=1/4π, initialized to central energy density εi =370 GeV/fm3 at initial time τi=0.6 fm/c or initialized to energy density εi =72 GeV/fm3 at initial time τi=1.0 fm/c explains the ALICE data on centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity. Smaller initial time τi=0.2 fm/c do not reproduce the data. Initial time τi=0.6-1.0 fm/c is also consistent with ALICE measurement of charged particles pT spectra and elliptic flow. We also show that an alternative of hadronic resonance gas, even at the unphysical high temperature of T=220 MeV do not explains the ALICE data.

Electromagnetic probes,poster,Photon and dilepton production from viscous QGP,"Sinha, Bikash",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Photons and dileptons are important probe for the lattice QCD predicted deconfined matter, commonly called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP).  Unlike the  strongly interacting hadrons, which can give information about the ‘last scattering surface’, electromagnetically interacting  photons and dileptons give information about the matter at the deep interior. Viscous effects on photon and dilepton production is studied recently [1,2].  However, the model [1,2] appears to have some inconsistency that viscous effects on fluid evolution were not accounted for. In a recent work, we have removed the  inconsistency [3]. Photon production rate from Compton and annihilation processes was convoluted over the space-time evolution of the QGP, obtained by explicitly solving Israel-Stewart’s 2nd order theory of hydrodynamics. In viscous dynamics, photon/dilepton production is modified due to (i) changed space-time evolution of the fluid and (ii) non-equilibrium correction to the equilibrium distribution function. The non-equilibrium correction grows with viscosity as well with transverse momentum. Applicability of viscous hydrodynamics requires that the non-equilibrium correction is small. Viscous effects on photon and dilepton production are strong [3,4]. Even for AdS/CFT lower bound of viscosity ($\eta$/s=0.08), strong viscous correction render the hydrodynamics inapplicable beyond pT ~ 1.5 GeV.  If QGP viscosity is larger than the Ads/CFT limit, then limitation will be even more severe. Photon production as a function of initial time, also suggest that if the   inverse slope parameter of the photon spectra, is measured within an accuracy of ~20-80 MeV, one can possibly estimate the initial time and viscosity within reasonable limit. We also find that for dilepton invariant mass M~600-900 MeV, the dilepton to  photon ratio is sensitive to viscosity to entropy ratio of the medium. The dilepton to  photon ratio can possibly serve as a ‘viscometer’ for QGP.

We show that the future p-A data to be collected at the LHC should allow one to disentangle the various nPDF sets currently available. In heavy-ion collisions, the photon transverse momentum can be used to gauge the initial energy of the massive parton which is expected to propagate through the dense QCD medium produced in those collisions.  The two-particle final state provides a range of observables (jet asymmetry, photon-jet pair momentum, among others), through the use of which a better understanding of parton energy loss processes in the massive quark sector can be achieved, as shown by the present phenomenological analysis carried out in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tzvetalina', 'last_name': 'Stavreva', 'fullName': 'Stavreva, Tzvetalina', 'id': '1897280', 'affiliation': 'LPSC', 'emailHash': 'a08ce01621c0ab46b5e3a706a3cfaa58', 'db_id': 1897280, 'person_id': 2047250}"
Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,poster,Quarkonia propagation and collectivity in the QGP: Towards the suppression of quarkonia suppression,"Berrehrah, Hamza",Subatech,Unknown,"For 20 years, the suppression of quarkonia has been studied as a probe of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) properties, either by Debye screening of the interaction between the q-qbar pair (Matsui and Satz) or via gluo-dissociation of quarkonia states, which remain strongly bound (Kharzeev). However, the comparison between experimental data and scenarios including suppression mechanisms is not very conclusive.
  Rather than focusing only on these “suppressed” quarkonia, an alternative track is to focus not only on the suppressed but also on the physical properties of quarkonia survivors in the QGP. In fact, recent results from NA50 and NA60 experiments at SPS showed that these quarkonia indeed carry a non-zero elliptic flow. This could lead to a reconsideration of the propagation and collectivity of these quarkonia in the QGP, especially the elastic scattering process of quarkonia states with the partons in the QGP. 
  We study the quarkonia propagation and collectivity by using a hydrodynamic transport code. This code requires the evaluation of two ingredients: The elastic cross section and the Fokker-Planck (FP) coefficients for stochastic processes (drag and diffusion coefficients).

  In my contribution, I will first present some theoretical calculations and results obtained for the elastic cross section, following perturbative calculations in quantum mechanics and in QCD. I will then present our model for the estimation of FP coefficients and discuss the collisional energy loss of quarkonia in the QGP. Finally, results deduced from our transport code MC@SHQ to study the quarkonia propagation and collectivity are shown. The general tendency of our results shows that quarkonia elastic processes have non-negligible influence on the quarkonia study in the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hamza', 'last_name': 'Berrehrah', 'fullName': 'Berrehrah, Hamza', 'id': '1897277', 'affiliation': 'Subatech', 'emailHash': '6d1235bfaf1b3a9714f67eb156caa3bf', 'db_id': 1897277, 'person_id': 2047445}"

pairs in the invariant mass range of 0.2 to 0.5 GeV/c^2 in Au+Au collisions
at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. However, it is difficult to draw a firm physics
conclusion from the measurement, since the measurement still has large
statistical and systematic uncertainties.The main uncertainty comes from
the small signal-to-background ratio of about 1/200 in minimum bias
collisions. The electron decay branching ratios of light vector mesons
are very small (~10^{-4}), while there are many background electrons mainly
originating from pi^0 Dalitz decays and gamma conversions.
 A Hadron Blind Detector,(HBD) has been installed in the PHENIX to reject
such background electrons using the opening angle information of electron
positron pairs, since the opening angle of electron positron pairs from
those decays is small compared to the pairs from light vector mesons.
PHENIX has successfully collected p+p and Au+Au data with the HBD in 2009 and
2010.
 In Au+Au central collisions, high occupancy of HBD readout pads needs to be
handled. The high occupancy is mainly due to the scintillation light emitted
by CF4, which is the Cherenkov radiator gas of the HBD. In Au+Au peripheral
collisions or p+p collisions, the effect of scintillation light is negligible
compared to the Cherenkov light by electrons. However, in Au+Au central

scintillation lights becomes significant.

Jets,poster,Energy density in Pb-Pb Collisions at LHC,"Djuvsland, Oeystein",University of Bergen,Unknown,"In ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at sufficiently large energy densities, a new state of strongly interacting matter is created, often referred to as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). 
The produced medium can be attributed a formation time, and a formed energy density can be estimated based on the transverse energy ($E_T$) produced in these collisions via the Bjorken 
formula (Bjorken, 1983).

Data from Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt{s_NN}=2.76 TeV measured with the ALICE experiment in 2010 has been analyzed to extract dE_T/d_eta for different centrality bins. The measurement has been done with two methods, using the tracking system to obtain the hadronic part and calorimetry for the electromagnetic part of E_T. We will present the status of the measurements, with the main focus on the calorimetry measurement with the ALICE PHOS. Due to its high energy resolution PHOS is well suited for precision measurements starting at low gamma energies. 

We will also compare to the available theoretical models, which display a rather large variation in their predictions. Results from earlier experiments up to RHIC energies are consistent with a 
linear increase in E_T with ln(sqrt{s}). Gluon saturation models, which reproduce the charged particle multiplicity well, generally predict a much stronger increase in E_T towards the energies at LHC.

Earlier STAR results have shown a $\Delta \eta$ elongated structure for the small $\Delta \phi$ angles (on the same-side) and the development of significant deformations at $\Delta \phi \aprox \pi$ (on the away-side). In this talk we will present new results from such correlation analysis that show unambiguously formation of a double-hump structure on the away side in raw correlation measured in very central Au+Au collisions for intermediate pT (2$<$pT$<$5GeV/c) particles.

We carry out systematic investigation of the same- and away-side features by varying the event centrality and kinematic selection for 200GeV Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions. To characterize the observed correlation structure we fit the data with a multi-component model that includes a same side Gaussian and higher order Fourier moments (vn; n = 1,2,3,4). The impact of including the third Fourier moment in the fit on the elongated same-side structure and the second Fourier moment (related to the elliptic flow strength) is discussed.

Finally we compare our data to theoretical expectations based on CGC initial conditions [1], [2], initial density fluctuations [3] and pQCD [4]. We conclude that, within the studied model, the same-side eta elongated structure is consistent with a coexistence of jet and non-jet contributions.

However, effects such as the statistical recombination of heavy flavor quark-antiquark pairs or co-mover absorption can also affect quarkonia production.  For the bottomonium states these competing effects are expected to be smaller than for the charmonium states.  Lattice calculations show that quantifying the suppression of an entire family of quarkonium mesons can give us a model dependent measurement of the temperature of the matter produced in heavy ion collisions.  For the $\Upsilon$ family, calculations indicate that the $\Upsilon(1S)$ state should not be suppressed at $\sqrt(s) = $ 200 GeV, which would give a standard candle that the $\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\Upsilon(3S)$ states can be compared to.  The suppression of quarkonia can be quantified by calculating the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, which is the ratio of production in p+p scaled by the number of binary collisions to the production in Au+Au collisions.  

We will present results for mid-rapidity $\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{{s}_{NN }}$ = 200 GeV.

Correlations and fluctuations,poster,Local Parity Violation or Local Charge Conservation/Flow? A Reaction-Plane-Dependent Balance Function Study,"Wang, Hui",Michigan state university,USA,"STAR has recently reported charge-dependent azimuthal correlations that are sensitive to the charge separation effect in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV [1]. Qualitatively, these results agree with some of the theoretical predictions for local parity violation in heavy-ion collisions. However, a study using reaction-plane-dependent balance functions shows an alternative origin of this signal. The balance function, which measures the
correlation between oppositely charged pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges. The reaction-plane dependent balance function measurements can be related to STAR's charge-dependent azimuthal correlations. We report reaction-plane-dependent balance functions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 , 62.4, 39, 11.5, and 7.7 GeV using the STAR detector. The model of Schlicting and Pratt [2] incorporating local charge conservation and elliptic flow reproduces most of the three-particle azimuthal correlation results at 200 GeV.

implications of such a QCD phase transition in the early universe. We
propose that the large baryon-asymmetry is diluted by a little
inflation where the universe is trapped in a false vacuum state of
QCD. The little inflation period will change the freeze-out criteria
for WIMP dark matter so that their annihilation and production cross
section would be reduced by orders of magnitude.  In addition the
power spectrum of cold dark matter can be affected up to mass scales
of globular clusters. The effects of the QCD phase transition on the
relic gravitational wave spectrum is controlled by the trace anomaly
of QCD where we apply recent data from lattice gauge calculations. The
QCD transition imprints a strong step into the spectrum of
gravitational waves depending on the strength of the QCD phase
transition which could be detected with the gravitational wave
detectors LISA, BBO and by pulsar timing. The little QCD inflation
scenario could be probed with the low-energy run at BNL's RHIC,

QCD phase diagram,poster,Role of Finite Size Baryons in QCD Phase Transition and Critical Point,"Srivastava, Prashant Kumar",Banaras Hindu University,Unknown,"The physics regarding the existence of the critical point on the QCD phase boundary still remains unclear and its precise location is quite uncertain. We follow the suggestion of T. D. Lee et. al. [Phys. Rev. D9, 2291 (1974)] that a phase transition at high baryon density in a bulk matter can be realized in which nucleon loses part of its mass and thus baryons play a significant role in the phase transition. We suggest that the hadron gas consists of pointlike mesons and each baryon having a geometrical hard-core size. It means that mesons can fuse into one another while baryons experience a repulsive force with other baryons when densely packed. We formulate an excluded volume model existing for the equation of state (EOS) of hot, dense hadron gas and for the quark gluon plasma we use a thermodynamically consistent quasiparticle model (QPM). We construct a first order phase transition using Gibbs' equilibrium criteria. This leads to an interesting and surprising finding that a critical point exists in such a formulation beyond which a cross-over region appears. We find that such a picture always appears in all excluded volume models considered in the literature. For ideal hadron gas model, there is no critical point in the diagram. In the mean field model also, we do not get a critical point unless we incorporate an excluded potential effect. Our analysis strongly suggests that the existence of a critical point and a cross-over region owes its explanation in the finite size baryons in the hadron gas.  We find an interesting result that the ratio of the baryons to the total hadrons at the critical point is around 0.2 in all types of models and thus a cross-over region starts as soon as this ratio becomes smaller than 0.2.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Prashant Kumar', 'last_name': 'Srivastava', 'fullName': 'Srivastava, Prashant Kumar', 'id': '1897079', 'affiliation': 'Banaras Hindu University', 'emailHash': '705c47f21494a22008a498bc0ad224c9', 'db_id': 1897079, 'person_id': 2047307}"
New theoretical developments,poster,"Extended Schematic Model for Hadrons, and What Happens to the Radius of an Excited Hadron","Friedmann, Tamar",University of Rochester,Unknown,"It is well-known that making reliable predictions about low-energy QCD and hadrons is a great challenge, as perturbative methods of quantum field theory do not apply when the coupling constant is strong. The common approach has been to propose various dynamical models which are inspired by assumptions, ideas, and intuition borrowed from physical systems which are not QCD. In this talk, I present refs. 1, 2 below. I will show how a schematic model employing pure QCD ingredients can teach us about the dynamics of QCD. I will present a new extended schematic model for hadrons where diquarks serve as building blocks on equal footing with quarks, and use it to reclassify the hadron spectrum. The outcome is that there are no radially excited mesons and no radially excited baryons; mesons and baryons which were believed to be radially excited are actually orbitally excited states involving diquarks. The reclassification thereby provides a new set of relations between two fundamental properties of hadrons: their size and their energy. The relations state that the size of a hadron is largest in the ground state and shrinks when the hadron is excited, contrary to practically all dynamical models proposed for QCD where the quarks are allowed to be pushed apart by a centrifugal barrier or radial excitations. While this set of relations appears counter-intuitive, it provides a novel explanation for the relationship between confinement and asymptotic freedom. It shows that we can overcome confinement and reach asymptotic freedom by increasing a hadron’s orbital excitation: the path from confinement to asymptotic freedom is a Regge trajectory. This sheds new light not only on the low energy regime of QCD but also on its connection with high energies. 

It is significant that the above set of relations predicts a QCD effect whereby a hadron can shrink. It is especially important since protons and neutrons, which make up the bulk of ordinary matter, are hadrons, and as such they obey the said relations. Our prediction proved to be concrete and testable when it was confirmed by an experiment that showed that the size of the proton shrinks (Pohl et. al., Nature 466, 213) nine months after this work was posted.

Hadron thermodynamics and chemistry,poster,Identifying multi-quark hadrons from heavy ion collisions,"Cho, Sungtae",Yonsei University,Unknown,"We propose a new approach of using relativistic heavy ion collisions to identify and study multi-quark hadrons. We focus on the expected production yields of these hadrons and show that their production yields are strongly affected by their internal structure [1], e.g. multi-quark configurations or hadronic molecules. 


We mainly use the coalescence model, which was successful in explaining the enhanced production of baryons at midrapidity in the intermediate transverse momentum region [2, 3] and the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow of identified hadrons [4]. Based on the coalescence model, we are able to take into account the effects of the internal structure of hadrons, such as the angular momentum and the multiplicity of quarks [5. 6], on their production yields. We also rely on the statistical model [7], which has been known to describe the relative yields of normal hadrons very well, to extract important parameters for the coalescence model and normalize the expected yields. 


We find that the ratio of the production yields of normal hadrons calculated in the coalescence model to those from the statistical model, N^{coal}/N^{stat}, is in the range 0.2$<$N^{coal}/N^{stat}$<$2. This ratio is, however, typically an order of magnitude smaller if a hadron is a compact multi-quark state. On the other hand, for a hadron which is a loosely bound hadronic molecule, it would be more abundantly formed than the expected production yield by a factor of two and more. We further find that the yields of multi-quark hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions are large enough for detection in experiments. For example, the D_{sJ}(2317) yield per unit rapidity is predicted to be more than 2*10^{-3} in central heavy ion collisions at RHIC. Therefore, relativistic heavy ion collision experiments provide a promising opportunity for studying multi-quark hadrons. By measuring their production yields in these experiments, we expect to achieve both new discovery of exotic hadrons and the understanding of their internal structures at the same time.

We show that the Weizsacker-Williams distribution can be probed in a dijet production process in DIS whereas the Fourier transform of the color dipole appears in photon-jet production in pA collisions.

The developed model considers the confining colour tube as the cylindrical

A close inspection of the free energies of elongated cylindrical  bag  and the confining  colour  tube  that  connects the static quark-antiquark pair 
allows us to find out the string tension in terms of the surface tension, thermal pressure and the bag radius. Using the derived relation it is possible
to estimate the bag surface tension at zero temperature directly from the lattice QCD data. The requirement of positive entropy density of such bags leads to 
negative values of the surface tension coefficient of quark gluon bags at the cross-over region, i.e. at the continuous transition to deconfined quarks and gluons.
It is shown that such an approach naturally accounts for an existence of a very pronounced surprising  maximum  of the  string  entropy observed  in the lattice QCD simulations, which, as we argue, signals about the fractional surface formation of

,poster,Radiative energy loss reduction in a plasma due to damping,"Bluhm, Marcus",Laboratoire SUBATECH,Unknown,"The strong quenching of jets and the suppression of hadron spectra 
at high transverse momenta are striking experimental observations 
made in high energy nuclear collisions. Both have been interpreted 
as signature for the formation of a deconfined plasma of QCD 
matter, in which partons suffer a medium-induced energy loss. In 
theoretical studies devoted to a parton's radiative energy loss, 
however, the damping of radiation within the plasma has so far 
widely been neglected. 

We investigate the radiative energy loss per unit distance of a 
relativistic colour charge traversing as probe an infinite 
absorptive plasma. The Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is 
incorporated as well as modifications due to the polarization of 
and damping mechanisms in the medium. The latter are 
phenomenologically described by a complex index of refraction, 
while the colour charge dynamics is considered in the Abelian 
approximation. We find a substantial reduction of the medium-
induced mechanical work in addition to the well known Ter-
Mikaelian effect from the polarization of matter. Moreover, the 
formation time of radiated quanta is also drastically reduced, 
both for small frequencies, where damping has a minor additional 
impact besides the polarization effect, and for larger frequencies. 
These effects are more pronounced for larger medium damping 
and/or larger initial energy of the charge. 

Therefore, we expect that our study will have a significant impact 
on the understanding of jet quenching phenomena in ultra-
relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and even more at LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marcus', 'last_name': 'Bluhm', 'fullName': 'Bluhm, Marcus', 'id': '1896803', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire SUBATECH', 'emailHash': '7290f465e860db3668f19807ef470560', 'db_id': 1896803, 'person_id': 2046996}"

The time evolution of this fluid can be described by hydrodynamical models. After expansion and cooling, the freeze-out happens and hadrons are created. Their distribution reveals information about the final state of the fluid. To investigate the time evolution one needs to analyze penetrating probes, such as direct photon spectra. Distributions of low momentum photons was published in 2010 by PHENIX. Such low momentum distributions can be compared to hydrodynamics to determine the equation of state and the initial temperature of sQGP. In this paper we analyze a 3+1 dimensional solution of relativistic hydrodynamics. We calculate momentum distribution of low momentum thermal photons and other observables from the model. Using earlier fits of this model to hadronic spectra, we compare photon calculations to measurements from RHIC. We find that the initial temperature of the center of the fireball is at least 519+-12 MeV, while for a time averaged equation of state we get c_s=0.36+-0.02.

New theoretical developments,poster,Simulations of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of  the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma,"Filinov, Vladimir","Joint Institute for High Temperatures, Russian Academy of  Sciences, Russia",Unknown,"In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in dynamics and thermodynamics of  non-Abelian plasmas at both very high temperature and density. It is expected that a specific state of matter with unconfined quarks and gluons - the so called quark - gluon plasma (QGP) - can exist. The most fundamental way to compute properties of the strongly interacting matter is provided by the lattice QCD. Interpretation of these very complicated computations requires application of various QCD motivated, albeit schematic, models simulating various aspects of the full theory. Moreover, such models are needed in cases when the lattice QCD fails, e.g. at large baryon chemical potentials and out of equilibrium. A semi-classical approximation, based on a point like quasi-particle picture has been recently introduced in literature. It is expected that it allows to treat soft processes in the QGP which are not accessible by the perturbative means and the main features of non-Abelian plasmas can be understood in simple semi-classical terms without the difficulties inherent to a full quantum field theoretical analysis.  
Here we propose stochastic simulation of thermodynamics and kinetic properties  for  QGP  in semi-classical approximation in the wide region of temperature, density and quasi-particles masses. We extend previous classical nonrelativistic simulations based on a color Coulomb interaction to the quantum regime and take  into account the Fermi (Bose) statistics of quarks (gluons) and quantum degeneracy self-consistently. 
In grand canonical ensemble for finite and zero baryon chemical potential we use the direct quantum path integral Monte Carlo method (PIMC) developed for finite temperature within Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics to do calculations of internal energy, pressure and pair correlation functions. The QGP quasi-particles representing dressed quarks, antiquarks and gluons interact via color quantum  Kelbg pseudopotential rigorously derived in for Coulomb particles. This method has been successfully applied to strongly coupled electrodynamic plasmas (EMP) . A strongly correlated behavior of the QGP is expected to show up in long-ranged spatial correlations of quarks and gluons which, in fact, may give rise to liquid-like and, possibly, solid-like structures. This expectation is based on a very similar behavior observed in electrodynamic plasmas. 
We have done already the first calculation of the QGP equation of state, spatial and color pair distribution functions, diffusion coefficients and shear viscosity. The preliminary results has already been reported and discussed at the  international conferences and meetings and are accepted for publications.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vladimir', 'last_name': 'Filinov', 'fullName': 'Filinov, Vladimir', 'id': '1897199', 'affiliation': 'Joint Institute for High Temperatures, Russian Academy of  Sciences, Russia', 'emailHash': '194211995a8523992cbc5b90fb48ce22', 'db_id': 1897199, 'person_id': 2047391}"
QCD phase diagram,poster,Roles of Axial Anomaly on Neutral Strongly Interacting Matter ----  New Critical Points at Low Temperature and the Absence of Chromomagnetic Instabilty ----,"Kunihiro, Teiji","Kyoto University, Japan",Unknown,"We investigate effects of the axial anomaly term with a chiral-diquark coupling on the phase diagram within a two-plus-one-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model under the charge-neutrality and $\beta$-equilibrium constraints. We find that when such constraints are imposed, the new anomaly term plays a quite similar role as the vector interaction does on the phase diagram, which the present authors clarified in a previous work. Thus, there appear several types of phase structures with multiple critical points at low temperature $T$, although such phase diagrams with low-$T$ critical point(s) are never realized without these constraints even within the same model Lagrangian. This drastic change is attributed to an enhanced interplay between the chiral and diquark condensates due to the anomaly term at finite temperature; the u-d diquark coupling is strengthened by the relatively large chiral condensate of the strange quark through the anomaly term, which in turn definitely leads to the abnormal behavior of the diquark condensate at finite $T$, inherent to the asymmetric quark matter. We also show that the chromomagnetic instability of the neutral asymmetric homogenous two-flavor color superconducting(2CSC) phase is suppressed and can be even completely cured by the enhanced diquark coupling due to the anomaly term and/or by the vector interaction","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Teiji', 'last_name': 'Kunihiro', 'fullName': 'Kunihiro, Teiji', 'id': '1897198', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto University, Japan', 'emailHash': '3030e3f4154e04a400389ba8347340a3', 'db_id': 1897198, 'person_id': 2046946}"

Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,poster,The influence of bulk evolution models on heavy-quark phenomenology,"Gossiaux, Pol",Subatech,Unknown,"Heavy quarks are considered as one of the essential probes to study the interior of a QGP. The experimental observables contain only the combined information about the expansion of the system and the elementary interaction of heavy quarks with the plasma constituants. In order to asses the latter, we have to understand the influence of different expansion scenarios on the observables. In practice, models proposed by various groups for interpreting RHIC heavy quark data should be thoroughly compared before one can progress towards the understanding of LHC data. In this contribution we report on the joint effort of SUBATECH and TAMU in this respect: We study the impact of different Quark-Gluon Plasma expansion scenarios in heavy-ion collisions on spectra and elliptic flow of heavy quarks. For identical heavy-quark transport coefficients relativistic Langevin simulations with different expansion scenarios can lead to appreciable variations in the calculated suppression and elliptic flow of the heavy-quark spectra, by up to a factor of two. A cross comparison with two sets of transport coefficients supports these findings, illustrating the importance of realistic expansion models for quantitative evaluations of heavy-quark observables in heavy-ion collisions. It also turns out that differences in freeze-out prescriptions and Langevin realizations play a significant role in these variations. Light-quark observables are essential in reducing the uncertainties associated with the bulk-matter evolution, even though uncertainties due to the freeze-out prescription persist.

 To constrain these properties we have developed a software framework CHIMERA that is designed to perform statistical evaluation of multiple QGP signatures by comparing results from our multi-stage hydrodynamics/hadron cascade model of heavy ion collisions to the key soft observables (HBT, elliptic flow, spectra) measured at RHIC and LHC. All relevant data from different experiments are conveniently compiled into a single format. The unique feature of CHIMERA is that it utilizes both statistical and systematic uncertainties.

Heavy hadrons have a larger probability to be produced within the quark gluon plasma phase due to their short formation times. Heavy mass, high momentum resonances from jet fragmentation are more likely to be affected by the chirally symmetric medium, and the identification of the early produced resonances from jet fragmentation might be a viable option to study chirality [1]. Two particle correlations in di-jet cones can be used to distinguish between in-medium and in-vacuum fragmentation by assuming that the nearside correlations are surface biased whereas the away-side of a di-jet is likely interacting with the partonic medium.
In the analysis a single high pt hadron is chosen as a jet leading particle. Then the correlations of phi(1020) and K*(892), identified by their hadronic decay, with this leading particle have been studied in pp collisions at 7 TeV. The characteristics of these resonances (mass and width) as a function of the resonance correlation angle have been extracted both on the near side and the away side.

Open charm identification is based on distinguishing the displaced decay vertices from the nuclear collision vertex. This approach calls for a performant vertex detector.

The MFT is a Silicon pixels detector added in the Muon spectrometer acceptance (-4$<$eta$<$-2.5) upstream of the hadronic absorber. The MFT upgrade is motivated by several physics improvements. The measurement of the DCA (Distance of Closest Approach) of single muons and secondary vertex from dimuons will permit the identification of open charm (ctau~ 150 microns) and beauty (ctau ~ 500 microns) mesons. The MFT, thanks to its tracking capabilities, will allow to improve the mass resolution of the resonances for a better separation between rho/omega and phi, jpsi and psi prime,and upsilon family resonances. In addition, it will help to reject a large fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over background ratio. Moreover, the MFT will lead to the direct multiplicity measurement, event by event, of charged particles within the spectrometer acceptance. In order to evaluate the feasability of this upgrade, five Silicon planes were simulated within the AliRoot framework. Effects of multiple scattering in the absorber and L3 magnetic field on muons in the MFT will be shown.
