,parallel,Probing the gluonic structure of matter at a future Electron-Ion Collider,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The probing of nuclei and nucleons via deep-inelastic and diffractive processes in the high-energy (low-x) regime will open a new precision window for the investigation of the gluonic structure of matter.

Studies of e+p collisions at HERA and especially d+Au collisions at RHIC have found tantalizing hints of saturated gluon densities, a phenomenon with substantial impact on the physics of heavy-ion collisions.  Unveiling the collective behavior of densely packed gluons under conditions where their self-interactions dominate will require an Electron-Ion Collider (EIC): a new facility with capabilities well beyond those of any existing accelerator. Such a collider could be sited either at BNL or JLAB. 

In my talk I will outline the compelling physics case for e+A collisions with a focus on the opportunities for small-x physics. I will discuss the related key measurements and give a brief status of machine concepts, detector design, and timeline.",

After a short introduction on open problems at small x, I will briefly present the machine and detector. Then I will focus on small-x aspects in electron-nucleus collisions, first on inclusive measurements and the determination of nuclear parton densities, and then on diffraction.

Jets,parallel,Jet Reconstruction and Jet Background Classification with the ALICE experiment in PbPb collisions at the LHC,"Klein-Boesing, Christian",IKP Muenster,Germany,"The quantification of the effect of parton energy loss, known as jet
quenching, is one of the major goals of jet and high $p_T$
measurements in heavy-ion collisions. Here, the aim of the reconstruction of
jets, as compared to single particle measurements, is to provide a more direct
access to the original parton properties and the modification of the
fragmentation process in heavy-ion collisions.

For a clear interpretation of the reconstructed jet properties and the
measurement of the inclusive jet spectrum in heavy-ion collisions a detailed characterization of the
background and its fluctuation is paramount. In particular collective
effects within one event can enhance or deplete locally the level of
background and modify the jet energy scale.

The ALICE detector with its excellent tracking capabilities is the
ideal tool to study jet reconstruction based on charged particles in the presence of
correlated and uncorrelated background down to particle $p_T$ of 150
MeV/$c$.  

We will evaluate the evolution of background effects using different
probes embedded into heavy-ion data and quantify their influence on
the reconstructed jet spectrum.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christian', 'last_name': 'Klein-Boesing', 'fullName': 'Klein-Boesing, Christian', 'id': '1896758', 'affiliation': 'IKP Muenster', 'emailHash': '85a9d0cd66ec905a74d2a5a0741444e1', 'db_id': 1896758, 'person_id': 2047045}"

We study the interplay of those sources, in an evolving 3D simulation of the colliding system that involves hydrodynamics and hard jets.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Dielectron Continuum Production from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV pp and Au+Au collisions at STAR,"Zhao, Jie",SINAP/LBNL,USA,"Dilepton distributions have been proposed as one of the penetrating probes for hot and dense nuclear matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. Due to their relatively small final-state interaction cross-sections with the hot/dense environment, dileptons bring us direct information of the created matter in such collision. Since dileptons are created over all stages of heavy ion reactions, their sources vary as a function of kinematics. In the low mass region (LMR: mass<1.1GeV/$c^{2}$), dileptons are dominated by vector mesons and directed photons, while in the intermediate mass region (IMR: 1.1< mass< 3GeV/$c^{2}$) dileptons are dominated by thermal radiation of quark gluon plasma (QGP). In the high mass region (HMR: mass> 3 GeV/$c^{2}$), dileptons are mostly contributed by heavy (charm and bottom) quark decays and Drell-Yan processes. As a result, the dilepton distributions, especially in the IMR and HMR, could provide new aspects of early collision dynamics in heavy ion collisions.

With the completion of the full barrel time-of-flight detector, the electron identification has been significantly improved at STAR, especially in low momentum region. In this talk we will present the first STAR results on dielectron production in p+p and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The results will be compared to hadron decay cocktails to search for vector meson in-medium modifications in LMR and the QGP thermal radiation in IMR.

Dynamical fluctuations in global conserved quantities such as baryon number, strangeness, or charge may be observed near a QCD critical point. Results from new measurements of dynamical $K/\pi$, $p/\pi$, and $K/p$ ratio fluctuations are presented. The commencing of a QCD critical point search at RHIC has extended the reach of possible measurements of dynamical $K/\pi$, $p/\pi$, and $K/p$ ratio fluctuations from Au+Au collisions to lower energies. 

The STAR experiment has performed a comprehensive study of the energy dependence of these dynamical fluctuations in Au+Au collisions at the energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 39,  62.4, and 200 GeV.

Measurements of anisotropic flow provided evidence for the creation of strongly interacting matter which appears to behave as an almost ideal fluid. Anisotropic flow signals the presence of multiple interactions and is very sensitive to the initial spatial anisotropy of the overlap region in non-central heavy-ion collisions. In this talk we report measurements of elliptic v2, triangular v3, quadrangular v4 and pentagonal v5 flow. These measurements have been performed with two- and multi-particle correlation techniques.

In weak coupling, the stopping distance scales with energy as E^(1/2), up to logarithms.  In strongly-coupled plasmas with gravity duals, theorists have found that the maximum stopping distance scales instead like E^(1/3).  In the latter case, we show that there can be an important distinction between typical and maximum stopping distances.

New theoretical developments,parallel,Interference effects in medium--induced gluon radiation,"Casalderrey Solana, Jorge",CERN,Switzerland,"The recent results at the LHC on jet quenching in heavy ion
collisions call for a
fundamental understanding of the evolution of a relatively hard jet
propagating through a QCD medium like the quark--gluon plasma. As a first
step in that sense, we consider the interference pattern for the
medium--induced gluon radiation produced by a color singlet
quark--antiquark antenna embedded in a QCD medium with size $L$.
This setup is indeed well suited for studies of coherence phenomena like
angular ordering. We focus on the most favorable kinematics for
medium--induced gluon radiation in the BDMPS--Z regime, that is
transverse momenta $k_\perp \sim \sqrt{\hat q L}$, short formation
times $\tau_f \ll L$, and relatively large emission angles $\theta
\gtrsim \theta_f\equiv(\hat q/\omega)^{1/3}$ ($\hat q$ is the medium
`jet quenching' parameter and $\omega$ is the gluon energy).
We demonstrate that, for a dipole opening angle $\theta_{q\bar q}$
larger than $\theta_f$, there is no interference between
medium--induced gluon emissions by the quark and the antiquark.
That is, the in--medium contribution to the antenna pattern is the
incoherent superposition of two individual BDMPS--Z spectra.
Physically, this is
so since, unlike the direct emissions which can be delocalized anywhere
throughout the medium, the interference terms are non--zero only for the
very early emissions, such that the size of the $q\bar q$ dipole
at the time of emission be smaller than
the transverse wavelength of the emitted gluon.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jorge', 'last_name': 'Casalderrey Solana', 'fullName': 'Casalderrey Solana, Jorge', 'id': '1897567', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '4e4e485192147e6dd3250bf6d8faf700', 'db_id': 1897567, 'person_id': 2047473}"

New theoretical developments,parallel,Determination of relaxation times at weak and strong coupling,"Rischke, Dirk","Institut fur Theoretische Physik, Goethe University, and Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS), 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany",Unknown,"Using linear response theory, we derive [1] conditions for the retarded Green's function so that the linearized equation of motion of a dissipative current is reduced to a relaxation-type equation of the Israel-Stewart type [2]. We prove that this reduction can be done, if the singularity of the retarded Green's function closest to the origin is a simple pole on the imaginary axis. The relaxation time coefficient is then given by the location of this pole in the complex plane. This implies that previous attempts to derive the relaxation time from the generic long-wavelength, low-frequency (i.e., fluid-dynamical) limit of the retarded Green's function, via an expansion in terms of gradients of the fluid-dynamical variables, in general fail to give the correct result.

For a dilute gas, this prescription gives a value for the shear relaxation time that, under certain simplifying assumptions, coincides with the one derived by matching relativistic fluid dynamics to kinetic theory [3]. This shows that transient fluid dynamics is determined by the slowest microscopic and not by the fastest fluid-dynamical time scale. This has important implications for the description of the collective motion of matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, where microscopic time scales and  the lifetime of the system itself can be of the same order. We also prove that the long-wavelength dynamics  of the shear stress tensor in a strongly coupled N=4 SYM plasma is not described by relaxation-type equations as in Israel-Stewart theory [2].

For this purpose, we have developed a Monte Carlo simulation describing the interactions of perturbatively produced, non-eikonally propagating high-energy partons with the quarks and gluons from the expanding QCD medium. The partonic collision rates are computed in leading-order perturbative QCD, while three different hydrodynamical scenarios are used to model the QCD medium: (1+1)-dimensional hydro with initial conditions from the EKRT model for central heavy ion collisions, (2+1)-dimensional hydro with a smooth sWN profile obtained from the optical Glauber model for non-central collisions, and event-by-event hydro with an eBC profile from the Monte Carlo Glauber model to study the initial state fluctuation effects.

We compare our results with the neutral pion suppression observed in sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV Au+Au collisions at the BNL-RHIC.

Analyzing data from PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV, recorded with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, parton energy loss is observed as a significant imbalance of dijet transverse momentum. To gain further understanding of the parton energy loss mechanism and how it manifests itself in the distribution of final state particles, parton fragmentation functions are studied for the leading and subleading jet in bins of centrality and dijet imbalance. 

Dijets are reconstructed using the anti-kT jet algorithm, with the particle flow method of event reconstruction. Particle flow, which is applied to heavy-ion collisions for the first time in this measurement, allows for improved jet reconstruction by combining track and calorimeter information at the particle level.

Our result resums to all loop orders the leading unstable quantum fluctuations at early times. We showed explicitly previously for a scalar field theory [2] that averaging over the analogous spectrum of initial fluctuations leads to hydrodynamic behavior. The computation can now be carried out for QCD and we outline the algorithm for doing so. In addition to providing a mechanism for early thermalization, our result for the small fluctuation spectrum also enables one to compute a) key features of jet modification at early times and b) sphaleron transition rates in the Glasma. An understanding of the latter is crucial for the charge separation mechanism in the Chiral Magnetic Effect. We relate our weak coupling albeit non-perturbative results to strong coupling approaches to thermalization.

Reconstructed jet measurements in heavy ion collisions are expected to significantly improve experimental sensitivity to quenching and to more stringently constrain theoretical descriptions of the quark/gluon-medium interaction. Thus, prior to its commencement, it was anticipated that the LHC heavy ion program would substantially advance the study of jet quenching by providing access to jets with transverse energies in excess of 100 GeV -- sufficiently high that the underlying event would provide only a modest perturbation to the jet measurements.

The number of tubes fluctuates event by event and the width of the tubes introduces a granularity to the initial condition. Both parameters strongly affect the hydrodynamical evolution. For instance, we observe that the increasing granularity reduces the slope of the transverse momentum spectra, decreases the value of the differential elliptic flow at the average transverse momentum, and generates a double-peak structure in the two-particle distribution.

the low mass region (m<1 GeV/c2) consists primarily of pairs from
Dalitz decays of light hadrons and direct decays of vector mesons that
can be modified by the medium, while the intermediate (1<m<3

A large reason is that the pQCD parton spectrum at RHIC is so steeply falling that distinguishing even a moderate shift in parton energy from complete parton absorption is essentially impossible. In essence, energy loss models are effectively only probed in the vicinity of zero energy loss and as a result, only the pathlength dependence of energy loss offers some discriminating power at RHIC kinematics. At LHC, this is no longer the case: Due to the much flatter shape of the parton spectra originating from 2.76 AGeV collisions, the available data probe much deeper into the model dynamics.

Hadron thermodynamics and chemistry,parallel,Measurement of light vector mesons by PHENIX experiment at RHIC,"Sharma, Deepali",Weizmann Institute of Science,United States,"The PHENIX experiment at RHIC has carried out systematic measurements of $\phi$ and $\omega$ mesons in $p+p$, $d+Au$, $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Consistent results have been obtained using leptonic and hadronic decay modes as well as different analysis techniques.
  
In $p+p$ collisions, the transverse momentum distributions of $\omega$ and $\phi$, as well as all other mesons measured by PHENIX, are well described by the Tsallis distribution functional form. Combining the $e^+e^-$ and hadronic ($\omega \rightarrow \pi^0 gamma,~\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$, $\phi \rightarrow K^+K^-$) decay channels, $\omega$ and $\phi$ have been measured over a $p_T$ range of 0 - 13.5 GeV/c and 0 - 7 GeV/c respectively. New results obtained using hadronic and dielectron channels of $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons in $d+Au$ collisions extend the $p_T$ coverage to 0.25 - 13 GeV/c and 0 - 7 GeV/c respectively, and reveal a moderate enhancement at intermediate $p_T$ and a hint of suppression at $p_T >$ 8 GeV/c. Both observations are consistent with previous results for $\pi^0$, $\pi^+ + \pi^-$, $K_s$ and $K^+ + K^-$.

The nuclear modification factor of $\omega$ in $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions measured over a $p_T$ range of 4 - 12 GeV/c, shows that $\omega$ has a similar suppression pattern as that of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$, strengthening the observation that mesons with different  masses have similar behavior but different from the one of baryons. However, $\phi$ in $Cu+Cu$ and $Au+Au$ collisions, measured from 1 - 7 GeV/c, shows a suppression, that is smaller than that of the $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2 - 5 GeV/c), whereas at higher $p_T$, within the large experimental uncertainties, the amount of suppression appears similar to that of the light mesons. Results of $\phi$ production at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV show a similar behavior but with larger uncertainties. This talk will review the most recent results obtained for light vector mesons in different collision systems and energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deepali', 'last_name': 'Sharma', 'fullName': 'Sharma, Deepali', 'id': '1896778', 'affiliation': 'Weizmann Institute of Science', 'emailHash': '5baaf024310a9fa56dd030104aa64ff8', 'db_id': 1896778, 'person_id': 2047062}"

have found a unified description, thus providing very different 
probes for a possible delineation of the phase boundary between 
deconfined and hadronic matter produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions
from low (AGS) energies up to RHIC energy.
A purely thermal production (at chemical freeze-out) appears natural
for u,d,s-carrying hadrons and a good degree of consensus has been 
achieved with the RHIC data, at least for central collisions.
We are rather confident in predicting the chemistry of ligh-quark 
hadrons at the LHC.
In contrast, charmed hadrons and charmonia can be produced 
at chemical freeze-out only as a result of a ""distribution"" into 
hadrons of charm quarks produced in primary hard collisions. 
Our model describes rather well the RHIC and SPS data on charmonia,
which will be reviewed briefly.
We expect that generation at the phase boundary is at the LHC the 
exclusive mechanism (thus lifting the present controversy whether 
charmonia melt or not in the deconfined stage at RHIC and SPS 
energies).
With some of the model ingredients (like the volume at chemical 
freeze-out) already constrained by the first LHC data, the main
uncertainty in our predictions remains the charm cross section
in Pb-Pb, where shadowing is not yet known.
In addition to the overall hadron abundancies, including those of

Because of particle interactions, this initial spatial asymmetry leads to anisotropies in particle emission -- the phenomenon called anisotropic flow. The best known anisotropy of this kind is the elliptic flow that is described by the second harmonic in particle azimuthal distribution. Recently, the so-called triangular, and higher harmonic flow, and in particular their sensitivity to the system initial conditions attracted a lot of attention, as they might provide additional important information about the initial conditions and dynamical properties (e.g. viscosity) of the system.

Fluctuations in the initial geometry should be also reflected in the detail shape of the system at freeze-out. In this talk I discuss the possibility to measure such fluctuations by means of identical and non-identical particle femtoscopy. I support my conclusion on the sensitivity of the method to measure triangularity and higher harmonic spatial asymmetries by analytical calculations, and by results from event generators and blast wave model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sergei', 'last_name': 'Voloshin', 'fullName': 'Voloshin, Sergei', 'id': '1896829', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy-College of Science-Wayne Sta', 'emailHash': '36b4bf82b087c3f6d68e448577cca1bd', 'db_id': 1896829, 'person_id': 2047106}"

Heavy quark measurements in p+p collisions give information on the production of heavy flavor, without complications from medium effects.  New measurements in d+Au indicate significant and surprising cold nuclear matter effects on these quarks at midrapidity, and provide a new baseline for interpretation of the observed suppression in Au+Au collisions.  To complement the measured heavy quark spectra, correlations between heavy quark decay products give information on jet modification in nuclear collisions, while correlations between heavy quarks and hadrons produced in the same event can shed light on interactions with the medium.  When considered all together, these measurements present a detailed study of nuclear matter across a wide range of system size and temperature.

Global and collective dynamics,parallel,Collision energy dependence of the flow and spectra results in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV from PHENIX,"Gong, Xiaoyang",Stony Brook University,USA,"A central goal in experimental nuclear physics is to map out the QCD phase diagram, and to measure precisely the properties of the different phases. In order to achieve this goal, RHIC has embarked on an energy scan program involving gold nuclei at various energies. The data collected by the PHENIX experiment for this program consists of data sets obtained at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200, 62, 39 and 7.7 GeV.

The analysis of these data, have yielded a wealth of new soft physics results which are used in concert to probe reaction dynamics and to constrain the transport coefficients of hot QCD matter. One particularly effective probe that is emphasized in this talk is the anisotropy of particle production, characterized by flow coefficients $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$. For Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, measurements indicate a hydrodynamic flow of hot QCD matter at the partonic level with a small but finite value of the viscosity to entropy density ratio. However, at sufficiently low collision energy (thus lower energy density and temperature), we expect this picture to break down. Therefore measurement of the collision energy dependence of $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ could provide new insights to the current understanding of the nature of interactions in hot QCD matter.

We present new energy scan measurements of flow coefficients for both unidentified and identified particles, as well as several other soft physics observables such as identified hadron spectra and HBT correlations.

Jets,parallel,Energy dependence of energy loss in Au+Au collisions at PHENIX,"Novitzky, Norbert",Department of Physics-University of Jyvaskyla,United States,"The suppression of inclusive pion production by up to a factor of 5, which was first observed in Au + Au at √sNN= 130 GeV/c (e.g. [1]) and later in Au + Au at √sNN= 200 GeV/c [2, 3], is one of the most significant manifestations of the opaque QGP produced in heavy ion collisions. The absence of this suppression in d + Au collisions at the same energy indicates the final state nature of the suppression. It is natural to ask where the onset of such massive suppression is in terms of the energy density of the medium which is dictated by the collision energy, centrality and the mass of colliding nuclei. The PHENIX collaboration has studied collisions of lighter nuclei (Cu + Cu) at different beam energies in 2005 [4]. While a significant suppression is observed both at √sNN = 200 and 62.4 GeV, at √sNN = 22.4 GeV a moderate enhancement is found. In 2010 RHIC scanned lower energies, and PHENIX collected substantial data sets in Au + Au collisions at √sNN = 39 and 62 GeV. The goal was to identify better the conditions for the onset of the π0 suppression. This talk presents results from the systematic study of c.m. energy and the system size dependencies of π0 yield and the nuclear modification factor.

Hadron thermodynamics and chemistry,parallel,Validity of the hadronic freeze-out curve,"Stock, Reinhard",Institut fuer Kernphysik - Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.,Unknown,"In nucleus-nucleus collisions we distinguish early hadro-chemical freeze-out, fixing hadronic concentrations, and final kinetic freeze-out to spectral and flow features, occuring at the end of the hadronic ""cascade"" phase. This view has been adopted in all recent analysis of hadron production rates, which are well described in the grand canonical statistical equilibrium model. The derived freeze-out systematics in the (T,mu(B)) plane occurs in all present sketches of the QCD matter phase diagram. It merges with the lattice QCD parton-hadron coexistence line at small mu(B).

The preservation of the equilibrium pattern of hadronic yields (established in the close vicinity of hadronization) throughout the final hadronic expansion phase still remains to be explained, and substantiated.
In order to systematically assess the effect of the hadronic cascade stage we employ the hybrid version of the UrQMD transport model. In it, a high density hydrodynamic evolution stage is matched, via the Cooper-Frye formalism, to the final hadron/resonance expansion evolution. Matching occurs at a fixed critical energy density. These calculations are carried out at the energies covered by the
SPS Pb+Pb program, 6.3 < squrr(s) < 17.3 GeV. At each energy we determine, both, the hadron yield distribution arising directly after hadronization, and the eventual distribution resulting from the UrQMD hadron/resonance expansion ""afterburner"" stage. The latter turns out to preserve the bulk production channels but to systematically reduce the antibaryon yields, with exception of the Omega/Antiomega. We revisit the data in view of these predictions.

Finally we analyze all these yield distributions with the grand canonical statistical model, determining the freeze-out curve before/after the cascade afterburner. A significant shift of this curve occurs (to lower T, higher mu(B)) which, however, is essentially absent if the antibaryon yields are excluded, but with exception of the Omega/antiOmega yields. The cascade stage thus appears to distort the initially imprinted equilibrium distributions, but only selectively so: an effect that must be avoided in the data analysis. Thus one recovers the T, mu(B) established before the cascade stage.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Reinhard', 'last_name': 'Stock', 'fullName': 'Stock, Reinhard', 'id': '1896875', 'affiliation': 'Institut fuer Kernphysik - Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.', 'emailHash': 'a5071d68b96304833d25bc207fc399e9', 'db_id': 1896875, 'person_id': 2047145}"

The longitudinal structure of hot spots also leads to a near-side ridge in dihadron correlation with a large rapidity gap. By successively randomizing the azimuthal angle of the transverse momenta and positions of initial partons, one can isolate the effects of jet-induced medium excitation and expanding hot spots on the dihadron azimuthal correlation. The double peaks in the net dihadron and $\gamma$-hadron correlation are quantitatively different since the later is caused only by jet-induced Mach cone.

Previous computations of photon emission have been carried out using a hydrodynamical medium description with smooth, averaged initial conditions. Recently, more sophisticated hydrodynamical models which calculate observables by averaging over many evolutions with event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions (IC) have been developed. Given their direct connection to the early time dynamics, thermal photon emission appears an ideal observable to probe fluctuations in the medium initial state. In this work, we demonstrate that including fluctuations in the IC may lead to an enhancement of the thermal photon yield of about a factor of 2 in the region $2 < p_T < 4$ GeV/$c$ (where thermal photon production dominates the direct photon yield) compared to a scenario using smooth, averaged IC. Consequently, a better agreement with PHENIX data is found. This can be understood in terms of the strong temperature dependence of thermal photon production, translating into a sensitivity to the presence of 'hotspots' in an event and thus establishing thermal photons as a suitable probe to characterize IC fluctuations.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Lattice QCD based equation of state at finite baryon density,"Huovinen, Pasi",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"The effects of non-zero baryon density are expected to become important
in hydrodynamic modeling of heavy collisions below the highest energy at RHIC. Recent calculations in effective models and in QCD using Dyson Schwinger equation suggest that the transition in QCD remains a crossover up to baryon chemical potentials of about 800MeV [1]. If so, the equation of state relevant for hydrodynamic models can be calculated on the lattice using Taylor expansion. However, there are large cutoff effects in present lattice calculations for non-zero chemical potentials.

We employ the lattice QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients [2] to extend our previous parametrization of the equation of state [3] to finite baryon density. When we take into account lattice spacing and quark mass dependence of the hadron masses [3], the Taylor coefficients at low temperature are equal to those of hadron resonance gas. Therefore we require require that the equation of state is smoothly connected to the hadron resonance gas equation of state at low temperatures. Some preliminary results were reported in [4]. 
We also show how the hydrodynamical evolution is affected by this equation of state in the energy range relevant for SPS and the RHIC energy scan.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Direct photon production in heavy ion collisions in PHENIX experiment at RHIC,"Kistenev, Edouard",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"E.Kistenev for the PHENIX Collaboration

Direct photon production in heavy ion collisions in PHENIX  experiment at RHIC

Among the observables used to probe the high temperature and high density  phase of heavy nucleus collisions direct photons are considered of  particular interest. At LO direct photons are produced in quark-gluon Compton scattering and quark-antiquark annihilation, the NLO processes are dominating in bremsstrahlung and fragmentation photon production and jet  re-interaction in medium, QGP and hot hadronic stage emit thermal photons.  Correlated measurements of the  transverse momentum dependence of direct photon production in collisions of different species and of  underlying event observables, like isolation or  flow,  as well as the nuclear modification factor may give insight into the relative contribution from various production mechanisms. 

Extracting the direct photon signal from the large hadron decay  background is experimentally challenging particularly at lower transverse momenta and  high multiplicities.  PHENIX used a combination of techniques based upon virtual (via low to intermediate mass e+e- pairs) and real (neutral clusters in calorimeters and reconstructed e+e- pairs from photon conversions) photon measurements to determine direct photon yields in the range of transverse momenta up to about 20 GeV/c for a wide range of energies and  colliding species. 

In this talk we present recent PHENIX results on total direct photon production in pp, dA and AA collisions with emphasis on azimuthal correlations  and nuclear modification. Implications of the PHENIX  measurements for the initial temperature and density estimates as well  as for the space-time evolution of the fireball will also be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Edouard', 'last_name': 'Kistenev', 'fullName': 'Kistenev, Edouard', 'id': '1897060', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '09f02b655d8b3b38b2d93340e1ddb043', 'db_id': 1897060, 'person_id': 2047292}"

Global and collective dynamics,parallel,Turbulent fluctuations around Bjorken flow,"Floerchinger, Stefan",CERN,Switzerland,"For large Reynolds number (which is inverse to viscosity), fluids are known to develop turbulence. Therefore, the phenomenological evidence for a small viscosity suggests that the hydrodynamical description of heavy ion collisions may have a turbulent regime. Assuming that averaged velocities are described by Bjorkens model, we investigate local fluctuations around it. These perturbations are governed by non-linear equations and we characterize classes of qualitatively different evolution in terms of Reynolds numbers. Perturbations at different rapidities are found to decouple quickly, and the local evolution becomes effectively two-dimensional. The resulting Navier-Stokes equation of non-relativistic form (obtained after suitable coordinate transformations) can be discussed within the theory of Kolmogorov and Kraichnan. In particular, unlike three-dimensional turbulent flow, two-dimensional viscous fluid dynamics can show the interesting phenomenon of inverse cascading of energy into large scale structures.

Global and collective dynamics,parallel,Sensitivity of the elliptic flow coefficient to a temperature-dependent shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC,"Niemi, Harri",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"We investigate the effects of a temperature-dependent shear
viscosity-to-entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ on the elliptic 
flow of hadrons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. 
We use relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics to model the 
space-time evolution of the hot and dense system formed in 
such collisions. The final hadron spectra are calculated using 
the Cooper-Frye freeze-out procedure.

By studying different parametrizations for the temperature 
dependence of $\eta/s$, we found that the viscous suppression 
of the elliptic flow coefficient in $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV 
Au+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) 
is dominated by the viscosity in the hadronic phase and in the 
phase transition region. However, the elliptic flow at RHIC is 
largely insensitive to the viscosity of the 
quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

On the other hand, we found that sensitivity of the elliptic 
flow to the high-temperature $\eta/s$ increases with increasing 
multiplicity and simultaneously the sensitivity to the hadronic 
viscosity decreases. At the highest LHC energy, the elliptic 
flow becomes sensitive to the QGP viscosity and insensitive to 
the hadronic viscosity.

The change of the sensitivity from hadronic to QGP viscosity 
from RHIC to LHC can provide access to determining the 
temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ from elliptic flow data.

Measurement of $J/\psi$ production at high $p_T$ is particularly interesting since at high $p_T$ the various models give different predictions. Besides, high $p_T$ particles are widely used to study the parton-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions.

Jets,parallel,Medium-induced modifications of color flow in high transverse momentum processes,"Beraudo, Andrea","Centro Studi e ricerche ""Enrico Fermi"" - Rome (Italy)",USA,"Heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC show strong medium-induced modifications of high-pT single inclusive hadron spectra, jet-like particle correlations and reconstructed jets.
A dynamical understanding of these jet quenching phenomena is typically sought within a partonic picture in which the energy of highly energetic parent partons is degraded due to
multiple inelastic and/or elastic interactions inside QCD matter.
In the current model implementations of this parton energy loss the hadronization process is unaffected by it on account that for sufficiently energetic projectiles time dilation should guarantee their hadronization outside the medium.
However, as it has been pointed out before, the interaction of a colored parton with a QCD medium modifies the color flow of the parton shower and arguably can imprint on the hadronization process at much higher transverse momentum than estimated previously. 
In this context, we present here the first QCD-based calculation of medium-induced color flow. 
Decomposing the multiple scattering diagrams of the BDMPS-Z formalism for parton energy loss into color-singlet 'prehadronic' systems, we observe that (in comparison to vacuum fragmentation) medium-induced
effects do not only degrade the longitudinal momentum of these color-singlet systems but also strongly enhance their invariant mass. The larger the invariant mass of a color-singlet at the end of
the perturbative evolution, the more likely it is for such system to decay into a larger number of hadronic fragments and thus leave a smaller fraction of the total available energy to the leading hadron.
Therefore, for multi-partonic states that show the same kinematic distributions at the end of the perturbative evolution, medium-modified color flow can be a significant additional source of
medium-induced multiplicity increase and medium-induced degradation of the leading hadron.
We illustrate this general observation in simple models. We also identify a color flow specific formation time argument that indicates that effects of color-flow induced additional suppression
can persist over transverse energies up to tens of GeV, and may contribute to an enhanced slope of the nuclear modification factor.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '1897104', 'affiliation': 'Centro Studi e ricerche ""Enrico Fermi"" - Rome (Italy)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 1897104, 'person_id': 2047320}"

Combining the spectral function with the full 3D hydrodynamic evolution, theoretical dielectron spectra and the experimental data are compared.

Global and collective dynamics,parallel,Identified particles from viscous hydrodynamics,"Molnar, Denes",Purdue University,USA,"Much of our understanding of the collision dynamics at RHIC and LHC relies
on contrasting hydrodynamic or hydro+transport calculations with
experimental data. For example, early evidence for rapid thermalization
and quark-gluon plasma phase transition at RHIC came from particle spectra      
and the pion-proton splitting of differential elliptic flow. An inevitable
component in these calculations is the conversion of the fluid to
particles. For an ideal fluid the conversion is straightforward (the usual
caveats of the Cooper-Frye treatment aside) because the phase space
distributions are locally thermal for each species. For a viscous fluid,
however, an infinite class of phase space corrections can reproduce the 
same hydrodynamic variables, even in a one-component system.

Present viscous hydrodynamic calculations routinely assume that phase
space corrections induced by shear stress are quadratic in momentum and   
that they have the same coefficient for all particle species (""democratic""
Grad ansatz), independently of microscopic details. However, in a gas of  
hadrons, equilibration is driven by scattering rates - species that
scatter rarely tend to be further away from local equilibrium than those
that scatter often.

We will present results from fully nonlinear covariant transport theory
for the phase space corrections in an expanding multicomponent gas, and
test the validity of Grad's quadratic ansatz and of the ""democratic""   
assumption for sharing viscous effects between species. The findings will
be compared to phase space corrections from linear response theory, which
is applicable for small gradients and small deviations from local
equilibrium. Finally, we will show how dynamical phase space corrections

New theoretical developments,parallel,Equilibration and Thermalization of Strongly Coupled Field Theories,"Mueller, Berndt",Duke University,USA,"Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we probe the scale-dependence of thermalization in strongly coupled field theories following a quench, via calculations of 2-point functions, Wilson loops and entanglement entropy in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions.   In the saddlepoint approximation these probes are computed in AdS space in terms of invariant geometric objects -- geodesics, minimal surfaces and minimal volumes.    Our calculations for two dimensional field theories are analytical.   In our strongly coupled setting, all probes in all dimensions share certain universal features in their thermalization: (1) a slight delay in the onset of thermalization, (2) an apparent non-analyticity at the endpoint of thermalization, (3) top-down thermalization where the UV thermalizes first.   For homogeneous initial conditions the entanglement entropy thermalizes slowest, and sets a time scale for equilibration that saturates a causality bound over the range of scales studied.  The growth rate of entanglement entropy density is nearly volume-independent for small volumes, but slows for larger volumes.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Berndt', 'last_name': 'Mueller', 'fullName': 'Mueller, Berndt', 'id': '1897212', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': 'e51bc35ff8b893a5b108a7694d341c8f', 'db_id': 1897212, 'person_id': 2047244}"

of the QCD phase diagram in the region of a possible phase
transition between the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and the hadron gas
phase. In the year 2010 the first part of the BES program was
successfully accomplished by recording data from Au+Au collisions 
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV. The second harmonic 
($v_2$) of the azimuthal particle distribution relative to the reaction plane
was found to be one of the most important observables to
study the underlying dynamics in the early stage of the collisions.
The number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_{2}$ is
interpreted as a signature of deconfinement and existence of the  QGP phase. 
At the lower energies studied it was expected to see a change in this 
scaling behaviour as the role of the QGP phase should diminish.

We present $v_{2}$ measurements at all three beam energies for
identified hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, K$_{s}^{0}$, p, $\phi$, $\Lambda$,
$\Xi$) and light nuclei (d and $^{3}He$) as a function of $p_{T}$ for 
various collision centralities. The measured nuclei $v_{2}$ are 
compared to the proton $v_{2}$ and results from a dynamical coalescence

Jets,parallel,"Next-to-leading order analysis of inclusive jet, tagged jet and di-jet production in PbPb collisions at the LHC","Vitev, Ivan",Los Alamos National Laboratory,USA,"Jets physics is an important new area of active research at RHIC and at the LHC that paves the way for novel tests of QCD multi-parton dynamics in heavy-ion reactions. At present, perturbative QCD calculations of hard probes in “elementary” nucleon-nucleon reactions can be consistently combined with the effects of the nuclear medium up to next-to-leading order. While such accuracy is desirable for leading particle tomography, it is absolutely essential for the new jet observables. With this motivation, we present results and predictions at NLO for the recent LHC lead-lead (Pb+Pb) run at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon-nucleon pair. Specifically, we focus on the suppression the single and double inclusive jet cross sections and demonstrate how the di-jet asymmetry, recently measured by ATLAS and CMS, can be related to these general results. The case of jets tagged by an electroweak boson is exemplified by the Z0+jet channel. We predict a signature transition from enhancement to suppression of the tagged jet reflective of the medium-induced modification of parton showers. We also present NLO results relevant to the inclusive Z0 data obtained by the CMS collaboration. Our analysis includes not only final-state inelastic parton interactions in the QGP, but also initial-state cold nuclear matter effects and non-perturbative hadronization corrections. Finally, we clarify the relation between the suppression of inclusive jets, tagged jets and di-jets and the quenching of inclusive particles on the example of the recent ALICE neutral pion attenuation data.  We conclude by discussing future directions and effective theories of QCD that can help improve the accuracy of the theoretical tools for jet tomography.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ivan', 'last_name': 'Vitev', 'fullName': 'Vitev, Ivan', 'id': '1897229', 'affiliation': 'Los Alamos National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '24892447840676e23b8b8cf1de0f16f0', 'db_id': 1897229, 'person_id': 2047331}"
Jets,parallel,Leading hadron PID effects in di-hadron angular correlations in STAR,"Kauder, Kolja",University of Illinois at Chicago,USA,"Hard scatterings of partons provide a valuable colored probe of the
strongly-coupled medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion
collisions. These hard scatterings can be studied  by means of angular
correlations of charged hadrons with  respect to a high transverse

studies indicate that A+A collision dynamics evolve significantly
with collision centrality. They specifically reveal the presence of
unexpected strong away-side deformation and the development of a
long-range ""ridge"" in  correlation  measured as a function of
$\Delta\eta$ vs $\Delta\phi$. The detailed physics mechanisms
responsible for these features however remain under active

We will present preliminary results of a new di-hadron correlation

The relativistic rise of the ionization energy loss dependence of
particles measured in the STAR TPC is used to obtain a statistical

$\Delta \eta$ correlations measured in this work extend earlier
measurements of azimuthal correlations (in $\Delta \phi$ only)  with
identified hadron triggers, which, admittedly with  large

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Charge fluctuations in chiral models and the QCD phase transition,"Skokov, Vladimir","GSI, Darmstadt, Germany",Germany,"Fluctuations of conserved charges are key probes of the chiral
phase transition in a QCD medium. Of particular phenomenological importance are studies of such fluctuations at finite baryon density. A valuable tool for assessing critical fluctuations and the thermodynamics at non-vanishing baryon density is provided by effective chiral models.

We consider the Polyakov loop-extended two flavors chiral quark--meson model (PQM) and discuss  critical phenomena related with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The model is explored beyond the mean-field approximation in the functional renormalisation group (FRG) approach.

We formulate and solve the renormalization group flow equation for the scale-dependent thermodynamic potential in the presence of the gluonic background field at finite temperature and density [1] and determine the phase diagram of the PQM model in the FRG approach [2]. We also consider properties of the net-quark number density fluctuations as well as their higher cumulants [3] and discuss the influence of nonperturbative effects on their properties near the chiral crossover transition. With increasing net-quark number density, the higher order cumulants show a strong dependence on the chiral crossover transition. This is illustrated by exploring the ratios of moments of net-baryon number and electric charge  fluctuations. We discuss their role as probes of deconfinement and the chiral phase transition in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.

They can provide information about the matter properties in the early stages of the collisions where deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration are expected to take place. However, the measurements of dileptons in heavy ion collisions are challenging due to the overwhelming yield of pi0 Dalitz decays and photon conversions, which produce a large combinatorial background especially in the low invariant mass region (m_ee<1 GeV/c^2).

The PHENIX spectrometer has been upgraded with a Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) with the purpose of reducing the combinatorial background from the dielectron mass spectrum. The HBD is a windowless Cherenkov detector, operating with pure CF_4, using triple GEM elements with a CsI photocathode and pad readout. The HBD reduces the combinatorial background by exploiting the small opening angle of the pi0 Dalitz and conversion pairs.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,"Moments of charge fluctuations, pseudo-critical temperatures and freeze-out in heavy ion collisions","Karsch, Frithjof",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"In the chiral limit and at temperatures close to the QCD phase transition temperature physical observables are expected to show universal properties that are  controlled by the symmetry class of a 3-dimensional O(4) spin model [1]. Higher moments of net baryon number as well as electric charge fluctuations are sensitive to these universal features of the chiral phase transition [2]. 

The sixth order moments are the first moments which will diverge in the chiral limit at the QCD phase transition temperature. At non-zero values of the light quark masses the sixth order moment of baryon number fluctuations has a  pronounced minimum at a pseudo-critical temperature which is close to the temperature where fluctuations of the chiral order parameter are the largest.

We present a calculation of the O(4) scaling functions that control scaling properties of the net baryon number fluctuations [3]. Using these universal scaling functions as well as PNJL model calculations [4] we show that  the sixth order moment of baryon number fluctuations is negative in the vicinity of the pseudo-critical temperature for the chiral transition and present new results from lattice calculations using the highly improved staggered fermion action (hisq). These QCD results are in striking contrast to hadron resonance gas model calculations. We conjecture that higher order moments of net baryon number and electric charge fluctuations are well suited to characterize freeze-out conditions in heavy ion collisions. Their experimental analysis in low-energy runs at RHIC as well as at LHC will allow to verify to what extent freeze-out occurs from a thermal medium close to criticality.

This new formalism is applied to the computation of the $R_{AA}$ in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The medium is modeled using viscous 2+1D fluid dynamics which has been tuned to describe both the spectra and the $v_{2}$ at a $p_T$ < 2 GeV. The sole parameter of the calculation $\hat{q}$ is set proportional to the entropy density and is found to be approximately $2$ GeV$^{2}/fm$ at a plasma temperature of $T=350$ MeV.

Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,parallel,STAR measurements of bottom to charm ratio and heavy quark interaction with the QCD medium through non-photonic electron-hadron correlations,"xu, wenqin",University of California Los Angeles,USA,"FOR THE STAR COLLABORATION
Heavy Quarks are mostly produced through gluon fusions during the initial stage of the heavy ion collisions. Experimentally heavy quarks are found to suffer a considerable energy loss in the QCD medium with the nuclear modification factor for non-photonic electrons (NPE) from heavy quark decays much smaller than unity in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. To better understand the heavy flavor production and energy loss mechanism it is crucial to determine experimentally the relative contributions of Charm and Bottom meson decays to NPE and to study detailed characteristics of heavy quark interactions with the bulk QCD medium.
We will present the STAR measurements of relative charm and bottom contributions to NPE from p+p collisions at 200 and 500 GeV energies. We report the total bottom quark production cross section from p+p collisions at 200 GeV extracted from NPE spectrum and B to D ratios. We will also present the NPE-hadron correlations from Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV from the 2010 RHIC run where we have collected high statistics data set with low photonic conversion background. The evolution of the NPE-hadron azimuthal angular correlation as a function of collision centralities and in comparison with that from d+Au collisions will be indicative of dynamics of heavy quark interactions with the QCD medium created in Au+Au collisions.

Global and collective dynamics,parallel,Viscous hydrodynamic evolution with non-boost invariant flow for the color glass condensate,"Monnai, Akihiko",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"The heavy ion program at LHC opened up a new era in the physics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at higher energies. One of the most unique properties of the hot matter is the near-perfect fluidity, which was first discovered in Au-Au collisions at RHIC [1]. Relativistic hydrodynamic analyses on the momentum anisotropy of transverse collective flow revealed that small viscosity in the QGP is essential when the initial conditions are constructed from the color glass condensate (CGC), the description of saturated gluons in the nuclei before collisions. On the other hand, the dynamics of the longitudinal flow has scarcely been discussed so far due to the numerical difficulties of the non-boost invariant viscous hydrodynamic analyses in relativistic coordinates. Since the CGC itself is considered to be successful in reproducing the observed rapidity distributions and multiplicities at RHIC, it would be indispensable to investigate the longitudinal hydrodynamic evolution for the CGC. 

We develop a viscous hydrodynamic model with both shear and bulk viscosity and solve the full second-order constitutive equations [2] in the longitudinal direction with the relativistic coordinates using a novel numerical approach. The estimations are performed with the CGC-type initial distributions for both RHIC and LHC settings. The results exhibit visible and non-trivial deformations of the CGC rapidity distributions during the hydrodynamic stage due to the interplay between two factors: (i) Entropy production from non-equilibrium processes and (ii) entropy flux to the forward rapidity caused by non-boost invariance [3]. We find difference in the hydrodynamic effects at RHIC and LHC, which implies that readjustment of the CGC parameters might be necessary. This would be one of the possible explanations for the fact that the CGC predictions tend to underestimate the multiplicity at mid-rapidity observed in the Pb-Pb collisions at LHC experiments [4]. The results indicate that non-boost invariant hydrodynamic evolution together with viscosity is indispensable for understanding the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions as a whole. We also obtain several important numerical insights towards a full (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model for the more quantitative analyses.

Are the interactions of energetic partons with QCD matter characterized by weak or strong coupling, and what is the detailed mechanism for partonic energy loss?  Where is the QCD critical point and the associated first-order phase transition line?  Can we strengthen current evidence for novel symmetries in QCD matter and open new avenues?

Heavy flavor and quarkonia production,parallel,Heavy-flavor dynamics in nucleus-nucleus collisions: from RHIC to LHC,"Monteno, Marco",INFN Torino,Unknown,"The understanding of the heavy-quark dynamics in nucleus-nucleus collisions, so far possible at RHIC only through the inclusive measurement of electron spectra from c and b decays, is becoming now accessible at LHC also through the exclusive reconstruction of open-charm hadrons, thus providing a richer physical information useful to discriminate among different theoretical models.
A complete setup to study heavy-flavor observables in pp and AA collisions was recently developed by us: in the latter case the presence of a hot fireball leads to a modification of the final p_T-spectra. More specifically, the propagation of c and b quarks in the plasma (whose evolution is supposed to be described by relativistic hydrodynamics) is followed by solving the relativistic Langevin equation within a picture of multiple uncorrelated random collisions. The relevant heavy-quark transport coefficients are given a microscopic evaluation within the Hard Thermal Loop approximation, supplemented by a kinetic pQCD calculation for hard collisions.
The results obtained with this approach turned out to be in reasonable 
agreement with the experimental data obtained at RHIC, in particular 
for the R_AA of non-photonic electrons.
Here we extend the above study to the LHC case, at the current center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV.

New theoretical developments,parallel,Jets in QCD media: from color coherence to decoherence,"Mehtar-Tani, Yacine",University of Santiago de Compostela,Unknown,"Jet physics in hadronic collisions is one of the major achievements of perturbative QCD. However, a complete theory of jets in a hot and dense partonic environment remains to be developed. Such a theory is needed in Heavy-Ion Collisions (HIC), at RHIC and now at the LHC, in order to have a clean access to the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). 

To this end, we have investigated medium modification of the radiation pattern of a quark-antiquark antenna traversing a dense medium in order to understand how the QGP alters color coherence which is an important feature of the intRAjet structure in vacuum. In contrast to gluon radiation in vacuum, and unexpectedly, we find a strict geometrical separation between in-vacuum and medium-induced gluon radiation. Also, a soft logarithmic divergence appears pointing to the possibility of resuming multiple gluon branching in the cascade. Moreover, in the case of an opaque medium near the unitarity bound, a simple and intuitive physical picture arises : the interaction with the QGP leads to the gradual decoherence of the pair yielding a universal radiation pattern which does not depend on the initial color configuration of the antenna. 
These results are in qualitative agreement with the recent  ATLAS and CMS data and provide a starting point for further studies on in-medium  jet modification.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yacine', 'last_name': 'Mehtar-Tani', 'fullName': 'Mehtar-Tani, Yacine', 'id': '1897368', 'affiliation': 'University of Santiago de Compostela', 'emailHash': '6f1628f66f92a881d7727f3c4b549e0f', 'db_id': 1897368, 'person_id': 2047497}"
Global and collective dynamics,parallel,The QGP shear viscosity: elusive goal or just around the  corner?,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"The last two years have seen tremendous progress in the theoretical tools for extracting the specific shear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma in the temperature range explored by heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The effects of viscosity on the transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow and their interplay with other hydrodynamic parameters have been studied systematically [1]. A global viscous hydrodynamic fit to charged and identified hadron spectra and elliptic flow at all collision centralities in RHIC Au+Au collisions has been shown to successfully extrapolate to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [2], providing a rather good first description of the elliptic flow measured by the ALICE collaboration. Viscous relativistic hydrodynamics has been coupled to a microscopic description of the late hadronic rescattering and freeze-out stage [3,4], thus eliminating previous large uncertainties arising from strong dissipative effects in the hadronic phase [5] and allowing for a first tightly constrained extraction of the QGP shear viscosity from RHIC data [3,6]. The largest remaining uncertainty arises from poor theoretical control over the initial spatial eccentricity of the collision fireball, and a lack of prospects to more tightly constrain this initial deformation theoretically appears to make progress towards further increased empirical precision for the QGP shear viscosity elusive. Recent studies of higher harmonic eccentricity and flow coefficients [7] and their fluctuations from collision to collision using event-by-event hydrodynamics provide, however, a novel angle that may allow to settle this question experimentally. This will be the main focus of my talk.

The massive quark-antiquark antenna involves both the dead cone effect and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect, and takes into account the correlation between both of the emitters leading to an additional strong suppression of gluon radiation at angles smaller than the opening angle of the quark-antiquark pair.

In-medium modifications of the vector meson spectral functions were actually predicted to occur also in cold nuclear matter, though the experimental evidence at the moment is controversial. Proton-nucleus collisions also give access to the study of strangeness production as a function of the size of the nucleus, providing a robust ground for strangeness enhancement in nuclear collisions. Besides that, the study of the nuclear dependence of particle properties in proton-nucleus collisions, as the transverse momentum spectra and the production cross sections, is an effective tool to understand the dynamics of soft hadron interactions.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,New results on event-by-event ratio fluctuations in PbPb collisions at CERN SPS energies,"Schuster, Tim","Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Goethe-University Frankfurt",United States,"Event-by-event fluctuations of hadron ratios characterize the hadro-chemical composition of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This makes the fluctuation signal sensitive to changes in the underlying structure of matter, and phase transition effects in particular. In the SPS energy range, inclusive hadronic observables indicate the onset of the deconfinement phase transition [1], making ratio fluctuations a promising observable to further characterize the transition and possibly reveal signatures of the conjectured critical point as suggested by lattice calculations of quark number susceptibilities at finite mu_B [2]. Kaons and protons carry large parts of the conserved quantities strangeness and baryon number. Their correlation, reflected in the kaon-to-proton ratio fluctuations, is expected to undergo a significant change at the anticipated parton-hadron phase boundary [3].
Results on (K+ + K−)/(p + pbar) and K+/p fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions will be presented for the first time. At 5 energies between sqrt(s_NN) = 6.3 and 17.3 GeV, sigma_dyn has been evaluated in central Pb+Pb collisions. For both ratios, a fast transition from positive sigma_dyn at low SPS energies to negative values at the higher energies is observed, an energy dependence that is not reproduced by hadronic models. While hadronic transport models predict almost constant fluctuations in the SPS energy range, a multiplicity scaling as suggested in [4] is also incompatible with the data. This study is complemented by new results on the centrality dependence of ratio fluctuations at sqrt(s_NN) = 17.3 GeV, which confirm the systematics recently reported at RHIC energies [5].

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Energy dependence of the freeze out eccentricity from azimuthal dependence of HBT at STAR,"Anson, Christopher",The Ohio State University,USA,"Non-central heavy ion collisions at RHIC create an anisotropic participant zone of QCD matter under extreme conditions of energy and matter density.  While this zone is initially out-of-plane-extended, pressure gradients cause the hot, dense medium to expand preferentially in plane.  Over time, this expansion makes the shape more spherical, perhaps even becoming extended in the in-plane direction.  The change in shape is determined by the expansion and freeze-out time scales which depend, in part, on the early pressure gradients.  As a result, the freeze-out shape may provide a sensitive probe of the Equation of State of hot QCD matter.

     The recent RHIC Beam Energy Scan at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 7.7, 11.5, and 39 GeV provides an opportunity to explore the energy dependence of the freeze out eccentricity.  The new low energy data from STAR complements high statistics data sets at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 62.4 and 200 GeV.  The dependence of the HBT radius parameters on azimuthal angle relative to the reaction plane have been extracted.  These dependences can be related to the freeze out eccentricity within the context of a blast wave model.

Our results demonstrate that electron pair emission in small collision systems, such as C+C, can  essentially  be explained as a superposition of independent N+N collisions with a dominant contribution from the p-n channel. 

The comparison of the N+N reference spectrum with the di-electron invariant-mass distribution measured in Ar+KC collisions shows a pronounced excess radiation. The properties of the excess as a function of the transverse mass are quantified. 

Further medium effects have been investigated in p+Nb interactions at 3.5 GeV by a direct comparison to p+p reactions measured at the same energy. Differential dielectron production cross sections have been extracted and can be compared in detail in the pi^{0},  eta and the vector meson regions. The results will be discussed and compared to the ones obtained in photo-induced reactions.
   
Intriguing results were also obtained from the reconstruction of hadrons with open and hidden strangeness in Ar+KCl collisions. While the measured abundance of all reconstructed particles are well described assuming thermalization, the also reconstructed double-strange baryon Xi^{-} appears about ten times more abundant than expected. Also, the phi/omega ratio is much larger than the one measured in N-N collisions and does not require any OZI suppression.

measured with respect to p--p ($I_{AA}$) and with respect to peripheral

opposing the trigger, while an enhancement is measured on the near

In addition, the shape of the pair azimuthal distribution is examined

plasma on 64^3 × N_t(=96(T/Tc=0.78),54(1.38),46(1.62),40(1.87),32(2.33)) 
quenched anisotropic lattices with anisotropy a_s /a_t= 4, analyzing correlation 
functions of charmonia by the maximum entropy method (MEM) which is a 
very useful and powerful tool to analyze spectral functions from lattice QCD simulations [3]. 
We show detailed features of charmonium spectral functions of  pseudoscalar and 
vector channels and modification of the dispersion relation 
at finite momenta and discuss medium effect on them in QGP.

Pre-equilibrium and initial state physics,parallel,Particle multiplicities in high-energy hadronic collisions at RHIC/LHC from CGC with local rcBK evolution,"Fujii, Hirotsugu",University of Tokyo,Unknown,"A color glass condensate (CGC) model for particle productions at collider energies is confronted with the data at RHIC and LHC. When applying the CGC picture to high-energy scatterings at LHC (or higher) energies, we need to include the effects of the running coupling and the transverse expansion of the colliding hadrons. These two are appropriately incorporated here. Main features of our model include
1) fluctuations of the transverse positions of the nucleons in the projectile,
2) the Gaussian shape for the transverse profile of a nucleon to account for the transverse expansion of the nucleon with increasing energy, and
3) the x-evolution of the unintegrated gluon distribution by the running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov (rcBK) equation which is applied locally in the impact parameter space. We study the influence of initial condition for rcBK equation on particle production in high energy hadronic collisions. Specifically, the initial conditions provided by i) the naive McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model and ii) the running coupling MV model with adjustable
parameters are examined. The use of running-coupling MV model as the initial condition is necessary for the consistency with the evolution equation which includes the effects of the running coupling.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hirotsugu', 'last_name': 'Fujii', 'fullName': 'Fujii, Hirotsugu', 'id': '1897633', 'affiliation': 'University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': 'b55f014f5cd4ed38607a05b8c79bc9fb', 'db_id': 1897633, 'person_id': 2047657}"
Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Influence of tubular initial conditions on two-particle correlations,"Grassi, Frederique",Instituto de Fisica-Universidade de Sao Paulo,Unknown,"Relativistic nuclear collisions data on two-particle correlations exhibit structures as function of relative azimuthal angle and rapidity. A unified description of these near-side and awayside structures is proposed for low to moderate transverse momentum. It is based on the combined effect of tubular initial conditions and hydrodynamical expansion.

A 3+1 hydrodynamic approach with fluctuating tubular initial conditions, in addition to reproducing both the near and away-side structures [1], leads to a good qualitative agreement with various data: dependence on trigger/associated particle tranverse momentum and on centrality [2], difference in the away-side structure for in-plane/out-of plane triggers [3]. Some results on the relation between triangularity and triangular flow have also been obtained for this approach [4].

Since 3+1 hydrodynamics is a complicated scenario, we have also studied the effect of single tubes in 2+1 hydrodynamics. Contrary to expectations, the hydrodynamic solution shows that the high energy density tubes (leftover from the initial particle interactions) give rise to particle emission in two directions and this is what leads to the various structures [2], including the effect of in-plane/out-of plane triggers [3]. This description is sensitive to some
of the initial tube parameters and may provide a probe of the strong interaction.

Jets,parallel,Pion quenching and tomography from RHIC to LHC in the WHDG model,"Horowitz, William",University of Cape Town,Unknown,"We present parameter-free predictions from the WHDG (radiative+elastic+geometric fluctuation) energy loss model for high pT pion suppression in A+A at 2.76 and 5.5 ATeV. The input density is constrained from a rigorous statistical analysis of RHIC pi0 quenching data. The predictions are consistent with the recent _charged_ hadron RAA data from ALICE only within the current very large systematic uncertainty (due to the unmeasured reference p + p spectrum). However, our constrained prediction of central to peripheral pion R_cp(pT), in which reference p + p spectra uncertainties cancel, is found to be over-quenched by ~two sigma relative to the charged hadron ALICE R_cp data at all pT<20 GeV. The basic tomographic assumptions in WHDG are (1) the energy loss scales linearly with the initial QGP density, rho0, and (2) that rho0 scales linearly with charge particle multiplicity dNch/dy. Under these assumptions, WHDG predicts significant difference in magnitude and pt slope pf pion RAA between RHIC and LHC. Future ALICE identified pi,K,p hadron RAA data (as well as accurate p + p and p + Pb reference data) will enable more quantitative jet tomographic tests of hard probe dynamics in strongly interacting quark gluon plasmas.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'William', 'last_name': 'Horowitz', 'fullName': 'Horowitz, William', 'id': '1897657', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': '55f364f277a24e4fba7936eefe9fac04', 'db_id': 1897657, 'person_id': 2047671}"
