Poster Session,poster,"Characterizing the away-side jet, devoid of flow background, via two-particle and three-particle correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200~GeV in STAR","Jiang, Kun",University of Science and Technology of China & Purdue University,USA,"Jets are modified in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to jet-medium interactions. Measurements of jet medium modifications have so far been obscure because of the large underlying anisotropic flow background. In this analysis we devise a novel method to subtract the flow background using data themselves. We select events with a large recoil momentum ($P_x$) within a pseudorapidity ($\eta$) window of $0.5<\eta<1$ ($-1<\eta<-0.5$) from a high-$p_T$ trigger particle to enhance the away-side jet population. Di-hadron azimuthal correlations are analyzed with associated particles in two $\eta$ ranges ($-0.5<\eta<0$ and $0<\eta<0.5$) symmetric about midrapidity, one (close-region) close to and the other (far-region) far away from the $P_x$ selection $\eta$ window. The away-side jet contributes to the ""close-region"" but not as much to the ""far-region"" due to the large $\eta$ gap, while the flow contributions are equal. Assuming the $\Delta\phi$ shape of jet-like correlations does not depend on $\Delta\eta$, the correlation difference measures the away-side jet shape where the anisotropic flow background is cleanly subtracted.  

The away-side jet correlation width is studied as a function of centrality and associated particle $p_T$. The width is found to increase with centrality at modest to high associated particle $p_T$. The increase can arise from jet-medium modifications, event averaging of away-side jets deflected by medium flow, and/or simply nuclear $k_T$ broadening. To further discriminate various physics mechanisms, a three-particle correlation analysis is conducted with robust flow background subtraction also using data themselves.  Based on this analysis we discuss possible physics mechanisms of away-side broadening of jet-like correlations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kun', 'last_name': 'Jiang', 'fullName': 'Jiang, Kun', 'id': '932682', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China & Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'c5cfb8bf3d5d9d9332aaf35b84383fc0', 'db_id': 932682, 'person_id': 998475}"
Poster Session,poster,Modelling Early Stages of Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions: Coupling Relativistic Transport Theory to Decaying Color-electric Flux Tubes,"Ruggieri, Marco","Physics and Astronomy Department, Catania University",Unknown,"In this study we 
model early times dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions by an initial color electric field
which then decays to a plasma by the Schwinger mechanism,
coupling the dynamical evolution of the initial color field
to the dynamics of the many particles system produced by the decay. 
The latter
is described by relativistic kinetic theory in which we fix the ratio 
$\eta/s$ rather than insisting on specific microscopic processes,
and the backreaction on the color field is taken into account by solving
self-consistently the kinetic and the field equations.
Within a single self-consistent calculation scheme
we address the problems of isotropization and thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma
produced by the field decay, as well as the quark-gluon plasma formation time
and its chemical equilibration,
both for $1+1$D and $3+1$D expanding geometry.
We find that regardless of the viscosity of the produced plasma,
longitudinal pressure becomes positive within 0.2 fm/c.
The initial color electric field decays within $1$ fm/c;
however in the case $\eta/s$ is large, plasma oscillations appear
and affect the entire time evolution of the system. 
In case of small $\eta/s$  ($\eta/s$<0.3)
we find $\tau_{isotropization}\approx 0.8$ fm/c
and $\tau_{thermalization}\approx 1$ fm/c.
Moreover quark-gluon plasma production occurs in $\tau_{qgp}< 1$ fm/c,
and almost perfect chemical equilibration takes place within 1 fm/c.
Hence our work supports the common assumptions of hydrodynamics about 
thermalization, isotropization and equilibration of quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marco', 'last_name': 'Ruggieri', 'fullName': 'Ruggieri, Marco', 'id': '932706', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '7dbee3a50d9dfce54118a7c749886eda', 'db_id': 932706, 'person_id': 998497}"

to study strongly interacting matter at high temperature and/or
high density. The simultaneous onset of confinement and chiral 
symmetry-breaking phenomena in lattice QCD (LQCD) simulations 
inspired their coupling in effective models.
The Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio or the PNJL model is one such QCD-inspired
non-perturbative model. The physics reflected from the behavior of thermodynamic
observables extracted from this model, gives an insight into QCD. 
LQCD results have been recently obtained in the continuum limit
which consequently lowers the transition temperature. This motivates us
to modify the effective potential in the PNJL model.
Analysis of important thermodynamic observables with this potential
encouragingly show a similarity on
comparison to LQCD continuum data. We use this modified potential
to sketch the phase diagram.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sudipa', 'last_name': 'Upadhaya', 'fullName': 'Upadhaya, Sudipa', 'id': '933402', 'affiliation': 'Bose Institute', 'emailHash': '20132bf9eef4dd0ef030cce34ae5eabf', 'db_id': 933402, 'person_id': 999032}"
Poster Session,poster,Mesurement of Heavy flavored jet modification and heavy flavor jet tagging in CMS,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The energy loss of jets in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the flavor of the fragmenting parton. Thus, measurements of jet quenching as a function of flavor place powerful constraints on the thermodynamical and transport properties of the hot and dense medium. Measurements of the nuclear modification factors of the heavy-flavor-tagged jets (both from charm and bottom quarks) in both PbPb and pPb collisions can quantify such energy loss effects. Specifically, pPb measurements provide crucial insights into the behavior of the cold nuclear matter effect, which is required to fully understand the hot and dense medium effects on jets in PbPb collisions. In this talk, we present the b-jet spectra and measurements of the nuclear modification factors in both PbPb and pPb as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, using the high statistics pp, pPb and PbPb data taken in 2011 and 2013. Finally, we also will present a proposal for c-jet tagging methodology to be used for the upcoming high-statistics heavy-ion run in late 2015 at the LHC.",

hadron resonance gas (EHRG) model. We find that at zero baryon chemical potential the shear
viscosity to entropy ratio (η/s) decreases with temperature and reaches very close to Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound. At sufficiently large baryon chemical potential this ratio shows same behavior as a function of temperature but goes below KSS bound.

Poster Session,poster,J/psi polarization measurement in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV with the STAR experiment,"Trzeciak, Barbara",Czech Technical University in Prague,Unknown,"Despite extensive studies, the J/$\psi$ production mechanism in hadron collisions is not yet exactly known.
For many years, mostly J/$\psi$ differential cross-section measurements have been used to test different J/$\psi$ production models. While many models can reasonably well describe the experimental data on the J/$\psi$ cross-section in $p+p$ collisions, they have different predictions for the J/$\psi$ polarization. Therefore, measurements of the J/$\psi$ polarization may provide further constraints for the models and new insight into the J/$\psi$ production mechanism.
 
In this presentation, a measurement of J/$\psi$ polarization in $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV via the dielectron decay channel at mid-rapidity with the STAR experiment will be shown. This measurement has been performed in a wide transverse momentum range of 5 $< p_{T} <$ 16 GeV/$c$. Two polarization parameters $\lambda_{\theta}$ and $\lambda_{\phi}$, related to the polar and azimuthal anisotropy respectively, have been extracted in two reference frames: helicity and Collins-Soper. The frame invariant parameter, $\tilde{\lambda}$, has also been determined as a function of $p_{T}$ in these two frames.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Barbara', 'last_name': 'Trzeciak', 'fullName': 'Trzeciak, Barbara', 'id': '932743', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'emailHash': '1789ffa4e52d0e12d6658662e7d46e6c', 'db_id': 932743, 'person_id': 998532}"

Poster Session,poster,Heavy quarkonia and Drell-Yan gauge boson production in the color dipole picture,"Sumbera, Michal",Acad. of Sciences of the Czech Rep. (CZ),CZ,"We present a extensive phenomenological study of Drell-Yan and heavy quarkonia production at LHC and RHIC energies within the color dipole formalism.  Using  Color-Singlet model (CSM) we calculate several different observables including quarkonia pT spectra and rapidity/azimuth difference between J/psi or Y and leading hadron in p-p and p-A collisions.  Moreover, the gauge boson (Z0, W±) production in association with hadron that fragments from the incoming quark is calculated, and then applied to study gauge boson-hadron correlations at LHC energies. This provides a complementary analysis tool to prompt-photon–hadron and hadron-hadron correlations within the color dipole formalism.
As a very promising measurement we suggest to study correlations between forward high-pT pion and J/psi or Y produced at mid-rapidity at RHIC energies. Such forward-midrapidity correlations test higher order pQCD in pp collisions at modest energies.  All suggested variables have a strong potential for better constraining CSM contribution to the J/psi and Y production at RHIC and LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michal', 'last_name': 'Sumbera', 'fullName': 'Sumbera, Michal', 'id': '932669', 'affiliation': 'Acad. of Sciences of the Czech Rep.

conventional Polyakov-loop. We demonstrate that its rapid increase with $T$ is driven by the evaporating of
pion condensation. On the other hand, the dressed Polyakov-loop shows abnormal thermal behavior, which even
decreases with $T$ at low temperatures due to the influence of pion condensate. We thus argue that in QCD

Poster Session,poster,Eta meson production of high-energy nuclear collisions at NLO,"Zhang, Ben-Wei",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The transverse momentum spectrum of $\eta$ meson in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied at the next-to-leading-order (NLO) within the perturbative QCD, where the jet quenching effect in the QGP is incorporated with the effective medium-modified $\eta$ fragmentation functions using the higher-twist approach. We show that the theoretical simulations could give nice descriptions of PHENIX data on $\eta$ meson in both $\rm p+p$ and central $\rm Au+Au$ at the RHIC, and also provide numerical predictions of $\eta$ spectra in central $\rm Pb+Pb$ collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$~TeV at the LHC.  The ratios of $\eta/\pi^0$ in $\rm p+p$ and in central $\rm Au+Au$ collisions at $200$~GeV are found to overlap in a wide $p_T$ region, which matches well the measured ratio $\eta / \pi^0$ by PHENIX. We demonstrate that, at the asymptotic region when $p_{T} \rightarrow \infty$ the ratios of $\eta/\pi^{0}$ in both $\rm Au+Au$ and $\rm p+p$ are almost determined only by quark jets fragmentation and thus approach to the one in $e^{+} e^{-}$ scattering; in addition, the almost identical gluon (quark) contribution fractions to $\eta$ and to $\pi$ result in a rather moderate variation of $\eta/\pi^{0}$ distribution at intermediate and high $p_T$ region in $\rm A+A$ relative to that in $\rm p+p$; while a slight higher $\eta/\pi^{0}$ at small $p_T$ in $\rm Au+Au$ can be observed due to larger suppression of gluon contribution fraction to $\pi^{0}$ as compared to the one to $\eta$.

Poster Session,poster,Influence of quantum conservation laws on particle production in hadron collisions,"Janik, Malgorzata Anna",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Conservation laws strongly influence particle production. Effects connected to this mechanism were studied in details using correlation techniques in $e^+e^-$ collisions. At the time models were tuned to correctly reproduce measured data [1]. Similar studies for hadron-hadron collisions have never been performed, until recent ALICE measurement [2]. ALICE reported on studies of untriggered two-particle angular correlations of identified particles ($\pi$, K, and p) measured in pp collisions at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$ 7 TeV. The ALICE results confirm that also in hadron-hadron collisions conservation laws strongly influence the shape of the correlation functions for different particle types and must be taken into account while analysing the data. Moreover, now, when ALICE results are available, it can be observed that the contemporary models (Pythia, Phojet) no longer reproduce the data well. It should be noted, that also in heavy-ion collisions conservation laws (i.e. local charge conservation) provide crucial elements that are needed to describe experimental data [3]. 

In the talk we would like to present a brief history of experimental measurements of correlations induced by conservation laws, also including the newest Preliminary results from ALICE. We explain interesting structures observed in ALICE LHC data employing a dedicated model, called CALM (ConservAtion Laws Model). CALM is a model developed to study analytically the influence of the conservation laws on the shape of the $\Delta\eta\Delta\phi$ correlation functions. With this model we demonstrate that local conservation of charge, strangeness, and baryon number in hadron production mechanism is essential for description of experimental data.

(DE),Germany,"The study of event-by-event fluctuations of identified hadrons may reveal the degrees of freedom of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions and reflect the underlying dynamics of the system. The observable $\nu_{dyn}$ , which is given in terms of the moments of identified-particle multiplicity distributions, is used to quantify the magnitude of the dynamical fluctuations in event-by- event measurements of given particle ratios. The ALICE detector at the LHC is well suited for the study of $\nu_{dyn}$, due to its excellent particle identification capabilities.
Particle identification that is based on the measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss dE/dx works well on a statistical basis, but suffers from ambiguities when applied on the event-by- event level. A novel experimental technique called the ""Identity Method"" was recently proposed to overcome such limitations. The method follows a probabilistic approach using the inclusive dE/dx distributions measured in the ALICE TPC, and determines the moments of the multiplicity distributions by an unfolding procedure. In this contribution, an analysis of identified particle ratio fluctuations that applies the Identity Method to Pb-Pb data from ALICE will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mesut', 'last_name': 'Arslandok', 'fullName': 'Arslandok, Mesut', 'id': '932935', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

While pp collisions provide a reference measurement for a medium-free environment, the impact of cold nuclear matter effects on the dielectron production can be estimated from p-Pb collisions. Moreover, the measurement of low-mass dileptons has a high sensitivity to the production of charmed mesons at low $p_{T}$ via their decay into correlated $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs.

Poster Session,poster,QGP properties from azimuthal-angular dependence of charged-pion interferometry,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Recently the results of HBT measurements of charged pions with respect to the second and third order event plane are presented by PHENIX [1]. They extract $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT measurements which contain information about not only the source shape at freezeout but also the space-time evolution of QGP matter.  They show the relation between initial $\epsilon_{2, 3}$ which are obtained from a Glauber model and final $\epsilon_{2,3}$ which are extracted from the HBT radii. They find that the final $\epsilon_2$ from the HBT radii is finite and smaller than the initial $\epsilon_2$. On the other hand, the final $\epsilon_3$ is significantly reduced and potential reversed by the end in spite of existence of finite initial $\epsilon_3$. The interesting different response of $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$  during space-time evolution gives us a clue to understand the detailed QGP properties. 

For analyses of such high statistics experimental results, we develop a state of the art numerical scheme of causal viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion collisions, which has a shock-wave capturing scheme and less numerical dissipation [2]. Furthermore, using the hydrodynamic algorithm, we construct a hybrid model of hydrodynamic model plus UrQMD to include the realistic freezeout processes.  Using the model we investigate the time evolution of spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$. We find that the sign of $\epsilon_3$ changes from positive to negative during the space-time evolution, which suggests a solution of the vanishing final $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii by PHENIX. From detailed analyses,  we discuss the initial conditions of hydrodynamic model and the detailed QGP properties such as transport coefficients.

The nuclear modification factors RAA and RCP are presented as a function of centrality, pT and η. They show a distinct pT-dependence with a pronounced minimum at about 7 GeV. Above 60 GeV, RAA is consistent with a flat, centrality-dependent, value within the uncertainties. The value is 0.55±0.01(stat.)±0.04(syst.) in the most central collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Viscous corrections to anisotropic flow and transverse momentum spectra within a transport approach,"Plumari, Salvatore",University of Catania (Italy),Unknown,"Viscous hydrodynamics is commonly used to model the evolution of the matter created
in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision. It provides a good description of transverse
momentum spectra and anisotropic flow. These observables, however, cannot be consistently
derived using viscous hydrodynamics alone, because they depend on the microscopic
interactions at freeze-out. We derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit and the first-order
viscous correction to anisotropic flow ( $v_2$ , $v_3$ and $v_4$ ) and momentum spectrum using a
transport calculation [1]. We find that the linear response coefficient to the initial anisotropy, $v_n(p_T)/\epsilon_n$ ,
depends little on n in the ideal hydrodynamic limit. The viscous correction to the spectrum
depends not only on the differential cross section, but also on the initial momentum
distribution. This dependence is not captured by standard second-order viscous hydrodynamics.
The viscous correction to anisotropic flow increases with $p_T$ in agreement with the recent
analytical solutions of viscous hydrodynamic [2].

created in high-energy nuclear collisions. Among them, the source
imaging technique enables us to extract the source function, namely
distribution of the relative distance between two emission points for
observed particles, directly from two particle correlation functions.
Since the source function looks no longer a Gaussian in general, it
contains richer information about the space-time distribution of
emission source than HBT radii and is an ideal quantity to compare
experimental data with theoretical results. In this study, we discuss
one- and three-dimensional source functions for pions and kaons from a
hydro + hadronic cascade hybrid model simulations [1]. Our model

(3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics for the quark gluon plasma and a

$p_{T}$ spectra for pions and kaons are reproduced well. We next
calculate one-dimensional source function of pions and kaons in Au + Au

play a significant role to describe non-Gaussian tail which was observed

Cartesian spherical harmonics as the PHENIX Collaboration employed the

Poster Session,poster,Gluon transport in a semi-holographic model of QCD,"Yang, Di-Lun",University of Crete,Unknown,"A semi-holographic approach combining the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to study a gluon plasma which consists of hard and soft degrees of freedom, where the former is at the saturation scale of QCD and the latter is around the temperature of the quark gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model aims at analyzing gluonic transport in the phase after the thermalization of soft degrees of freedom. The hard sector is presumed to be weakly interacting, where its dynamics is characterized by kinetic theory with the collisional term incorporating the scattering of hard and soft gluons. In contrast, the soft sector is strongly interacting, which could be described by an infrared conformal field theory (IR-CFT) as the gauge theory dual of a supergravity theory in thermal equilibrium. In general, the dynamics of the IR-CFT could be captured by hydrodynamics and the interaction with the hard sector then appears as a driving force thorough the conservation equation, while the input of holography is to obtain the transport coefficients. The corrections on both sectors could be solved order by order in terms of the marginal coupling of two sectors on the boundary. It is found that the correction on the hard gluons is sub-leading compared with that on the soft gluons. In early times, the hard gluons could be characterized by classical Yang-Mills theory with large occupation numbers. In the longitudinal expanding system, the energy density of the IR-CFT receives non-hydrodynamic correction, which depends on the dynamics of the hard gluons captured by the non-thermal attractor solution. In late times, we may expect the thermalization of the hard sector, which then gives rise to hydrodynamic correction on the soft sector.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Di-Lun', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Di-Lun', 'id': '932811', 'affiliation': 'University of Crete', 'emailHash': '98953c64fa620444fd463f14f116de1d', 'db_id': 932811, 'person_id': 998592}"

This formation process is called final-state coalescence. The production of light nuclei is dependent on the baryon density and the correlation (freeze-out) volume. Therefore, by studying the yield and azimuthal anisotropy of light nuclei (anti-nuclei) and comparing them with that of proton (anti-proton) we can gain insight in the particle production mechanism via coalescence and physical properties of the expanding system at the thermal  freeze-out. Unlike the quark coalescence phenomena of identified hadrons, nucleonic coalescence is directly measurable as both the light nuclei and nucleons (proton and anti-proton) are measured by the detectors in a given experiment.

Measurement of anisotropic flow in asymmetric collisions is a subject of special interest because asymmetric collisions provide different density profiles, pressure gradients and initial geometry comparing to symmetric collisions in mid-central collisions.
 In this poster, we present current status of flow observables in Cu+Au collisions with center of mass energy, 200 GeV, as a function of transverse momentum, as measured by the PHENIX detector at RHIC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hiroshi', 'last_name': 'Nakagomi', 'fullName': 'Nakagomi, Hiroshi', 'id': '932592', 'affiliation': 'Tsukuba University', 'emailHash': 'ca3ea0f2200a23368ac1090080c91291', 'db_id': 932592, 'person_id': 998389}"
Poster Session,poster,Soft pion production signals of new phenomena at the LHC,"Begun, Viktor",UJK,Unknown,"The LHC data on hadron production, transverse-momentum spectra, and particle correlations in Pb+Pb collisions demonstrate a peculiar behavior [1,2], which can be interpreted as a coherent emission of pions with low momenta [2-5]. It can be a consequence of the prior gluon condensation [6,7], or the overcooling of the quark-qluon plasma deeply into the hadronic phase [8]. In both cases a possible consequence is the formation of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of pions at the freeze-out. The presence of the condensate decreases the non-equilibrium parameters [5], and therefore improves the agreement of the non-equilibrium thermal model with the data for heavy nuclei. The combined analysis of the hadronic multiplicities and the pion transverse momentum spectra indicates that about 5% of pions at each centrality of the collision could be in the condensate [5]. The data on two- and three-pion correlations support even larger coherent fraction of 23% [2]. This could be the consequence of the fact that correlations are much more sensitive observables [9]. The correlated pions have a momentum below 150-200 MeV [5,8]. It is on the edge of the current acceptance range of the LHC [1,8]. Therefore some efforts are required in order to clarify whether the BEC of pions is reached. However, if the BEC of pions is formed, then its temperature is 10^10 times higher than the temperature of the famous BEC of ultra-cold atoms. There are also much higher densities, smaller volumes and different interaction forces involved. The studies of the properties of the high temperature pion condensate could open a wide new field of research, similar to the studies of the BEC of ultra-cold atoms. This talk is proposed to bring the attention of the heavy-ion community to this interesting and promising opportunity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Viktor', 'last_name': 'Begun', 'fullName': 'Begun, Viktor', 'id': '932896', 'affiliation': 'UJK', 'emailHash': 'ece73810bac066291d895826c878b5be', 'db_id': 932896, 'person_id': 998467}"

Poster Session,poster,Long-range correlations in the deconfined phase of QCD,"Tywoniuk, Konrad",Universitat de Barcelona,Unknown,"Experimental evidence indicates that the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC behaves like a strongly coupled liquid. These features are intimately related to the infrared (IR) behavior of QCD at finite temperature and present a challenge for conventional perturbative approaches. A way to tackle this obstacle is to improve the description of soft non-Abelian gauge degrees of freedom (DoF) using Gribov's quantization. In consequence, a physical scale, which at high temperature corresponds to the (chromo)magnetic scale, is induced in the system. We discuss how this novel framework affects the relevant quark collective DoF's. Strikingly, we uncover a previously unknown massless mode which is protected by a novel non-Abelian magnetic scaling. As a result, the quark spectral function violates positivity, a well-known feature of confinement. This sheds new light on the interplay of quasi-particle DoF's and genuine long-range modes in the deconfined pase of QCD. Within the same framework, we also discuss the impact of the modified IR dynamics on the jet quenching parameter. We calculate its temperature dependence and find a strong enhancement near the phase transition that is in line with the expectation of a strongly coupled QGP.

Furthermore also measurements in proton-lead (p--Pb) collisions at the LHC showed this anomaly, but to a lesser extent.
In this contribution, measurements are presented of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ spectra of $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$) baryons and $K^0_{S}$ mesons produced in association with charged jets in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=2.76$ TeV and p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. The analysis is based on data recorded by ALICE at the LHC, exploiting its excellent particle identification capabilities. The baryon/meson ratios of strange particles associated with jets are studied as a function of the event activity in p-Pb collisions and are restricted to central events in Pb-Pb collisions.

predicted by lattice QCD calculations. Properties of low-mass vector mesons

chiral symmetry restoration. This phenomenon can’t be easily observed in
hadronic decay channels because of final-state re-interactions of the decay

After their production, they propagate through the quark gluon plasma and lose energy by colliding with quarks and gluons and by radiating gluons. After their production, they may also get fragmented into heavy mesons by picking up light quarks/antiquarks and in turn may decay through leptonic channels. These leptons would carry information of the initial stage of heavy ion collisions and also the evolution of the plasma.  In this work, we calculate the elliptic flow of muons from heavy flavours decay at forward rapidities in Pb+Pb collision. 
The transverse momentum distribution of heavy quarks produced from the initial fusion of partons, is calculated by FONLL ( Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Logarithms) approach. We consider both radiative and collisional energy loss along with a boost-invariant expansion of the plasma for the calculation of elliptic flow. The fragmentation of heavy quarks into mesons is governed by Peterson fragmentation function.  We compare our result at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE Preliminary data.

the QCD phase transition and to get a glimpse of how matter behaves at
such extreme conditions. Phase transitions are governed by a set of
thermodynamic parameters, like, temperature ($T$), pressure, entropy,
and energy density ($E$), and can be further characterized by their
response functions, like, specific heat,
compressibility, and susceptibility. In thermodynamics, the heat
capacity ($C$) is defined in terms of the ratio of the event-by-event
fluctuations of the energy of a part of a finite system in thermal
equilibrium to the energy ${(\Delta E^2)} = {T^2}C(T)$. This can be
applied for a locally thermalized system produced during the evolution
of heavy-ion collisions. But for a system at freeze-out, specific heat
can expressed in terms of the event-by-event fluctuations in temperature
of the system where volume is fixed: $ \frac{1}{C} = \frac{(\langle T^2
\rangle - \langle T \rangle ^2 )}{\langle T \rangle ^2}$. We define the
specific heat as the heat capacity per pion multiplicity within the experimentally available phase space in rapidity
and azimuth. For a system in equilibrium, the mean values of temperature
and energy density are related by an equation of state. However, the
fluctuations in energy and temperature have quite different behavior.
Energy being an extensive quantity, its fluctuations have a component
arising from the volume fluctuations, and not directly suited for
obtaining the heat capacity.
Here, we obtain the specific heat for heavy-ion
collisions at SPS, RHIC beam energy scan energies and for LHC energy.
Experimental results from NA49, STAR, PHENIX, PHOBOS and ALICE are

In this talk, based on the recent work of Ref. [1], we show that its contribution to isospin-averaged observables is, to a surprising accuracy, canceled by the repulsion from the pion-pion scalar-isotensor channel. As a result, in practice one should not incorporate f0(500) in standard hadronic resonance-gas models for studies of isospin averaged quantities. In our analysis we use the formalism of the virial expansion, which allows one to calculate the thermal properties of an interacting hadron gas in terms of derivatives of the scattering phase shifts, hence in a model-independent way directly from experimentally accessible quantities. A similar cancellation mechanism occurs for the scalar kaonic interactions between I=1/2 channel (containing the alleged K∗0(800) or the κ meson) and the I=3/2 channel.

Forward rapidity $\phi$ production cross section was measured in p+p collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.
The status of the  comparison study  of those experimental results  to  model calculation  is presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raphael', 'last_name': 'Tieulent', 'fullName': 'Tieulent, Raphael', 'id': '932675', 'affiliation': 'Universite Claude Bernard-Lyon I (FR)', 'emailHash': '9d4bebdb5ef8749823f9dbed92f4d69b', 'db_id': 932675, 'person_id': 998470}"
Poster Session,poster,Quantum corrections to the stress-energy tensor in thermodynamic equilibrium with acceleration,"Grossi, Eduardo",University of Florence & INFN Florence,Unknown,"We show that the stress-energy tensor has additional terms with respect to the ideal form in states of global thermodynamic equilibrium in flat spacetime with non-vanishing acceleration and vorticity. These corrections are of quantum origin and their leading terms are of second order in the gradients of the thermodynamic fields. The relevant coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the Lorentz group. With respect to previous assessments, we find that there are more second order coefficients and that all thermodynamic functions including energy density receive acceleration and vorticity dependent corrections. Notably, also the relation between $\rho$ and p, that is the equation of state, is affected by acceleration and vorticity. We have calculated the corrections for a free real scalar field -- both massive and massless -- and we have found that they increase, particularly for a massive field, at very high acceleration and vorticity and very low temperature. Finally, these non-ideal terms depend on the explicit form of the stress-energy operator, meaning that different stress-energy tensor of the scalar field -- canonical or improved -- are thermodynamically inequivalent.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Eduardo', 'last_name': 'Grossi', 'fullName': 'Grossi, Eduardo', 'id': '932683', 'affiliation': 'University of Florence & INFN Florence', 'emailHash': 'c626a766eb3b8b9ec0c7b0e9ec7a9a1c', 'db_id': 932683, 'person_id': 998476}"
Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium melting in the QGP fireball from the stochastic potential,"Rothkopf, Alexander",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"Elucidating the sequential suppression patterns of Bottomonium discovered in dilepton yields during run1 at the LHC urges theory to develop non-perturbative real-time descriptions of in-medium quark bound states out of equilibrium. The recent treatment of Bottomonium as open-quantum system [1,2] promises a viable path towards this goal.

  Here we present results from a first simulation of quarkonium dynamics in a realistic quark-gluon plasma, based on the concept of stochastic potential [1]. The values of this proper potential is extracted from first principles (Nf=2+1) lattice QCD simulations and does not contain modeling input [3].

  Initializing with the wave function of a localized quark-antiquark pair obtained in non-relativistic QCD effective theory [4], we solve the stochastic Schrödinger equation for Bottomonium according to the local temperature obtained from 2+1 dimensional hydrodynamics [5]. Including the effect of feed down after bottomonium hadronization, we compare our results with experimental data, in particular the centrality dependence of the bottomonium nuclear modification factor R_AA. Possible signatures of thermalization are discussed by comparing to the predictions of the statistical model of hadronization.

Poster Session,poster,Is heavy quark diffusion applicable? -- A new time scale introduced by decoherence,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Stony Brook University,USA,"Interaction of heavy quarks with particles in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) results in the heavy quark energy loss. In the nonrelativistic regime, the effective theory for this process is the Langevin equation, a classic example in the nonequilibrium physics. In the heavy-ion collisions, several studies have applied the Langevin dynamics to phenomenology and tried to interpret the experimental data of nuclear modification factor (R_AA) and elliptic flow (v2) of charm quarks.

  In this talk, I would like to introduce a new aspect to the Langevin dynamics, namely the dynamics of heavy quark color charge [1]. In the perturbative picture, each scattering rotates heavy quark color into a new color state and causes a macroscopic superposition state (Schrödinger's cat state) of the momentum. To derive classical descriptions of the Langevin dynamics, the quantum interference of the superposition must be destroyed by decoherence. I estimated this time scale to be \sqrt(M/\gamma), where \gamma is the momentum diffusion constant of heavy quarks. This time scale should be the lower limit of the discretization of the Langevin equation. Interestingly, this is estimated to be about 3-5fm for charm and bottom quarks, which is not small enough compared to the QGP lifetime so that the naïve application of Langevin equation to heavy-ion physics might be questioned.

Poster Session,poster,Strangeness production in Au+Au collision at $\sqrt(s)$ =  2.4 $A$ GeV,"HADES Collaboration, -",speaker to be announced,Unknown,"Particle production in collisions of heavy ions at energies in the few $A$GeV energy regime is still a matter of theoretical controversy. Is the assumption of statistical emission from a thermalized system sufficient, or is there evidence for sequential freeze-out?  Is there a consistent picture of chemical and thermal freeze-out? Or can particle production at these energies be only understood in a fully dynamical description like e.g. microscopic transport? 

HADES has recently measured 7 billion central (40%) Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of 1.23 $A$GeV.  For the first time at such low energies it has been possible to reconstruct the dominant particles carrying strangeness like K$^+$, K$^-$, K$^0$ and $\Lambda$ as well as the hidden-strange $\phi$. After development of an improved reconstruction method the particles can now be reconstructed with high purity and with a large phase space coverage. The respective  phase space distributions are analyzed with regard to the above phrased questions. In particular the conjecture of a possibly uniform freeze-out configuration is assessed as well as its location on the QCD phase diagram.

Poster Session,poster,Azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jets in Pb + Pb collisions at √ sNN = 2.76 TeV in a multiphase transport model,"Nie, Maowu",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP),Unknown,"Azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jets [$v_{jet}^{n} (n = 2,3)$] have been investigated in Pb + Pb collisions at the center of mass energy $√s_{NN} = 2.76 TeV$ within a framework of a multiphase transport (AMPT) model. The $v_{jet}^{2}$ is in good agreement with the recent ATLAS data. However, the $v_{jet}^{3}$ shows a smaller magnitude than $v_{jet}^{2}$ , and approaches zero at a larger transverse momentum. It is attributed to the path-length dependence in which the jet energy loss fraction depends on the azimuthal angles with respect to different orders of event planes. The ratio $v_{jet}^{n}$ /$ε_{n}$ increases from peripheral to noncentral collisions, and $v_{jet}^{n}$ increases with the initial spatial asymmetry ($ε_n$) for a given centrality bin. These behaviors indicate that the $v_{jet}^{n}$ is produced by the strong interactions between jet and the partonic medium with different initial geometry shapes. Therefore, azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jet are proposed as a good probe to study the initial spatial fluctuations, which are expected to provide constraints on the path-length dependence of jet quenching models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maowu', 'last_name': 'Nie', 'fullName': 'Nie, Maowu', 'id': '932717', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)', 'emailHash': '0c05d4ac4a0db61e91ab517bd4e3dade', 'db_id': 932717, 'person_id': 998508}"
Poster Session,poster,Stationary fluctuation theorem in high-energy nuclear collisions,"Kurita, Ryuichi",Univ. of Tokyo,Unknown,"The QGP created at RHIC and LHC behaves like a perfect fluid, which suggests it reaches thermal equilibrium state. Stability of thermal equilibrium state is a consequence of an interplay between thermal fluctuation and dissipation. On the other hand, only dissipation has been taken into account in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for the past years. In addition to dissipation, thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution (a.k.a., hydrodynamic fluctuation) must be taken into account to consistently describe the dynamics of the QGP. To study this, causal fluctuating hydrodynamics was formulated [1] and implemented in numerical hydrodynamic simulations recently [2]

   In this study, we apply this framework to the (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion and show that, under some limited conditions, the dynamics of the QGP satisfies ""stationary fluctuation theorem"" [3] which was established in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Through this theorem, we focus on the entropy fluctuation and claim that the thermal fluctuation becomes more important in the smaller systems such as p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. We further investigate the effects of finite relaxation time in causal hydrodynamics and find it significantly affects the final entropy distribution. This suggests we have an opportunity to extract some information about relaxation time from final observables on multiplicity.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium production with soft gluon radiation in the CGC framework,"Watanabe, Kazuhiro",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We study initial soft gluon radiation effect on quarkonium production at low transverse momentum in the color glass condensate (CGC) framework. 
In high energy pp (pA) collisions, the quarkonium production at forward rapidity can be described 
by adopting usual collinear pdf for dilute proton and the dipole gluon distribution function for dense proton (nucleus) [1]. 
The small-$x$ quantum correction is embedded in the dipole amplitude which follows the BK equation with running coupling effect (rcBK). 
In the CGC framework, the parton saturation is expected to characterize the low-$P_\perp$ spectrum.
Meanwhile, the initial soft gluon radiation also can affect the low-$P_\perp$ spectrum [2]. 
Therefore, in order to study the parton saturation quantatively, both the small-$x$ resummation and the low-$P_\perp$ resummation have to be considered simultaneously.

In this talk, we consider the Sudakov factor associated with the initial soft gluon resummation by following the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism [3].
We will present some numerical results of quarkonium production at the LHC including both the small-$x$ resummation and the low-$P_\perp$ resummation.

Poster Session,poster,Non-Prompt J/ψ Measurements with the STAR experiment,"YE, ZAOCHEN",UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,USA,"Because of their large masses and long lifetimes, heavy quarks are dominantly produced from initial hard parton scattering processes and can experience the whole evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

Measurements of non-prompt J/ψ produced from B hadron decays are very interesting because they may provide an opportunity to access bottom quark production in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Such measurements have become possible with the installation of the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) and Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) into the STAR experiment in 2014. The HFT can precisely measure track impact parameters, and thus allows a separation between prompt and non-prompt J/ψ through measuring their decay lengths. The MTD enables J/ψ reconstruction in the dimuon channel at STAR for the first time, which is important for J/ψ measurements at transverse momentum $p_{T}$<5 GeV/c and complementary to those in the dielectron channel at higher $p_{T}$.

below the free nucleon-nucleon threshold. In baryon dominated matter K$^+$ and K$^-$ mesons exhibit different properties,
since only K$^-$ can be resonantly absorbed by nucleons. 

Although strangeness exchange reactions have been proposed to be the
dominant channel for K$^-$ production in this energy regime, the production yield
could also be explained in Ar+KCl-reactions at 1.76 AGeV based on a
statistical hadronization model fit to the measured particle yields. To guarantee strangeness conservation, strangeness is calculated canonically
within R$_c$ in these models, and therefore the ratio of $\phi$/K$^-$ is predicted to rise with
decreasing beam energies and as a consequence the feed-down of $\phi$-mesons to kaons becomes important.

For this purpose, we develop a novel type of hydrodynamic initialization model by combining an event generator, PYTHIA [2], Brodsky-Gunion-Kuhn type initial nuclear effects [3] and MC-Glauber model. In addition to the fluctuation of transverse profile having been discussed frequently so far, this newly developed model enables us to demonstrate multiplicity fluctuation, longitudinal fluctuations and highly asymmetric longitudinal profile, which have not been available in the conventional MC-Glauber model. Since the size of the system is small and, in turn, the lifetime of the QGP fluid is short, the hadronic afterburner must play a major role in the whole dynamical evolution. So we investigate this by switching on/off the hadronic rescatterings in the integrated dynamical model so that we can quantify how much the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP is attributed for the observed collective-flow-like behaviors in the experimental data.

In order to fully exploit the longitudinal boost invariance of this problem, we use a basis in which the mode functions are labelled by the Fourier conjugate $\nu$ of the spatial rapidity. This choice has also the virtue of being suitable for a lattice implementation in which the rapidity $\eta$ is used as longitudinal coordinate.

These discoveries complement similar earlier findings form d+Au reactions at RHIC. In this talk we present recent calculations and theoretical interpretation for two such examples - the nuclear enhancement for heavy meson production in the backward rapidity region and single inclusive jet production in both d+Au and p+Pb collisions. We demonstrate that the incoherent multiple parton scattering can describe rather well the observed Cronin-like nuclear enhancement in the intermediate pT region of heavy meson production at RHIC and the LHC [1,2]. On the other hand, we show that initial-state inelastic parton processes in p+A collisions lead to attenuation of the jet production cross section, which is amplified at very high pT and forward rapidity. We demonstrate quantitatively to what extent parton energy loss effects in cold nuclear matter can explain the attenuation of the recently observed jet production yields in p(d)+A reactions at RHIC and the LHC [3]. We further show the consistency between the observed scaling behavior of the nuclear modification factor as a function of the jet energy and the initial-state parton energy loss picture.

The production of photons from virtual quarks considered here is of order $\mathcal{O}(\rho_p)$, while the bremsstrahlung process 
$q \to q\gamma X$ seems to be the leading contribution parametrically. However, the bremsstrahlung process should involve also the real quark distribution function in the initial state that brings in theoretical uncertainties, but our formula is free from such external input and closed within the McLerran-Venugopalan model.

Poster Session,poster,Radiative 3<->2 transport and thermalization,"Molnar, Denes",Purdue University,USA,"The mechanism of rapid thermalization in heavy-ion reaction is still an open problem. While 2->2 perturbative QCD rates do not thermalize sufficiently fast (e.g., Molnar & Gyulassy anno 2000), it has been claimed a decade ago by Xu & Greiner using their BAMPS code that perturbative 3<->2 rates shorten thermalization time-scales in A+A at RHIC and LHC energies to 1 fm/c or smaller. Later it has been argued, however, (e.g., Deng et al) that the BAMPS calculation may have missed the rates by a factor of 3!=6. We investigate the thermalization question using the transport code MPC/Grid, which algorithmically is quite similar to BAMPS (it has scatterings implemented via sampling test particles in small spatial cells in discrete timesteps). The new code has been verified against every analytic test we could think of, and in 2->2 mode also against earlier A+A results from the geometric MPC/Cascade code. On one hand, we do find that the inclusion of 3<->2 rates speeds up thermalization very significantly, however, the rates are still not as high as those published from BAMPS. The difference in 3<->2 rates, however, is not simply a factor of 6 even when we try to reproduce their calculation exactly.

In this hybrid approach, it is found that the temperature-dependent bulk viscosity plays a crucial role
in simultaneously describing the multiplicity, mean $p_T$ and the integrated $v_n$ of all identified particles.
Importantly, the extraction of the shear viscosity of QGP very much depends on the bulk viscosity 
resulting in smaller value of the shear viscosity.
These calculations are also in good agreement with HBT measurements.

Finally, it will be shown that a hybrid approach is critical
in describing identified particle $p_T$-spectra and the $v_n$ including baryons and multi-strange hadrons.
The afterburner is also found to be important in describing the angular correlations.

Moreover the LHC has started the Run 2 operations this year, and the study of D-meson production in  pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV could provide a measurement of heavy-flavour production cross section at an unprecedented energy. In p--Pb collisions, heavy-flavour measurements are essential to assess the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the initial state, such as the modification of the parton densities and the $k_{\rm T}$-broadening resulting from multiple soft scatterings of the partons.
In this poster we will focus on D$^{+}$-meson measurements as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision. These measurements are sensitive to the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production in p--Pb collisions and, in particular, could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies. The measurement is performed in  p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector in 2013. D$^{+}$ mesons are reconstructed in their hadronic $K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay channels in the central rapidity region, and their yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\rm T}$ intervals.
The per-event yield of D$^{+}$ mesons in the different multiplicity intervals, normalized to its multiplicity-integrated value, and its evolution with $p_{\rm T}$ will be compared for pp and p--Pb collisions.

Since the glasma initial condition consists of longitudinally polarized color-flux tubes, 
possible instabilities should reflect this background.
Recently, classical gluon fields in a nonexpanding geometry are found to show parametric instability 
under a longitudinally polarized background with homogeneous intensity [1]. 
The growth rates of low momentum modes are large enough compared with other instabilities proposed so far. 
The rapid growth is caused by the spin-magnetic field interaction.

Surprisingly, parametric instability survives even in an expanding geometry [2]. 
We introduce the conformal coordinates which enable us to map an expanding problem into a nonexpanding problem. 
We find that fluctuations with finite longitudinal momentum can grow exponentially 
due to the suppression of effective momenta coming from the longitudinal expansion. 
We also discuss the relevance of the parametric instability to the early stage dynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Characterization of the initial state and QGP medium from a combined Bayesian analysis of RHIC and LHC data,"Bernhard, Jonah",Duke University,USA,"A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), notably its transport coefficients, such as the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$.  Since these properties are not directly measurable, one relies on a comparison of the data to computational models of the time-evolution of the collision to connect measured observables to the properties of the transient QGP state.  The computational model parameters are tuned such that simulated observables optimally match experimental data.

We employ a Bayesian model-to-data comparison method for extracting QGP properties [1303.5769, 1502.00339].  First, we choose a set of salient model parameters -- including physical properties such as $\eta/s$ -- then evaluate a modern event-by-event heavy-ion collision model at a small set of points in the multidimensional parameter space, varying all parameters simultaneously.  We use a Gaussian process emulator to non-parametrically interpolate the parameter space, providing fast predictions at any point in parameter space with quantitative uncertainty.  Finally, we systematically explore the parameter space with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain rigorous constraints on all parameters simultaneously, including all correlations.

In this work, we apply the Bayesian methodology to the new TRENTO initial condition model [1412.4708] and standard MC-Glauber initial conditions, coupled to event-by-event viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics and UrQMD [1409.8164].  We calibrate several initial condition and medium parameters to experimentally observed particle yields, spectra, and flows from RHIC and the LHC.

This systematic model-to-data comparison yields rigorous constraints on the nature of the initial state and on fundamental QGP medium properties.  The method is general and easily extensible to future studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jonah', 'last_name': 'Bernhard', 'fullName': 'Bernhard, Jonah', 'id': '932888', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': 'e1e4bed92542141fb326b2e63f77f689', 'db_id': 932888, 'person_id': 998660}"

Poster Session,poster,Event-by-Event Fluctuations in Identified Particle Ratios in ALICE at LHC,"Jena, Deepika",Panjab University (IN),Unknown,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter to a state of quark and gluons. Phase transitions are often associated with enhanced fluctuations in various globally conserved quantities, such as electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, etc. Therefore, the study of the event-by-event fluctuations of these quantities can be a probe to explore the properties of the matter created in heavy ion collisions and its phase structure. A study of particle ratio fluctuations has been carried out by using the variable $\nu_{dyn}$ which, by its construction, is free from collisional biases, i.e. impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of particles within the detector acceptance. We present the first results on event-by-event dynamical fluctuations of identified particle ratios, such as, K/$\pi$, p/K and p/$\pi$ in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. In order to gain insight into the origin of these fluctuations, we measure $\nu_{dyn}$ for all like-sign and unlike-sign particle pairs as a function of number of participants.

Quarkonium production is an important probe to characterize the properties of the QGP. 

High precision data in pp and p-Pb collisions serve, respectively, to provide the baseline  for the Pb-Pb measurement and to quantify the amount of initial and/or final state effects related to cold nuclear matter, that are largely unknown at LHC energies. Since 2010, the LHC delivered Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, pp collisions at various energies and, in 2013, p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

The inclusive J/$\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV was studied by ALICE down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in the backward (-4.46 < $y_{cms}$ < -2.96) and forward (2.03 < $y_{cms}$ < 3.53) center-of-mass rapidity intervals in the dimuon decay channel and in the mid-rapidity region (-1.37 < $y_{cms}$ < 0.43) in the dielectron decay channel. The two former rapidity intervals correspond to the Pb-going and p-going directions, respectively. In this presentation, the J/$\psi$ nuclear modification factors will be presented as a function of the J/$\psi$ rapidity and $p_{\rm T}$ and of the centrality of the collision, as estimated from the energy deposited in the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The forward-to-backward ratios and the average $p_{\rm T}$-square values will be also reported. The measurements will be compared to theoretical models and the implication of these measurements to the interpretation of the nuclear modification factor measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cynthia', 'last_name': 'Hadjidakis', 'fullName': 'Hadjidakis, Cynthia', 'id': '932897', 'affiliation': 'Universite de Paris-Sud 11 (FR)', 'emailHash': '89f18e36fcb7a4983e7a9eecdf10ce6d', 'db_id': 932897, 'person_id': 998668}"
Poster Session,poster,Velocity-induced dissociation of Heavy Quarkonium  in the  gauge-gravity prescription,"Khanchandani, Himanshu",Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Unknown,"Using the gauge-gravity duality we have obtained the potential 
between a heavy quark and an antiquark pair, which is
moving transverse to the direction of orientation.
For the purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\em viz.} OKS-BH geometry, whose
dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence proves to be a
better background for thermal QCD. 
The potential obtained has confining term both in vacuum and medium,
in addition to the Coulomb term alone usually reported in the literature.
As the velocity of the pair is increased the screening of the potential 
gets screened, which may be understood by the decrease of effective 
temperature with the increase of velocity. The chief finding of
our work is that the potential develops an imaginary part
beyond a critical separation of the heavy quark pair, which
is nowadays beleived to be the main source of dissociation.
The imaginary part is found to vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the 
perturbative result. Finally we have estimated the thermal width
for the ground and first excited states and found that
non-zero rapidities lead to an increase of thermal width.
This implies that the moving medium fecilitates the dissociation of quarkonium states 
than in the static medium, thus agrees with other calculations. However, the 
width in our case is larger than other calculations due to the presence 
of confining terms and hence dissolutes earlier.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Himanshu', 'last_name': 'Khanchandani', 'fullName': 'Khanchandani, Himanshu', 'id': '932898', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee', 'emailHash': '08a04f64b41306e191ec870876058581', 'db_id': 932898, 'person_id': 998669}"
Poster Session,poster,Entanglement Entropy of Several Bosonic Quantum Field Theories,"Pang, Jin-Yi",National Taiwan University,Unknown,"We investigate how entanglement entropy behaves in general non-conformal
quantum field theories which describe kinds of physical systems. The
scalar field in $O(N)$ $\sigma-$model and non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge
field on lattice are concerned as two typical bosonic models in our
study. By virtue of divergency structure of entanglement entropy,
we distinguish different phases of $O(N)$ $\sigma-$model, symmetric
phase with positive mass square and symmetry-breaking phase with negative
one. The ultra-violet divergences in entanglement entropy of field
theories, further more, are demonstrated to be cancelled by counter-terms
induced on the interface between two subregions entangling to each
other. It is consistent with that topological entanglement entropy
as non-divergent part of entanglement entropy is renormalizable quantity
which is understood as cosmological constant living on interface.
In non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge field theories, at the same time, interface
cosmological constant becomes more important because it is able to
clarify ambiguity emerging from different choices of boundary conditions
on the interface in gauge field theories simultaneously. In order
to extract physical quantity from the disputed issue, we continue
to calculate finite temperature dependence, susceptivity to size of
subsystem and mutual information which are related to physical parts
of entanglement and as well irrelevant to interface counter-terms.

Poster Session,poster,Lifshitz point for the inhomogeneous chiral phase transition in the magnetic field,"Tatsumi, Toshitaka",Kyoto U.,Unknown,"The possible existence of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram has recently received enhanced attention.
We elucidate some peculiar features of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the magnetic field. Taking the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) [1], we have found that the energy spectrum of the Dirac operator exhibits the spectral asymmetry in the lowest Landau level, which is closely related to chiral anomaly [2]. It is a topological effect due to the phase od the chiral condensate inherent in the DCDW phase and gives rise to some interesting consequences such as a novel Lifshitz point [2], spontaneous magnetization [3] or appearance of the hybrid chiral condensate [4].
A new term appears in the generalized Ginzburg-Landau (gGL) expansion and the Lifshitz point appears on $\mu=0$ in the chiral limit. Such point should be directly explored by the lattice QCD simulations [2].
We can further pursue the Lifshitz point in a realistic situation, where quark mass is finite. Within the gGL theory the thermodynamic potential should include an additional term proportional to the quark mass and disfavor DCDW: DCDW is greatly modified around the Lifshitz point by the mass term, and it is shifted to larger $\mu$.  As a result one may expect a shift of the Lifshitz point from $\mu\sim 0$. On the other hand, it is well known that this term changes the usual chiral transition to be cross over at high temperature but small $\mu$. Note that the inhomogeneous to homogeneous phases should exhibit a clear phase transition due to the difference of symmetry between them. 
We discuss how the finite mass effect modifies our earlier findings and some implications on the lattice QCD simulations.

In this analysis we propose a novel method of event shape dependent two-particle interferometry with the aim of removing a large portion of the jet-background. By categorizing events by their transverse sphericity ($S_T$) we identify two classes of events, which significantly differ in hardness.

A statistically significant finite signal is observed. The improved statistical precision allows systematic studies of the charge separation and investigation of possible further physics background.

Poster Session,poster,Is the ideal fluid limit stable against microscopic perturbations?,"Torrieri, Giorgio",IFGW Unicamp,Unknown,"We discuss the zero-viscosity limit of fluid dynamics in the presence of microscopic thermal fluctuations.   The interplay between these fluctuations and the generally non-linear evolution of fluid flow makes the existence of a well-defined hydrostatic limit ambiguous.
We investigate these issues taking microscopic thermal perturbations into account non-perturbatively via lattice field theory techniques, where their effect is absorbed into the functional integral.
 
We find intriguing evidence, that the vacuum of such a theory is non-trivial, casting doubts on whether the gradient expansion can provide a good effective field theory for this type of system. The non-trivial vacuum looks like a ""turbulent"" state where some of the entropy is carried by macroscopic degrees of freedom. We describe further steps to strengthen or falsify this evidence, and conclude with a discussion of the role of these issues in the ""perfect fluid"" phenomenology of heavy ion collisions.

and Drell-Yan pairs in proton-nucleus interactions in the kinematic region 
corresponding to LHC experiments. Real photons and lepton pairs produced 
in a hard scattering are not accompanied with any final state interaction, 
either energy loss or absorption. Consequently, such observables as transverse momentum pT and rapidity distributions of real photons and lepton pairs at low and high dilepton invariant masses M may, therefore, serve as more efficient and cleaner probes for nuclear modification effects than inclusive hadron production. 

We have shown that shadowing effects in production of lepton pairs coming from the coherence are suppressed at large invariant masses and at very large pT at mid-rapidities. So naively one should not expect any nuclear effects
is this kinematical regime. Contrary to this expectation, we found 
a significant large-pT suppression which was already observed by PHENIX 
experiment in d+Au and central Au+Au collisions, as well as by fixed-target 
FNAL E772 and E866 experiments at large Feynman xF. This new effect can be 
treated as an effective energy loss proportional to the initial energy and 
is universally induced by multiple initial state interactions.

Besides, we present a systematic analysis of the nuclear effects in 
production of real photons and Drell-Yan pairs in p+Pb interaction at the LHC. We perform predictions for nuclear suppression as a function of pT, rapidity and dilepton invariant mass that can be verified by the LHC experiments.

Heavy quarks are created during early stages of heavy-ion collisions in hard processes before the QGP is formed. Their identities are not lost during the evolution of the QGP and subsequent phases, which makes them a good probe for the study of the properties of the QGP. Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) that originate from semileptonic decays of $D$ and $B$ hadrons can serve as a good proxy for heavy flavor quarks. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of NPE is sensitive to the interaction of heavy quarks with the QGP and thus the QGP properties.

Measurements of NPE $R_{AA}$ have revealed a strong suppression at high $p_T$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 $ GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In the year 2012 STAR collected data in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV. In the most central U+U collisions a higher energy density can be achieved than that in Au+Au collisions, which is expected to enhance the suppression of NPE.

In this talk we use this model to study the dependence of the crossover temperature with an external magnetic field. Remarkably, our results for the pressure of the plasma and the crossover temperature [1] are in quantitative agreement with current lattice data for values of the magnetic field $0< eB < 0.3$ GeV$^2$, which is the relevant range for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision applications.

We establish a comprehensive framework to describe the full heavy flavor evolution in heavy-ion collisions: the QGP medium is described in a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics model, the dynamics of heavy quarks are studied in an improved Langevin framework incorporating both radiative and collisional energy loss, and the hadronization of heavy quarks is described with a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination.\\

In this talk, we present first calculations of heavy flavor energy loss and collective behavior in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The Nuclear modification factor shows a centrality dependence: in the untra-central collisions, in-medium energy loss leads to suppression of heavy quarks; while cold-nuclear-matter effects are dominant in mid-central to peripheral collisions. The comparison between the elliptic flow of mesons and light charged hadrons indicates an incomplete coupling of heavy quarks with the medium due to the reduced temperature and medium size. We propose to use centrality dependence of the observables in p+Pb collisions in order to disentangle hot-nuclear-matter effects from cold-nuclear-matter effects. In addition, we go beyond the typically studied systems in heavy-ion collisions and focus on small systems (Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV) and on a lower collisional energy ( Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV). Looking at the nuclear modification factor and collective flow of $D$ and $B$ mesons, we are able to quantify the QGP modifications to heavy quark over the entire $p_T$ range: suppression at high $p_T$, and collective behavior as well as signs for partial thermalization at low $p_T$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yingru', 'last_name': 'Xu', 'fullName': 'Xu, Yingru', 'id': '932973', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '6c29d92a9d43b72e34863aa41983a2b9', 'db_id': 932973, 'person_id': 998729}"

We construct an Israel-Stewart-like theory containing these 13 temperature-dependent transport coefficients that is suitable for phenomenological applications in the context of numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We give parametrizations for the temperature dependence of all the second-order transport coefficients that appear in this theory in a format that can be easily implemented in current numerical hydrodynamic codes.

The new formula is applicable for an arbitrary value of the momentum imbalance of the two jets, $k_t$. This generalizes the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization formula that has been derived before by Dominguez et al. Their formula is valid only for small values of the transverse momentum of the small-x gluon from the target; it has TMD gluon distributions, but on-shell hard matrix elements. We extend their formula to all ranges of $k_t$ by including off-shell matrix elements. We also add finite $N_c$ corrections. The derivation is done with a standard Feynman diagram technique, and, independently, with a color ordered amplitudes method. The new formula encompasses both, the TMD factorization for small $k_t$ on the order of the saturation scale, and the High Energy Factorization (HEF) for large $k_t$ on the order of the momentum of the jets. The TMD and HEF factorizations can be derived from the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formula for forward di-jet production in the appropriate limits.

In the first part we report on the inclusion of fluctuations into the fluid dynamical evolution equations. We show that (thermal) noise can be consistently incorporated in fluid dynamics and check our results against known equilibrium fluctuations and analytical results for Bjorken flow. This framework also allows one to study the evolution of critical fluctuations, for example by applying transport coefficients with critical behavior or by coupling the sigma-field to a fluid dynamical background. In the second part we assume that critical fluctuations have formed in the collision dynamics according to universality arguments and parametrizations of the correlation length.

Thus, it is necessary to have under control the physical assumptions made in the hydrodynamical modelling.  In this work we present a new exact solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation. This solution describes a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric radial expansion for arbitrary shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. The resulting solution is invariant under the $SO(3)_q \otimes SO(1,1) \otimes Z_2$ group symmetry. We test the efficiency of various hydrodynamic approximation methods by comparing the evolution of the moments of the exact solution (such as energy density and shear viscous tensor) with the corresponding solutions of the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase-space evolution of this new exact solution and the physical constraints on its applicability.

Poster Session,poster,Heavy flavored jet modification in CMS,"Jung, Kurt Eduard",Purdue University (US),USA,"The energy loss of jets in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the flavor of the fragmenting parton. Thus, measurements of jet quenching as a function of flavor place powerful constraints on the thermodynamical and transport properties of the hot and dense medium. Measurements of the nuclear modification factors of the heavy-flavor-tagged jets (from charm and bottom quarks) in both PbPb and pPb collisions can quantify such energy loss effects. Specifically, pPb measurements provide crucial insights into the behavior of the cold nuclear matter effect, which is required to fully understand the hot and dense medium effects on jets in PbPb collisions. In this talk, we present the heavy flavor jet spectra and measurements of the nuclear modification factors in both PbPb and pPb as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, using the high statistics pp, pPb and PbPb data taken in 2011 and 2013.

Poster Session,poster,Classical and quantum evolution of quarkonium in a plasma,"ESCOBEDO ESPINOSA, Miguel angel",CEA Saclay-CNRS,Unknown,"New developments have changed the picture of quarkonium suppression in the last years. On one hand, perturbative and lattice computations indicate that the potential describing the interaction of two heavy quarks in a plasma has an imaginary part that effectively takes into account the collisions of the heavy quarks with the plasma constituents. There are also experimental indications that recombination plays an important role in determining the observed suppression. Both of these developments force us to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of quarkonia in a medium, beyond the static or equilibrium picture that prevails in most discussions. In this talk we investigate the quantum evolution of quarkonium in a thermal medium, including finite momentum effects that are usually ignored in potential models. By treating color degrees of freedom in a rigorous way we are able to understand under which circumstances a classical evolution, similar to that given by a Langevin equation, can be obtained. This classical equation can be generalized to an arbitrary number of heavy quarks, allowing us to study within the same formalism quarkonium suppression and recombination.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Miguel angel', 'last_name': 'ESCOBEDO ESPINOSA', 'fullName': 'ESCOBEDO ESPINOSA, Miguel angel', 'id': '933057', 'affiliation': 'CEA Saclay-CNRS', 'emailHash': 'd01141026ad41cba6e2ebc15f91a3e65', 'db_id': 933057, 'person_id': 998800}"
Poster Session,poster,Heavy Flavor Triggered Azimuthal Correlations in p+p and Au+Au Collisions from STAR,"Geurts, Frank",Rice University (US),USA,"At RHIC energies, heavy quark pairs are mostly produced through initial hard scatter- ings, leading to a cleaner interpretation and understanding of the measurements in heavy- ion collisions. Correlations between heavy flavor quark (c, b) pairs offer a unique insight into early interaction dynamics of the hot and dense QCD matter. In the meantime, a comprehensive investigation of heavy quark pair production mechanisms in proton- proton collisions is of great importance and interest as a fundamental perturbative QCD (pQCD) test and baseline measurement for heavy-ion collisions.

We report new STAR measurements of heavy flavor correlations in p+p and Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV using D mesons, Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) from semileptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons as well
as J/$\psi$'s as trigger particles. Azimuthal angular correlation distributions between trigger
D mesons and associated charged hadrons (D-h), NPE (D-NPE) as well as anti-D mesons
(D-$\overline{\rm{D}}$) are measured in p+p 500 GeV for the first time. Results with much improved precisions are also obtained on J/$\psi$-h and NPE-h correlations in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 200 and 500 GeV, respectively. These results are compared with pQCD calculations
to improve understanding of charm and bottom quark production in elementary hadron
collisions. NPE-h correlations are also measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV and compared with those in p+p collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV to investigate parton-medium interactions. Finally, the first measurement of electron-muon correlations from heavy flavor quark-antiquark pair decays is presented, utilizing the new STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker and Muon Telescope Detector in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Prospects of heavy flavor correlation measurements in heavy-ion collisions are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Frank', 'last_name': 'Geurts', 'fullName': 'Geurts, Frank', 'id': '933063', 'affiliation': 'Rice University (US)', 'emailHash': 'cdf37e52a191217e0b33775454ecd751', 'db_id': 933063, 'person_id': 998803}"

Poster Session,poster,Inclusive and tagged beauty jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC,"Kang, Zhongbo",Los Alamos National Laboratory,USA,"Heavy flavor jets at the LHC have emerged as a new tool to test the theory of heavy flavor production and parton shower formation initiated by prompt b-quarks. They provide new insights into the mechanism of heavy flavor propagation and energy loss in dense QCD matter. B-jets are also an important physics thrust of the RHIC heavy ion program. In this talk we present recent theoretical advances in understanding single inclusive beauty jet production, as well as photon-tagged and B-meson-tagged b-jet production in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We find that predictions for the nuclear-induced attenuation of inclusive b-jets, based on the theory of coherent energy loss in the QGP, agree well with recent CMS experimental data at a center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV. We further extend our results to photon-tagged and B-meson tagged b-jet production at 5.1 TeV for comparison to data from the upcoming LHC Pb+Pb run.  We find that photon-tagged b-jets exhibit smaller momentum imbalance shift in nuclear matter, and correspondingly smaller energy loss, than photon-tagged light flavor jets. Our results show that B-meson tagging is most effective in ensuring that the dominant fraction of recoiling jets originate from prompt b-quarks. Interestingly, in this channel the large suppression of the cross section is not accompanied by a significant momentum imbalance shift, a behavior quite different from the one observed in dijet asymmetry distributions. Last but not least, we present comparison between the b-jet attenuation and the quenching of open heavy flavor (D and B mesons) in heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,New parameteric model for entropy deposition in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions,"Moreland, Scott",Duke University,USA,"Hybrid models based on hydrodynamics and Boltzmann transport provide a powerful tool to extract properties of the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in the first fm/c of ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. The largest source of uncertainty in these model-to-data extractions is the choice of theoretical initial conditions used to model the distribution of entropy (energy) at the hydrodynamic thermalization time. 

In this work we adopt a data driven approach and introduce a new parametric initial condition model that is constrained by systematic model-to-data comparison [1412.4708]. Starting from a participant nucleon model, we eschew binary collision scaling and parameterize the mapping from participant nucleon density to entropy deposition using a family of functions known as generalized means. These functions — described by a single continuous parameter — interpolate between the minimum and maximum of the local participant thickness functions and reduce to well known harmonic, geometric and arithmetic means for certain special cases.

We demonstrate that this new ansatz is flexible and can be used to emulate a broad class of initial condition models which are not described by a two-component wounded nucleon and binary collision parameterization. The model is then embedded in a state of the art hybrid simulation, and Bayesian model-to-data comparison is used to constrain initial state and medium properties simultaneously [1502.00339]. We compare results to measured flows, spectra and charged particle multiplicities and discuss implications for first principle initial condition calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Scott', 'last_name': 'Moreland', 'fullName': 'Moreland, Scott', 'id': '933099', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '5c3dae75953dc245616e28d238363076', 'db_id': 933099, 'person_id': 998662}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of open-charm production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV with ALICE at the LHC,"Bala, Renu",University of Jammu (IN),India,"The ALICE detector was designed for the study of the high energy-density QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are  important probes of this matter, as they are produced in initial hard scattering processes and  they experience all the stages of the medium evolution. Therefore measurements of heavy-flavour hadron production provide important information on the early stage of the collision and the parton-medium interaction. Open heavy-flavour production measurements in pp collisions provide the necessary baseline to understand the results in Pb-Pb collisions and a test of pQCD (perturbative quantum chromodynamics) calculations. Furthermore, the study of open heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity allows us to investigate the interplay between hard and soft mechanisms in particle production. In particular, it could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies.

In this contribution, the measurement of  open heavy-flavour per-event yields as a function of  charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ =7 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector will be presented. D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ mesons are reconstructed from their hadronic decay channels in the central rapidity region, and their yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\rm T}$ intervals.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of ${\rm D}^{\star +}$-meson production in Pb--Pb and pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Veen, Annelies Marianne",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Unknown,"The measurement of open heavy-flavour production is a powerful tool to test next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations in hadronic collisions in the TeV energy regime of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Moreover, the D$^{\star +}$-meson $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section in pp collisions provides the reference for the study of nuclear matter effects on ${\rm D}^{\star +}$-meson yields in Pb--Pb collisions, as quantified by the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$). This observable compares the measured particle yield in Pb--Pb collisions with the yield in binary-scaled pp collisions. As heavy-flavour quarks (charm and beauty) are primarily produced in hard scattering processes in the early stage of collisions, they provide excellent probes for the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in Pb--Pb collisions.

The ALICE detector at the LHC collected data in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 2.76, 7, 8 TeV and, starting from June 2015, at 13 TeV, as well as in Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV and in p--Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV.

Prominent results from the LHC Run1 involved the measurement of single and dimuons in the ALICE Muon Spectrometer (MS) at -4 < η < -2.5 to look for low mass vector mesons, rare probes from the charmonium and bottomonium families, and open-heavy flavor. These probes allow to investigate the chiral symmetry restoration, to test the predictions from the lattice QCD about the melting temperature of a tightly bound heavy 
<i>qqbar</i> pair, to test the in-medium regeneration scenario, and to scrutinise the gluon density in the QGP using the in-medium heavy-quark energy loss. By the end of the Run2, the ALICE experiment will accumulate around 1/nb of Pb–Pb collisions. However, at least 10/nb will be needed to conduct high precision multidifferential studies on rare probes. To that end, LHC will be able to provide high rate running conditions for Run3 and beyond, i.e. 50 kHz for Pb–Pb collisions.
The ALICE apparatus will have to inspect all heavy-ion collisions to achieve the physics goals. We will present the required upgrade for the MS. The new Front-End and Read-Out Electronics are designed to cope with a peaking readout rate of 100 kHz, to be compared with the current capability of 1 kHz.

Majority of cosmic-ray nuclei is known to vary from proton to iron, and their target in the atmosphere is light nuclei such as nitrogen and oxygen.  To study the high-energy cosmic rays with low flux, atmospheric air showers are observed instead of primary particles.  To interpret the air shower observation to the properties of primary particles, the knowledge of the high-energy interaction is indispensable.
  The Large Hadron Collider forward (LHCf) experiment was designed to study the particle production at LHC. Though the ultimate target of the experiment is the ultrarelativistic nucleus collisions, LHCf has so far measured precise cross sections in the LHC proton-proton collisions.

suggest that coalescence hadronization between charm quarks and light quarks will also
lead to an enhancement in the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$/D$^0$ ratio. Therefore, it is of great
interest to study the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryon production to further understand the hadronization
scheme in the charm sector and constrain total charm yield in heavy-ion collisions. The
possible $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$/D$^0$ enhancement in heavy-ion collisions will introduce additional
suppression for charm decay electrons due to smaller semi-leptonic decay branching
ratios of $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$, which could lead to a different interpretation of the heavy flavor decay
electron results.


$\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryons have an extremely small lifetime ($c \tau \sim 60$ $\mu$m) and have not been measured

Poster Session,poster,Global and Local Temperature Fluctuations in High Energy Heavy-ion Collisions,"Nayak, Tapan",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),India,"Heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies create matter at extreme conditions of energy density and temperature, similar to the ones that existed within a few microseconds after the Big Bang. The fireball produced in the collision goes through a rapid evolution from an early partonic phase of deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to a hadronic phase and ultimately freezing out after a few tens of fm. 
Temperature fluctuations have been discussed in the literature as a means of characterizing the evolving system. The fluctuations may have two distinct origins, first, quantum fluctuations that are initial state fluctuations, and second, thermodynamical fluctuations. We discuss a method of extracting the thermodynamic temperature from the mean transverse momentum of pions, by using controllable parameters such as centrality of the system, and range of the transverse momenta. Event-by-event fluctuations in global temperature over a large phase space provide the specific heat of the system. We present Beam Energy Scan of sp. heat from data, AMPT and HRG model prediction. For Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, because of the production of a large number of particles in every event, it is possible to divide the phase space into small bins and obtain local temperature for each bin. Event-by-event fluctuations in local temperature can be obtained by following a novel procedure of making fluctuation map of each event. 
The origin of the local fluctuations has been studied with the help of event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations, which shows that the system exhibits fiercely large fluctuations at early times after the collision, which diminishes with the elapse of time. Any observation of non-zero local fluctuations may imply that a part of the early fluctuations might have survived till freeze-out. We discuss the hydrodynamic calculations and a feasibility study at LHC using AMPT simulated data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tapan', 'last_name': 'Nayak', 'fullName': 'Nayak, Tapan', 'id': '933142', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': '3eb0d7389968fcaf9ef891c87c9016c2', 'db_id': 933142, 'person_id': 998413}"

Due to the finite number of nucleons, the initial distribution fluctuates on an event-by-event basis. This medium undergoes a hydrodynamic evolution, before it freezes out to form a hadronic matter. In the last years it has been revealed that if measuring relative to higher order event planes $\Psi_n$, higher order flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n>2$ can be measured. It also turned out that Bose-Einstein (HBT) correlation radii also show 3rd order oscillations if measured versus the third order event plane $\Psi_3$. The initial transverse plane anisotropy causing these phenomena can be translated into a series of anisotropy coefficients or eccentricities: $\epsilon_2$, $\epsilon_3$, $\epsilon_4$, etc. These anisotropies then evolve in time, and result in measurable momentum-space anisotropies, to be measured with respect to their respective symmetry planes. In our work we investigate the time evolution of the asymmetries and the mixing of spatial and momentum space anisotropies via numerical viscous hydrodynamics and via analytic solutions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Roy', 'last_name': 'Lacey', 'fullName': 'Lacey, Roy', 'id': '933150', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': 'c1129d5060eac3f589873103b9f63418', 'db_id': 933150, 'person_id': 998856}"

The suppressions exhibit strong nucleus A and also kinematic dependences, especially with Feynman-x (or rapidity) and transverse momentum pT. Such suppression in heavy ion collisions is predicted to be an important signature for the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) due to color screening, however, there are also other non-QGP effects, such as initial state parton energy loss, parton shadowing and final state breakup, that affect the formation of charmonia. It is important to quantify the contributions from the cold nuclear matter, and it could be achieved through studying charmonia and Drell-Yan productions in proton-nucleus collisions where no significant QGP is expected.

For dielectron invariant masses above 1 GeV/$c^{2}$, the semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons are the main contributions to the spectrum. The invariant mass and pair $p_{T}$ distributions are expected to be modified from the pp reference due to the energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium and the excess of thermal radiation. A correct understanding of heavy-ion results requires, in addition, an evaluation of initial state nuclear effects, through the study of p-Pb collisions.
To access the intermediate and high mass regions, abundant high $p_{T}$ electron samples are needed.

Poster Session,poster,Dilepton and photon production in the semi-quark gluon plasma,"Hidaka, Yoshimasa",RIKEN,Unknown,"We discuss the dilepton and photon production in the semi-quark gluon plasma (semi-QGP), at temperatures above but near the critical temperature for deconfinement. Working to leading order in the coupling constant of QCD, we find that there is a mild enhancement, ~ 20%, for dilepton production in the semi-QGP over that in the perturbative QGP. In contrast, we find that photon production is strongly suppressed in the semi-QGP, by about an order of magnitude, relative to the perturbative QGP. In the perturbative QGP photon production contains contributions from 2->2 scattering and collinear emission with the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In the semi-QGP we show that the two contributions are modified differently. The rate for 2->2 scattering is suppressed by a factor which depends upon the Polyakov loop. In contrast, the collinear rate is suppressed not by the Polyakov loop, but by 1/N. We compute the rate from 2->2 scattering to the leading logarithmic order and the collinear rate with the LPM effect to leading order in the semi-QGP.

The reduced value of $\kappa\sigma^2$ is found to be consistent with the recently measured data by PHENIX [1].

In 2), using the functional renormlization group (FRG) method, we calculate the higher order cumulants of net-baryon number as a function of infrared momentum scale $k$ in a chiral quark-meson model [2].

As a result, we can discuss the bulk feature of the QGP such as transport coefficients and the equations of state in detail from comparison between hydrodynamic calculations and experimental results at RHIC and LHC. One of the current hottest topics is higher flow harmonics which has the information of initial conditions through event-by-event fluctuations and the space-time evolution of the QGP matter. In particular, it is pointed out that the higher flow harmonics is related to the ridge structure which is remnant of long correlations in the longitudinal direction [1]. The dynamics in the longitudinal direction may affect that on the transvers plane. Here, we investigate the effect of longitudinal fluctuations to the higher flow harmonics, using a hydrodynamic simulation [2]. Especially, we discuss possible existence and time evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy ion collisions. If the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs through longitudinal fluctuations, the vortexes form, which may affect the expansion in the transvers direction.

The dynamical breaking of the magnetic symmetry has been shown to impart
 the dual superconducting properties to the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum which ultimately leads to a unique flux tube configuration in QCD vacuum responsible for enforcing the color confinement. The color singlet physical spectrum in accordance with the color confinement has been achieved through the requirement of the color reflection invariance which provides two magnetic glueballs as the collective excitations of the magnetically condensed dual superconducting QCD vacuum which in turn, are intimately connected to the flux confining parameters (penetration length and coherence length) of the superconducting vacuum. Furthermore, in view of the relevance of the phase transitions at finite temperatures, utilizing the path-integral formalism, dual QCD theory has also been extended to the thermal domain to examine the deconfinement phase transition. The effective potential at finite temperature has, thus, been derived to compute the critical temperature for phase transition which has been shown to be  in good agreement with the lattice results. A large reduction of color monopole condensate
 and glueball masses near the critical temperature has been shown to lead to a first order deconfinement phase transition and the complete evaporation of color monopole condensate in the high temperature domain reveals to the restoration of magnetic symmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Garima', 'last_name': 'Punetha', 'fullName': 'Punetha, Garima', 'id': '933232', 'affiliation': 'Center of Advanced Study, Department of Physics, Kumaun University, Nainital-263001 (India)', 'emailHash': 'bb876c820329b42531d089648ba7d8a8', 'db_id': 933232, 'person_id': 998926}"

This process lead to not only energy loss of leading partons but also convert its flavor  to others due to induced gluon and quark pair production. As a consequence, beside the suppression of leading hadron spectra, the flavor compositions of a jet should be modified. Through a numerical study of the medium-modified QCD evolution, the leading K^- strange meson spectra are found to be particularly sensitive to the induced flavor conversion in e+A collisions. This conversion can lead to increased number of gluons and sea quarks in a jet and enhance the K^- spectra to counter the effect of energy loss with large momentum fractions x_B where the struck quarks are mostly valence quarks of the nucleus.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wei-Tian', 'last_name': 'Deng', 'fullName': 'Deng, Wei-Tian', 'id': '933242', 'affiliation': 'Huazhong University of Science and Technology', 'emailHash': '69217ed013ac41399316dbd33c87e273', 'db_id': 933242, 'person_id': 998932}"

The hadronic equations of state include all known hadrons; repulsive interactions are taken into account via two versions of the excluded volume approximation.  A switching function is employed to make the crossover transition from one phase to another without introducing a thermodynamic phase transition. A fit to accurate lattice calculations of the pressure and trace anomaly, with temperature $100 < T < 1000$ MeV and $\mu = 0$, determines the parameters. These parameters quantify the behavior of the QCD running gauge coupling and the hard core radius of the nucleon.   With no new parameters, the pressure and trace anomaly from lattice calculations for $\mu = 400$ MeV are equally well reproduced, as is the speed of sound.  We then compute the skewness and kurtosis and compare to measurements of the fluctuations of the proton number distribution in central Au-Au collisions as measured by the STAR collaboration in a beam energy scan at RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,Status of the STAR Event Plane Detector (EPD),"Lomnitz, Michael",Kent State University,Unknown,"The first phase of Beam Energy Scan (BES) program of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) was an exploration of the QCD phase diagram. The second phase is an exploration for criticality and phase transition signals. For the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) a quantitative understanding of these signals requires an increase in statistics in 7.7, 11.5, 14.5 and 19.6 GeV AuAu collisions as well as dedicated hardware upgrades. The Event Plane Detector (EPD) is a proposed high $\eta$ hit detector that would replace the STAR Beam Beam Counter (BBC – a 32 channel hit detector 3.3 $< |\eta| <$ 5.0 used for BES triggering and first order event plane reconstruction) for BES II, which is scheduled to begin in 2019. The EPD would provide improved triggering, increased detector coverage in jet-like $\eta$-$\phi$ correlation measurements, improved resolution for event plane determination independent of the TPC ($|\eta| < 1$), and provide a TPC independent centrality definition. Divorcing event plane and centrality determination from the TPC via a forward detector is crucial for correlation measurements performed at mid-rapidity. 


The EPD design consists of two scintillator discs at $\pm$ 3.75m, each is separated into ~500 tiles. A tile has embedded wavelength shifting fiber coupled to clear fiber outside of the tile which is, in turn, coupled to a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) – an inexpensive and magnetic field insensitive replacement for traditional phototubes. A pre-prototype of the detector, featuring scintillator with embedded fiber coupled to SiPMs was integrated into STAR during the 2015 run. Currently tile designs varying geometry and detector specifications are being fabricated and tested along with latest generation SiPMs. Additionally simulations have been performed to optimize tile $\eta$/$\phi$ segmentation, size, and shape.

We show that the main contribution to the net baryon number fluctuations at mid-rapidity comes from $q\bar{q}$ pair production in the transverse plane. There are three intrinsic length scales associated with this process: the transverse size of the baryon fluctuation $r_\perp$, the inverse of the saturation scale $Q_s^{-1}$ and the inverse of the mass $M^{-1}_{q(\bar{q})}$ for heavy massive quarks. We identify two regimes determined by the dominant scale $R_{max}= \text{max} (Q_s^{-1},M^{-1})$ and discuss in detail the properties of each regime as one varies the transverse scale of the baryon fluctuation $r_\perp$. In proton-nucleus collisions the net baryon correlation function is suppressed when $r_\perp > R_{max}$, while for heavy-light ion collisions this correlation extends up to the typical transverse size of the nucleus. These baryon number fluctuations generate non-trivial correlations which may propagate into the subsequent hydrodynamical evolution of the expanding fireball.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Douglas', 'last_name': 'Wertepny', 'fullName': 'Wertepny, Douglas', 'id': '933262', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': 'bc89776d9b2251a6247c88a73ec46fa4', 'db_id': 933262, 'person_id': 998457}"

These results are needed interpret the strong modifications in the rates of jet and dijet production in centrality-selected p+Pb collisions observed by ATLAS and CMS. The mean value of the transverse energy in the acceptance of the ATLAS forward calorimeter, where the centrality in p+Pb collisions is characterized, is reported in pp events with a dijet in the central region. This quantity is presented as a function of the average pseudorapidity and transverse momentum of the dijet, and also as a function of the scaled longitudinal momenta xproj and xtarg, estimated event-by-event from the dijet kinematics, of the hard-scattered partons in the protons headed away from and towards, respectively, the region of transverse energy production. The transverse energy is observed to decrease strongly with increasing xtarg, which in the analogy with p+Pb collisions represents one of the nucleons in the Pb nucleus. On the other hand, the transverse energy depends only weakly on xproj, which represents the proton in p+Pb collisions. These results provide counter-evidence to claims that the observed modifications in the jet production in p+Pb collisions arise from a correlation between hard scattering kinematics and soft particle production in the individual NN collisions.",
Poster Session,poster,Universality of particle production and energy balance in hadronic and nuclear collisions,"Grinbaum Sarkisyan, Edward",University of Texas at Arlington (US),USA,"A study of the universality of multihadron production in nucleus-nucleus and pp/p ̄p collisions is performed using the dependenceies of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities and of the mean multiplicity on the collision energy and on the number of nucleon participants, or centrality, in the energy range from a few GeV to a few TeV. The approach in which the multiparticle production is driven by the dissipating centrality-dependent effective energy of participants is introduced exploiting the earlier proposed consideration that combines the constituent quark picture with Landau hydrodynamics. Within this approach, the data on the energy dependence of the global variables studied and the pseudorapidity spectra from the most central nuclear collisions are well reproduced. The centrality dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities of charged particles are well described pointing to a similarity in the most central collisions and centrality data. The study of the mean multiplicty centrality dependence reveals a new scaling between the measured and calculated pseudorapidity spectra. Using this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation scaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra at all centralities. The obtained scaling clarifies on the differences in the multiplicty centrality dependence from RHIC and LHC as well as on the dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity density vs. multiplicity at RHIC. A complementarity in the multiplicity energy dependence in the most central collisions and centrality data is obtained. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions is pointed out to occur at ∼ 1 TeV. The pseudorapidity spectra of photons are also well reproduced within the proposed approach in the entire collision energy range and an explanation of their centrality independence is given.

Poster Session,poster,Fate of meson states and broken symmetries at high temperature,"Maezawa, Yu","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan",UK,"Thermal fluctuations cause modifications of meson bound states as well as restoration of broken chiral and $U_A(1)$ symmetries. The former (latter) plays an important role in the analysis of sequential melting patterns of open-flavor mesons (the nature of phase transition in QCD) in hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

We present recent results on lattice QCD calculations of meson correlations which express in-medium modifications of mesonic excitations containing up/down, strange and charmed quarks. Thermal effects are clearly visible in the spatial correlations which, unlike the temporal correlations, can be calculated at separations larger than the inverse of temperature. This makes them more sensitive to thermal modifications of hadrons. Moreover the spatial correlations provide a direct signal for the thermal modification of spectral functions which carry all the information about in-medium properties of mesons and their dissolution.

As a consequence of lattice QCD simulations using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical strange quark mass and (nearly) physical up/down quark masses, we find that light-unflavored, open-strange and open-charm mesons in the pseudo-scalar ($\pi$, $K$ and $D$) and vector ($\rho$, $K^\ast$ and $D^\ast$) channels show significant modifications even below the critical temperature ($T_c$). The modification pattern of these mesons is very similar below $T_c$, whereas a clear flavor dependence appears above $T_c$ where lighter mesons suffer larger modifications. The strange meson ($\phi$) and strange-charmed mesons ($D_s$ and $D_s^\ast$) show slight modification already at $T_c$, while the charmonium states ($\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$) feel thermal effects only at $T>1.2T_c$. This confirms that 1S charmonium states can survive beyond $T_c$. From degeneracies of parity partner it is also found that at $T_c$ the chiral symmetry is restored, whereas the breaking of the $U_A(1)$ symmetry is significant.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'Maezawa', 'fullName': 'Maezawa, Yu', 'id': '933286', 'affiliation': 'Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan', 'emailHash': '080dc64507877cea44385aded1691b09', 'db_id': 933286, 'person_id': 998964}"

We found the scale invariant operators are given as follows:
\begin{equation}
\phi_1=\alpha_s^{-9/11}\left\langle O_1\right\rangle ,\\
\phi_{2,3}=\alpha_s^{-(15 \mp \sqrt{17})/44}\left\langle \frac{-653 \pm 21\sqrt{17}}{424}O_1+\frac{1 \mp \sqrt{17}}{8}O_2+O_3\right\rangle.

Together with the dim 6 scalar operators whose renormalization has been worked out before[2],
our result completes the calculation of renormalization of all the dim 6 gluon operators, hence is  a first step toward identifying their mixing and thus a systematic analysis in the operator product expansion (OPE) of heavy quark correlation functions up to dimension 6.  After using the equation of motion in the purge gauge theory, only $O_1$ remains nonzero. 

As an application, we rewrite the dim 6 scalar and twist 4 operators as $f^{abc}B^a\cdot(B^b \times B^c)$ and $f^{abc}B^a\cdot(E^b \times E^c)$ and estimate their temperature  dependence using inputs  of dim 4 electric and magnetic condensate extracted from lattice gauge theory. We then improve the previous QCD sum rules for $J/\Psi$ mass near the $T_c$ based on dim 4 operators, by including the contribution of the dim 6 operators to the OPE. We find an enhanced stability in the sum rule and confirm that the $J/\psi$ will undergo an abrupt change in the property across $T_c$.

matter at freeze-out temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu$.
Since the underlying multiplicity distribution of the net-baryon number

construct the partition function $\mathcal{Z}(T,V,\mu)$ as a series of
fugacity [1], $ \mathcal{Z}(T,V,\mu) =
  \sum_{N=-N^*}^{N^*}Z(T,V,N)e^{\mu N/T}$,where $N^*$ is maximum baryon number the system can possess.
While one may be able to obtain thermodynamic quantities and
fluctuations from the partition function in this way, this also enables
us to study Yang-Lee zeros, which is the zeros of the partition
functions in complex chemical potential and provides information on the
phase boundary.

In this work, we show that the information on the phase boundary
extracted from Yang-Lee zeros of the truncated partition function is
stable under the truncation up to some orders, by making use of a
chiral random matrix model [2].
We compare the zeros from the exact solution of the model with those
from truncated partition function and from the corresponding Skellam
partition function.
We also show that the behavior of the zeros in the model against the truncation has a
significant difference  compared to those from the Skellam partition function.
We also discuss statistics necessary for obtain such zeros in heavy ion

Poster Session,poster,QCD Kondo effect in quark matter with heavy flavor impurities,"Yasui, Shigehiro",Tokyo Institute of Technology,Unknown,"The Kondo effect has been known as a phenomenon in electron systems with heavy mass impurities having finite spins. This phenomena is caused by imperfect cancelation of the infrared divergences of particle and hole excitations and is realized by a combination of the following ingredients; (0) heavy mass of impurity, (i) existence of Fermi surface, (ii) quantum loop effects, (iii) non-Abelian nature of interaction (e.g. the spin-spin interaction). These are indeed identified in a (light) quark matter with small number of heavy flavor quarks as impurities. In the quark matter, the non-Abelian properties of the interaction is given by the color exchange by gluons (S. Yasui and K. Sudoh, Phys. Rev. C88, 015201 (2013)). This is called the QCD Kondo effect, which modifies the transport properties of the quark matter with heavy flavor impurities, and can be relevant to experiments in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. 

In this presentation, we discuss how the effective coupling strength, between a heavy flavor impurity and a light quark, evolves in the low energy effective theory near the Fermi surface (K. Hattori, K. Itakura, S. Ozaki and S. Yasui, arXiv:1504.07619 [hep-ph]). We investigate the renormalization group flow at the leading log accuracy on the basis of the high-density QCD where the gluon propagator has the static screening mass and the dynamical screening effect for the electric and magnetic components, respectively, and show that the effective coupling becomes divergently large at a certain infrared scale near the Fermi surface, which is called the Kondo scale. This indicates the presence of a strongly coupled regime in the dynamics of the quark matter containing heavy flavor impurities. We find that, while the dynamical magnetic screening provides the dominant effect in the color superconductivity, it is sub-dominant compared to the static electric screening in the QCD Kondo effect.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shigehiro', 'last_name': 'Yasui', 'fullName': 'Yasui, Shigehiro', 'id': '933319', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': '6705014005278045b8eae45737aeae06', 'db_id': 933319, 'person_id': 998984}"

After splitting the obtained energy-momentum tensor and four-current into
ideal-hydrodynamics part and viscous correction, it often appears that the ""correction"" is large. However, all the existing models neglect viscous correction, assuming instant thermalization and violating angular momentum conservation.

Here we study the complete time evolution of heavy ion collisions within the coarse-grained UrQMD transport approach and quantify deviations from local equilibrium. Since these deviations are expected to be larger at lower beam energies and in more peripheral collisions, Au+Au collisions from $E_{lab} = 5 - 160 A$ GeV at different centralities are investigated. At every position in space-time the energy-momentum tensor and net baryon four-current are determined in the Landau rest frame.

We find that the largest contribution to the deviation from local equilibrium is the pressure difference in the transverse and
longitudinal direction, while the off-diagonal components of the tensor and baryon charge flow play a minor role in most of the cases. In addition, for every considered energy and centrality there exists a rather sharp time $t_0$, after which energy-momentum tensor from UrQMD is close to ideal hydrodynamics in a vast space region. This time $t_0$ decreases with collision energy and slightly increases with centrality, being larger than the typical times of hydrodynamics initialization found in the literature. By comparing the result from single events to the average result we also investigate the effect of event-by-event fluctuations on $t_0$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dmytro', 'last_name': 'Oliinychenko', 'fullName': 'Oliinychenko, Dmytro', 'id': '933330', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev 03680, Ukraine', 'emailHash': '360431e70e5701f7d46d282d1207c13b', 'db_id': 933330, 'person_id': 998988}"
Poster Session,poster,$\Omega-N$ Interaction from Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We investigate the
two-particle momentum intensity correlation function for $\Omega N$ pairs $

$ where $Q$ is the relative momentum of the two emitted particles and $S_i(x,k)$ denote the source function of particle species $i$.
$C(Q,K)$ has been used as a sensitive probe for
the source size in nucleus-nucleus collisions, but recently has been
investigated for $\Lambda\Lambda$ pairs to probe their interaction [1].

The $N\Omega$ system with $S=-3$ is particularly interesting, since it
is one of two multiplets in which the Pauli blocking does not take place thus can form a bound state. 
Indeed, a recent lattice QCD calculation by the HAL QCD collaboration [2] predicts the existence of $N\Omega$ bound state in the $^5 S_2 (J=2, S=2)$ channel. 
We adopt the $N\Omega$ interaction potential obtained by the HAL QCD
collaboration and calculate the $N\Omega$ correlation
function through the relative wave function $\Psi(x_1,x_2;Q)$. Moreover, we also study the variation of the correlation
function against the change of the property of the bound state.

We show that the correlation function $C(Q)$ is sensitive to whether the system has a bound state or not (see figure). If the
system has a bound state, the behavior of $C(Q)$ at low $Q$ also depends
on the binding energy. We discuss how the behavior the scattering wave
function can influence the behavior of $C(Q)$ and its interplay with the
source size. Our result indicates that high energy heavy ion collisions
at RHIC and LHC may provide information on the possible existence of the
$N\Omega$ dibaryon.

It contains a 72${\times}$72  pixel array of 83.2 µm pitch size. The key feature of TopMetal-II- is that it can directly collect charge via metal nodes of each pixel to form two-dimensional images of charge cloud distribution. Topmetal-II- sensor is designed with a low power consumption of 104 mW and low ENC value of 30 e-. From our measurement by injecting pulse signal into the top metal of each pixel, we got the ENC value of 13 e-, which is even better than the design value. Furthermore, the noise distribution of the sensor is almost uniform among pixel matrix. With such a low noise, we can measure charge particle track without any gas amplification, achieving high energy and spatial resolution. Thus making Topmetal-II- a competitive candidate for next generation of TPC readout node in high energy physics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shuguang', 'last_name': 'Zou', 'fullName': 'Zou, Shuguang', 'id': '933335', 'affiliation': 'CCNU', 'emailHash': '2e3f3200a140568bb85f7074dad82ee7', 'db_id': 933335, 'person_id': 998990}"

centrality-selected proton--lead collisions at the LHC are observed to
grossly violate geometric models of the relationship between jet
production at mid-rapidity and soft particle production in the nuclear

attributed to the suppression of soft gluons in proton configurations

fluctuations, or interpreted as the result of a rapidity-separated
energy conservation between soft and hard processes. This poster
reports the measurement of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jet production in

with unity. However, the centrality-selected $R_{d\mathrm{Au}}$ shows
substantial deviations from unity, with a qualitative pattern similar

Poster Session,poster,Centrality dependence of photon anisotropic flow at RHIC,"Chatterjee, Rupa",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"We calculate elliptic and triangular flow of thermal photons for different collision centralities at RHIC using event–by-event hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions.  Photon $v_3$ as a function of $p_T$ calculated with respect to the participant plane angle is found to be comparable to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2(p_T)$ for 0—20% centrality bin at RHIC. However, $v_2(p_T)$ rises much faster than $v_3(p_T)$ towards peripheral collisions and $v_3(p_T)$ is found to be largest for 20—40% centrality bin. 

We study the event-by-event distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ and their corresponding initial state anisotropies to understand the correlation between them. A significant linear correlation between $v_2$ and $\epsilon_2$ is observed at different $p_T$ values, however we do not see any correlation between photon $v_3$ and the initial triangularity $\epsilon_3$. This is unlike the case of hadrons where a clear mapping between hadronic $v_3$ and $\epsilon_3$ has been observed. We conclude that indirect effects of initial state fluctuations, such as buildup of large transverse flow velocity contribute significantly to the observed $v_3$ results beyond leading to an overall triangular geometry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rupa', 'last_name': 'Chatterjee', 'fullName': 'Chatterjee, Rupa', 'id': '933340', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '641dd4c47ff16b98a37c70846715855d', 'db_id': 933340, 'person_id': 998416}"

In this talk, we point out that the origin of the correlations in the Glasma graphs is actually rooted on a basic physical mechanism, namely Bose enhancement of gluons in the incoming wave function [1].

Poster Session,poster,Sensitivity of flow harmonics to sub-nucleon scale fluctuations in heavy ion collisions,"Noronha-Hostler, Jacquelyn",Columbia University,USA,"Event by event hydrodynamic simulations of AA and pA collisions involve initial energy densities with large spatial gradients. This is associated with the presence of large Knudsen numbers ($K_n \sim 1$) at early times, which may lead one to question the validity of the hydrodynamic approach in these rapidly evolving, largely inhomogeneous systems. A new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities, $\varepsilon_n$,  are remarkably robust with respect to variations in the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients, $\lambda$. For $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV LHC initial conditions generated by the MCKLN code[1], $\varepsilon_n$ (across centralities) remains nearly constant if the fluctuation scale varies by an order of magnitude, i.e., when $\lambda$ varies from 0.1 to 1 fm. Given that the local Knudsen number $K_n \sim 1/\lambda$, the robustness of the initial eccentricities with respect to changes in the fluctuation scale suggests that the $v_n$'s cannot be used to distinguish between events with large $K_n$ from events where $K_n$ is in the hydrodynamic regime. We use the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code v-USPhydro[2] to show that this is indeed the case: anisotropic flow coefficients computed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics are only sensitive to long wavelength scales of order $ 1/\Lambda_{QCD}\sim 1$ fm and are incredibly robust with respect to variations in the initial local Knudsen number (see [3]). This robustness can be used to justify the somewhat unreasonable effectiveness of the perfect fluid paradigm in heavy ion collisions.

We use a strong coupling inspired energy loss parametrization [2] on top of the evolving space-time energy density distributions to propagate the heavy quarks inside the medium until the freeze-out temperature is reached and hadronization (modeled using PYTHIA) takes place. The resulting D$^0$ and non-photonic electron yield, computed event by event [6], is compared with recent experimental data for $R_\text{AA}$ and $v_2$ from the STAR and PHENIX collaborations [3-5].

Poster Session,poster,Mott-Hagedorn resonance gas and lattice QCD thermodynamics,"Turko, Ludwik","University Wroclaw, Poland",Poland,"We construct a combined effective model reproducing the equation of state of strongly interacting matter as obtained in recent lattice QCD simulations. The model reproduces basic physical characteristics of
the hadronic resonance gas at low temperatures and embodies the crucial effect of hadron dissociation. The quark and gluon degrees of freedom are described within an effective mean-field theory, the Polyakov-loop improved Nambu, Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The  hadron dissociation is obtained by the Mott effect within a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach. The
lowering of the thresholds for the two- and three-quark scattering state continuous spectrum triggers the
transformation of hadronic bound states to resonances in the scattering continuum. We postulate a generic temperature dependent behavior of the scattering phase shifts in these channels. The in-medium phase shift model is in
accordance with the Levinson theorem. This results in the vanishing of hadronic contributions to the thermodynamics at high temperatures. The crucial in-medium effect responsible for the hadron-to-quark matter phase transition is the lowering
of the quark masses in the chiral restoration transition which itself is a result of the behavior of the chiral condensate. We aim at a selfconsistent solution of the model. The used PNJL model is improved over its standard versions by adding
perturbative corrections in $0(\alpha_s)$ for the high-momentum region above the three-momentum cutoff. This leads to the broadening of the quarks, while the quark  selfenergy is calculated from the same kind of diagrams as hadronic selfenergy.

Poster Session,poster,MC study of proton-Nitrogen collisions at RHIC for cosmic-ray physics,"SUZUKI, Takuya",Waseda University,Japan,"To understand the origin of high-energy cosmic rays, many experiments were carried at ground level, thereby observing air showers. Many measurements confirm a steepening and a flattening of the all-particle spectrum at $10^{15.5}$ and $10^{18.5}$ eV, that are called 'knee' and 'ankle', respectively. Both are considered to be the indices of change in propagation or origin of cosmic rays. Despite the high statistics, interpretation of the results depend strongly on the hadronic interaction model used in the Monte Carlo calculation which has larger uncertainties than the statistical errors. Chemical composition of cosmic ray (from proton to iron nucleus) is one interest of astroparticle physics, but results are not settled yet. Calibration of interaction models is an urgent need for air shower measurements.
 LHCf experiment has measured data of the forward region in proton-proton collision at $\sqrt{s}=0.9$, 7 and 13 TeV and proton-lead collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. Nuclear effect must be well understood, since air shower consists of interactions between cosmic ray (proton to iron nucleus) and the atmosphere (mainly nitrogen); lead and gold are too heavy target. Unfortunately, no high energy collision of light ion has been provided. RHIC and LHC are good candidates that can provide such collisions. We focus on the result expected with proton-nitrogen inelastic collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV ($10^{14}$ eV in lab frame) where we use the LHCf detector in the forward region ($\eta>6$) of the proton-remnant side at RHIC. We compare the energy spectrum with that of proton-proton inelastic collision at $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV to evaluate the nuclear effect. A MC calculation shows that it is possible to discriminate nuclear effect incorporated in some models widely used in air shower measurements and demonstrates that it can be the first good test to evaluate air shower.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takuya', 'last_name': 'SUZUKI', 'fullName': 'SUZUKI, Takuya', 'id': '933375', 'affiliation': 'Waseda University', 'emailHash': 'bcd9157e3cd0d8857561f5f7f2189339', 'db_id': 933375, 'person_id': 999015}"
Poster Session,poster,Viscous Leptons and Fluid-like Photons in the Strongly Coupled Quark Gluon Plasma,"Yang, Di-Lun",RIKEN/University of Crete,Unknown,"In the quark gluon plasma (QGP), the transport properties of electromagnetic (EM) probes such as leptons and photons could be modified by the lepton/photon-parton scattering compared with the case in the QED plasma. In order to incorporate the non-perturbative effects from the strongly couple QGP on the lepton/photon-parton collisions, a semi-holographic approach which combines the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to compute the shear viscosity of thermal leptons and photons. It is found that the lepton shear viscosity due to the lepton-quark scattering is inversely proportional to the ratio of electric conductivity of the QGP to temperature up to the leading logarithmic order of the EM coupling and is suppressed compared with the one from lepton-lepton scattering. On the other hand, the photon shear viscosity up to the leading order of the EM coupling is suppressed by the photon-parton scattering, where the suppression is favored by the coupling of the QGP. Such suppression stems from the blue shift of the thermal-photon spectrum at fixed temperature when the coupling of the QGP is increased. On the contrary, the lepton shear viscosity behaves oppositely due to the decrease of electric conductivity of the QGP at stronger coupling. Moreover, in a holographic model breaking conformal symmetry, both the conductivity and the amplitude of the thermal-photon spectrum scaled by temperature decrease rapidly near the deconfinement transition. Accordingly, a sharp enhancement of the shear viscosity of both thermal leptons and thermal photons close to the critical temperature is observed. In conclusion, our findings imply that the thermal leptons and photons in the QGP are less viscous than in the QED plasma. In particular, thermal photons may become fluid-like in the strongly coupled scenario. We argue that it may strengthen the anisotropic flow of direct photons.

Poster Session,poster,"Fluctuations, Instabilities and Collective Dynamics","Csernai, LaszloPal",UiB,Unknown,"Fluid dynamical processes became a dominant direction of research in high energy heavy ion reactions. The QuarkGluon plasma formed in these reactions has low viscosity [1], which leads to significant fluctuations and turbulent instabilities [2]. One has to study and separate these two effects [3], but this is not done yet in experiments. When such separation is performed, both fluctuations and new collective effects, like rotation and turbulence and the arising polarization [4] and two particle correlations [5] can be studied. The polarization arises from the shear flow based on the equipartition principle between local flow vorticity [6] and particle spin. Vorticity increases with beam energy in peripheral collisions, while higher temperatures counteract spin alignment. Due to these two effects polarization is expected to be observable at lower energies also [6].

It has been found that the presence of both a vector and an axial chemical potential could induce an axial current parallel to the applied electric field known as the chiral electric separation effect (CESE), where the axial conductivity is proportional to the product of the small vector and axial chemical potentials in QED and weakly coupled QCD plasmas. By implementing the gauge/gravity duality, we qualitatively obtain the same relation in the strongly coupled scenario. On the other hand, we find that an axial Hall current can also be generated when introducing an electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to each other with an axial chemical potential, which could be dubbed as the chiral Hall effect (CHE). The fluctuations of chemical potentials will further result in chiral electric waves (CEW) as propagating density waves led by the applied electromagnetic fields. Interestingly, the Hall density waves propagating perpendicular to both applied fields may exist even at zero chemical potentials and become non-dissipative. The transport coefficients including the Hall conductivities, damping times, wave velocities, and diffusion constants of CEW in a strongly coupled plasma via the AdS/CFT correspondence will be presented. We argue that the CHE could lead to nontrivial charge distributions at different rapidity in asymmetric heavy ion collisions. The presentation is based on  Phys.Rev.

Poster Session,poster,Single electrons from heavy flavor decays in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV in PHENIX RUN14 data,"Nagashima, Kazuya",Hiroshima University,Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are important probes of the energy loss mechanism in the quark gluon plasma formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are produced only by hard scattering in the initial stage of a heavy-ion collision, since the charm and bottom masses are larger than the energy scale of QCD ($m_{c,b}$ >> $\Lambda_{QCD}$). The energy loss of heavy quarks would be expected to be smaller than that of light quarks due to the Dead-Cone-Effect that leads to a strong suppression of small angle gluon radiation.

 We will present the status of the analysis of single electrons from heavy flavor decays in Au+Au collisions from the PHENIX Run14 dataset. The goal of the analysis is to understand the quark mass dependence of QCD medium effects via the $p_{T}$ spectrum of single electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays separately. The first step of the analysis is the evaluation of key variables such as the Distance of Closest Approach (DCA) distributions of electrons and hadrons, inclusive electron $p_{T}$ spectra and variables for electron identification. The total resolution of the transverse DCA and primary vertex is ~ 80μm at $p_{T}$ > 1GeV/c, which is enough to separate decay electrons from charm and bottom hadrons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazuya', 'last_name': 'Nagashima', 'fullName': 'Nagashima, Kazuya', 'id': '933415', 'affiliation': 'Hiroshima University', 'emailHash': '970dca31df3d873fa365c41c1cb5f2f9', 'db_id': 933415, 'person_id': 999041}"

The charm production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collisions is studied based on the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)
transport approach.  The initial charm quarks are produced by the
Pythia event generator tuned to fit the transverse momentum
spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from
Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. 
The shadowing effect is accounted for the nuclei collisions.
The produced charm quarks  scatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
with the off-shell partons whose masses and widths are given by
the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which reproduces the
lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The relevant
cross sections are calculated in a consistent way by employing the
effective propagators and couplings from the DQPM.  Close to the
critical energy density of the phase transition, the charm quarks
are hadronized into $D$ mesons through coalescence and
fragmentation. The hadronized $D$ mesons then interact with the
various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections
calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark
spin symmetry. The nuclear modification factor
$R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$ mesons from PHSD are
compared with the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration
for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV
and to the ALICE data for Pb+Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =2.76 TeV.
We find that in the PHSD the energy loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be
dominantly attributed to partonic scattering while the actual
shape of $R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects the  heavy-quark
hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation.
Also the hadronic rescattering is important for the $R_{AA}$
at low $p_T$ and enhances the $D$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

Poster Session,poster,Beyond the thermal model,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"The statistical hadronization (or thermal) model was initially developed by Hagedorn for hadron collisions above 10 GeV/c primary laboratory momentum [1]. In relativistic heavy-ion physics, many authors have developed it further and compared to a large amount of data in particular for hadron production rates, e.g. [2,3,4], where it  yields excellent results. 

To decide whether the system is indeed in thermal equilibrium, the distribution functions rather than production yields are decisive:
In the transverse momentum distributions of produced particles, deviations from thermal behaviour plus collective expansion occur beyond about 8 GeV/c. Not only the rapidity distributions of net baryons, but also the pseudorapidity distributions of produced mesons deviate from pure thermal behaviour: the thermal model does not generate a plateau in dN/dy, or a dip in dN/deta. 

Such non-equilibrium effects can to a certain extent be accounted for in a relativistic diffusion model [5,6] with three sources - two fragmentation sources, and a mid-rapidity source arising from gluon-gluon collisions - that merges with the thermal model only for time to infinity. Given the short interaction times of AuAu at RHIC or PbPb at LHC, the fragmentation sources still contribute substantially, providing good results when compared [6,7] to data from PHOBOS and ALICE, and also for asymmetric systems such as dAu at RHIC and pPb at LHC.

Poster Session,poster,Cosmic Phase Transition- a hint of  Cold Dark Matter in the Standard model,"Sinha, Bikash","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, India",Unknown,"Witten$^1$ and others$^2$ have argued that “small” supercooling leading to “little inflation” was the reality at the primordial era of cosmic phase transition from quarks to hadrons. This will necessarily shift the direction of the phase transition from a “cross over” to a first order phase transition.
Strange quark nuggets (SQM) with baryon number of $\sim$ $10^{44}$ as relics of this phase transition will survive$^2$ the entire cosmic time scale upto now. The presentation will demonstrate the SQM’s can be the most plausible candidate of cold dark matter discovered around 1996. The “MACHO” observations and the recent observations of strangelets of Bose Institute (Kolkata) seem to corroborate the just mentioned concept.
This is quite natural within the ambit of the standard model; exotica like axioms even WIMPS, not observed, do not have to be invoked.

With the come out of recent LHC results on particle production of various species, we find it a good opportunity to use this approach to interpret the data. The transverse-momentum spectra, from both $p+p$ and Pb+Pb collisions, are systematically studied within the Tsallis Blast-Wave (TBW) model, and compared to the RHIC results. Good agreement between the data and the fit is achieved over a broad kinetic range - 0-10 GeV/$c$ for $p+p$ collisions from 200 to 7000 GeV, and 0-5 GeV/$c$ for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV.

From the fit the kinetic freeze-out temperature T, the average radial flow velocity <β> and the parameter q, which is a measure of the degree of non-equilibrium of the system, can be extracted. The evolution of these parameters with collision energy and centrality will be presented. For $p+p$ collisions, the radial flow is found to be consistent with zero at beam energy below 900 GeV and increases to $\sim0.3$ at 7 TeV. For Pb+Pb collisions, the TBW model illustrates better fit stability compared with the normal BW model. The centrality dependence of T, <β> and q are demonstrated. A detailed fit to non-strange, single-strange and multi-strange particle species separately will be given. The multi-strange particle shows distinct characteristics at kinetic freeze-out comapred to the non-strange and single-stranged particles.

Poster Session,poster,Baryon number cumulant ratios at finite density in the strong-coupling lattice QCD,"Ohnishi, Akira",Kyoto University,Unknown,"Cumulants of conserved charges contain information of fluctuations

In order to confirm the conjecture that the non-monotonic behavior could suggest the existence of the QCD critical point [1], we need calculation of cumulant ratios 
hopefully in lattice QCD at finite density. 

We have recently calculated the cumulant ratios of net baryon numbers 
at finite density in the chiral limit in the strong-coupling lattice QCD [2].
Fluctuation effects beyond the mean field treatments are included 
in the auxiliary field Monte-Carlo method [3].
We find that $\kappa\sigma^2$ show oscillatory behavior;
one negative valley around the phase boundary is sandwiched by 
two positive peaks as a function of $T$.
With increasing lattice size, 
the negative $\kappa\sigma^2$ region is narrowed while the amplitude grows.
This behavior may be in agreement with the potential surface argument [1]
and the scaling function analysis [4].

In the presentation, we will briefly introduce the strong-coupling lattice QCD,
and show results of higher-order cumulant ratios around the phase boundary.
We may also discuss recent developments including $1/g^2$ effects in the strong-coupling expansion.

Further, required boundary conditions are automatically satisfied due to the geometry of the collision. The chiral transition is, therefore, completed by a propagating interface, exactly as for a first order transition, even though the transition actually is a crossover for relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Same thing also happens when we consider the initial confinement-deconfinement transition with Polyakov loop order parameter. The resulting equation, again with dissipative dynamics, can then be identified with the reaction-diffusion equation known as the Fitzhugh-Nagumo equation which is used in population genetics.

However, how the choice of the initial condition model for the QGP medium as well as spatial correlations between the medium and the initial production vertices of the heavy quarks affect these observable is still unclear. Of particular interest is the effect of initial correlation between heavy quark production vertices with the underlying event (referred as soft-hard correlation).

We have used the left ($L$) going and right ($R$) going spectator neutrons to form the 
observable $L+R$ that can be measured in experiments using Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC). 
The spectator binning helps us to analyse rarer events whose property usually get masked 
in the standard analysis with centrality bins. We find that in a given centrality bin, events 
with different ellipticity can be selected with $L+R$ binning. This serves as a complementary 
technique to $q_2$-binning to analyse intial event shape. The advantage in using spectators 
is that they are never part of the fireball produced and hence are pristine carriers of the 
initial state information. We find that the scaling relation between $v_2/\varepsilon_2$ and 
$\left(1/S\right)dN_{ch}/d\eta$ obeyed by different centrality bins is broken by the $L+R$ bins, 
instead the hydrodynamic response for both centrality as well as $L+R$ bins exhibit scaling 
with the initial transverse dimension.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bedangadas', 'last_name': 'Mohanty', 'fullName': 'Mohanty, Bedangadas', 'id': '933566', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN)', 'emailHash': 'c29d717a3abe3e9c9082324579e1f8fe', 'db_id': 933566, 'person_id': 999127}"
Poster Session,poster,$\Lambda-\Lambda$ Correlation in High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We show that  $\Lambda\Lambda$ intensity correlation function $C(Q=k_1-k_2)$ measured in high energy heavy ion collisions can constrain the interaction between two $\Lambda$ [1]. 

For various $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction potentials in literature, summarized in the figure with corresponding low energy scattering parameters, we compute the $\Lambda\Lambda$ relative wave function $\Psi(x_1,x_2;Q)$ by assuming modification of the wave function in $S-$wave and discuss the relation between the scattering parameters and the behavior of the correlation function 
$
 C(Q,K) = \frac{\int dx_1 \int dx_2
  S(x_1,K)S(x_2,K)|\Psi(x_1,x_2;Q)|^2}{\int dx_1 S(x_1,k_1) \int dx_2 S(x_2,k_2)},
$
where $S(x,K)$ denote the source function which is the phase space distribution of $\Lambda$ at freeze-out.

Employing a Gaussian source model with longitudinal and transverse
expansion as a source function of $\Lambda$, we discuss the parameter
ranges of the scattering length $a_0$ and the effective range
$r_{\text{eff}}$ constrained from experimental data in Au+Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$GeV measured by the STAR collaboration [2].
The contribution from electromagnetic decay $\Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda \gamma$
is found to be important. We also point out the existence of residual
correlation in the high $Q$ region which cannot be explained in the
present framework. 

Consequently, we obtained a constraint on the scattering length 
$1/a_0 < -0.8 \text{fm}^{-1}$. 
We will also address an application of this method to other systems,
such as $\Omega-N$ [3].

Poster Session,poster,A small current measurement system for gaseous micropattern detectors suitable for operation at high voltages,"Poljak, Nikola",University of Zagreb  (HR),Unknown,"Future upgrades of several large particle detectors intend to employ gaseous micropattern detectors. This class of detectors, which include Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs), Micro-MEsh Gaseous Structure detectors (MicroMegas) and similar, usually require the measurement of small currents (pA) at high potentials (kV) with respect to ground. While only this in itself presents an obstacle, the measurements very often need to satisfy other strict requirements, such as small current resolution, low power consumption, high readout frequencies (1 kHz) or simultaneous readouts of multiple channels.

Several instruments that overcome some of these difficulties have been proposed or developed, often lacking in characteristics that would make them universally applicable. We present a description of a high-resolution picoammeter developed in our laboratory. Tests of the prototype with a local Gas Electron Multiplier sheet setup demonstrate that it satisfies all the aforementioned requirements, including a current resolution of less than 15pA, a readout frequency of 1kHz, the ability of simultaneous readout of multiple channels (up to 16) and low battery power consumption. Several prototypes have been sent for independent testing to other institutions, providing feedback for possible improvements, which are either already under way or planned as future upgrades.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nikola', 'last_name': 'Poljak', 'fullName': 'Poljak, Nikola', 'id': '933574', 'affiliation': 'University of Zagreb  (HR)', 'emailHash': '89e320380d3341156c6281f5b8540ec7', 'db_id': 933574, 'person_id': 999130}"
Poster Session,poster,Nuclear Symmetry Energy in QCD degree of freedom,"Jeong, Kie Sang",Yonsei University,Unknown,"Nuclear symmetry energy is an important ingredient in understanding asymmetric nuclear configuration starting from rare isotopes at nuclear matter density to the core of neutron star at extremely high density.
The symmetry energy in continuous matter can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\bar{E}(\rho_N,I)=E_0(\rho_N)+E_{\textrm{sym}}(\rho_N)I^2 +
O(I^4)+\cdots,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_N$ is the nuclear medium density and $I =
(\rho_n-\rho_p)/(\rho_n+\rho_p)$ the asymmetric parameter. Our goal
is to understand the iso-spin asymmetric nature of the nuclear
matter using the QCD degree of freedom.

For the hadronic phase, by taking the
difference between the  neutron and proton self-energies calculated in the QCD sum rules, we obtained the
symmetry energy in terms of local operators [1]. We
find that the scalar (vector) part gives a negative (positive)
contribution to the nuclear symmetry energy, which is consistent
with the results from relativistic mean field theories.

For the  quark phase, we used hard dense loop (HDL) resummation for
the normal phase and considered BCS pairing in 2-color
superconductor (2SC) phase [2]. In the normal
phase, the effect of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy,
obtained from the HDL resumed free energy, was found to be small. In
the 2SC phase, the BCS paring gives enhanced symmetry energy as the
gapped states are forced to be in the common Fermi sea reducing
iso-spin asymmetrizable states. Also, in the 2SC phase, the gluonic
contribution to the symmetry energy is expected to be minimal as
only the unimportant Meissner mass has iso-spin dependence. The
different symmetry energy in each phase will affect the iso-spin
density of the dense matter and subsequently lead to different
prediction for the particle yields in HIC experiment.

Poster Session,poster,Nuclear modification of jet structure in proton-lead collisions at the LHC,"Qin, Guang-You",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The collective anisotropic flows observed in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC and the agreement with hydrodynamic calculations strongly support that a hot and dense QGP may be formed in such small collisions systems. However, the current experimental measurement showed no indication of nuclear modification on the production of large transverse momentum hadrons and jets in minimum-bias proton-lead collisions. As is well known, jet quenching has been one of the most important evidences for the formation of QGP in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Thus, the search for the signature of jet modification is essential to our understanding of high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.

We study the nuclear modification of full jets and their structure in proton-lead collisions at the LHC. The evolution of full jet shower in dense QCD matter is simulated via a pQCD-based Monte-Carlo transport model which includes the medium effects from both radiative and collisional processes. The space-time evolution of the hot and dense nuclear matter produced in proton-lead collisions at the LHC is simulated utilizing a (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions as obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber-based energy deposition model, from which we calculate the anistropic flows and compare to the experimental data. We are particularly interested in the multiplicity dependence and the rapidity dependence for the nuclear modification of the inner structure of single inclusive jets and photon-triggered jets in proton-lead collisions. Comparing to the single inclusive hadron or jet spectra, the modification of full jet structure is more sensitive to the details of jet-medium interaction. We argue that the multiplicity and rapidity dependences for the nuclear modification of full jet structure, once observed, should clearly signal the formation of QGP in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guang-You', 'last_name': 'Qin', 'fullName': 'Qin, Guang-You', 'id': '933589', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '07d521d0766c2824bed3b66cdef7109a', 'db_id': 933589, 'person_id': 999141}"

be derived from the non-extensive statistical and thermodynamical phenomena. Based on
earlier theoretical developments, it seems, the methods are very applicable for jets hadronization processes in electron-positron, proton-proton, and even in heavy-ion collisions.

Here, we present what can was learnt from the recent theoretical and phenomenological
developments: transverse momentum spectra and azimuthal anisotropy (v2) of charge averaged
pions, kaons and protons stemming from high-energy collisions form RHIC to LHC energies, which are described analytically in a ‘soft + hard’ model.
In this model, we propose that hadron yields produced in heavy-ion collisions are simply
the sum of yields stemming from jets (hard yields) in addition to the yields originating from the Quark-Gluon Plasma (soft yields).

In particular, we remark that such scaling behavior resembles the approximate Bjorken scaling of parton distribution functions, and could be naturally explained if ""somehow"", parton distribution functions aquired an angular dependence.

We speculate on how this could occur, focusing on the stability structure of the GLR (Gribov-Levin Ryskin equation) when its full 2+1 dimensional structure is considered.   Via a linearized solution, we isolate a regime in which azimuthal perturbations grow with ln(1/x).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Giorgio', 'last_name': 'Torrieri', 'fullName': 'Torrieri, Giorgio', 'id': '933597', 'affiliation': 'IFGW Unicamp', 'emailHash': 'c07c41ff0d5c6580561a0e796930e395', 'db_id': 933597, 'person_id': 998723}"

Poster Session,poster,Strangeness production in U+U collisions at STAR,"Tripathy, Srikanta Kumar","Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar",Unknown,"Enhanced strange quark production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions relative to p+p col- lisions was proposed as a possible signature of the deconfined phase of quarks and gluons [1]. It was suggested that the dominant process for the production of strange quarks in the quark gluon plasma is gluonic fusion. Chemical equilibration of strange quarks formed in such medium happens faster than would be the situation in hadronic scenario [2].

With 20% larger energy density expected [3] and a larger lifetime of fireball than Au+Au collisions, we can have a better insight of testing these facts in U+U collisions.

We will present transverse momentum (pT ) spectra of Ks , Λ(Λ ̄) and Ξ(Ξ ̄) in U+U collisions at √sNN = 193 GeV in STAR experiment at RHIC. These strange particles are reconstructed from their weak decay topology via dominant hadronic decay modes using the Time Projection Chamber(TPC) detector of STAR. Measured masses of these particles are consistent with PDG values. A clear centrality dependence of pT spectra is observed for these particles. We’ll also show comparison of these results with Au+Au 200 GeV results.

We approximate the conditions met in heavy ion collision by enforcing strangeness neutrality and a constant baryon number to electric charge ratio. We show that the fourth-order equation 
of state is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \sim 20$ GeV. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion coefficients are used to estimate truncation errors

The presented results will be close to final, *i.e.*, many of the quantities will be continuum extrapolated, based on lattice calculations performed with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action (HISQ) in the temperature range 140 MeV < T < 330 MeV, with lattice sizes $24^3 \times 6$, $32^3 \times 8$ and $48^3\times 12$. The strange quark mass is tuned to its physical value

We address the difficulties of the present theoretical approaches to have a
self-consistent description of the experimental data at both RHIC and LHC. 
In particular a puzzling relation between the nuclear modification factor
$R_{AA}(p_T)$ and the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ related to heavy quark has been
observed which challenged  existing models. We discuss how the
temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient can
account for a large part of such a puzzle. We point out that for the
same $R_{AA}(p_T)$ one can generate 2-3 times more $v_2$ depending on the
temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient [3]. 
A non-decreasing drag coefficient as T→Tc, as in liquids and not in gas, is a major ingredient 
for a simultaneous description of $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ along with hadronization by coalescence.

Within our study, we determine the momentum, temperature and chemical potential dependencies of the QGP d.o.f. within the dynamical quasi-particle model [3].

In the same approach, we compute the transport properties (shear and bulk viscosities, electric and heat conductivities, etc) of the QGP at finite temperature and chemical potential. The cross sections at finite temperature and chemical potential, used in our study, are evaluated for these dynamical quasi-particles using the leading order Born diagrams [4].

This contribution is important to understand in order to be able to determine the true centrality dependence of the J/\psi yield from hadronic sources. It also addresses some interesting questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in a semi-central collision: if the number of photons is ""frozen"" before the collision and all protons contribute to the photon flux, or if only the protons in the spectator fragments contribute. Similarly, it is not clear if the photon target is restricted to the spectator fragments or if production can occur also in the participant region. In the latter case, photoproduction will provide a novel probe of strongly interacting matter, and the interplay with hadronic production, e.g. regarding regeneration and thermalization, would merit further experimental and theoretical study.

The model used to calculate the photoproduction cross section will be discussed and the expected yield as function of centrality will be compared with the expected hadronic contribution. The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the two production mechanisms will be compared.  The calculations indicate that the yield from photoproduction changes from a few percent of the hadronic yield for the 50-60% most central collisions to around 50% of the hadronic yield for the 80-90% most central collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joakim', 'last_name': 'Nystrand', 'fullName': 'Nystrand, Joakim', 'id': '933689', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen (NO)', 'emailHash': 'cea77e55aed8319d570a00d5ec090d51', 'db_id': 933689, 'person_id': 999206}"

We model the heavy-ion collisions using the PHSD microscopic transport approach, which includes the dynamics of quarks, antiquarks and gluons as well as a covariant dynamical hadronization scheme and the subsequent off-shell hadronic reaction dynamics. The implementation of photon bremsstrahlung in transport approaches has been based until now on the soft photon approximation, which is valid only at low energy of the produced photon. Presently, we have improved the calculation of this channel beyond the soft photon approximation by using the one-boson-exchange model. In order to clarify the channel decomposition of the direct photon spectra, we investigate the centrality dependence of the photon yield at RHIC and, most recently, also at the LHC.

This is confirmed by simulations using various initial-state models.

It has been argued that non-Gaussianities may not reflect underlying
microscopic dynamics. On the contrary, there are indications that they
are to a large extent
universal and arise from the global condition $|\varepsilon_n|<1$.
On the other hand, systematic investigations of second and
fourth-order cumulants $\varepsilon_n\{2\}$ and $\varepsilon_n\{4\}$
reveal deviations from this universal behavior in large systems,
which suggests that non-Gaussianities may carry non-trivial dynamical
information.

In this talk, we present results from Monte Carlo simulations and
analytic calculations which we have done in order to
investigate what non-Gaussianities tell us about the early stage of

We find that the non-Gaussianities are essentially universal in p+Pb

Jet quenching has been observed at RHIC and the LHC, and it has been extensively studied at both colliders.

Recently a new aspect of jet physics has been revealed at RHIC and the LHC.
The jet energy deposition in the medium (jet-quenching effect) was found to result in an increased production of low $p_{T}$ particles at large angles opposite to the survived jet or triggered gamma direction.
However, there are still remaining open questions how the quenched jet energy is re-distributed in geometrical space, and how the QGP medium responds to it.

The HBT correlations using quantum interferometry of identical particles provide a unique tool to measure the source size at kinetic freeze-out.
In particular, azimuthally sensitive HBT with respect to the event plane($\Psi_{2}$) offers the detailed analysis of freeze-out source shape.

In order to obtain more detailed information on    the jet modification effect in geometrical space, the HBT technique can be extended and applied relative to jet axis.

We present a study on the stability of a Fulde-Ferrell type inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase, the so-called dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase, of dense quark matter against low energy fluctuations about a spatially modulated order parameter [1]. We find that the DCDW phase exhibits a flavor-translation locking symmetry from the symmetry point of view. We also show that the Nambu-Goldstone modes, whose dispersion relations are spatially anisotropic and soft in the directions transverse to the modulation, wash out the long-range order at non-zero temperatures, but sustain quasi-long-range correlations (algebraically decaying long-range correlations), starting with a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective Lagrangian. Consequently, at finite temperatures the DCDW phase is found to be a quasi-one-dimensional ordered phase as in smectic phases of liquid crystals.

Then, we put heavy-light mesons into such phases and investigate what happens. At first, we put heavy-light mesons on some inhomogeneous phases and see the modification of their masses. In this case, heavy-light mesons carrying different spin and iso-spin mix each other. And this causes the mass splitting of heavy-light mesons, e.g., $D(0^-)$ and $D^*(1^-)$ degenerated in the vacuum. Furthermore, these splitting patterns reflect what kind of inhomogeneous phase occurs. Next, we show the dispersion relations for heavy-light mesons in the Chiral Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW is one of the inhomogeneous phases where scalar mode and neutral pseudo-scalar mode can condense. In this phase, potentials for heavy-light mesons are periodic, so that we have to employ the Bloch’s theorem to get the dispersion relations. Thereby, dispersion relations drastically change, i.e., the existence of the Brillouin zones and the emergence of collective modes.

using the 2+1 hydrodynamical code v-USPhydro [1] that includes bulk and shear viscosity effects (on an event by event basis) both in the hydrodynamic evolution and also at freeze-out. While shear viscosity is known to attenuate the flow harmonics, the inclusion of bulk viscosity
decreases the shear viscosity-induced suppression of the flow harmonics at RHIC bringing them closer
to their values in ideal hydrodynamical calculations [2]. 

In this talk, NeXuS initial conditions [3] are used to investigate not only how initial flow can alter the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma but also how different models for bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\zeta/s$, ranging from strong coupling holographic models to hadron gas+lattice calculations, can be used to determine the sensitivity of current hydrodynamic modelling to temperature dependent transport coefficients. We find that flow harmonic data at RHIC can only be adequately described with viscous hydrodynamics [4] if the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma is two to three times as large as the AdS/CFT viscosity bound.

The physical interpretation of the scaling exponent is in the small-x behaviour of the parton densities. The most thrilling consequence, however, is the resulting extremely simple scaling law for the lepton charge asymmetry which also relates measurements in different collision systems. For example, this allows an almost-direct comparison of measurements in p-p and p-Pb or in p-Pb and Pb-Pb, pairwise, even if the center-of-mass energies would be different! The expectations are contrasted with the existing data and a very good overall agreement is indeed found. The understanding of the underlying physics allows us to make very accurate predictions for upcoming LHC measurements and we also propose a precision observable to be measured.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emilien', 'last_name': 'Chapon', 'fullName': 'Chapon, Emilien', 'id': '933698', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR)', 'emailHash': '3b079887dfa41b7b92831bbff9553fe0', 'db_id': 933698, 'person_id': 998774}"

In this work as a mean to approach this problem we study fermion production under a background electromagnetic field at real time. Using a simple enough time profile for such external electromagnetic field, allows us to define a proper Bogoliubov transformation between in and out states. In this way, we take on the problem of fermion production by numerically evolving the wave functions in real time and computing the proper observables, we obtained the net currents produced. In particular, the chiral magnetic effect is simulated considering finite parallel electric and magnetic components, exploring thus, its CP-odd domain.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation Evolution in Au+Au Collisions at FAIR energy,"Ahmad, Shabir","University of Kashmir, Srinagar J&K India",Unknown,"Event by event fluctuations of particle multiplicities and their ratios are considered to be sensitive probes to the exotic phenomena in high energy heavy ion collisions like phase transtion or the occurence of critical point. These phenomena might take place at different time after the collision based on fulfilling the required conditions at a particular time. Fluctuations are therefore expected to show non-monotonic behaviour at the of time of occurence of these phenomena. Experimentally, fluctuations are measured at freezeout. In this work, using the hybrid version of the UrQMD event generator, we have investigated the propagation of fluctuations of particle multiplicities, their ratios and the ratio of total positive and negative charges in AuAu collisions at E$_{lab} < $ 90 AGeV. Two commonly used experimental measures i.e., $\sigma^2$/mean and $\nu_{dyn}$ have been used in the analysis in a given acceptance. The hybrid model, i.e., UrQMD with hydrodynamic evolution has been used to  study the effect of hydrodynamic evolution on these conventional fluctuation measures. It is observed that the fluctuations as measured by $\sigma^2$/mean and $\nu_{dyn}$ gets reduced considerably at freezeout. The dominat structures present at the initial stage of the evolution get smoothen out. However, the energy dependence of the fluctuations remain preserved till the freezeout. The hydrodynamic evolution of the model with chiral equation of state shows considerably higher fluctuation at lower collision energy as compared to pure hadronic transport version or the hybrid version with hadronic equation of state. The time evolution of the higher order moments of net-proton distributios for particles in a specified coverage showed similar behaviour.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shabir', 'last_name': 'Ahmad', 'fullName': 'Ahmad, Shabir', 'id': '933707', 'affiliation': 'University of Kashmir, Srinagar J&K India', 'emailHash': '803ce7a755fc0aca1436bc7282388e50', 'db_id': 933707, 'person_id': 999215}"
Poster Session,poster,Chiral mirror-baryon-meson model and nuclear matter beyond mean-field,"Weyrich, Johannes",Technical University Darmstadt,Unknown,"We describe the liquid-gas transition of nuclear matter together with chiral symmetry restoration in the high baryon-density phase considering a chiral baryon-meson model for nucleons and their parity partners in mirror assignment interacting with pions, sigma and omega mesons. 
The model is known to provide a phenomenologically successful description of nuclear matter properties within the mean-field approximation. Here, we go beyond this approximation and include mesonic fluctuations by means of the functional renormalization group. 
We concentrate on cold nuclear matter in the vicinity of the  nuclear-matter transition but also consider finite temperatures to study the full phase diagram of the model.
While including beyond mean-field fluctuations does not lead to major qualitative changes in the phase diagram of the model, in the vacuum one is no longer free to adjust the parameters so as to reproduce the binding energy per nucleon, the nuclear saturation density, and the nucleon sigma term all at the same time.
However, the prediction of a clear first-order chiral transition at low temperatures inside the high baryon-density phase appears to be robust.
Moreover, combining an extended mean-field approximation for the grand potential in the vacuum with thermal fluctuations at finite density provides a promising approach to explore the phenomenological consequences of the chiral transition of this model inside the high baryon-density phase for an equation of state of neutron matter and the mass-radius relation of neutron stars.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Johannes', 'last_name': 'Weyrich', 'fullName': 'Weyrich, Johannes', 'id': '933712', 'affiliation': 'Technical University Darmstadt', 'emailHash': '8353ef800205e5a7d0cd92850b4b0251', 'db_id': 933712, 'person_id': 999219}"
Poster Session,poster,Energy Dependence of Moments of Net-Kaon Multiplicity Distributions at STAR,"Xu, Ji",Central China Normal University / Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,USA,"One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program is to study the QCD phase structure, including the search for the critical point, over a wide range of the collision energy. Theoretical calculations predict that fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon number (B), charge (C), and strangeness (S), are sensitive to the correlation length $[1]$ of the dynamical system. Experimentally, higher moments of multiplicity distributions have been utilized to search for the QCD critical point and extract freeze-out conditions $[2]$ in heavy-ion collisions.

  The STAR Collaboration has published moments of net-proton and net-charge multiplicity distributions $[3]$. In this talk, we will report recent efficiency corrected cumulants and higher moments of the net-kaon multiplicity distributions at mid-rapidity ($|y|<0.5$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4$, and $200$ GeV obtained from the first phase of the RHIC BES program. The collision energy and centrality dependence of cumulants up to the fourth order, as well as their ratios, will be shown. Furthermore, we will also present studies of their rapidity and pT dependence. The comparisons with baseline calculations (Poisson, NBD) and non-critical point models (UrQMD, AMPT) will also be discussed.

Besides, we present a variety of predictions for the nuclear suppression as function of transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass of the lepton pair that can be verified by experiments at RHIC and LHC. We found that the nuclear suppression is caused predominantly by effects of quantum coherence (shadowing corrections) and by the effective energy loss induced by multiple initial state interactions. Whereas the former dominates at small Bjorken x2 in the target, the latter turns out to be significant at large x1 in the projectile beam and is universal at different energies and transverse momenta.

The measurement is focused on the pT-integrated observables dominated by particles with low transverse momenta (pT< 2 GeV) and thus sensitive to the hydrodynamic response of the medium to the fluctuating initial conditions. The full potential of the ATLAS detector inner tracker is exploited, including charged particle track reconstruction at very low transverse momentum (pT > 100 MeV). To reduce uncertainties due to low efficiency and high fake rate, affecting especially particles with lowest transverse momenta, a unique data set of Pb+Pb collisions recorded with the solenoid magnet switched off is also used. A simplified tracking is performed to reconstruct two-point pixel tracklets with estimated minimum pT as low as 70 MeV. The event plane and scalar product methods are also used to measure v2 of KS0. The topological reconstruction of the KS0 →π+π− decay in the ATLAS inner detector is used to measure KS0 elliptic flow in a wide range of transverse momentum and in the central rapidity region (|y|<1) as a function of collision centrality.",

Poster Session,poster,Heavy hadron systems in a magnetic field,"Suzuki, Kei",Tokyo Institute of Technology,Unknown,"Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in a strong magnetic field is one of the most exciting topics in hadron physics. In relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments performed in RHIC and LHC, it is predicted to be produced a strong magnetic field by non-central collision of charged nuclei. In particular, hadron properties under such external field can be drastically modified by perturbative and non-perturbative effects. 

In this study, we investigate theoretically the properties of heavy hadrons (especially, D mesons) including a charm quark in a magnetic field by using some theoretical approaches such as the QCD sum rules and effective models. 
From our approaches, we can predict the D meson mass shifts by magnetic effects such as the Landau level for a charged particle, the mixing effect between different hadron states and magnetic field dependence of condensates. Technically, in the QCD sum rules, the OPE up to the order of the square of magnetic field is calculated and the magnetic field dependences of condensates are taken from the recent results of lattice QCD or effective field theory. For the phenomenological side, we introduce a new structures induced by a magnetic field to go beyond the analysis by (conventional) ``pole + continuum"" assumption.

As a result, we discuss some magnetic properties of the hadrons induced by a magnetic field, such as Landau level of the charged meson, mixing effect with other hadron states and magnetic field dependence of QCD condensates.

Poster Session,poster,Initial State fluctuations in ultra-central collisions in an event-by-event transport approach,"Plumari, Salvatore",University of Catania (Italy),Unknown,"We discuss the generation of anisotropic flows $v_n$ for a fluid at fixed $\eta/s(T)$ by means of an 
event-by-event transport approach. Such an approach, as shown in [1], recovers the universal features 
of the ideal hydrodynamics showing an agreement with the recent analitical solutions.
We discuss the effect of the $\eta/s$ and its temperature dependence on the 
build up of the $v_n(p_T)$ revealing that only in ultra-central collisions ($0-0.2\%$) the $v_n(p_T)$ have a stronger sensitivity to the T dependence of $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase and this sensitivity increases with 
the order of the harmonic n. 
Moreover, the study of the correlations between the initial spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$ and the final 
flow coefficients $v_n$ shows that at LHC energies there is more correlation than at RHIC energies. 
The degree of correlation increases from peripheral to central collisions, but only in ultra-central 
collisions at LHC, we find that the linear correlation coefficent $C(n,n) \approx 1$ for $n=2,3,4$ and $5$. This suggests that 
the final correlations in the ($v_n$,$v_m$) space reflect the initial correlations in the ($\epsilon_n$,$\epsilon_m$) space. 
Moreover the recent event shape engineering (ESE) [4]  tecnique allows to have a new insight into the initial state fluctuations and $\epsilon_n$ correlations [5].
Finally, we discuss in ultra-central collisions the structure of the integrated ($v_n,n$) plot and its relation with the

Poster Session,poster,Determining eta/s in Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and below via a statistical analysis of a hybrid model,"Auvinen, Jussi",Duke University,USA,"Transport + hydrodynamics approach has proved to be successful in describing the particle spectra and elliptic flow in the heavy ion collisions at the collision energy range investigated in RHIC beam energy scan. However, it has been difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the chosen values of input parameters, due to the massive amount of computational resources required for evaluating all possible input parameter combinations. A way to reduce the computational effort is to run a set of simulations for semi-random, space-filling selection of points in parameter space, and then use an emulator trained on this data to predict the output for arbitrary input. Gaussian processes are an attractive choice for the emulator, as they are very flexible and predict probability distributions with quantitative uncertainty.

In this study, we investigate the input parameters, including the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\eta/s$, of the UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model[1]. Focusing on Au+Au collisions at the higher end of the RHIC beam energy scan energy range, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ and $39$ GeV, we determine the most probable parameter values and their uncertainties using the state-of-the-art statistical analysis based on Bayesian statistics. Following the methods described in [2,3], the probability distributions for the parameters are produced by calibrating the model to experimental data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, utilizing Gaussian processes to emulate the hybrid model behavior for uninvestigated input values. The results illustrate how much the input parameters are constrained by a given set of observables and reveal the correlations between the parameters.

Models provide some insight into the phase structure but usually rely on various parameters and therefore require validation from the point of view of the fundamental theory.

Poster Session,poster,Crystalline chiral condensates in an external magnetic field,"Nisihiyama, Kazuya",Kyoto university,Unknown,"We study the QCD phase diagram by the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the mean-field approach, taking into account both of the magnetic field and inhomogeneity of the chiral condensates.
For the analysis of the chiral inhomogeneous phase, the generalized chiral condensate $\Delta := -2G\left[\left<\overline\psi\psi\right>+i\left<\overline\psi i\gamma^5\tau^3\psi\right>\right]$ is used.
The dual chiral density wave (DCDW) and the real kink crystal (RKC) have been commonly used as typical form of the chiral condensate: DCDW is a plane wave configuration, $\Delta(x) =me^{iqx}$, and RKC is a multi-soliton configuration, $ \Delta(x)
=\frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left( \frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}},
\nu\right) $.
 The thermodynamic properties of the DCDW phase in the magnetic field has been studied by Frolov et al., and it has been shown that the DCDW phase develops in the wide density region in the presence of the magnetic field.
 However, they have only considered DCDW, while it has been suggested that the RKC phase may be favored without the external magnetic field.

Here we figure out the properties of the chiral inhomogeneous condensate in the presence of external magnetic field, taking into account the possibility of the RKC phase. We introduce a hybrid configuration (HCC) which has the feature of both DCDW and RKC,
$
 \Delta(x) = \frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left(
\frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}},\nu \right)e^{iqz}$, to this end.
Note that it smoothly connects both configurations by changing modulus $\nu$.
There never appears the pure RKC phase, and DCDW and RKC coexist as HCC in the weak magnetic field at moderate density.
Eventually DCDW becomes most favorable in the strong magnetic field.
It is also shown that there is a first order phase transition between inhomogeneous phases in the presence of magnetic field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazuya', 'last_name': 'Nisihiyama', 'fullName': 'Nisihiyama, Kazuya', 'id': '933807', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto university', 'emailHash': 'e4baa09ad2cb9e9b91bcc3a0209f3507', 'db_id': 933807, 'person_id': 998696}"

There are many proposals for pinning down the underlying mechanics for it. Immediately after a collision, which is a crucial stage of the problem, strong gluon field is dominant and quantum fluctuations on the top of the classical configurations (glasma) induce instabilities. It may trigger the chaotic behavior of the gauge field and eventually give rise to entropy production. In this work, we investigate thermalization of glasma by using the Husimi-Wehrl (H-W) entropy defined by Husimi function which is a coarse-grained quantum distribution function. We calculate the semi-classical time evolution of the Husimi function and the H-W entropy in Yang-Mills field theory with two numerical methods based on Monte-Carlo method, and also discuss the time scale of the entropy growth.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hidekazu', 'last_name': 'Tsukiji', 'fullName': 'Tsukiji, Hidekazu', 'id': '933810', 'affiliation': 'Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University', 'emailHash': '7b20c7c2bcc922df1fff35e71a3c8ffd', 'db_id': 933810, 'person_id': 999272}"
Poster Session,poster,Collective flow in event-by-event partonic transport plus hydrodynamics hybrid approach,"Bhalerao, Rajeev",TIFR,Unknown,"Complete evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied within a coupled Boltzmann and relativistic viscous hydrodynamics approach [1]. For the initial non-equilibrium evolution phase, we employ A MultiPhase Transport model that explicitly includes event-by-event fluctuations in the number and positions of the participating nucleons as well as of the produced partons with subsequent parton transport. The ensuing near-equilibrium evolution of quark-gluon and hadronic matter is modeled within the (2+1)D relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. (1) We probe the role of parton dynamics in generating and maintaining the spatial anisotropy in the pre-equilibrium phase. Substantial spatial eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ are found to be generated in the process of parton production from initial NN collisions. (2) For ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, the model is able to explain qualitatively the unexpected hierarchy of the flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-6)$ observed at LHC. (3) We find that the results for $v_n(p_T)$ are rather insensitive to the variation (within a range) of the time of switchover from AMPT parton transport to hydrodynamic evolution. (4) The usual Grad and the recently proposed Chapman-Enskog-like single-particle distribution functions are found to give very similar results for $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-4)$. (5) The model describes well both the RHIC and LHC data for $v_n(p_T)$ at various centralities, with a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio 0.08 and 0.12, respectively. (6) The event-by-event distributions of $v_{2,3}$ are in good agreement with the LHC data for mid-central collisions. The linear response relation $v_n = k_n \varepsilon_n$ is found to be true for $n=2,3$, except at large values of $\varepsilon_n$, where a larger value of $k_n$ is required, suggesting a small admixture of positive nonlinear response even for $n=2,3$.

Poster Session,poster,Energy and centrality dependence of identified particle elliptic flow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Shi, Shusu",CCNU,Unknown,"The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at the RHIC facility was initiated in
the year 2010 to study the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase
diagram[1]. In the years 2010, 2012 and 2014 the STAR experiment
recorded Au + Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6,
27, 39, and 62.4 GeV within a pseudo rapidity range of |\eta|< 1.
Recently reported results from identified particle elliptic flow in
minimum bias (0–80%) collisions revealed an energy dependent
difference in elliptic flow between particles and antiparticles [2].
This difference is increasing with decreasing collision energy and is
almost identical for all baryons. These observations attracted various
theory groups, that tried to reproduce the results with different
assumptions in their model calculations [3].

In this talk, we present the elliptic flow of identified particle for
three centrality classes in Au + Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 -
62.4 GeV. The centrality dependence and the data at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 14.5
GeV are new. Except at the lowest beam energies, we observe a similar
relative v2 baryon-meson splitting for all centrality classes which is
in agreement within 15% with the number-of-constituent quark scaling.
The larger v2 for most particles relative to antiparticles, already
observed for minimum bias collisions shows a clear centrality
dependence, with the largest difference in the most central collisions.
The new beam energy (14.5 GeV) and centrality dependence would be useful
to distinguish between the different models or to improve their input
parameters.

Poster Session,poster,PHENIX Results on Excited Charmonia Production at Forward and Backward Rapidity,"Durham, J.

The exact mechanism behind this difference in suppression is not immediately clear.  Since all primordial charm quark production is subject to similar initial state effects inside the nucleus, and the time the $c \bar{c}$ pair spends in the nucleus is so short, it may be that interactions outside the nucleus with co-moving particles are partially responsible for the disruption of the charmonium wavefunction.  Therefore it is interesting to study charmonium production at forward and backward rapidity, where the co-moving particle density varies considerably between the Au-going and $p$-going directions.  The introduction of the Forward Silicon Vertex Tracker (FVTX) in front of the PHENIX muons arms has improved the dimuon mass resolution such that the $\psi(2s)$ peak can now be distinguished from the $J/\psi$ peak and measured at forward and backward rapidity.

In the quark coalescence picture of particle production, the baryon formation probability can be influenced by these local parton density fluctuations that lead to clustering and voids in the distribution of hadrons in the phase space. We propose to use the normalized distribution of produced particles in coarse azimuthal angular bins to study the fluctuations. The shape of the normalized distribution is expected to be sensitive to clustering in the phase space. We use Poisson and Binomial distributions to generate reference comparisons. Clustering of particles is introduced empirically in the Monte Carlo to investigate the sensitivity of various moments of the normalized distribution. We compare our Monte Carlo results with the STAR Beam Energy Scan data to demonstrate deviations from Poisson/Binomial distributions and the sensitivity of our approach to possible clustering and parton density fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Roli', 'last_name': 'Esha', 'fullName': 'Esha, Roli', 'id': '933860', 'affiliation': 'University of California - Los Angeles', 'emailHash': '83ca9cd23acd3a0b42fc9ee157ae4851', 'db_id': 933860, 'person_id': 999298}"

Poster Session,poster,STAR Au + Au Fixed Target Results,"Meehan, Kathryn",UC Davis,Unknown,"The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program was proposed to look for the turn-off of signatures of the quark gluon plasma (QGP), search for a possible QCD critical point, and study the nature of the phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter. The results from the NA49 experiment at CERN have been used to claim that the onset of deconfinement occurs at a collision energy around a center-of-mass energy of 7 GeV, the low end of the BES range [1]. Data from lower energies are needed to test if this onset occurs. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES II with the same detector to energies that are likely below the onset of deconfinement. Currently, STAR has inserted a gold target into the beam pipe and conducted test runs at center-of-mass energies 3.9 and 4.5 GeV. Tests have been done with both Au and Al beams. First physics results from a Coulomb analysis of Au + Au fixed-target collisions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments, will be presented. These results demonstrate that STAR has good particle identification capabilities in this novel detector setup. Furthermore, the Coulomb potential, which is sensitive to the Z of the projectile and degree of baryonic stopping, will be compared with published results from the AGS. Additional results and comparisons will be presented if available.

We argue that the trace anomaly peak and the local minimum of the generalized specific volume observed   
at a laboratory energy of 11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of   
a mixed phase between the QGP and the hadron phase. This is also supported by an independent meta-analysis [3]: we compare the quality of hadron spectra and multiplicities description from 10 different models in the range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from 2.1 GeV to 17.3 GeV and find that at 5-10.8 GeV and above 12 GeV models assuming QGP perform notably better, while at 4.4­-4.87 GeV and 10.8­-12 GeV QGP models perform as good as purely hadron ones.

Measurements of Non-Photonic Electron (NPE) production from open heavy flavor hadron decays have revealed strong suppression at large transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Such suppression has been attributed to energy losses of heavy flavor quarks within the QGP. Theoretical predictions that are able to describe existing NPE data suggest that bottom quarks lose less energy than charm quarks, but it varies among models how exactly they differ. Therefore it is important to experimentally constrain such model calculations, which can further improve our understanding of parton interactions with the QGP and the QGP properties. Electrons from bottom hadron decays can be statistically separated thanks to the long lifetime of the bottom hadrons by comparison of the impact parameter distributions.

The PHENIX Collaboration has previously measured open heavy flavor production via the yields of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The results indicate a significant suppression of the combined charm and bottom decay electrons for $p_T>5$ GeV/$c$, but by themselves provide little constraint on the modification of the separate parent hadron distributions. The installation of the PHENIX silicon vertex detector in 2011 allowed for the measurement of the displaced vertex of these electrons for the first time at RHIC. In order to separate the contributions from charm and bottom hadrons, Bayesian unfolding techniques can be applied to the $p_T$ and displaced vertex dependence of the yield of electrons from open heavy flavor decays. This separation provides further constraints on energy loss and transport mechanisms in the medium produced in heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Spectral function analysis of the hydrodynamical mode around the QCD critical point with use of functional renormalization group,"Yokota, Takeru","Kyoto University, Japan",Unknown,"One of the unique points of QCD phase diagram is the existence of QCD critical point (CP), which is the end point of the phase boundary of the first-order chiral transition at low temperature. It is noteworthy that the phase transition turns to a second order at the CP, where fluctuations of some physical quantities should be divergent in the system with infinite degrees of freedom. People are thus interested in identifying such physical quantities which divergent behavior can be nicely detectable in experiment. It has been suggested that the soft modes at the QCD CP are hydrodynamical modes such as the baryon density fluctuation (particle-hole excitation) and entropy fluctuation, using RPA analysis of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory [1, 2]. A notable point is that these modes are coupled to the scalar mode or the fluctuating mode of the chiral order parameter at finite chemical potential off the chiral limit. We examine whether this suggestion remain valid even when the thermodynamic fluctuations are fully taken into account. For this purpose, we calculate the spectral function of the collective modes coupled to the scalar mode using functional renormalization group. We employ the quark-meson model and set spatial momentum finite to investigate particle-hole excitations. On the basis of the numerical calculation of the spectral function around the QCD CP, we explore possible development and softening of the collective modes in the space-like as well as the time-like region.

The CBM experiment aims at understanding and characterizing nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities but moderate temperatures focussing on the investigation of rare probes as for example electromagnetic radiation.
The major detector for clean electron identification in the CBM experiment at SIS 100 will be a RICH detector using CO${_2}$ as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors with reflective Al+MgF${_2}$ coating as focusing elements and a photodetector plane consisting of an array of H12700 MAPMTs from Hamamatsu.

The testbeam evaluations included a detailed study of layers of wavelength-shifting films for enhanced UV sensitivity and the development of MAPMT readout. Several MAPMT sensors were tested in this setup but also for radiation hardness in separate experimental campaigns with thermal neutron and gamma irradiation. As result the H12700 sensor was ordered from Hamamatsu in spring 2015. First delivery is expected for autumn 2015.

Poster Session,poster,Technique for Performing High Accuracy Forward-Backward Multiplicity Correlation Measurements,"Gulbrandsen, Kristjan",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"Forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements are used to study the soft component of high energy collisions. The observable is sensitive to the dynamics of the collision and is relatively less affected by the following hadronization processes. In proton-proton collisions, forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements allow one to study the underlying event while, in heavy-ion collisions, they can provide insight into effects such as gluon saturation. 

The measurement requires one to determine the variances of and covariance between the forward and backward multiplicities. Realistic detector effects such as acceptance and efficiency alter the required measured quantities. Exactly how these quantities are altered is neither straightforward nor intuitive compelling one to use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unaltered values. However, the robustness of using Monte Carlo simulations is difficult to determine as they depend on the initial assumptions.

A Monte Carlo independent technique to determine multiplicity correlation measurements which accounts for acceptance and efficiency is presented here. The goal is to allow one to perform these measurements while minimizing measurement bias and allowing one to exploit the full capability of their detector (full acceptance and largest pseudorapidity separations), where one may otherwise limit the acceptance with a fiducial cut. Larger separations and highest accuracy provide the maximum ability to distinguish between various models implementing different mechanisms for particle production.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kristjan', 'last_name': 'Gulbrandsen', 'fullName': 'Gulbrandsen, Kristjan', 'id': '933888', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '783a504216987a0fd2b56675c12b34ee', 'db_id': 933888, 'person_id': 999316}"

In this talk, we explore thermodynamic properties of a model of quarks with soft BRST breaking for arbitrary temperatures and quark chemical potentials. This model is expected to describe the infrared properties of confined quarks, while keeping compatibility with ultraviolet QCD properties. Indeed, the analytical propagator of the model displays positivity violation and fits well the available lattice data. The model has been also proven to be renormalizable, reducing to perturbative quarks in the ultraviolet regime. Our goal here is to show not only that confinement in the form of positivity violation in the quark sector implies a well-defined macroscopic behaviour, but also that the tree level model is capable of predicting nontrivial features, being in general qualitatively compatible with the effect of nonperturbative interactions as observed in lattice data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leticia', 'last_name': 'Palhares', 'fullName': 'Palhares, Leticia', 'id': '933890', 'affiliation': 'UERJ', 'emailHash': 'f6a96b4e21b7213378dbf839b602fa91', 'db_id': 933890, 'person_id': 999318}"

The dynamical energy loss formalism is shown to be able to accurately explain suppression measurements at 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [1,2]. With the upcoming LHC measurements at notably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences, with respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. We will concentrate on light and heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb collisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably (∼30% ) larger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to the estimated (significant) energy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly, more detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these two energies; note that this prediction is in agreement with the similar suppression patterns observed for light flavor observables at lower beam energies at RHIC and LHC. We will show that this unexpected result is due to interplay of the following two effects [3], which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of the initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii) significantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss. Therefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear (qualitative and quantitative) test of the dynamical energy loss formalism.

Poster Session,poster,Photon flow harmonics $v_n$ with chemical equilibration and non-ideal gas distribution,"Monnai, Akihiko",RIKEN BNL Research Center,USA,"Elliptic flow $v_2$ of direct photons are found to be larger than those from most hydrodynamic estimations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is recognized as the ""photon $v_2$ puzzle"". The recent discovery of large triangular flow $v_3$ hints that this is at least partially due to the medium properties. Theoretical explanation of the photon data should be essential for understanding the dynamical properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

We discuss enhancement of direct photon flow harmonics due to (i) quark chemical equilibration [1] and (ii) in-medium corrections to phase-space distributions [2], both of which modify the photon emission rate. The former scenario is motivated by the observation that chemical equilibration can be slower than thermalization in the transition from the gluon-rich color glass condensate to the QGP [3]. In the latter scenario, we consider non-ideal gas distributions using a quasi-particle picture so that they reproduce the equation of state from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD. Both mechanisms reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom for the quark distribution. This suppresses early photons with smaller anisotropy, leading to larger anisotropy in total direct photons. 

We use a hydrodynamic model to numerically estimate thermal photon $v_2$ and $v_3$ with and without the above effects. The calculations show visible enhancement of the photon flow harmonics. Quadrangular ($v_4$) and pentagonal ($v_5$) flow are also estimated as theoretical guides to quantify possible anomalous enhancement of anisotropy.

Once produced, these photons will not interact strongly with the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions, providing a calibrated measure of the pre-energy loss properties of the opposing parton and giving unique insight into how jets interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). To understand the observed modification to jets opposite a direct photon, it is necessary to make similar base-line measurements within a reference system. Previously this was done using p+p collisions, however cold nuclear matter effects may also play a role, making similar baseline measurements in d(p)$+$A important. Additionally, recent results from d$+$Au and p$+$Pb suggest that there may be medium-like effects present, making clean measurements of the initial parton energy in a hard scattering crucial. We present the most recent results for direct photon-hadron correlations in d$+$Au from PHENIX.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ali', 'last_name': 'Hanks', 'fullName': 'Hanks, Ali', 'id': '933911', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '212c81ea2a1d0e9ee69671bf90779e7d', 'db_id': 933911, 'person_id': 999327}"
Poster Session,poster,Latest developments in anisotropic hydrodynamics,"Tinti, Leonardo",Jan Kochanowski University,Unknown,"In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions nuclear matter is heated to a temperature exceeding that necessary to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Traditionally, second order viscous hydrodynamics has been used to reproduce the soft collective flow of the QGP and hadronic spectra; however, due to rapid longitudinal expansion in the early stages of evolution, the system may possess substantial pressure anisotropies which are a consequence of large viscous corrections, even for small shear viscosity over entropy ratios.

These large corrections violate the viscous hydrodynamics assumption of small deviation from local equilibrium. They may lead to unphysical results, and, comparing to the exact 0+1 solutions of the Boltzmann equation, they often badly reproduce the longitudinal pressure (especially for initial stages) and provide the wrong asymptotic behavior.

In order to more accurately treat systems possessing large pressure anisotropies, a new approach called anisotropic hydrodynamics was recently developed. In this approach, the pressure anisotropy is treated in a non perturbative manner at the leading order in the hydrodynamic expansion. In previous works simplifying symmetries were considered in order to extract the leading order of of anisotropic hydrodynamics, like longitudinal boost invariance, or cylindrically symmetric radial expansion. The equations have been extended to the 3+1-dimensional expansion, however in the first attempt it were not possible to fully recover the very good agreement with the exact solutions of the Boltzmann equation. We present the very latest prescription, which is lacking any symmetry constraint on the space-time evolution, it is fully consistent with second order hydrodynamics in the close-to-equilibrum limit, and it is providing an unprecedented agreement with the exact solutions in the 0+1 dimensional expansion, comparing to other leading order prescriptions and second order viscous hydrodynamics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leonardo', 'last_name': 'Tinti', 'fullName': 'Tinti, Leonardo', 'id': '933912', 'affiliation': 'Jan Kochanowski University', 'emailHash': '8dac539203aad13c6fa6ff61c5cad3fd', 'db_id': 933912, 'person_id': 999328}"
Poster Session,poster,Non-perturbative Approach to Open Heavy Flavor in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,"He, Min",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,Unknown,"We evaluate open heavy-flavor (HF) transport in relativistic heavy-ion 
collisions utilizing a strong-coupling treatment for both macro- and 
micro-dynamics of the problem [1]. The former is realized through a 
hydrodynamic evolution quantitatively constrained by bulk-hadron spectra 
and elliptic flow. The HF transport is based on non-perturbative $T$-matrix
calculations of heavy-light parton scattering in the Quark-Gluon Plasma 
(QGP) [2], yielding a diffusion coefficient consistent with lattice QCD, 
and on effective interactions of $D$-mesons with light hadrons in hadronic 
matter [3]. The $T$-matrix interactions in the QGP lead to resonance 
formation close to $T_c$ which are implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface, providing a seamless treatment of HF interactions throughout the bulk-medium evolution. We deploy this 
framework for a comprehensive study of open HF observables from 
62-2760 GeV [4,5,6]. A fair description of current experimental data for the 
nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$, $D_s$, $B$ mesons and 
HF leptons emerges at low and intermediate transverse momenta $p_T$. Discrepancies arise toward high $p_T$, which allows us to determine the onset of radiative energy loss processes.

Poster Session,poster,Systematic searches for the chiral magnetic effect and chiral vortical effect using identified particles at RHIC/STAR,"Wen, Liwen",UCLA,Unknown,"QCD allows for chirality imbalance as a consequence of the vacuum transition$[1]$.  When coupled with the strong magnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions, the chirality imbalance in local domains can lead to electric charge separation along the magnetic field direction, manifested as the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, an analogous effect, the chiral vortical effect(CVE)$[2]$ was also theorized, in which the vorticity of the collision system replaces the magnetic field, and a baryonic charge separation appears instead of the electric charge separation. This would result in a distinct hierarchy in the particle dependent correlation magnitudes: $proton-K_s^0$ (no CME/CVE), $proton-\pi^{\pm}$ (CME only), $proton-\Lambda$ (dominated by CVE), and $proton-proton$ (both CME and CVE). In order to explore this physics, we report correlation measurements for these identified particle pairs in Au+Au at 200GeV with the STAR detector. The physics backgrounds due to collective flow$[3]$ and resonance decays are evaluated.

In addition, the measurements to search for the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral magnetic wave will also be presented for Au+Au at 14.5 GeV, which completes the Phase I of the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC.

That analysis uncovered puzzling new features in the detailed rapidity dependence of these correlations. We present new work on correlation observables computed using the second order Israel-Stewart hydrodynamics with stochastic noise and latest lattice QCD equations of state and transport coefficients.

Precision calculations of jet substructure observables will thus become the key to extracting the medium properties. Jet shapes and jet fragmentation functions give the transverse and longitudinal energy profiles inside jets and are sensitive to the jet formation mechanism in the medium. In this talk we will demonstrate the resummation of jet shapes at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. This is the first time phase space logarithms in this observable are resummed using renormalization group techniques. We will then present the calculation of jet shape modification in heavy ion collisions caused by Glauber gluon interactions in the background QGP medium. The study of jet shape modification is closely related to the calculation of jet energy loss. Taken together, these observables provide a comprehensive description of the energy distribution of the in-medium parton shower. We will show first results for the modifications of jets beyond the soft gluon emission limit for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and present predictions for the 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb run.

In Pb--Pb collisions, a strong suppression of heavy-flavour yields has been observed at high $p_{\rm T}$ with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions which is attributed to energy loss of heavy quarks in the QCD medium.
Further information about energy-loss mechanism can be obtained by measuring the production of jets containing charm and beauty.
In ALICE, inclusive jet production has been measured for $p_{\rm{T}}>$ 20 GeV/$c$ in pp and Pb-Pb collisions.
Heavy-flavour jets can be identified via heavy-flavour decay electrons inside the jet cone.
In this poster, we show studies of heavy-flavour jet production tagged by electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays with ALICE.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shingo', 'last_name': 'Sakai', 'fullName': 'Sakai, Shingo', 'id': '934010', 'affiliation': 'Istituto Nazionale Fisica Nucleare Frascati (IT)', 'emailHash': '89e8cc2a271783654163d2b89562f9aa', 'db_id': 934010, 'person_id': 999374}"
Poster Session,poster,Transition from Multifragmentation to Flow in Relativistic Nuclear Collisions at CBM energies,"ARGINTARU, Danut",Constanta Maritime University,Unknown,"The CBM experiment aims the study of the QCD phase diagram at low temperatures and high baryonic densities, mainly to find out the order of the phase transition between hadrons and partons under these conditions. Between the many predictions about signals to detect the phase transition point: fluctuations [1], hydrodynamics [2], baryon-baryon correlations [3], etc., in our previous studies [4-5] we found as an interesting tool for the analysis of relativistic nuclear collisions: the “nuclear matter jets”. Having a non- partonic origin, the number of jets indicates the centrality of the collision, i.e. the amount of incident energy pumped into the system, and the jet-kinematic and dynamic properties allowed us to make assumptions about their origin. A liquid-gas nuclear phase transition was indicated by the disappearance of jets. At CBM energies, varying the projectile mass, we intend to study the evolution of the number and characteristics of nuclear matter jets when passing from the small projectile (p+Au) whose energy is converted into thermal energy leading to mutifragmentation, to a symmetric projectile (Au+Au) when flow is unleashed. For this, we made jetology studies on UrQMD and AMPT simulations (performed at the computing system YaPT from “Nuclear Matter in Extreme Conditions” Research Center – Faculty of Physics, Bucharest University)in the 4-25 A GeV incident energies range. We will extract the usefulness of the “nuclear matter jets” variable for relativistic nuclear collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Production of Muons from Heavy-Flavour Hadron Decays in Pb--Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC,"Zhang, Zuman","Central China Normal University CCNU (CN), Univ. Blaise Pascal Clermont-Fe. II (FR)",France,"The LHC heavy-ion physics program aims at investigating the properties of QCD matter at extremely large temperature and energy density, where the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are regarded as efficient probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a very short time scale in initial hard scattering processes and subsequently interact with the medium.

At high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), heavy-flavour yields are suppressed due to in-medium parton energy loss. This suppression is quantified by the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of the particle yield measured in Pb-Pb collisions to the cross section in pp collisions scaled with the average nuclear overlap function.

At low $p_{\rm T}$ the heavy-flavour azimuthal anisotropy provides insight into whether heavy quarks participate in the collective expansion of the medium, and at high $p_{\rm T}$ it carries information on the path-length dependence of parton energy loss.
The heavy-flavour azimuthal anisotropy is quantified via the measurement of the second order coefficient ($v_2$) of the Fourier expansion of particle azimuthal distributions, also called elliptic flow.

With ALICE, designed and optimised for the study of heavy-ion physics, we can measure open heavy flavours at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y< 4$)

They are primarily produced in hard scattering processes in the early stage of the collision, after which they experience the full evolution of the system. Previous measurements have shown that the production of prompt D mesons in central Pb--Pb collisions is strongly suppressed in comparison to binary-scaled pp collisions. This suppression may be interpreted as an energy loss of the heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium due to collisional and radiative processes. To obtain a more complete picture on the Pb--Pb results, an understanding of cold nuclear matter effects in the initial and final state such as modification of parton densities in nuclei, $k_{\rm T}$ broadening and energy loss in cold nuclear matter, is required. These effects are accessible in p--Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of D meson$-$charged particle azimuthal angular correlations in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Rajput, Sonia",University of Jammu (IN),India,"A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a general purpose heavy-ion experiment with the main goal of exploring the characteristics of the medium formed in high-energy nuclear collisions, composed of deconfined and strongly-interacting quarks and gluons (Quark-Gluon Plasma, QGP). Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are produced in the initial hard scatterings and interact with the medium constituents throughout its whole evolution. Therefore, they serve as sensitive probes to study the properties of the medium. 

The study of the angular correlation between D mesons and charged particles can provide relevant information on the processes by which heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and help to spot possible modifications of the charm parton shower and hadronisation induced by the presence of the medium. The measurement of this observable in pp collisions, besides furnishing the necessary reference for future Pb$-$Pb studies, is interesting to study the  fragmentation of charm quarks as well as their production mechanism providing a testing ground for perturbative QCD calculations. Data from p$-$Pb collisions are important to constrain possible modifications of the angular correlation pattern that could be induced by cold nuclear matter effects in the initial and final state of the nuclear collision.

In this contribution, we present the results of the measurement of azimuthal correlations between D mesons and charged particles using the data collected with ALICE in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. They are compared to the results obtained in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. D mesons were reconstructed from their hadronic decays at central rapidity ($|y| <$ 0.5) in the transverse momentum range 3 $<$ $p_{\rm T}(\rm D)$ $<$ 16 GeV/$c$ and were correlated with charged hadrons reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| <$ 0.8.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sonia', 'last_name': 'Rajput', 'fullName': 'Rajput, Sonia', 'id': '934005', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu (IN)', 'emailHash': '413609f7c3075230e89af95ef7e715f8', 'db_id': 934005, 'person_id': 999372}"
Poster Session,poster,Spontaneous magnetization of quark matter in the inhomogeneous chiral phase,"Yoshiike, Ryo",Kyoto university,Unknown,"Recently, a possible appearance of the inhomogeneous chiral phase has been extensionly studied by the use of the effective models of QCD like the NJL models. Here, we study the magnetic properties of the inhomogeneous chiral phase, taking the contribution of “dual chiral density wave (DCDW)” [1], where both scalar and pseudoscalar condensates are spatially modulated. We study the response of quark matter to a tiny external magnetic field to show the spontaneous magnetization in the DCDW phase. In an external magnetic field, the energy spectrum of quarks becomes asymmetric about zero in the lowest Landau level [2], and it gives rise to chiral anomaly [3].
   We find that this spectral asymmetry also gives rise to the spontaneous magnetization, since a new term linearly proportional to the magnetic field is induced in the thermodynamic potential. Furthermore, this spontaneous magnetization includes not only the contribution of chiral anomaly [4] but also one of valence quarks. Such spontaneous magnetization might be a candidate of the origin of the strong magnetic field in neutron stars.
   We also show the peculiar behavior of magnetic susceptibility at the ferromagnetic transition point: it never diverges unlike the usual ferromagnetic transition, which suggested a different mechanism of spontaneous magnetization from spin alignment.

Therefore, measurements of jets containing heavy-flavour hadrons can shed light on underlying QCD dynamics. Measurements of inclusive heavy-flavour cross sections do not allow to distinguish between different production mechanisms of heavy quarks (pair production, gluon splitting and flavour excitation). More exclusive studies using dijet events might provide further insight on the relevant production mechanisms.

Heavy-flavour dijets can be measured by tagging jets containing electrons originating from decays of heavy-flavour hadrons.

In this work, we present the current status and strategy for the measurement of the elliptic flow of neutral pions in mid and high pT range in Pb + Pb collisions at ALICE with Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal)[1].

Both photons and jets are excellent probes of QGP. Photons are produced during the different stages of the expansion of the initial hot matter fireball. They do not interact strongly with the medium and passing through it, they carry information on the properties of the matter at the space-time point of their emission. The direct photons are formed at the early stage of the collision in two processes: annihilation ($q \bar{q} \to g \gamma$) and Compton scattering ($qg \to q\gamma$). They enable a test of perturbative QCD constraining parton distributions and fragmentation functions. Moreover, they estimate the energy of correlated back-to-back jet.

A parton formed in the hard scattering at the early stage of the collision lose the energy when traversing the hot and dense matter and then fragments into a spray of particles called jet. Modification of the jet structure in medium compared to vacuum can provide hints to the properties of QGP.

Both direct photons and jets have been measured by the ALICE experiment at LHC. However, back-to-back correlation between photon and reconstructed jet in the ALICE experiment can be observed only with large statistics available in Run 2 due to the relatively small cross-section. Both the algorithm of selection of correlated gamma-jet events and prediction of the expected yield will be shown for both systems $pp$, Pb-Pb and p-Pb for available at LHC energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 13 TeV, 5 TeV and 5.02 TeV, respectively.

Important parameters that could be varied in these studies are the mass of the particles, their baryon number, and their strangeness content. Multi-strange baryons provide unique probes to test baryon/meson dynamics and strangeness equilibration. The transverse momentum spectra of $\Xi^-$ and $Xi^+$ at mid-rapidity are studied over a wide range of multiplicity in pp, pPb and PbPb systems using the CMS detector at LHC. The results are compared to the production of other strange mesons and baryons to study the baryon/meson differences and strangeness equilibration as a function of the multiplicity of final-state particles in different collision systems.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhoudunming', 'last_name': 'Tu', 'fullName': 'Tu, Zhoudunming', 'id': '934061', 'affiliation': 'Rice University (US)', 'emailHash': '36420c18f80ddec56eff31ea4e928c9a', 'db_id': 934061, 'person_id': 999393}"

Poster Session,poster,Quark coalescence from RHIC to LHC,"Greco, Vincenzo",University of Catania,Unknown,"In a coalescence plus independent fragmentation approach we calculate the $p_T$ spectra of the main hadrons $\pi,K, p, \bar p, \Lambda, \phi$ in a wide range of transverse momentum from low

We show that the approach correctly predicts the evolution of the $p_T$ spectra from RHIC to LHC energy and in particular the baryon-to-meson ratios $p/\pi, \bar p/\pi, \Lambda/K$ that reach a peak  value of the order of unit at $p_T \sim 3$ GeV, while  $p/\phi $ remains nearly constant showing the mass against the quark number effect in the coalescence process.
Recombination of minijet partons with the partons from the QGP is also included and plays a
role at $p_T \sim  2 − 5$ GeV where the baryon to meson anomaly is observed experimentally.
The more recent availability of experimental data up to $p_T \sim 10$ GeV for the spectra as well as for  $p/\pi$, $\bar p/\pi$, $\Lambda/K$ ratios allows to spot some lack of yield in a limited $p_T$ range around 6 GeV.
Finally, we discuss also the origin of a significant breaking of the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow $v_2$.

Based on this effective model, we discuss (i) how the ground state depends on quark mass, and (ii) why the phase transition at $\theta=\pi$ is present in both the chiral and the quenched limit.

Poster Session,poster,Anisotropic hydrodynamics for a mixture of quark and gluon fluids,"Maksymiuk, Ewa",Jan Kochanowski University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been a fundamental tool to understand the evolution of matter in heavy-ion experiments at RICH and LHC. Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing collective behavior and particle spectra, there are still theoretical shortcomings that may question the validity of the approach in heavy-ion experiments conditions. Large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion produce very large pressure corrections, in contrast to the founding hypothesis of small deviation from local equilibrium and the perturbative treatment viscous corrections. One way to address this problem is anisotropic hydrodynamics. Most of the theoretical investigations about hydrodynamics started from a kinetic underlying substrate of a single species of particles. Unfortunately the striking agreement of anisotropic hydrodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation was not preserved in the case of a mixtures of quarks and gluons.
We recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics prescription for massless particles in 1+1-dimensions to the case of mixtures of fluids, largely improving the agreement with the exact solutions compared to previous works [1-3]. We allow quarks and gluons to have different momentum scales during the evolution and a non vanishing baryon chemical potential. We take the dynamical equations from the zeroth, the first and the second moment of the Boltzmann equation [4]. We performed a test of the new formulation, comparing the results of anisotropic hydorodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for a mixture of fluid in the Bjorken flow limit, finding a very good agreement [5].

Poster Session,poster,Chiral magnetohydrodynamics from quantum field theory,"Hongo, Masaru",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamics is a low-energy effective theory which describes a long-distance and long-time behavior of many-body systems. It has been recently pointed out that quantum anomalies affect macroscopic transport properties and generate novel anomaly-induced transports. One example is the chiral magnetic effect, which represents the existence of a dissipationless vector current along the magnetic field and is expected to occur in heavy-ion collisions.

For the description of the anomaly-induced transport in the QGP, we have established formalism, so-called anomalous hydrodynamics, that captures effects of quantum anomalies. Since the QGP consists of electrically charged particles, it is necessary to consider a back reaction to electromagnetic fields in order to describe the space-time evolution of them together with that of the QGP. However, in the conventional anomalous hydrodynamics, electromagnetic fields are treated as external ones and the back reaction is neglected. Moreover, the magnitude of magnetic fields is assumed to be small. Therefore, we need to construct chiral magnetohydrodynamics in the strong magnetic field in order to assess the contribution from anomalous transports.

In this study, considering the recent development of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamics under strong magnetic fields from the underlying microscopic theory, that is, the quantum field theory. In order to derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation, we use a solid basis in our previous study on the derivation of the first-order hydrodynamics [1], in which we assume that the local Gibbs distribution is realized at initial time. As a result, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation with the the field theoretical expression of Green-Kubo formulas for the all transport coefficients.

One of the main results of heavy ions collision at relativistic energy experiments is the  very small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, close to the conjectured lower bound eta/s=1/4\pi for systems in the infinite coupling limit. Another key transport coefficient, but less studied than shear viscosity, is the electric conductivity that represents the response of a system to an applied external electric field.
In heavy Ion Collisions very high electromagnetic fields are expected to be generated with a decay time depending on the value of the electric conductivity and their impact on pressure isotropization depending on the \eta/s of the plasma.

We discuss the connection between shear viscosity and electric conductivity and explain why the ratio $(\eta/s)/(\sigma_{el}/T)$ supplies a measure of the quark to gluon scattering rates whose knowledge would allow to significantly advance in the understanding of the QGP phase.
We also predict that the ratio should increase near the critical temperature contrary to the flat behaviour predicted by  a conformal theory.
We show that $(\eta/s)/(\sigma_{el}/T)$, independently on the running coupling $\alpha_s(T)$, 
should increase up to about $\sim 20$ for $T \rightarrow T_c$, while it goes down to a nearly flat behavior around $\simeq 4$ for $T \geq 4\, T_c$.
Therefore we in general predict a stronger T dependence of $\sigma_{el}/T$ with respect to $\eta/s$ as $T\to T_c$.

Poster Session,poster,Nucleon-nucleon interactions within an extended linear sigma model,"Teilab, Khaled",Goethe-University Frankfurt,Unknown,"In the intermediate- and low-energy regime, hadrons (instead of quarks and gluons) are the relevant degrees of freedom. Their masses and interactions can be well described by effective approaches to QCD. The extended linear sigma model is an effective model based on chiral and dilatation symmetries (together with their explicit as well as spontaneous breaking). It includes (axial-) vector mesons in addition to (pseudo-) scalar ones, which turns out to be very successful in describing the mass spectrum and decay widths of mesons up to 1.7 GeV [1,2].

Moreover, including two baryon doublets in the so-called mirror assignment as suggested in [3] allows for introducing a chirally invariant mass term for baryons as well as the interaction with a low-mass four-quark field, related to the resonance $f_0$(500). Thus, the mass of the nucleon arises not solely from the chiral condensate, but also from the four-quark condensate [4,5,6].

The model has been used to describe elastic nucleon-nucleon collisions as well as inelastic nucleon-nucleon interactions involving the production of mesons and electromagnetic radiation. A comparison of the theoretical results with experimental data will be shown.

Among the sPHENIX detector, additional precision tracking inside the 1.5 tesla BaBar superconducting solenoid, as well as the currently operating PHENIX silicon vertex tracker, play a crucial role to reduce fake track contributions and improve the momentum resolution, thus leading to separation of the three $\Upsilon$ states and to separation of charm and bottom quarks.


A charged particle tracking system, consisting of two layers of the silicon pixel detectors and five layers of the silicon strip detectors placed circumferentially in the radial space from 2-80 cm, will perfectly satisfy the above requirements.

Poster Session,poster,Simulation studies of beauty-jet tagging in p--Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE,"Corrales Morales, Yasser",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are predominantly produced via initial hard parton scatterings in the early stages of hadronic collisions. Thus, they are ideal probes 
of the QCD matter since they lose energy by means of elastic scatterings and radiative 
processes while propagating through the strongly-interacting medium created in 
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. According to theoretical models, the parton energy 
loss is colour charge and parton mass dependent. In particular, it is expected that 
beauty quarks lose less energy than charm and light quarks. These dependencies can be 
studied by comparing the nuclear modification factor of beauty jets with that of charm 
or light-parton jets. The measurement of beauty-jet production in p-Pb collisions is 
needed to quantify cold nuclear matter effects, a fundamental step for the 
interpretation of Pb-Pb results.
 
  In this poster we present Monte Carlo based performance studies of beauty-jet 
tagging via displaced secondary vertex reconstruction, obtained with ALICE for p-Pb 
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The tagging technique, its 
performance in terms of efficiency and beauty jet selection purity, and the 
corrections required for measuring the cross section of beauty-jet production will 
be described.

Poster Session,poster,The curvature of the chiral phase transition line at small values of the quark chemical potentials,"Hegde, Prasad",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"One of the goals of the ongoing Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC is to look for evidence of the conjectured QCD Critical Point. The feasibility of detecting the critical point however depends on how close the QCD chiral phase transition line is to the freeze-out curve. In the two-flavor chiral limit, this transition is expected to be second-order at zero and  small values of $\mu$, the quark chemical potential. The critical temperature $T_c$ however, tends to decrease as $\mu$ is increased; this shift is characterized, for small values of $\mu$, by the curvature of the transition line $\kappa$. 

While the current lattice QCD results [1-5] on the curvature are significantly smaller than the phenomenological parametrization of the freeze-out line given by Cleymans and Redlich [6], it must be noted that they differ by more than a factor of two among themselves. In this talk, we will present an upper bound for the light and strange curvatures $\kappa_q$ through extrapolation to the chiral limit. We work in 2+1-flavor QCD and with five different pion masses between 80 MeV $\leq m_\pi \leq$ 160 MeV. Our new results improve on our earlier result [1], both by working at a smaller lattice spacing and through the use of the HISQ action, which has considerably smaller cutoff effects than the actions that were previously used.

Poster Session,poster,Future measurements of vector mesons in nucleus at J-PARC,"Ozawa, Kyoichiro",University of Tokyo (JP),Unknown,"Mass spectra of vector mesons attract wide interest in high energy heavy ion physics and hadron physics in the point of view of restoration of chiral symmetry and hadron mass. The mass spectra of vector mesons are theoretically connected to qbar-q contents of a QCD medium. Even in nucleus matter, modifications of vector mesons are predicted[1].
The KEK-PS E325 experiment was performed to study mass properties of vector mesons and partial chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear medium. The KEK experiment measure mass spectra of phi mesons using electron-positron decays. The experiment reports significant mass modification in nucleus[2]. New experiment is being prepared at J-PARC to continue this measurement. In this presentation, details of new experiment are presented. 
A new beam line is under construction at the Hadron Experimental Facility of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to perform the experiment. A new beam line delivers a primary 30 GeV proton beam and intensities of the beam is 10^10 Hz. 
The first experiment using the beam line is under preparation. The experiment will measure mass spectra of vector mesons in nucleus with 100 times larger statistics than the KEK-PS E325 experiment. The new experiment aims to confirm results of the previous KEK experiment and have a large statistics to discuss more details. The new experiment uses new detector techniques, such as a GEM tracker and a Hadron Blind Detector, to achieve such a large statistics.

They are also used to compute the behavior of the 't Hooft loop and study the exceptional group G(2) . In this talk, I review the basic ideas of the construction of these models and propose a new form of the non-ideal corrections in the matrix model. In the semi-QGP region, the new model is in good agreement with the lattice simulations as the previous ones, while in higher temperature region, it reproduces the upward trend of the rescaled trace anomaly as found in lattice which, however, can not be obtained from the previous models. In addition, I discuss the perturbative corrections to the thermal effective potential which could be used to systematically improve the matrix models at high temperatures. In particular, I provide, for the first time, an analytical proof of the relation between the one- and two-loop effective potential: two-loop correction is proportional to the one-loop result, independent of the eigenvalues of the Polyakov loop.

Poster Session,poster,CP violation in $B^0$ and $\bar B^0$ decay and the flavor-tagged Δt distributions,"Furui, Sadataka","Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Teikyo University",Unknown,"The BABAR experiment shows that the flavor-tagged Δt distribution of $B^0\to J/\Psi K^0_L$ agrees with the theoretical prediction, but that of $\bar B^0\to J/\Psi \bar K^0$ shows discrepancy at large |Δt| region[1]. 
The difference could appear from the presence of tree diagrams of $\bar B^0\to \bar K^0_L J/\Psi$ but absence corresponding tree diagram of $B^0\to K^0_L J/\Psi$, in the Cartan's supersymmetry[2].

The tree diagram could contain retarded time effect before $J/\Psi$ creation during propagation of the W boson.
The model can be extended to the decay of $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$ and $\bar B^0\to K^-\pi^+$[3], and $B^0\to D^{*-}X\ell^+\nu$[4]. 

The $Z_3$ symmetry of leptons and quarks[5] suggests that CP violation effects 
in the $B^0\to D^{*-}X\ell^+\nu$ cannot be detected by our electromagnetic detectors.

Possibility of detecting the retarded time effect by rapidly moving the detector[6] will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation-induced effects in inhomogeneous chiral phases,"Karasawa, Shintaro",Kyoto university,Unknown,"We discuss the effect of fluctuations for the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the thermodynamics of QCD.

Inhomogeneous chiral phase is characterized by the spatially modulated chiral condensate, $M(z) = -2G ( \langle \bar{q} q \rangle +i \langle \bar{q} i \gamma_{5} \tau_{3} q \rangle ) =m(z) e^{i \theta(z)}$.
There are two typical types of condensates.
One is called real kink crystal (RKC), which is modulated only in the amplitude; $M(z)=m(z)$[1].
The other one is called dual chiral density wave (DCDW), which is modulated only in the phase; $M(z)=me^{i\theta(z)}$[2].
Here, we concentrate on the analysis for sinusoidal condensate.

Within the mean field approximation, it is known that there appears the inhomogeneous phase between the homogeneously broken and the normal phases in QCD phase diagram.
Both RKC and DCDW have characteristic behavior: there is the second order phase transition line between inhomogeneous and chiral restored phases.

If we consider the fluctuation effects, this behavior is remarkably changed.
Brazovskii has shown that the thermal fluctuation effect changes the order of phase transition between the inhomogeneous and normal phases [3].
Dyugaev has also shown that the quantum fluctuation induces similar effect [4].
Here, we develop these works and apply to the inhomogeneous chiral condensate: we consider both the thermal and quantum fluctuations.

As a result, we show the effects of the quantum and thermal fluctuations change the order of the phase transition.
Also we show that these effects disfavor the inhomogeneous condensate, the region of the inhomogeneous phase in QCD phase diagram is decreased.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of W and Z-boson production in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Zhu, Jianhui",Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN),China,"The high collision energies available at the LHC allow for an abundant production of hard probes, such as quarkonia, high-$p_{\rm T}$ jets and vector bosons (W, Z). The latter are produced in initial hard parton scattering processes and they decay before the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is a deconfined phase of QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, their leptonic decay products do not interact strongly with the QGP. The electroweak boson introduces a way for benchmarking in-medium modifications to coloured probes. In Pb--Pb and p--Pb collisions, precise measurements of W and Z-boson production can constrain the Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions (nPDFs), which could be modified with respect to the nucleon due to shadowing or gluon saturation, and they can be used to test the scaling of hard particle production with the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Especially in p--Pb collisions, the measurement of W yields at forward and backward rapidity allows us to probe the modification of nPDFs at small and large Bjorken-$x$, respectively. Such measurements can be benchmarked in pp collisions, where W and Z-boson production is theoretically known with good precision. Also, the charge asymmetry of leptons from W-boson decays is a sensitive probe of up and down quark densities in a nucleon inside a nucleus.

The production of W and Z bosons in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV is measured with the ALICE muon spectrometer via the inclusive $p_{\rm T}$-differential muon yield and the invariant mass of opposite-sign muon pairs, respectively. The rapidity coverage of the muon spectrometer is -4.46 $< y^\mu_{\rm cms} <$ -2.96 and 2.03 $< y^\mu_{\rm cms} <$ 3.53, which is complementary to the one of ATLAS and CMS.

Poster Session,poster,Photon production from gluon mediated quark-anti-quark annihilation prior to hadronization,"Campbell, Sarah",Columbia University,USA,"Heavy ion collisions produce direct photons at low transverse momentum, $p_{T}$ from 1-3 GeV/c, in excess of the $p$+$p$ spectra scaled by the nuclear overlap factor, $T_{AA}$.  These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large azimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$, suggesting late-stage production.  Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic models, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct photon excess and $v_{2}$.  This talk investigates increased photon production as the system becomes color neutral from soft-gluon mediated $q$-$\bar{q}$ interactions in a process analogous to coalescence.  This production mechanism will generate photons that follow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of two for direct photons.  A $\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published direct photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements and a coalescence-like Monte Carlo is used to test this description.  The $\chi^{2}$ comparison finds that $n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value $n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.  The coalescence-like Monte Carlo simulation calculates the direct photon $v_{2}$ while describing the shape of the direct photon $p_{T}$ spectra in an internally consistent manner.  The simulation, while systematically low when compared to the data, is in agreement with the 0-20% and 20-40% Au$+$Au PHENIX measurement at $p_{T}$ less than 3 GeV/c.  This model predicts that higher order flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, in direct photons will follow the modified $n_{q}$-scaling laws seen in identified hadron $v_{n}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of approximately two.  Comparisons to preliminary direct photon results, including higher-order anisotropies and the status of simulations at LHC energies, will also be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sarah', 'last_name': 'Campbell', 'fullName': 'Campbell, Sarah', 'id': '934167', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University', 'emailHash': '9f2b38a6a844c823e59cb40d6fb770ac', 'db_id': 934167, 'person_id': 999448}"

These temperatures can be estimated from their masses at those temperatures but the only experimental information is given at zero temperature. At non-zero temperatures, there are several models to estimate the meson masses, where the temperature-dependence of quark-quark interactions is necessary. Most calculations use the free energies from Lattice results or their modifications, for this input.
Recently, AdS/CFT offered the temperature-dependent potentials between quarks by introducing infrared cutoff on the AdS Schwarzschild space, which inhibit the two characteristic features, confinement at long rages and asymptotic freedom at small ranges. We adopted these temperature-dependences on our model potential, which is composed of a screened Coulomb-type strong potential plus a Coulomb potential as a vector potential and the linear plus constant potential as a scalar potential. Here the temperature dependence of the screening radius and tangent of the linear potential is determined based on AdS/CFT. For two quark system, we used the Dirac’s constraint dynamics to get the Schrodinger-type equations with all dynamical and spin-dependent terms expressed by our model potential.
In this presentation, we calculated the meson mass spectrum, especially for quarkonia and B_{c} meson. Heavy meson masses are almost constant for T=0~0.4T_{c} but decrease after 0.4T_{c} as temperatures increase up to 1.4T_{c}, especially linearly after T=T_{c}. Our results are consistent with others based on the Lattice calculation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Minjung', 'last_name': 'Kim', 'fullName': 'Kim, Minjung', 'id': '934177', 'affiliation': 'Inha University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'aa0d317c640a5d2b1e484cca25fb51eb', 'db_id': 934177, 'person_id': 999455}"
