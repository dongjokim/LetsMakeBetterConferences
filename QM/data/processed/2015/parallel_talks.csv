Collective Dynamics IV,parallel,Elliptic Anisotropy $v_2$ May Be Dominated by Particle Escape instead of Hydrodynamic Flow,"Lin, Zi-Wei",ECU,Unknown,"It is commonly believed that azimuthal anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collisions are generated by hydrodynamic evolution of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. Recently, apparent anisotropy signals have been observed in small systems of proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions, and the signals can again be described by hydrodynamics. A natural question is why hydrodynamics still seems to be applicable to such small systems. Since A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT), like hydrodynamics, has been quite successful in describing a large amount of experimental data, we investigate the generation of anisotropies in AMPT by analyzing the complete parton collision history. We also use another transport model, the MPC/Cascade, to check the model dependence of our results.

To our surprise, we find [1] that the majority of $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons, not from the parton collective flow, for semi-central Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV. Hydrodynamic-type collective flow will eventually dominate over the escape mechanism at unrealistically large parton cross sections. However, even at the parton cross section of 40 mb, the escape mechanism still contributes to about one-third of the final parton $v_2$. The picture is qualitatively the same from both transport models, and for the smaller d+Au system the escape mechanism is more dominant as expected. Our results thus show that elliptic anisotropy $v_2$ is dominated by particle escape instead of hydrodynamic flow in transport models. If confirmed, our finding could change the paradigm of anisotropic flow. Our results also suggest the need for hydrodynamics to include the escape mechanism, without which the extracted viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$) ratio would be severely underestimated.

Quarkonia IV,parallel,$J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ measurements in the di-muon channel in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV  with the STAR experiment,"Ma, Rongrong",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Measurements of quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions have played an essential role in understanding the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in such collisions. In particular, $J/\psi$ suppression in the medium has been proposed as a direct probe of the QGP formation, where quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom. However,  regeneration of $J/\psi$ from uncorrelated $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks in the medium adds extra complications to the interpretation of $J/\psi$ suppression. The measurement of the second order harmonic coefficient ($v_{2}$) for $J/\psi$ would help disentangle different production mechanisms since the regenerated $J/\psi$ is expected to inherit the flow of the charm quarks while the primordial $J/\psi$  should have almost zero $v_{2}$. On the other hand, the contribution from regeneration to $\Upsilon$, $b\bar{b}$ bound states, is much smaller at RHIC energies, making them ideal probes to study the color-screening feature. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), designed to trigger on and identify muons based on precise timing information, was fully installed in STAR at mid-rapidity. Due to the low trigger threshold on muon $p_{\rm{T}}$, the MTD trigger has a relatively high efficiency for low $p_{\rm{T}}$ $J/\psi$, where the regeneration contribution is expected to be the largest. Moreover, the MTD opens the door for separating different $\Upsilon$ states for the first time at STAR as the Bremsstrahlung radiation for muons is much smaller compared to electrons. In this talk, we present the measurements of $J/\psi$ suppression, quantified as the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{AA}}$,  and $v_{2}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV down to zero $p_{\rm{T}}$. These measurements bring extra insights into the $J/\psi$ production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the measurement of different $\Upsilon$ states is explored within the precision of the available statistics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rongrong', 'last_name': 'Ma', 'fullName': 'Ma, Rongrong', 'id': '932744', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '4e8b7b778088536e47427a629a542265', 'db_id': 932744, 'person_id': 998533}"

propagating in thin QCD plasma. Within the N=1 opacity approximation, we determine the induced emission pattern of two gluons which are soft compared to
the parton energy but hard compared to the medium scale. We assume a wide separation between the energies of those two gluons, but we allow arbitrary ordering of their emission angles. We select the transverse
momenta of the induced gluons such that only the softest one may be medium induced. We study the ordering properties of a hard jet forming in the medium by analyzing the interference pattern of the softest gluon with respect to the hard quark-gluon core. We concentrate in the regime in which the formation times of both gluons are comparable and discuss the interplay between interferences and the formation time of the quark-gluon subsystem.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jorge', 'last_name': 'Casalderrey Solana', 'fullName': 'Casalderrey Solana, Jorge', 'id': '933734', 'affiliation': 'University of Barcelona (ES)', 'emailHash': '4e4e485192147e6dd3250bf6d8faf700', 'db_id': 933734, 'person_id': 998920}"

window into many aspects of excited medium formation and evolution.
Unlike symmetric collisions, an asymmetric system can have non-zero
odd-order moments in its average transverse distribution of
participants, and the pattern of participants from the two nuclei
can have different shapes on average.  In 2012, PHENIX measured
particle production in Cu$+$Au collisions at

azimuthal anisotropies $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ (directed, elliptic,

The set of shapes includes the first order angularity, the pTD and the difference between the leading and subleading tracks of the jet. The shapes are measured with a constituent cutoff of 0.15 GeV and small jet resolution $R=0.2$.  New techniques for background subtraction are applied and a 2D unfolding is performed to correct the shapes to particle level. We further present differential studies of jet suppression measured via full jet $R_{\rm AA}$ as function of sub-jet structure.

In pPb collisions, studies of b-quark production can also provide insights into the relevance of cold nuclear matter effects in the heavy-flavour sector. The CMS experiment has excellent capabilities for measuring b-quark production thanks to the excellent performances of its muon and tracker system. In this talk, we will present the measurement of fully reconstructed B mesons in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity.

Collective Dynamics II,parallel,Anisotropic hydrodynamics for conformal Gubser flow,"Strickland, Michael",Kent State University,Unknown,"We derive the equations of motion for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally-symmetric transverse ""Gubser flow"" using leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics. This is accomplished by assuming that the one-particle distribution function is ellipsoidally-symmetric in the momenta conjugate to the de Sitter coordinates used to parameterize the Gubser flow. We then demonstrate that the SO(3)_q symmetry in de Sitter space further constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form. The resulting system of two coupled ordinary differential equations for the de Sitter-space momentum scale and anisotropy parameter are solved numerically and compared to a recently obtained exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We show that anisotropic hydrodynamics describes the spatio-temporal evolution of the system better than all currently known dissipative hydrodynamics approaches. In addition, we prove that anisotropic hydrodynamics gives the exact solution of the relaxation-time approximation Boltzmann equation in the ideal, eta/s -> 0, and free-streaming, eta/s -> infinity, limits.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Strickland', 'fullName': 'Strickland, Michael', 'id': '933070', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University', 'emailHash': '115cd550a1295459b4ffe5c86a279a76', 'db_id': 933070, 'person_id': 998527}"
Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness I,parallel,Violation of mass ordering for multi-strange hadrons at RHIC and LHC,"Takeuchi, Shiori",Sophia Univ,Unknown,"We study effects of hadronic rescattering on final observables for
multi-strange hadrons in high-energy nuclear collisions within an
integrated dynamical model. We simulate the whole collision process on
an event-by-event basis by using a fully (3+1)-dimensional ideal
hydrodynamic description for the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and a
subsequent kinetic transport description for the hadron resonance gas.

The QGP created in a collision expands, cools down and then turns into
hadron gas. In the last stage of the collisions, hadrons continue to
scatter with each other. Therefore observed hadron spectra are, in
general, contaminated by the hadronic rescatterings. In order to probe
the QGP more directly, multi-strange hadrons, in particular $\phi$-meson
and $\Omega$-baryon, can be utilized since multi-strange hadrons have
small scattering cross-sections and less scatter with non-strange
hadrons. Thus final observables of $\phi$-mesons and $\Omega$-baryons
are expected to reflect the properties of the system just after
hadronization.

Some years ago, violation of mass ordering in $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ was
predicted by using a hydro + cascade hybrid model and thereafter
observed by the STAR collaboration. Following this work, we scrutinize
multi-strange hadron spectra at both RHIC and LHC energies by using a
more sophisticated integrated dynamical model towards comprehensive
understanding of this phenomenon. In addition to $v_2(p_{\rm T})$, we
investigate the hadronic rescattering effects on mean transverse momenta
($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) and $p_{\rm T}$-averaged $v_2$ of hadrons
including heavier multi-strange hadrons such as $\Xi$- and
$\Omega$-baryons. We also discuss the collision energy dependence of the
hadronic rescattering effects on the violation of mass ordering behavior
and show that multi-strange hadrons can be used as “penetrating probes”
of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shiori', 'last_name': 'Takeuchi', 'fullName': 'Takeuchi, Shiori', 'id': '932712', 'affiliation': 'Sophia Univ', 'emailHash': 'f485168345919cb613b69ee40e8eb102', 'db_id': 932712, 'person_id': 998503}"
QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Flow in small systems from parton scatterings,"Ma, Guo-Liang","Shanghai INstitute of Applied Physics (SINAP), CAS",Unknown,"We show that the incoherent elastic scattering of partons, as present in a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), with a modest parton-parton cross-section of $\sigma$=1.5-3 mb, naturally explains the long-range two-particle azimuthal correlations as observed in p+p and p+Pb collisions for all measured $N_{track}$ and $p_T$ bins by the LHC-CMS experiment [1]. We calculate the elliptic, $v_2$, and triangular, $v_3$, Fourier coefficients of the two-particle azimuthal correlation function in p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. Our results for $v_3$ are in a good agreement with the CMS data. The $v_2$ coefficient is very well described in p+Pb collisions and is underestimated for higher $p_T$ in Pb+Pb collisions. The characteristic mass ordering of $v_2$ in p+Pb is also reproduced whereas for $v_3$ such ordering is not observed [2]. An escape mechanism has been proposed recently to explain these successful model results [3]. We investigate this issue in detail and show that collisions between active partons are directly responsible for generating the final $v_n$.

Quarkonia III,parallel,Charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from lattice QCD at finite temperature,"Ohno, Hiroshi","Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba",UK,"Dissociation of heavy quarkonia is expected to happen in the quark-gluon plasma due to the Debye screening, which causes suppression of quarkonium yields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Actually the $J/\psi$ suppression in SPS, RHIC and LHC as well as the sequential $\Upsilon$ suppression in LHC have been observed. However, since there are not only the medium effect but also other processes, e.g. cold nuclear matter effects, to contribute to the quarkonium suppression and production, the experimental results are still not fully understood. Therefore theoretical understanding of in-medium quarkonium properties plays an important role to explain the experimental data. Moreover, since the elliptic flow suggesting collective motion of heavy quarks due to the hydrodynamic effects has been observed, in-medium behavior of a single heavy quark is also of great theoretical interest.

In this talk we report our study on charmonium and bottomonium in lattice QCD at finite temperature. Similarly to a previous study [1] simulations have been performed on large and fine isotropic lattices by using quenched gauge field configurations. A couple of lattice spacings towards the continuum limit were also chosen. At temperatures in a range from 0.73$T_c$ to 2.2$T_c$ we construct charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators which have been computed in our previous studies
[2,3]. From the temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions we discuss the dissociation of the quarkonium states. We will also extract the transport properties of heavy quarks from the spectral function in the vector channel and estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient for both charm and bottom.

Dileptons are produced in the whole evolution of the system and escape with minimum interaction with the strongly interacting medium. Thus, they provide information about the various stages of the system during the evolution. In the low mass region ($M_{ee}<1.1$ $GeV/c^{2}$), they retain information about the in-medium modifications of vector mesons which are considered as a link to chiral symmetry restoration. Recently, it is found in a model calculation that the charged particle multiplicity normalized dilepton excess yield in the low mass region is proportional to the lifetime of the hot, dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6-200 $GeV$ [1]. The energy density created in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ is expected to be higher by about 20% and the medium created might have a longer lifetime compared with the Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 $GeV$. Thus it would be interesting to compare the normalized dielectron excess yields in U+U and Au+Au collisions. 

In this talk, we will present the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and centrality dependent measurements of dielectron production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$. With the acceptance correction applied, we will report the invariant dielectron excess mass spectra in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ and in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27, 39, and 62.4 $GeV$. Comparisons with the NA60 results and the STAR measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 19.6 and 200 $GeV$ will be shown. System-size and energy dependences of low mass excess yield will be discussed together with model comparisons.

The dependence of the energy loss on the in-medium path length provides deeper insight into the energy loss mechanisms and can be studied by measuring jet production relative to the event plane orientation.

This contribution will show results of measurements of $R=0.2$ charged jet production in central and peripheral $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV Pb--Pb collisions with respect to the second order event plane, quantified as $v_2^{\mathrm{jet}}$.

Quarkonia IV,parallel,Dynamical upsilon-suppression in the Schroedinger-Langevin approach,"Gossiaux, Pol",Subatech,Unknown,"The suppression of upsilon Y(1S) states in AA collisions, observed by the STAR collaboration at RHIC and by the CMS and ALICE collaboration at LHC, is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the quark gluon plasma. The precise survival of excited Y(2S) and Y(3S) states vs ground state could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions, according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature. 

In our contribution, we address the question of upsilon dissociation resorting to a dynamical approach, i.e. the non-linear Schroedinger-Langevin equation (SLE). In this scheme, the time-dependent real potential implements the Debye-screening while the stochastic forces express the (hard) interactions between the QGP and the $b\bar b$ state, possibly leading to instantaneous dissociation. The SLE preserves unitarity and enables to treat the transitions between bound and open quantum states, which are mocked up resorting to imaginary potential in other treatments. It allows to consider a realistic compact initial state, made of a linear superposition of upsilon eigenstates and to preserve quantum coherence in the time-evolution of the $b\bar b$ pair.
In a stationary QGP, our SLE naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of {Y(1S), Y(2S),...} following correct statistical weights, which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination. This sanity check is a unique feature of our approach.
 
We will describe the main ingredients of our SLE as well as some of its most important properties. We will then present the suppression prediction resulting from SLE embedded in state-of-the-art evolution scenario of the QGP background, both for RHIC and LHC energies.

To do this we have to follow the heavy quarks from their production point through the QGP up to the final rescattering of heavy mesons with hadrons after the hadronization. 
The interaction of heavy quarks in the QPG is calculated in pQCD with a running coupling constant and including elastic as well as radiative collisions (arXiv 1307.5270). Due to event by event fluctuations the interaction of heavy mesons in the hadronic phase depends on the light quarks/mesons which are produced simultaneously with the heavy quarks during the initial phase of the heavy ion reaction. Therefore the observables of the heavy and light hadrons are correlated and both have to be studied simultaneously. 
Combining the event generator EPOS with our Heavy Quark approach we can for the first time present event-by-event results simultaneously for the light and heavy meson sector and overcome by this uncertainties of the heavy quark observables due to the ambiguities in the plasma expansion  (arXiv:1102.1114).

Jets and High pT Hadrons II,parallel,Jet Hadronization via Recombination of Parton Showers in Vacuum and in Medium,"Fries, Rainer",Texas A&M University,USA,"We have developed a hadronization model for jet parton showers based on the quark recombination model. Gluons at the end of a perturbative shower evolution undergo a non-perturbative splitting into quark and antiquark pairs, then a Monte-Carlo version of instantaneous quark recombination is applied. Finally remnant quarks (those which have not found a recombination partner) are connected by color strings and subjected to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to parton showers from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, the final hadron spectra from our calculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been hadronized with the default Lund string fragmentation. This hadronization model readily generalizes to jet showers emerging from a quark gluon plasma by allowing recombination of shower partons with thermal partons, sampled from fluid dynamics or blast wave models.  We find that the recombination of shower and thermal partons leads to a significant enhancement of intermediate transverse momentum pions and protons at both RHIC and LHC. Our results thus suggest that medium modification of jet fragmentation provides a plausible explanation for the enhanced production of intermediate transverse momentum hadrons and the changed hadron chemistry observed in experiments. A computer code based on this vacuum and medium hadronization model has been developed within the JET collaboration and can be combined with existing jet shower Monte Carlo codes.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rainer', 'last_name': 'Fries', 'fullName': 'Fries, Rainer', 'id': '932685', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'emailHash': '043accfcafd1e7abcdeef2818eef1890', 'db_id': 932685, 'person_id': 998478}"

Measurements in p--Pb collisions help to characterize the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the collision (cold nuclear matter effects). ALICE has provided measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ in the heavy-flavour sector. More differential measurements of charm and beauty production in pp and p--Pb collisions can provide further insight on the above topics.

The analysis of angular correlations between heavy-flavour particles and charged particles allows us to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and is sensitive to their production mechanism. Differences between the measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can give insight on how cold nuclear matter effects affect the heavy-quark production and hadronisation in p--Pb collisions. In the analysis of hadron-hadron correlations in p--Pb collisions, a double-ridge long-range structure was observed, possibly coming from a collective behavior of the system or gluon saturation in the initial state. This feature can be investigated for heavy quarks as well through heavy-flavour correlation studies. Moreover, the study of heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity is a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between hard and soft QCD processes responsible for particle production in hadronic collisions and provides information on the role of multi-parton interactions.

the collision evolution interacting with the medium constituents via both 
elastic and inelastic processes.

The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) and the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) 
are two of the main experimental observables that allow us to investigate the 
interaction strength of heavy quarks with the expanding medium.
$R_{\rm AA}$ accounts for the modification of heavy-flavour hadron yields in 
Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions, after the proper binary 
collision scaling is applied on the latter system. The comparison of the 
$R_{\rm AA}$ of charm, beauty and light-flavour hadrons can provide 
information about the colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of the parton 
energy loss. $v_{2}$ is the second Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal 
distribution of particle momenta in the transverse plane with respect to the 
reaction plane. At low $p_{\rm{T}}$ it is sensitive to the degree of 
thermalization of heavy quarks in the deconfined medium, and at high

in-medium parton energy loss.

The Beam Energy Scan (BES)-I program at RHIC, spanning center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV of Au+Au collisions, provided measurements at different baryochemical potentials, µB, to map the QCD phase diagram.

QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Direct photon production and jet quenching in small systems,"Gale, Charles",McGill University,Unknown,"Signatures usually associated with hydrodynamic behavior have been recently observed in high and intermediary multiplicity proton-nucleus (pA) collisions at the LHC. Even though these signals suggest the creation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in such collisions, they do not represent concrete proof. In order to better address this problem, other signals must be investigated.

In this work we calculate the thermal photon radiation produced by a small and rapidly expanding QGP droplet [1] and evaluate how much energy jets can loose when penetrating through such a small system.  We find that a significant amount of thermal radiation is produced in proton-nucleus collisions, with thermal photons accounting for ~50% of the direct photons produced in high multiplicity pA collisions at low $p_T$. Furthermore, we show that despite the small system size, jets still loose a significant fraction of their initial energy, leading to a charged hadron Raa of 0.7--0.8 at a transverse momentum of ~10 GeV.  If these two signatures can be accessed by the experiments, they will serve as additional evidence that a strongly coupled QGP is being produced in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC. To complete the analysis, we study direct photon production and jet quenching in other small systems, such as d-Au and He-Au collisions at RHIC energies.

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium I,parallel,Centrality and pseudorapidity dependence of transverse energy flow in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with CMS,"Murray, Michael",University of Kansas (US),USA,"The CMS Collaboration has measured the pseudorapidity and centrality dependence $dE{T}/d\eta$ for 5.02 TeV pPb collisions over 10 units of pseudo-rapidity. This was carried out in a systematic way by measuring centrality using different experimental definitions. As the centrality increases the mean pseudorapidity moves backwards and the $1/N dE_{T}/d\eta$ distribution widens. For the most central pPb collisions the maximum $1/N dE_{T}/d\eta$ reaches 25 GeV. The rate of change of dEt/deta with eta and centrality is characterized by the ratio $S_{pc} (eta, centrality) = E_{T} (\eta, centrality)/E_{T}(\eta, centrality=0-10\%)$. This ratio depends very strongly upon the definition of centrality and shows strong auto-correlations if a particular eta region is used to define centrality. For the most central events there is a large overlap in the event classes selected by different centrality measurements, but for peripheral events different centrality measures select quite different. This is quite different to the situation in PbPb and suggests that event-by-event fluctuations in the pseudorapidity distribution of particles are much stronger in pPb than in PbPb.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Murray', 'fullName': 'Murray, Michael', 'id': '933021', 'affiliation': 'University of Kansas (US)', 'emailHash': '8f75899199011d39b28025ed4bff7cf2', 'db_id': 933021, 'person_id': 998772}"

Recent measurements of the pPb nuclear modification factor ($R_{pPb}$), with diverging values for inclusive jets and charged hadrons, have raised question on jet fragmentation properties in pPb collisions. These spectra measurements are performed with pp reference at 5.02 TeV constructed by interpolation or extrapolation from different $\sqrt{s}$, and on steeply falling power-law spectra. As the jet fragmentation function is only evolving logarithmically with $\sqrt{s}$, this further underscores the importance of a direct measurement. Together with the CMS results in pPb inclusive jets and charge hadron $R_{pPb}$, we introduce the new CMS measurement of fragmentation function in pPb collisions, where within our uncertainties, jets in pPb is found to have identical fragmentation property vs. pp jets.

Collective Dynamics II,parallel,Hydrodynamic fluctuations and dissipation in an integrated dynamical model,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Thermal fluctuations arising during hydrodynamic evolution of
the system (a.k.a., *hydrodynamic fluctuations*) [1] play an important role
in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. For example, entropy
production fluctuates during the expansion even if we start from a common
initial condition in a macroscopic sense [2]. On the other hand, the
effect of the fluctuations must be significant in small colliding systems
such as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions [2]. Stability of thermal
equilibrium systems is a consequence of an interplay between thermal
fluctuations and dissipation. Thus it is indispensable to take the
hydrodynamic fluctuations into account in causal dissipative hydrodynamic
simulations.

In this study, we develop a new (next-generation) integrated dynamical
model to investigate the effects of the hydrodynamic fluctuations on
observables in high-energy nuclear collisions. We implement the
hydrodynamic fluctuations in a fully 3-D dynamical model consisting of
the hydrodynamic initialization models such as Monte-Carlo
Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi model and Monte-Carlo Glauber model, causal
dissipative hydrodynamics, and the subsequent hadronic cascades. By
analyzing the hadron distributions obtained by massive event-by-event
simulations with both of the hydrodynamic fluctuations and the

fluctuations on the flow harmonics, $v_n$, and their fluctuations. This
sheds a new light on extracting transport coefficients from observables.

However, it is still not well understood after decades of effort. Simultaneous measurement of quarkonium spectrum and polarization in a wide kinematic range, notably at high transverse momentum, is suggested as a necessary step towards determination of quarkonium production mechanism. Moreover, an intriguing trend of a sharp increase of the quarkonium yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity was observed in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 7 TeV at the LHC. Such a behavior could be qualitatively explained in the framework of multiparton interactions, hydrodynamic evolution, or the percolation model and the latter two assume the formation of a high density medium. Therefore it is very interesting and important to study if such effects are also present at much lower energies in order to discriminate among these theoretical interpretations.

QGP in Small Systems II,parallel,Causal hydrodynamic fluctuation in Bjorken expansion,"Nagai, Kenichi",Sophia university,Unknown,"We investigate effects of causal hydrodynamic fluctuation on dynamics of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) in Bjorken expansion in high-energy nuclear collisions. The space-time evolution of the QGP can be well described by relativistic hydrodynamics. In the recent hydrodynamic analyses, effects of event-by-event (e-by-e) initial fluctuation on final flow observables have been focused. Moreover, it is hotly debated whether the same hydrodynamic models can be applicable even in small systems such as p-p, p-A, and peripheral A-A collisions. 

In this study, we focus on thermal fluctuation during hydrodynamic evolution which must be also important on an e-by-e basis of hydrodynamic description, in particular, in small systems.
We first introduce causal hydrodynamic fluctuation, namely the thermal noises arising during the hydrodynamic evolution, into the boost invariant Bjorken expansion. We next perform hydrodynamic simulations of the Bjorken model with hydrodynamic fluctuation on an e-by-e basis. 

We find the final entropy fluctuates around the mean value even if the initial condition is fixed in a macroscopic sense. We also find the entropy can temporally decreases during the time evolution, which is allowed by the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Fluctuation of entropy results in multiplicity fluctuation as an observable. Through the fluctuation-dissipation relation, hydrodynamic fluctuation is intimately related with dissipation. Thus final multiplicity fluctuation contains transport properties of the QGP. The fluctuation effect would be significant in small system such as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. Therefore we may have a chance to constrain the transport properties in such small systems. 

We further discuss rapidity　dependent hydrodynamic fluctuation on top of boost-invariant Bjorken expansion to see whether long-range rapidity correlation can be contaminated by hydrodynamic fluctuations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenichi', 'last_name': 'Nagai', 'fullName': 'Nagai, Kenichi', 'id': '933119', 'affiliation': 'Sophia university', 'emailHash': 'fab9a3b3de60218bed97d2b94013f284', 'db_id': 933119, 'person_id': 998511}"

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,Resumming large radiative corrections in the high-energy evolution of the Color Glass Condensate,"Iancu, Edmond",IPhT Saclay,France,"The Color Glass Condensate effective theory is the perturbative QCD description of the initial state for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The BK-JIMWLK equations describing the evolution of this theory with increasing energy have recently been extended to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy, which should allow for direct comparisons with the phenomenology.  However, some of the NLO corrections turn out to be extremely large, since amplified by (double and single) `collinear’ logarithms, i.e. logarithms of ratios of transverse momenta. As a result, the evolution at NLO becomes unstable and void of any predictive power. This difficulty points towards the existence of large radiative corrections to all orders in $\alpha_s$, which must be computed and resummed in order to restore the predictive power of the perturbative expansion. 

In Ref. [1], we performed such a resummation for the largest corrections — those where each power of $\alpha_s$ is accompanied by a double transverse logarithm. Subsequently, in Ref. [2], we have extended this resummation by including single transverse logarithms and running coupling corrections. This led us to a `collinearly improved’ version of BK equation, which resums the largest radiative corrections to all orders. Numerical studies of this equation show that the evolution is now stable and also considerably slowed down by the resummation. To demonstrate the usefulness of this equation as a tool for phenomenology, for have used it for fits to the HERA data for electron-proton deep inelastic scattering at high energy [2]. We have obtained excellent fits with a reduced number of free parameters and with initial conditions at low energy taken from perturbative QCD.

For the first time, the multiplicity distributions for pp collisions are measured over a wide kinematic range at the LHC (pseudorapidity coverage of $-3.4<\eta<+5.1$). The $P(N_{ch})$ are obtained at LHC Run 1 energies: from $\sqrt{s}=$0.9 to 8 TeV, and at the highest available energy $\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV from Run 2.

Correlations and Fluctuations II,parallel,Systematics of higher order net-baryon number fluctuations at small values of the baryon chemical potential: A comparison of lattice QCD and beam energy scan results,"Karsch, Frithjof",Brookhaven National Laboratory & Bielefeld University,USA & Germany,"Fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges of strong 
interactions have long been considered sensitive observables 
for the exploration of the structure of the phase diagram of QCD. Cumulants 
of conserved charge fluctuations are the most promising experimental observables 
in the search for a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD performed in the 
beam energy scan (BES) at RHIC. The published data on cumulants of net-proton number 
fluctuations and, in particular, the still preliminary data set on net-proton 
fluctuations which covers a larger transverse momentum range show obvious 
deviations from the thermodynamics of a hadron resonance gas (HRG). This 
naturally raises the question whether ratios of cumulants of net-proton number 
fluctuations, and the relation between them and net electric charge cumulants 
measured by STAR and PHENIX can be understood in terms of equilibrium 
thermodynamics obtained from lattice QCD calculations.

We present results for cumulants of net-baryon number and net electric
charge fluctuations calculated 
in a next-to-leading order (NLO) Taylor series in the baryon chemical potential
($\mu_B$). We discuss the resulting pattern of ratios of cumulants, 
e.g. $\kappa_B\sigma_B^2\equiv \chi_4^B/\chi_2^B$ and 
$S_B\sigma_B^3/M_B\equiv \chi_3^B/\chi_1^B$. We note that both quantities are 
identical at $\mu_B=0$ and that the curvature of the 
latter is about three times larger than the former. Comparing this generic 
structure with STAR results on net-proton number fluctuations we conclude that 
current BES results at energies $\sqrt{s} \ge 19.6$~GeV 
are compatible with QCD thermodynamics and can be understood in a NLO Taylor 
expansion. We also discuss changes of freeze-out parameters that arise from the new, 
preliminary STAR data on net-proton fluctuations compared to the published data and the
recent PHENIX data on electric charge fluctuations.",
Jets and High pT Hadrons I,parallel,Thermalization of mini-jets in a quark-gluon plasma,"Wu, Bin",CEA-Saclay,Unknown,"We complete the physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma by investigating the thermalization of the soft components of the jet. We argue that the following scenario should hold: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via quasi-democratic branchings and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature T. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the jet. We support this scenario, first, via parametric arguments and, next, by studying a simplified kinetic equation, which describes the jet dynamics in longitudinal phase-space. We solve the kinetic equation using both (semi-)analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain the first exact, analytic, solutions to the ultrarelativistic Fokker-Planck equation in one-dimensional phase-space. Our results confirm the physical picture aforementioned and demonstrate the quenching of the jet via multiple branching followed by the thermalization of the soft gluons in the cascades.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bin', 'last_name': 'Wu', 'fullName': 'Wu, Bin', 'id': '933160', 'affiliation': 'CEA-Saclay', 'emailHash': 'f7ca681d86612ffe1ea83babd5a78bcd', 'db_id': 933160, 'person_id': 998866}"

Extending a previous perturbative QCD based jet energy loss model (known as CUJET2.0) with (2+1)D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds, this new framework includes three novel features of nonperturbative physics origin: (1) the Polyakov loop suppression of color-electric scatterings and (2) the enhancement of the jet scattering due to emergent chromomagnetic monopoles near $T_c$ and (3) thermodynamic properties constrained by lattice QCD data. CUJET3.0 reduces to CUJET2.0 at high temperatures $T > 400$ MeV, but greatly enhances $\hat{q}$ near the QCD deconfinement transition temperature. This enhancement accounts well for the observed elliptic harmonics of jets with $p_T>10$ GeV. Extrapolating our data-constrained $\hat{q}$ down to thermal energy scales, $E \sim 2$ GeV, we find for the first time a remarkable consistency between the high energy jet quenching and bulk perfect fluidity with $\eta/s\sim T^3/\hat{q} \sim 0.1$ near $T_c$.

This talk will focus on $v_1$, and its slope $dv_1/dy$, near midrapidity. Ten identified particle types will be presented: $\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda$, $\phi$, $K^0_s$, $K^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, and $\pi^\pm$ produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV as a function of rapidity.

At intermediate centrality (10-40\%), $dv_1/dy$ shows a minimum near 14.5 GeV for several particle species while $p$ and $\Lambda$ also show a sign change. The $\phi$ meson appears to follow $\bar{p}$ at the higher BES energies, while protons, kaons and pions have a lower magnitude than $\bar{p}$ at 14.5 GeV and above. $\Lambda$ and $p$ are consistent within errors at all energies. $dv_1/dy$ shows a strong centrality dependence, especially for $p$ and $\Lambda$ at the lower beam energies. Results for net kaons and net protons will also be discussed.

Correlations and Fluctuations II,parallel,Correlated fluctuations near the QCD critical point,"Song, Huichao",Peking University,Unknown,"Recently, STAR beam energy scan (BES) measured the multiplicity distributions of net protons with the maximum transverse momentum extended from 0.8 GeV to 2 GeV. The related higher cumulants (moments) present large deviations from the poisson baselines, showing the potential of discovery the QCD critical point in experiment. 

  In this talk, we introduce a freeze-out scheme for  the dynamical models near the QCD critical point through coupling the classical particles with the correlated fluctuating sigma field [2]. For an infinite and stationary medium, such freeze-out scheme can reproduce the standard Staphanov formulas for cumulants presented in Ref[3].

  Within this framework, we calculate the correlated fluctuations of net protons emitted from the hydrodynamic freeze-out surface at various collision energies.  A comparison with recent STAR BES data shows that our model could reproduce kurtosis (and C4) through tuning the related parameters. However, the critical fluctuations in our model (also in the Stephanov formula) always give positive contributions to the cumulants C2 and C3, which over-predicts the data with poisson expectations served as the thermal fluctuation baselines[2].  In order to qualitatively /quantitatively describe these cumulants data, the effects from dynamical evolution and the deviations from poisson thermal fluctuations should be investigated in the near future.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness II,parallel,Charm degrees of freedom above deconfinement,"Petreczky, Peter",BNL,USA,"The heavy quarks are one of the most versatile probes of the strongly
coupled QCD medium created in the heavy ion collision experiments. 
However, the interactions of the heavy quarks or heavy quark bound 
states with the strongly coupled medium is still not well understood. 
One of the ways to look at such interactions is to study the behaviour 
of open charm hadrons in the thermalized medium.  
In our earlier study [1] we have shown that open charm hadrons 
are the relevant degrees of freedom below the QCD transition temperature. 
However, very little is known about the excitations of the charm degrees 
of freedom above the QCD transition temperature. 
In this work we study the nature of the
excitations carrying charm in deconfined QCD medium from first
principles using the lattice data on fluctuations of charm and its
correlations with baryon number and strangeness. Assuming that
the total charm pressure can be written as the sum of the partial
pressures of charm mesons, charm baryons and charm quarks we
extract the corresponding partial pressures from the lattice data.
We observe that the partial meson and baryon pressures
are significant till temperatures of about 200 MeV, implying
that meson and baryon excitations survive well beyond the QCD transition
temperature till about 200 MeV. Above that temperature quark 
like excitations start dominating. We also probe the relative importance 
of excitations carrying different quantum numbers,
specifically we show that possible diquark excitations carrying a
charm quantum number are not important for thermodynamics.
Our studies could be important in understanding the
energy loss mechanism and flow of the heavy quarks in the QGP as
well as the hadronization mechanism of the open charm states.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness III,parallel,Measurements of heavy-flavour production in p--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Wilkinson, Jeremy",Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,"The ALICE experiment's heavy-ion programme allows us to study the hot, high energy-density state of matter formed in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions. In particular, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) serve as calibrated probes of the medium, since they are predominantly produced during the initial hard scatterings in the collision. ALICE's excellent tracking, vertexing and particle identification capabilities allow it to fully reconstruct the hadronic decays of open-charmed D mesons, as well as enabling the study of leptons stemming from charm and beauty decays at forward and mid-rapidity.

Measurements in p--Pb collisions allow us to disentangle experimental observations arising due to the hot and dense medium from those occurring due to cold nuclear matter effects such as momentum broadening, initial-state energy loss, and the modification of nuclear PDFs in the Pb nucleus. In particular, it is possible to measure nuclear modification factors in p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions in order to determine whether the observed suppression of particles at high $p_\mathrm{T}$ in central Pb--Pb collisions is a medium-induced effect. Further insight into cold nuclear matter effects can be obtained by examining the yields of D mesons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in p--Pb collisions.

Here we present the most recent results from ALICE for charm and beauty production in p--Pb collisions via heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity, heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity, and the hadronic decays of D$^0$, D$^+$, D$^{\star +}$ and D$_\mathrm{s}^+$ mesons at mid-rapidity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jeremy', 'last_name': 'Wilkinson', 'fullName': 'Wilkinson, Jeremy', 'id': '933298', 'affiliation': 'Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE)', 'emailHash': '437827083b36609cef76a23bf9cfedef', 'db_id': 933298, 'person_id': 998972}"

Using a standard collinear gluon distribution for the probe and an up to date dipole cross section fitted to HERA data to describe the target we achieve a rather good description of the cross section in proton-proton collisions, although with a rather large normalization uncertainty.

It is shown in this work that the use of a modern hydrodynamical model of heavy ion collisions [1] together with more complete photon emission rates greatly improves agreement with both ALICE and PHENIX data, supporting the idea that thermal photons are the dominant source of direct photon momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions. The event-by-event hydrodynamical model used includes, for the first time, both shear and bulk viscosities, along with second order couplings between the two viscosities. Different photon emission rates are investigated, including one that takes into account the effect of confinement on photon emission [2]. The effect of both shear and bulk viscosities on the photon rates is studied and is shown to have a measurable effect on the photon momentum anisotropy. The inclusion of parton energy loss on prompt photons and its importance for comparisons of direct photon calculations with experiments is discussed.

Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Forward-backward multiplicity fluctuation and longitudinal harmonics in high-energy nuclear collisions,"Huo, Peng",State University of New York (US),USA,"One of the largest uncertainties in the modeling of heavy-ion collision arises from present poor understanding of the early-time dynamics especially in the longitudinal direction. Forward-backward (FB) multiplicity correlation has been regarded as a power observable on the early time dynamics since it probe directly the initial state density fluctuations in pseudorapidity. Previous studies of FB multiplicity correlation  were primarily based on two-bin or multi-bin correlation method in selected $\eta$ ranges, whose connection to underlying dynamics is complicated by statistical smearing due to finite multiplicity and residual centrality or volume effects. In a recent paper (1506.03496), we have developed a data-driven two-particle correlation method which overcome both limitations and hence allow direct connection between the correlation function and underlying heavy-ion collision dynamics. The robustness and physics potential of the method are demonstrated using the AMPT and HIJING simulation. We found that the long-range component of the FB correlation is captured by a few longitudinal harmonics, with the first component driven by the asymmetry in the number of participating nucleons in the two colliding nuclei and the second component reflecting the EbyE fluctuation of nuclear-stopping. The higher-order longitudinal harmonics are found be strongly damped in AMPT compare to HIJING, due to weaker short-range correlations as well as the final-state effects present in the AMPT model. Two-particle pseudorapidity correlation reveals interesting charge-dependent short-range structures in AMPT model that are absent in HIJING model. The proposed method opens a new avenue to elucidate the particle production mechanism and early time dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Future analysis directions and prospects of using the pseudorapidity correlation function to understand the centrality bias in p+p, p+A and A+A collisions are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peng', 'last_name': 'Huo', 'fullName': 'Huo, Peng', 'id': '933362', 'affiliation': 'State University of New York (US)', 'emailHash': 'aaea26f14f5a4cfc1337ebed5b4107fe', 'db_id': 933362, 'person_id': 999005}"

The additional radial and elliptic flow inherited by the heavy-flavour hadrons from the light quarks will affect the final observables, providing a better agreement with the experimental data for RAA and v2. 
We will show how, with our setup, it is also possible to study more differential observables like various kind of azimuthal correlations: D-h, e-h -- for which experimental data start getting available -- but also D-Dbar or e+-e-, not yet experimentally accessible but allowing in principle a more direct information on the decorrelation occurred at the partonic level. If the interaction with the medium tends to partially wash-out the initial Q-Qbar angular correlation, the elliptic flow acquired in the medium and at hadronization will tend to introduce a common correlation of all the heavy-flavour hadrons with the reaction plane, which will also contribute to the experimental signal.
Finally we will display the first results of our ongoing study on heavy-flavour observables in small systems, like the ones produced in p-Pb or d-Au collisions, trying to check whether the presence of a hot medium suggested by observables in the light sector (e.g. double ridge, elliptic flow...) can leave its fingerprints also in heavy-flavour signals.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '933423', 'affiliation': 'INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 933423, 'person_id': 998889}"

are an excellent probe of a phase transition or its remnant.
In heavy-ion collision, fluctuations related to conserved charges 
carried by light and strange quarks play an important role to identify
the QCD chiral crossover and deconfinement properties.

Recent Lattice QCD simulations have revealed that the charmed mesons
are deconfined together with light-flavor mesons in the temperature 
range where the chiral symmetry is partially restored. This result 
strongly suggests that the light-flavor dynamics interferes non-trivially
with the heavy flavors.

We discuss correlations between the light and heavy-light flavored
mesons at finite temperature within a chiral effective theory implementing
heavy quark symmetry. We show that the heavy quark dynamics is tied to 
the light flavor physics, and the thermodynamics is strongly dragged by 
the chiral crossover dominated by the non-strange flavors. Consequently,
the fluctuations carried by the states with strangeness can  be used to characterize the onset of the chiral symmetry restoration.

Here it is suggested that the combined effect of gluon-induced dissociation, collisional damping, screening, and reduced feed-down explains [3,4] most of the suppression of Upsilon states that has been observed in PbPb relative to pp collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the CERN LHC.
The formulation includes hydrodynamic expansion of the medium, the relativistic Doppler effect on the dissociation, and the running of the strong-coupling constant. For the centrality-dependent Y(1S) suppression agreement with the CMS data is found. The momentum dependence of the 
nuclear modification factor is calculated.
 
The suppression is a clear, albeit indirect, indication for the presence of a Quark-Gluon Plasma at LHC energies. A prediction for the centrality-dependent Y(1S) suppression at the forthcoming LHC energy of 5.125 TeV 
is presented. Regarding the suppression of the Y(2S) state, additional mechanisms have to be considered.

The pseudorapidity dependence of the azimuthal Fourier coefficients ($v_n$) is expected to be sensitive to the underlying mechanism with, in the hydrodynamic picture, the longer lifetime of the fireball on the Pb-going side expected to lead to a larger flow signal than found on the p-going side. To investigate the detailed properties of the observed collectivity, differential $v_n$ values in transverse momentum ($p_T$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) are presented over the full range of the CMS tracker detector ($-2.4 < \eta < 2.4$) for pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of mass energy of 5.02 TeV. Results based on multiparticle analyses involving four or more particles are shown. An event plane analysis is presented where the influence of recently demonstrated event-plane de-correlation is considered. Comparisons are made with peripheral PbPb collisions measured at similar mid-rapidity particle multiplicities. The results will be discussed in the context of current models of the longitudinal dependence of the multiparticle correlations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Quan', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Quan', 'id': '933532', 'affiliation': 'University of Kansas (US)', 'emailHash': '96165394c2c758b67ede6b2bc92f057d', 'db_id': 933532, 'person_id': 999112}"
QGP in Small Systems II,parallel,Azimuthal anisotropy harmonics from long-range correlations in high multiplicity pp collisions at CMS,"Chen, Zhenyu",Rice University (US),USA,"Observation of a long-range, near-side, two-particle correlation (known as the “Ridge”) in high-multiplicity pp and pPb collisions opened up new opportunities of exploring novel QCD dynamics in small collision systems. While extensive studies of this long-range correlation phenomenon in pPb collisions have revealed its collective properties, the nature of the ridge in pp collisions still remains unknown. New measurements of two-particle angular correlations for charged particles, and identified $K^0_s$ and $\Lambda$ particles emitted in 7 TeV pp collisions are presented using the CMS detector. With the implementation of a high-multiplicity trigger during the 2010 LHC pp run, CMS is capable of probing the most exotic high multiplicity pp collisions. The second-order ($v_2$) and third-order ($v_3$) anisotropy harmonics of charged particles, $K^0_s$ and $\Lambda$ particles are extracted from long-range correlations as a function of particle multiplicity and $p_T$, after correcting for the contribution of back-to-back jet correlations. Four-particle cumulants ($c_2${4}) are also measured for charged particles as a function of multiplicity. The results are compared to 5.02 TeV pPb data covering a similar range of particle multiplicity.

The data were recorded using the CMS detector at the LHC. It has recently been shown that factorization breaking of two-particle azimuthal correlations can be attributed to the effect of initial-state fluctuations. Using a PCA approach, Fourier coefficients of observed two-particle azimuthal correlations as a function of both particles' $p_T$ are characterized into leading and subleading mode terms. The leading modes are essentially equivalent to anisotropy harmonics ($v_n$) previously extracted from event-plane or two-particle correlation methods as a function of $p_T$. The subleading modes represent the largest sources of factorization breaking. In the context of hydrodynamic models, they are a direct consequence of initial-state fluctuations, particularly providing new insights on the radial excitations of initial-state eccentricity. The results are presented over a wide range of centrality and event multiplicity, and are compared to hydrodynamic predictions.

The experimental measurements, however, can be performed only
for momentum-space (or pesudo-) rapidity.
The latter is usually used as a proxy of the former implicitly.
However, thermal motion blurs this one-to-one correspondence.

We investigate this effect quantitatively,

Electromagnetic Probes I,parallel,Jet fragmentation photons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Hattori, Koichi",RIKEN-BNL Research Center,USA,"Electromagnetic probes have been expected to be penetrating probes of the early-time dynamics and quark-gluon plasma. Indeed, the photon spectra measured in the recent RHIC and LHC experiments provide us with an opportunity to deepen understanding of the photon emission mechanism, as they have significantly larger anisotropies compared to theoretical estimates by the hydrodynamic modeling of the bulk properties, implying a missing photon production mechanism giving rise to the large anisotropy. This also implies that the sensible production mechanism should be able to provide a good amount of photons so the anisotropy survives in averaging over various photon sources.

We discuss a photon production mechanism associated with the fragmentation of jets of quarks and antiquarks. We show theoretical estimates of the photon yield obtained from a convolution of the phenomenological jet distribution and the photon emission rate by the bremsstrahlung after the hard parton scatterings at the impact of heavy-ion collisions. 

Our estimate shows a significant photon yield in a few GeV transverse momentum range and a power low behavior. This transverse momentum dependence may be consistent with a recent observation that the photon spectra measured in distinct collision energies can be fitted by power low exponents and the saturation momentum which characterizes the energy scale before and just after the collisions [Klein-Boesing, McLerran, Phys. Lett. B 741 (2015)]. An implication from this observation is the early-time emission of photons before other scales come into play. As a possible interpretation of the early-time emission, we argue that the power low behavior of the phenomenological jet distribution with an infrared cutoff by the saturation momentum is taken over by the photon spectrum. We also discuss anisotropy of the photon spectrum due to the jet energy loss which captures the anisotropic spatial geometry of the matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Koichi', 'last_name': 'Hattori', 'fullName': 'Hattori, Koichi', 'id': '933556', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN-BNL Research Center', 'emailHash': '249a701e18344f65bedc16d4b398fab6', 'db_id': 933556, 'person_id': 998985}"
QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Effects produced by multi-parton interactions and color reconnection in small systems,"Paic, Guy",Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX),MX,"Multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) have raised special interest due to the fact that they can produce QGP-like effects in small systems, specifically, flow-like patterns. Now we will show that the same mechanisms produce an explicit dependence of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra with the number of constituent quarks. In addition, a Cronin-like peak, at intermediate transverse momentum (2 $<  p_{\rm T} <$ 10 GeV/$c$), and a sort of binary scaling, at higher $p_{\rm T}$, are also observed in events with large number of MPI in pp collisions. While those effects have been revealed in pA collisions at  RHIC and at  LHC. In pp collisions, the last two effects have not been reported. This suggests that if MPI and CR are the mechanisms which originate the observed effects, then, the conditions for jet quenching would not be satisfied in small systems.

In addition, we will discuss the experimental challenges to select on MPI. Specifically, the limitations and the biases of the event multiplicity, when, it is calculated in certain kinematic regions. We will show that such a selection can be improved using new approaches based on event shapes. Among the findings we will report that the multiplicity selection bias may affect the average \pt at high multiplicity, producing the so-called second rise of $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ as reported by the ALICE Collaboration. Also, it will be argued that the average expansion velocity extracted from the analysis of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra can be increased by the same kind of bias.

We perform 3+1 dimensional anomalous hydrodynamic simulations, with constitutive equations that contain the anomaly-induced effects. We also develop a model of the initial condition for the axial charge that captures the statistical nature of random chirality imbalance created by color flux tubes. Basing on the event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for hundreds of thousands of collisions, we calculate the correlation functions that are measured in experiments, and discuss how the anomalous transports affect the observables.

Jets and High pT Hadrons I,parallel,Interplay between Mach cone and radial expansion in jet events,"Tachibana, Yasuki","Nishina Center, RIKEN",Unknown,"As we see expansion of bulk quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions is well described by relativistic hydrodynamics, fluidity is one of the key properties of the QGP. At the same time, the QGP has a large stopping power against propagation of jets: The jets lose a large amount of their energies while traversing the QGP fluid due to strong interactions between them. The deposited energy of the jet induces a shock wave, a.k.a. Mach cone, in the QGP as a hydrodynamic response. Such a hydrodynamic response is also a clear manifestation of the fluidity of the QGP. Since the structure of shock wave is characterized by various properties of the QGP, e.g., sound velocity, stopping power, and viscosity, we have a great opportunity to extract the property of the QGP by analyzing this phenomenon.

We study the hydrodynamic response to jet propagation in the expanding QGP and investigate how it reflects the particle spectra after the hydrodynamic evolution of the bulk QGP. We perform simulations of the bulk dynamics of the QGP specifically in di-jet and gamma-jet events by solving (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms. Mach cones are formed and largely develops in the QGP fluid. However, the double peak in the azimuthal particle distribution, which is believed to be an intuitive signal of the Mach cone, is smeared out by the diffusion wake, the distortion by the radial flow and freeze-out processes. Instead, we find a novel phenomenon of the interplay between the Mach cone and radial expansion when the jets travel through the off-central trajectories: Propagation of Mach cone pushes back the radial flow. As a result, the particle production is suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation. This is the direct signal of hydrodynamic response to jet propagation and even includes the information about the jet passage in the expanding QGP fluid.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yasuki', 'last_name': 'Tachibana', 'fullName': 'Tachibana, Yasuki', 'id': '933815', 'affiliation': 'Nishina Center, RIKEN', 'emailHash': '601eb4b4a9f614e3bed0e069c852b5f0', 'db_id': 933815, 'person_id': 999275}"

confront our model with available single jet, dijet and photon-jet data in

the model by incorporating the transverse momentum picked up by
each parton in the shower as it propagates through the medium, at
the expense of adding a second free parameter.  We use this model to
discuss the influence of the transverse broadening of the partons in a jet

It can neither be accounted for in a collinear factorized formalism with process-independent fragmentation functions, nor can it be understood as a final state modification of the final state parton shower (on which standard jet quenching models in nucleus-nucleus collisions are based). We argue that these findings, point to a process-dependent element in the high-$p_T$ fragmentation mechanism. We note that the color recombination mechanisms implemented in general purpose event generators like SHERPA provide for such a process-dependent mechanism, since they imply that single inclusive hadron production depends not only on the factorized hard partonic interaction,
but also on the density of the underlying event within which this hard process color recombines during hadronization. We demonstrate both on the level of qualitative arguments and with Monte Carlo simulations that by simply accounting for the factor 3 higher underlying event activity in pA collisions as compared to pp collisions, this mechanism can account for
the observed nuclear modification factors of  jet and hadron spectra in pA collisions. We emphasize that if the proposed mechanism is confirmed, it has interesting consequences for the understanding of high-pT hadron spectra in proton-proton collisions, since it allows one to quantify the size of a process-dependent correction to the standard collinearly factorized framework.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Urs', 'last_name': 'Wiedemann', 'fullName': 'Wiedemann, Urs', 'id': '933843', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'b3e9ac8536071cc26fac1dbcff7b76ac', 'db_id': 933843, 'person_id': 999287}"

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,Charge-dependent anisotropic flow in Cu+Au collisions,"Niida, Takafumi",Wayne State University,United States,"At the early stages of non-central heavy-ion collisions, a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane is created. In asymmetric Cu+Au collisions, due to the difference in the number of spectators, not only the magnetic field but also a strong electric field (E-field) would be created along the reaction plane and pointing from the Au-nucleus to Cu-nucleus. The lifetime of the E-field would be short, of the order of a fraction of a fm/c. The quarks and antiquarks that have been already produced at this time would experience the Coulomb force, which result in charge separation of directed flow. Thus, the measurement of the charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au provides an opportunity to test different quark (charge) scenarios, e.g Pratt’s two-wave quark production, and shed light on the (anti-)quark production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions in general. Understanding the time evolution of the quark densities in heavy-ion collisions is also very important for detailed theoretical predictions of the Chiral Magnetic Effect and Chiral Magnetic Wave, which various experiments are actively searching for.
￼The transverse-momentum dependence of the directed (dipole) flow in Cu+Au collision is also very sensitive to the system initial density gradients in the transverse plane, which can only be observed in symmetric systems as a result of density fluctuations. Measurements of the higher-harmonic flow also allows further study of hydrodynamics and the properties of QGP.

Both elastic processes and number changing inelastic processes are taken into account. The semi-analytical solutions that we obtain complement discussions based on parametric estimates, or purely numerical solutions, and provide new insights on the  interplay of elastic and inelastic collisions during the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma.

We show that one can scale these measurements by quantities involving
lower-order harmonics in such a way that the
ratio is independent of initial conditions, and solely involves the
medium nonlinear response.
The resulting ratios allow to directly confront hydrodynamics with
experimental data [1].

We construct four independent such ratios involving $v_4$, $v_5$ and
$v_6$ and extract their values from LHC data on Pb+Pb collisions, as a
function of centrality.
We then calculate these ratios using single-shot hydrodynamics and
using the transport model AMPT [2].
Model calculations are in very good agreement with data.
We point out that hydrodynamics predicts simple scaling relations
between these response coefficients, which can be read off directly from
data.

A substantial response ratio in the seventh harmonic is found
in theoretical calculations (both in AMPT and in hydrodynamics), from
which we argue that a nonzero $v_7$ signal should be seen when
measured with respect to elliptic and triangular flow. We present
predictions for $v_7$ versus centrality in Pb+Pb collisions at the

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness IV,parallel,Heavy quark suppression and D-hadron (D-D) correlations in heavy-ion collisions,"Cao, Shanshan",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,USA,"Heavy quarks are valuable probes of the dense nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a comprehensive framework that describes their entire temporal evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadron gas. The dynamics of open heavy quarks in the QGP is described using either an improved Langevin approach [1,2] or a linearized Boltzmann approach [3] that both simultaneously incorporate the quasi-elastic scattering and medium-induced gluon radiation processes. The hadronization of heavy quarks into their mesonic bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid model of fragmentation plus heavy-light quark coalescence [1,2]. And the final rescatterings of heavy hadrons inside the hadron gas are described using the UrQMD model. 

Within this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; and the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate $p_\rm{T}$. Our numerical results provide a good description of the $R_\rm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of both $D$ meson and $B$-decay non-prompt $J/\psi$ measured at RHIC and LHC. 

In addition, two-particle correlation functions of heavy flavor are explored [4]. We show that while the nuclear modification of the $p_\rm{T}$ imbalance of $D-\bar{D}$ pairs reflects the total energy loss of heavy quarks, their angular correlations are sensitive to the detailed energy loss mechanisms. $D$-hadron correlations are also calculated and shown to be a potential observable quantifying the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles.

 provided and give a much stronger longitudinal decorrelation, indicating
 larger fluctuations along the pseudorapidity direction for lower energy

 charged hadrons in momentum space comes from initial state decorrelation
 in space, while the hydrodynamic evolution is important to transfer the

Collective Dynamics IV,parallel,Pinning down QCD-matter shear viscosity in A+A collisions via EbyE fluctuations using pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics,"Niemi, Harri",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"We compute the initial fluctuating QCD-matter energy densities produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions from NLO perturbative QCD using a saturation conjecture to control soft particle production [1], and describe the subsequent space-time evolution of the system with dissipative fluid dynamics [2], event by event [3]. The resulting centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, and flow coefficients from this pQCD + saturation + hydro (""EKRT"") framework are then compared simultaneously to the LHC and RHIC measurements. We also show that the computed probability distributions of relative event-by-event fluctuations of the flow coefficients, that mostly constrain the initial conditions, match well with the LHC measurements.  With such a systematic multi-energy and multi-observable analysis we can test the initial state calculation and applicability of hydrodynamics, and also constrain the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio of QCD matter in its different phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correlations of two and three event-plane angles provide additional constraints to the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity. As shown in [3], we can describe all these different flow coefficients and correlations remarkably consistently with the shear viscosity that is independent of the collision energy. Using these constraints from the current RHIC and LHC measurements we then predict the charged hadron multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, flow coefficients and event-plane correlations for the forthcoming 5 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions.

Correlations and Fluctuations III,parallel,Observable consequences of event-by-event fluctuations of HBT radii,"Plumberg, Christopher",The Ohio State University,USA,"One of the major lessons from the field of heavy-ion physics in the past several years has been the significance of the role played by event-by-event fluctuations in the evolution of a heavy-ion collision.  Their important effects on many momentum-space observables (particle yields and spectra, anisotropic flows, etc.) have already been studied systematically, and some of the properties of their event-by-event distributions, and their consequences for the extraction of medium properties such as the specific viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), are already known.

In this talk it is pointed out that similar event-by-event fluctuations of spatiotemporal observables provide complementary constraints on our understanding of the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The relation of Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii extracted from ensemble-averaged correlation function measurements to the mean of their event-by-event probability distribution is clarified, and a method to experimentally determine the mean and variance of this distribution is proposed and demonstrated using an ensemble of fluctuating events generated with the viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. The sensitivity of the mean and variance of the HBT radii to the specific QGP shear viscosity $\eta/s$ is studied using simulations with the same code. We report sensitivity of the mean pion HBT radii and their variances to the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ near the quark-hadron transition at a level similar (10-20%) to that which was previously observed for elliptic and quadrangular flow of charged hadrons.

Photons and neutral mesons ($\pi^{0}$, $\eta$, $\omega$) are reconstructed via complementary methods, using the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters, PHOS and EMCal, and by the central tracking system, identifying photons converted into $e^+e^-$ pairs in the material of the inner barrel detectors (TPC and ITS).  Prompt direct photons produced in Compton ($q+g \rightarrow \gamma+q$) and annihilation ($q+\bar{q} \rightarrow \gamma+g$) processes can be identified in the EMCal calorimeter combining two techniques: electromagnetic shower shape analysis; and isolation cut analysis (no other particle production along the photon direction in the hard process), making use of the measured particle activity in the EMCal and in reconstructed tracks close to the prompt photon candidate. These methods are efficient in getting rid of photons from neutral meson decays ($\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$), dominant at high-energy collisions produced at LHC.

Measurements of isolated photons and neutral meson spectra in pp collisions provide valuable data for pQCD calculations and allow us to study scaling properties of hadron production at LHC energies and to constrain the proton parton distribution function.  ALICE measured the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ for the $\pi^{0}$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV at different collision centralities showing a clear pattern of strong suppression in a hot QCD medium with respect to $pp$ collisions.

early dynamics in  heavy-ion collisions. Among all  open charm
mesons, $D_{s}^{+}(c\bar s)$ and $D_{s}^{-}(\bar c s)$ mesons play a unique role to quantify
heavy quark diffusion and hadronization in heavy-ion collisions, because of their valence quark compositions.  Also, like multi-strange hadrons,  $D_{s}^{\pm}$ mesons are expected to freeze out early and have smaller hadronic interaction cross-section 
compared with other $D$ mesons. Therefore, the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium I,parallel,Initial state azimuthal anisotropies in small collision systems,"Lappi, Tuomas",University of Jyvaskyla,Unknown,"Recent experimental results have revealed a surprisingly rich structure of  multiparticle azimuthal correlations in high energy proton-nucleus collisions. Final state collective effects can be responsible for many of the observed effects, but it has recently been shown that a part of these correlations are present already in the wavefunctions of the colliding particles. A domain structure at length scales of the inverse saturation scale, present in the classical color field of a high energy nucleus, naturally leads to such multiparticle correlations. This talk discusses recent work on azimuthal anisotropy coefficients originating from the initial stage color fields. In particular, we describe a recent calculation [1] of the momentum space 2-particle cumulant azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v_n{2}, n=2,3,4 from fundamental representation Wilson line distributions describing the high energy nucleus. These would correspond to the flow coefficients in very forward proton-nucleus scattering. This calculation finds significant differences between Wilson lines from the MV model and from JIMWLK evolution. The talk also discusses the relation [2] of this calculation to earlier work on the ridge correlation obtained in  the ""glasma graph"" approximation [3], and to the ""field domain model"" [4] where the correlations would originate from a novel nongaussian fluctuation structure in the nuclear color field.

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,The influence of pre-equilibrium dynamics on heavy-ion collision observables,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,USA,"In order to bracket the importance of the pre-equilibrium stage on relativistic heavy-ion collision observables at RHIC and LHC energies, we compare simulations in which the pre-equilibrium stage is modeled by free-streaming partons with others where it is modeled fluid dynamically. The first (second) case implements the assumption of extremely weak (strong) coupling in the initial collision stage. We introduce a switching time parameter for the duration of the weakly coupled stage; after this time the system is assumed to stay in the strongly coupled hydrodynamic stage (with a specific shear viscosity that we can vary) until freeze-out. Based on event-by-event simulations of fluctuating initial conditions, we first study observables (radial, elliptic and triangular flow) systematically as a function of the switching time from free-streaming to viscous hydrodynamics (""thermalization time""), leaving other parameters fixed. We then perform a three-dimensional simultaneous parameter fit of the switching time, specific shear viscosity and freeze-out temperature by comparing the numerical results with a set of 5 experimental observables, for four different types of initial conditions. We find that the strongest constraint on the thermalization time does not come of anisotropic flow measurements, as previously thought, but from the mean transverse momentum of hadrons with different masses (i.e. radial flow). First results from a campaign that includes bulk viscous effect and a hadronic afterburner to describe the freeze-out stage, with particular focus on the mass-ordering of the elliptic and triangular flow for protons and Lambda hyperons which is incorrectly described by VISHNU without pre-equilibrium flow, will also be shown.

Jets and High pT Hadrons IV,parallel,Jet suppression and the flavor dependence of partonic energy loss with ATLAS,"Kosek, Tomas",Charles University (CZ),CZ,"In relativistic heavy ion collisions, a hot medium with a high density of unscreened color charges is produced. One manifestation of the energy loss of jets propagating through the medium is a lower yield of jets emerging from the medium than  expected in the absence of medium effects. Therefore modifications of the jet yield are directly sensitive to the energy loss mechanism. Furthermore, jets with different  flavor content are expected to be affected by the medium in different ways. Parton showers initiated by quarks tend to have fewer fragments carrying a larger fraction of  the total jet energy than those resulting from gluons. Jets containing heavy quarks may lose less energy as the large quark mass suppresses the amount of medium-induced  radiation. This would lead to different relative contributions of inelastic and elastic energy loss. In this talk, the latest ATLAS results on single jet suppression will  be presented. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor, RAA, for fully reconstructed jets are shown. The rapidity dependence of jet suppression is discussed, which  is sensitive to the relative energy loss between quark and gluon jets. New measurements of single hadron suppression out to pT~150 GeV are also presented, which provide  complementary information to the jet suppression measurements. Finally, a new measurement of the RAA for b-tagged jets is presented. At low b-jet pT, the role of the  heavy quark mass is expected to be maximal and b-jets are dominated by hard scattering processes where the b quark carries most of the momentum. As the jet pT increases,  the flavor dependence of the energy loss is expected to be reduced and a significant contribution to b quark production develops from gluon splitting in the parton shower.  This measurement covers a kinematic range including both regimes and the interplay between the various effects is discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomas', 'last_name': 'Kosek', 'fullName': 'Kosek, Tomas', 'id': '934163', 'affiliation': 'Charles University (CZ)', 'emailHash': '5638f8d678265a695ebd21a9e4519f77', 'db_id': 934163, 'person_id': 999445}"

Correlation measurements of heavy particles extend the range over which the transverse mass dependence of the source radii can be studied and thus can serve, as a tool to learn about the dynamics of he deconfined medium. Particularly, we compare the measured 3D kaon radii with a model where the hydrodynamic phase is succeeded by a hadronic rescattering phase and a purely hydrodynamical calculation. The latter predicts an approximate mT scaling of source radii obtained from pion and kaon correlations. This $m_{\mathrm{T}}$ scaling appears broken in our data, which indicates strong rescattering in the hadronic phase at LHC energies.

Event-by-event fluctuations are estimated by measuring the asymmetry in the energy deposited by spectator neutrons in the zero-degree calorimeters on either side of the interaction vertex. The effect of these fluctuations on the pseudorapidity distributions of produced particles in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV is investigated for the first time. The results from the ALICE detector will be presented for different centralities and compared with results from models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rashmi', 'last_name': 'Raniwala', 'fullName': 'Raniwala, Rashmi', 'id': '934170', 'affiliation': 'University of Rajasthan (IN)', 'emailHash': '0778047751528009268f3e8ea55d8c26', 'db_id': 934170, 'person_id': 999450}"
Jets and High pT Hadrons IV,parallel,New results on inclusive and reaction plane dependent dijet asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions with ATLAS,"Perepelitsa, Dennis Vadimovich",Brookhaven National Laboratory (US),USA,"The phenomenon of events containing highly asymmetric dijet pairs is one of the most striking results in heavy ion physics. It has provided the first direct observation of in-medium jet energy loss at the LHC. Detailed measurements of centrality-dependent dijet imbalance in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV PbPb collisions using data collected in the 2011 LHC heavy ion run are presented. The new analysis fully corrects to the particle level. The results show a centrality-dependent modification of the dijet asymmetry distribution accompanied by an unmodified angular correlation between two jets in the dijet system. Detailed studies of the dijet asymmetry as a function of the leading jet transverse momentum and jet radius are presented. The reference measurement of the dijet asymmetry in the pp collisions at the same center of mass energy is also shown. The dijet asymmetry measurements are also done while selecting the leading jet at different angles with respect to the second order event-plane. This effectively probes the path-length dependence of the dijet asymmetry at fixed centrality. The variation of the dijet asymmetry with the soft particle $v_2$, at fixed centrality are also measured.
   To further constrain the energy loss models, the measurement of the correlations between jets that are at small relative angles was performed. The measured neighbouring jet pairs result primarily from hard radiation by the parton that occurs early in the process of the shower formation.
   These dijet and multijet measurements can provide a better understanding of the correlation of the parton energy-loss with the underlying geometry, help elucidating the role of the fluctuations in the energy loss as well as put some constrains to models in which a part of the parton shower radiates coherently in the response of the medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dennis Vadimovich', 'last_name': 'Perepelitsa', 'fullName': 'Perepelitsa, Dennis Vadimovich', 'id': '934173', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)', 'emailHash': '05b83b006d2a82b1427598a90d8b4548', 'db_id': 934173, 'person_id': 998993}"
Collective Dynamics III,parallel,Measurements of Correlations between Anisotropic Flow Harmonics in Pb–Pb Collisions in ALICE,"Zhou, You",Niels Bohr Institute (DK),DK,"Anisotropic flow is one of the key observables used to probe the properties and evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions. It was recently realized that event-by-event initial fluctuations lead to correlations between different harmonics (correlations of $v_{n}$ and $v_{m}$ when $n≠m$), present also in transport model calculations. The strengths of some of these correlations are much more sensitive to QGP transport properties (e.g. $\eta$/s) compared to standalone $v_{n}$ measurements [1]. In this talk, we report the first ALICE measurements of the correlation strength between various anisotropic flow harmonics. The correlation strength is characterized with multi-particle cumulants of mixed harmonics, which by construction depend only on the fluctuations of magnitudes of the anisotropic flow vectors. A detailed comparison to Monte Carlo models, including AMPT and HIJING, is also presented. These studies further constrain initial conditions, the properties and the evolution of the system in theoretical calculations of heavy-ion collisions.

Collective Dynamics I,parallel,Event shape engineering with the ALICE detector,"Timmins, Anthony Robert",University of Houston (US),United States,"Event shape engineering (ESE) is a differential technique, which involves selecting events based on their anisotropic flow, and studying other observables with respect to the magnitude of that flow [1]. These studies have been pursued by the ALICE, ATLAS, and PHENIX collaborations, and promise to open up a new paradigm in the era of high statistics heavy-ion data. We will show the latest results from the ALICE collaboration for Pb-Pb 2.76 TeV collisions. In particular, we will show new studies on event by event correlations of radial and anisotropic flow, and discuss how these studies can place extra constraints on the initial conditions. We will demonstrate how the pion, kaon, proton spectra evolve with the event-wise anisotropic flow, and use a blast wave model to determine changes in the radial flow velocity. We will also review the sensitivity of the ESE technique, by comparing results using different ALICE sub-detectors. Finally, we will discuss the feasibility of more statistically demanding ESE studies for the upcoming LHC run 2 and 3 data.

Collective Dynamics IV,parallel,Higher harmonic anisotropic flow of identified particles in Pb-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector,"Mohammadi, Naghmeh",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Netherlands,"Anisotropic flow plays a critical role in establishing the equation of state for the Quark Gluon Plasma. The results at the LHC have demonstrated that the matter created in heavy-ion collisions behaves as a nearly perfect fluid reflected in the low value of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\eta$/s). The higher flow harmonics are particularly sensitive to the value of $\eta$/s in hydrodynamic calculations. In this talk, we present the first ALICE results on $p_{\rm T}$ differential $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, $v_{4}$ and $v_{5}$ for π$^{\pm}$, K$^\pm$, $\mathrm{p}$($\overline{\mathrm{p}}$) from the high statistics 2011 heavy-ion run. We investigate how all $v_{n}$ coefficients evolve with particle mass and centrality for 0-1%, 20-30% and 40-50% centrality percentiles. These new measurements aim at differentiating between models that use different initial conditions, constraining further the value of $\eta$/s and allowing to decouple the influence of the late hadronic stage from the hydrodynamic evolution of the system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Naghmeh', 'last_name': 'Mohammadi', 'fullName': 'Mohammadi, Naghmeh', 'id': '934188', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': '24c9d13684e56502fd673207c63f315f', 'db_id': 934188, 'person_id': 999463}"
Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Forward-central two-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV,"Kryshen, Evgeny",CERN,Switzerland,"A double-ridge structure has been observed in two-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions at midrapidity and its origin is actively debated. Measurements at larger relative pseudorapidity can further improve our understanding of this phenomenon. The results on two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward pseudorapidity range (2.5 < |η| < 4.0) and associated particles at mid-rapidity (|η| < 1.0) in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV are reported in the talk. The trigger particles are detected by the ALICE muon spectrometer, and the associated particles by the ALICE central barrel tracking detectors. The reconstructed trigger particles mainly originate from weak decays of primary pions and kaons at low transverse momentum ($p_T$), and heavy-flavor particles at high $p_T$. The ridge is found to persist to the pseudorapidity ranges studied here, and the second-order Fourier coefficients for these measured trigger particles are extracted after subtracting the correlations obtained in low-multiplicity events from those in high-multiplicity events. The Fourier coefficients have a similar pT dependence in the p-going and Pb-going directions, and the ratio of Fourier coefficients in the two directions is calculated as a function of $p_T$. The results are compared with calculations from a parton-cascade model.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Evgeny', 'last_name': 'Kryshen', 'fullName': 'Kryshen, Evgeny', 'id': '934189', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '3f4b94bf0add83e3ad5c87e201ff78f7', 'db_id': 934189, 'person_id': 999464}"

Results on the multiplicity and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence measured with ALICE in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at 7 TeV, 5.02 TeV, 2.76 TeV are presented. The balance function in both ∆η and ∆φ becomes narrower with increasing multiplicity in all three systems for particles with 0.2 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c. The experimental findings favor models that either incorporate some collective behavior (e.g. AMPT) or mimic this using different mechanisms (e.g. PYTHIA8 with color reconnection). For higher values of transverse momenta the balance function becomes even narrower but exhibits no quantitative difference between the three systems. The results add constraints to models that describe collective effects down to small systems (for low values of $p_T$), and particle production mechanisms such as coalescence and fragmentation processes (for inter- mediate and high values of $p_T$).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Panos', 'last_name': 'Christakoglou', 'fullName': 'Christakoglou, Panos', 'id': '934190', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': 'eb31b84fa8a7711e6939eb76aa9f2876', 'db_id': 934190, 'person_id': 999465}"
