Poster Session,poster,"Characterizing the away-side jet, devoid of flow background, via two-particle and three-particle correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200~GeV in STAR","Jiang, Kun",University of Science and Technology of China & Purdue University,USA,"Jets are modified in relativistic heavy-ion collisions due to jet-medium interactions. Measurements of jet medium modifications have so far been obscure because of the large underlying anisotropic flow background. In this analysis we devise a novel method to subtract the flow background using data themselves. We select events with a large recoil momentum ($P_x$) within a pseudorapidity ($\eta$) window of $0.5<\eta<1$ ($-1<\eta<-0.5$) from a high-$p_T$ trigger particle to enhance the away-side jet population. Di-hadron azimuthal correlations are analyzed with associated particles in two $\eta$ ranges ($-0.5<\eta<0$ and $0<\eta<0.5$) symmetric about midrapidity, one (close-region) close to and the other (far-region) far away from the $P_x$ selection $\eta$ window. The away-side jet contributes to the ""close-region"" but not as much to the ""far-region"" due to the large $\eta$ gap, while the flow contributions are equal. Assuming the $\Delta\phi$ shape of jet-like correlations does not depend on $\Delta\eta$, the correlation difference measures the away-side jet shape where the anisotropic flow background is cleanly subtracted.  

The away-side jet correlation width is studied as a function of centrality and associated particle $p_T$. The width is found to increase with centrality at modest to high associated particle $p_T$. The increase can arise from jet-medium modifications, event averaging of away-side jets deflected by medium flow, and/or simply nuclear $k_T$ broadening. To further discriminate various physics mechanisms, a three-particle correlation analysis is conducted with robust flow background subtraction also using data themselves.  Based on this analysis we discuss possible physics mechanisms of away-side broadening of jet-like correlations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kun', 'last_name': 'Jiang', 'fullName': 'Jiang, Kun', 'id': '932682', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China & Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'c5cfb8bf3d5d9d9332aaf35b84383fc0', 'db_id': 932682, 'person_id': 998475}"
Poster Session,poster,Modelling Early Stages of Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions: Coupling Relativistic Transport Theory to Decaying Color-electric Flux Tubes,"Ruggieri, Marco","Physics and Astronomy Department, Catania University",Unknown,"In this study we 
model early times dynamics of relativistic heavy ion collisions by an initial color electric field
which then decays to a plasma by the Schwinger mechanism,
coupling the dynamical evolution of the initial color field
to the dynamics of the many particles system produced by the decay. 
The latter
is described by relativistic kinetic theory in which we fix the ratio 
$\eta/s$ rather than insisting on specific microscopic processes,
and the backreaction on the color field is taken into account by solving
self-consistently the kinetic and the field equations.
Within a single self-consistent calculation scheme
we address the problems of isotropization and thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma
produced by the field decay, as well as the quark-gluon plasma formation time
and its chemical equilibration,
both for $1+1$D and $3+1$D expanding geometry.
We find that regardless of the viscosity of the produced plasma,
longitudinal pressure becomes positive within 0.2 fm/c.
The initial color electric field decays within $1$ fm/c;
however in the case $\eta/s$ is large, plasma oscillations appear
and affect the entire time evolution of the system. 
In case of small $\eta/s$  ($\eta/s$<0.3)
we find $\tau_{isotropization}\approx 0.8$ fm/c
and $\tau_{thermalization}\approx 1$ fm/c.
Moreover quark-gluon plasma production occurs in $\tau_{qgp}< 1$ fm/c,
and almost perfect chemical equilibration takes place within 1 fm/c.
Hence our work supports the common assumptions of hydrodynamics about 
thermalization, isotropization and equilibration of quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marco', 'last_name': 'Ruggieri', 'fullName': 'Ruggieri, Marco', 'id': '932706', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '7dbee3a50d9dfce54118a7c749886eda', 'db_id': 932706, 'person_id': 998497}"

Collective Dynamics IV,parallel,Elliptic Anisotropy $v_2$ May Be Dominated by Particle Escape instead of Hydrodynamic Flow,"Lin, Zi-Wei",ECU,Unknown,"It is commonly believed that azimuthal anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collisions are generated by hydrodynamic evolution of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma. Recently, apparent anisotropy signals have been observed in small systems of proton- and deuteron-nucleus collisions, and the signals can again be described by hydrodynamics. A natural question is why hydrodynamics still seems to be applicable to such small systems. Since A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT), like hydrodynamics, has been quite successful in describing a large amount of experimental data, we investigate the generation of anisotropies in AMPT by analyzing the complete parton collision history. We also use another transport model, the MPC/Cascade, to check the model dependence of our results.

To our surprise, we find [1] that the majority of $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons, not from the parton collective flow, for semi-central Au+Au collisions at 200A GeV. Hydrodynamic-type collective flow will eventually dominate over the escape mechanism at unrealistically large parton cross sections. However, even at the parton cross section of 40 mb, the escape mechanism still contributes to about one-third of the final parton $v_2$. The picture is qualitatively the same from both transport models, and for the smaller d+Au system the escape mechanism is more dominant as expected. Our results thus show that elliptic anisotropy $v_2$ is dominated by particle escape instead of hydrodynamic flow in transport models. If confirmed, our finding could change the paradigm of anisotropic flow. Our results also suggest the need for hydrodynamics to include the escape mechanism, without which the extracted viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$) ratio would be severely underestimated.

Quarkonia IV,parallel,$J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ measurements in the di-muon channel in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV  with the STAR experiment,"Ma, Rongrong",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Measurements of quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions have played an essential role in understanding the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in such collisions. In particular, $J/\psi$ suppression in the medium has been proposed as a direct probe of the QGP formation, where quarks and gluons are the relevant degrees of freedom. However,  regeneration of $J/\psi$ from uncorrelated $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks in the medium adds extra complications to the interpretation of $J/\psi$ suppression. The measurement of the second order harmonic coefficient ($v_{2}$) for $J/\psi$ would help disentangle different production mechanisms since the regenerated $J/\psi$ is expected to inherit the flow of the charm quarks while the primordial $J/\psi$  should have almost zero $v_{2}$. On the other hand, the contribution from regeneration to $\Upsilon$, $b\bar{b}$ bound states, is much smaller at RHIC energies, making them ideal probes to study the color-screening feature. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), designed to trigger on and identify muons based on precise timing information, was fully installed in STAR at mid-rapidity. Due to the low trigger threshold on muon $p_{\rm{T}}$, the MTD trigger has a relatively high efficiency for low $p_{\rm{T}}$ $J/\psi$, where the regeneration contribution is expected to be the largest. Moreover, the MTD opens the door for separating different $\Upsilon$ states for the first time at STAR as the Bremsstrahlung radiation for muons is much smaller compared to electrons. In this talk, we present the measurements of $J/\psi$ suppression, quantified as the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{AA}}$,  and $v_{2}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV down to zero $p_{\rm{T}}$.

in a Polyakov-loop enhanced chiral model of QCD. As a counterpart of the dressed Polyakov-loop, the first Fourier
moment of pion condensate is introduced for $\mu_I>{m_\pi}/{2}$ under the temporal twisted boundary
conditions for quarks. We confirm this dual condensate exhibits the similar temperature dependence as the
conventional Polyakov-loop. We demonstrate that its rapid increase with $T$ is driven by the evaporating of
pion condensation. On the other hand, the dressed Polyakov-loop shows abnormal thermal behavior, which even
decreases with $T$ at low temperatures due to the influence of pion condensate. We thus argue that in QCD
the critical temperature extracting from a dual observable may have nothing to do with the quark
confinement-deconfinement transition if the quark mass is very small.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhao', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Zhao', 'id': '932795', 'affiliation': 'NCEPU', 'emailHash': '576d5490e5604e9c912eb1491cccf6ea', 'db_id': 932795, 'person_id': 998578}"

This collective phenomena is know as anisotropic flow, and successfully parameterized by a Fourier harmonics. The correlation between different flow harmonics may provide a new window into both the early stage dynamics and transport properties of QGP Several flow observables have been studied by measuring moments [1], with two symmetric sub-events group separated by a single rapidity gap. The advantage of using this method is that we can suppress non-flow (e.g from jets and/or resonances) in addition to suppressing self-correlation effects. We measure the correlation between different flow harmonics  (both magnitude and event plane angle direction) and estimate non-linear coefficients of the hydrodynamic response In this presentation, our methods will be discussed in detail, and our results will be compared to the AMPT simulation and various hydrodynamic calculations.

study the initial state of the high-energy heavy-ion collisions. FoCal com-
prises two calorimeters: an electro-magnetic calorimeter (FoCal-E) to mea-

H) to improve isolation and jet measurements. FoCal-E consists of low-
granularity silicon-pad (PAD) modules and high-granularity silicon-pixel (Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors: MAPS) modules, and has been designed as a Si+W sampling calorimeter.
In the current design, the FoCal-E structure consists of four PAD modules

precise location of the position of the shower and the two-shower separation,
while the PAD modules are essential for a good measurement of the shower
energy. One PAD module has four layers each consisting of a tungsten tile
and an 8x8 silicon photodiode(of size 11.3x11.3 mm2) array, respectively.
The summed signal of four photodiode cells in same lateral position is read
out via a summing board and APV25 hybrid chips.

This is accomplished by assuming that the one-particle distribution function is ellipsoidally-symmetric in the momenta conjugate to the de Sitter coordinates used to parameterize the Gubser flow. We then demonstrate that the SO(3)_q symmetry in de Sitter space further constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form. The resulting system of two coupled ordinary differential equations for the de Sitter-space momentum scale and anisotropy parameter are solved numerically and compared to a recently obtained exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We show that anisotropic hydrodynamics describes the spatio-temporal evolution of the system better than all currently known dissipative hydrodynamics approaches. In addition, we prove that anisotropic hydrodynamics gives the exact solution of the relaxation-time approximation Boltzmann equation in the ideal, eta/s -> 0, and free-streaming, eta/s -> infinity, limits.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Strickland', 'fullName': 'Strickland, Michael', 'id': '933070', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University', 'emailHash': '115cd550a1295459b4ffe5c86a279a76', 'db_id': 933070, 'person_id': 998527}"

Due to their large masses, the production process of heavy quarks is essentially restricted to primordial nucleon-nucleon collisions. Thus, heavy quarks are clean probes to study the hot and dense matter because they carry information about the entire time-evolution of the medium.
The Silicon Vertex Tracker (VTX) was installed in the RHIC-PHENIX detector in year 2011.
The VTX was designed to give precise tracking reconstructions of the distance of closest approach (DCA) to the collision vertex in order to distinguish prompt particles from in-flight decays. In this way, we will be able to statistically separate electrons from semi-leptonic decay of heavy flavor hadrons. In order to extract the heavy flavor contributions from DCA     distribution, understanding of background and its subtraction from the DCA distribution play crucial roles.

We show that the theoretical simulations could give nice descriptions of PHENIX data on $\eta$ meson in both $\rm p+p$ and central $\rm Au+Au$ at the RHIC, and also provide numerical predictions of $\eta$ spectra in central $\rm Pb+Pb$ collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$~TeV at the LHC.  The ratios of $\eta/\pi^0$ in $\rm p+p$ and in central $\rm Au+Au$ collisions at $200$~GeV are found to overlap in a wide $p_T$ region, which matches well the measured ratio $\eta / \pi^0$ by PHENIX. We demonstrate that, at the asymptotic region when $p_{T} \rightarrow \infty$ the ratios of $\eta/\pi^{0}$ in both $\rm Au+Au$ and $\rm p+p$ are almost determined only by quark jets fragmentation and thus approach to the one in $e^{+} e^{-}$ scattering; in addition, the almost identical gluon (quark) contribution fractions to $\eta$ and to $\pi$ result in a rather moderate variation of $\eta/\pi^{0}$ distribution at intermediate and high $p_T$ region in $\rm A+A$ relative to that in $\rm p+p$; while a slight higher $\eta/\pi^{0}$ at small $p_T$ in $\rm Au+Au$ can be observed due to larger suppression of gluon contribution fraction to $\pi^{0}$ as compared to the one to $\eta$.

Poster Session,poster,Influence of quantum conservation laws on particle production in hadron collisions,"Janik, Malgorzata Anna",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Conservation laws strongly influence particle production. Effects connected to this mechanism were studied in details using correlation techniques in $e^+e^-$ collisions. At the time models were tuned to correctly reproduce measured data [1]. Similar studies for hadron-hadron collisions have never been performed, until recent ALICE measurement [2]. ALICE reported on studies of untriggered two-particle angular correlations of identified particles ($\pi$, K, and p) measured in pp collisions at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} =$ 7 TeV. The ALICE results confirm that also in hadron-hadron collisions conservation laws strongly influence the shape of the correlation functions for different particle types and must be taken into account while analysing the data. Moreover, now, when ALICE results are available, it can be observed that the contemporary models (Pythia, Phojet) no longer reproduce the data well. It should be noted, that also in heavy-ion collisions conservation laws (i.e. local charge conservation) provide crucial elements that are needed to describe experimental data [3]. 

In the talk we would like to present a brief history of experimental measurements of correlations induced by conservation laws, also including the newest Preliminary results from ALICE. We explain interesting structures observed in ALICE LHC data employing a dedicated model, called CALM (ConservAtion Laws Model). CALM is a model developed to study analytically the influence of the conservation laws on the shape of the $\Delta\eta\Delta\phi$ correlation functions. With this model we demonstrate that local conservation of charge, strangeness, and baryon number in hadron production mechanism is essential for description of experimental data.

(DE),Germany,"The study of event-by-event fluctuations of identified hadrons may reveal the degrees of freedom of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions and reflect the underlying dynamics of the system. The observable $\nu_{dyn}$ , which is given in terms of the moments of identified-particle multiplicity distributions, is used to quantify the magnitude of the dynamical fluctuations in event-by- event measurements of given particle ratios. The ALICE detector at the LHC is well suited for the study of $\nu_{dyn}$, due to its excellent particle identification capabilities.
Particle identification that is based on the measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss dE/dx works well on a statistical basis, but suffers from ambiguities when applied on the event-by- event level. A novel experimental technique called the ""Identity Method"" was recently proposed to overcome such limitations. The method follows a probabilistic approach using the inclusive dE/dx distributions measured in the ALICE TPC, and determines the moments of the multiplicity distributions by an unfolding procedure. In this contribution, an analysis of identified particle ratio fluctuations that applies the Identity Method to Pb-Pb data from ALICE will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mesut', 'last_name': 'Arslandok', 'fullName': 'Arslandok, Mesut', 'id': '932935', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Since leptons do not interact strongly, they carry information from all collision stages with negligible final state interaction. While pp collisions provide a reference measurement for a medium-free environment, the impact of cold nuclear matter effects on the dielectron production can be estimated from p-Pb collisions. Moreover, the measurement of low-mass dileptons has a high sensitivity to the production of charmed mesons at low $p_{T}$ via their decay into correlated $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs.

Poster Session,poster,QGP properties from azimuthal-angular dependence of charged-pion interferometry,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Recently the results of HBT measurements of charged pions with respect to the second and third order event plane are presented by PHENIX [1]. They extract $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT measurements which contain information about not only the source shape at freezeout but also the space-time evolution of QGP matter.  They show the relation between initial $\epsilon_{2, 3}$ which are obtained from a Glauber model and final $\epsilon_{2,3}$ which are extracted from the HBT radii. They find that the final $\epsilon_2$ from the HBT radii is finite and smaller than the initial $\epsilon_2$. On the other hand, the final $\epsilon_3$ is significantly reduced and potential reversed by the end in spite of existence of finite initial $\epsilon_3$. The interesting different response of $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$  during space-time evolution gives us a clue to understand the detailed QGP properties. 

For analyses of such high statistics experimental results, we develop a state of the art numerical scheme of causal viscous hydrodynamics for relativistic heavy ion collisions, which has a shock-wave capturing scheme and less numerical dissipation [2]. Furthermore, using the hydrodynamic algorithm, we construct a hybrid model of hydrodynamic model plus UrQMD to include the realistic freezeout processes.  Using the model we investigate the time evolution of spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$. We find that the sign of $\epsilon_3$ changes from positive to negative during the space-time evolution, which suggests a solution of the vanishing final $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii by PHENIX. From detailed analyses,  we discuss the initial conditions of hydrodynamic model and the detailed QGP properties such as transport coefficients.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness I,parallel,Violation of mass ordering for multi-strange hadrons at RHIC and LHC,"Takeuchi, Shiori",Sophia Univ,Unknown,"We study effects of hadronic rescattering on final observables for
multi-strange hadrons in high-energy nuclear collisions within an
integrated dynamical model. We simulate the whole collision process on
an event-by-event basis by using a fully (3+1)-dimensional ideal
hydrodynamic description for the quark gluon plasma (QGP) and a
subsequent kinetic transport description for the hadron resonance gas.

The QGP created in a collision expands, cools down and then turns into
hadron gas. In the last stage of the collisions, hadrons continue to
scatter with each other. Therefore observed hadron spectra are, in
general, contaminated by the hadronic rescatterings. In order to probe
the QGP more directly, multi-strange hadrons, in particular $\phi$-meson
and $\Omega$-baryon, can be utilized since multi-strange hadrons have
small scattering cross-sections and less scatter with non-strange
hadrons. Thus final observables of $\phi$-mesons and $\Omega$-baryons
are expected to reflect the properties of the system just after
hadronization.

Some years ago, violation of mass ordering in $v_2(p_{\rm T})$ was
predicted by using a hydro + cascade hybrid model and thereafter
observed by the STAR collaboration. Following this work, we scrutinize
multi-strange hadron spectra at both RHIC and LHC energies by using a
more sophisticated integrated dynamical model towards comprehensive
understanding of this phenomenon. In addition to $v_2(p_{\rm T})$, we
investigate the hadronic rescattering effects on mean transverse momenta
($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) and $p_{\rm T}$-averaged $v_2$ of hadrons
including heavier multi-strange hadrons such as $\Xi$- and
$\Omega$-baryons. We also discuss the collision energy dependence of the
hadronic rescattering effects on the violation of mass ordering behavior

QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Flow in small systems from parton scatterings,"Ma, Guo-Liang","Shanghai INstitute of Applied Physics (SINAP), CAS",Unknown,"We show that the incoherent elastic scattering of partons, as present in a multi-phase transport model (AMPT), with a modest parton-parton cross-section of $\sigma$=1.5-3 mb, naturally explains the long-range two-particle azimuthal correlations as observed in p+p and p+Pb collisions for all measured $N_{track}$ and $p_T$ bins by the LHC-CMS experiment [1]. We calculate the elliptic, $v_2$, and triangular, $v_3$, Fourier coefficients of the two-particle azimuthal correlation function in p+Pb and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions. Our results for $v_3$ are in a good agreement with the CMS data. The $v_2$ coefficient is very well described in p+Pb collisions and is underestimated for higher $p_T$ in Pb+Pb collisions. The characteristic mass ordering of $v_2$ in p+Pb is also reproduced whereas for $v_3$ such ordering is not observed [2]. An escape mechanism has been proposed recently to explain these successful model results [3]. We investigate this issue in detail and show that collisions between active partons are directly responsible for generating the final $v_n$.

Measuring the relative production of strange and multi-strange particles in different colliding systems enables a systematic investigation of possible dependence of strangeness production mechanism with system size and energy density.

Making use of its tracking and particle identification capabilities, ALICE is able to reconstruct the weakly decaying strange hadrons by detecting their daughter tracks and mapping their decay topology.
In this contribution, the recent measurement of strange hadrons and the corresponding antiparticles performed by ALICE in pp collisions at the

in an ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collision. It provides a good description of transverse
momentum spectra and anisotropic flow. These observables, however, cannot be consistently
derived using viscous hydrodynamics alone, because they depend on the microscopic
interactions at freeze-out. We derive the ideal hydrodynamic limit and the first-order
viscous correction to anisotropic flow ( $v_2$ , $v_3$ and $v_4$ ) and momentum spectrum using a
transport calculation [1]. We find that the linear response coefficient to the initial anisotropy, $v_n(p_T)/\epsilon_n$ ,
depends little on n in the ideal hydrodynamic limit. The viscous correction to the spectrum
depends not only on the differential cross section, but also on the initial momentum
distribution. This dependence is not captured by standard second-order viscous hydrodynamics.
The viscous correction to anisotropic flow increases with $p_T$ in agreement with the recent
analytical solutions of viscous hydrodynamic [2].

The feed-down contributions from $\psi$(2S), $\chi_{c}$ and $B$ mesons to J/$\psi$ have been included to compare the inclusive results from ALICE. The comparison with experimental values shows a good agreement beyond $p_{\rm T}$ = 4 GeV for the three centrality bins namely, 0%$-$20%, 20%$-$40% and 40%$-$90%. These results indicate that the cold nuclear matter and recombination effects on J/$\psi$ production at forward rapidities in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV is negligible for $p_{\rm T}$ $>$ 4 GeV. Thus, in the high $p_{\rm T}$ domain ($p_{\rm T}$ $>$ 4 GeV), the observed suppression in the J/$\psi$ yield by ALICE Collaboration can solely be accounted by color screening.

imaging technique enables us to extract the source function, namely
distribution of the relative distance between two emission points for
observed particles, directly from two particle correlation functions.
Since the source function looks no longer a Gaussian in general, it
contains richer information about the space-time distribution of
emission source than HBT radii and is an ideal quantity to compare
experimental data with theoretical results. In this study, we discuss
one- and three-dimensional source functions for pions and kaons from a

consists of event-by-event Glauber-type initial conditions,
(3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics for the quark gluon plasma and a
hadronic cascade for the hadron resonance gas. We first confirm the
$p_{T}$ spectra for pions and kaons are reproduced well. We next
calculate one-dimensional source function of pions and kaons in Au + Au

play a significant role to describe non-Gaussian tail which was observed
by the PHENIX Collaboration. We also analyze three-dimensional source
functions at the RHIC energy, where a special attention is paid to
obtain the source function by decomposing them into coefficients of
Cartesian spherical harmonics as the PHENIX Collaboration employed the

Quarkonia III,parallel,Charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from lattice QCD at finite temperature,"Ohno, Hiroshi","Center for Computational Sciences, University of Tsukuba",UK,"Dissociation of heavy quarkonia is expected to happen in the quark-gluon plasma due to the Debye screening, which causes suppression of quarkonium yields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Actually the $J/\psi$ suppression in SPS, RHIC and LHC as well as the sequential $\Upsilon$ suppression in LHC have been observed. However, since there are not only the medium effect but also other processes, e.g. cold nuclear matter effects, to contribute to the quarkonium suppression and production, the experimental results are still not fully understood. Therefore theoretical understanding of in-medium quarkonium properties plays an important role to explain the experimental data. Moreover, since the elliptic flow suggesting collective motion of heavy quarks due to the hydrodynamic effects has been observed, in-medium behavior of a single heavy quark is also of great theoretical interest.

In this talk we report our study on charmonium and bottomonium in lattice QCD at finite temperature. Similarly to a previous study [1] simulations have been performed on large and fine isotropic lattices by using quenched gauge field configurations. A couple of lattice spacings towards the continuum limit were also chosen. At temperatures in a range from 0.73$T_c$ to 2.2$T_c$ we construct charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators which have been computed in our previous studies
[2,3]. From the temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions we discuss the dissociation of the quarkonium states. We will also extract the transport properties of heavy quarks from the spectral function in the vector channel and estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient for both charm and bottom.

Poster Session,poster,Gluon transport in a semi-holographic model of QCD,"Yang, Di-Lun",University of Crete,Unknown,"A semi-holographic approach combining the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to study a gluon plasma which consists of hard and soft degrees of freedom, where the former is at the saturation scale of QCD and the latter is around the temperature of the quark gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The model aims at analyzing gluonic transport in the phase after the thermalization of soft degrees of freedom. The hard sector is presumed to be weakly interacting, where its dynamics is characterized by kinetic theory with the collisional term incorporating the scattering of hard and soft gluons. In contrast, the soft sector is strongly interacting, which could be described by an infrared conformal field theory (IR-CFT) as the gauge theory dual of a supergravity theory in thermal equilibrium. In general, the dynamics of the IR-CFT could be captured by hydrodynamics and the interaction with the hard sector then appears as a driving force thorough the conservation equation, while the input of holography is to obtain the transport coefficients. The corrections on both sectors could be solved order by order in terms of the marginal coupling of two sectors on the boundary. It is found that the correction on the hard gluons is sub-leading compared with that on the soft gluons. In early times, the hard gluons could be characterized by classical Yang-Mills theory with large occupation numbers. In the longitudinal expanding system, the energy density of the IR-CFT receives non-hydrodynamic correction, which depends on the dynamics of the hard gluons captured by the non-thermal attractor solution. In late times, we may expect the thermalization of the hard sector, which then gives rise to hydrodynamic correction on the soft sector.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Di-Lun', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Di-Lun', 'id': '932811', 'affiliation': 'University of Crete', 'emailHash': '98953c64fa620444fd463f14f116de1d', 'db_id': 932811, 'person_id': 998592}"

Light nuclei (anti-nuclei) can be produced in such heavy-ion collisions by the recombination of produced nucleons (anti-nucleons) or stopped nucleons. This formation process is called final-state coalescence. The production of light nuclei is dependent on the baryon density and the correlation (freeze-out) volume. Therefore, by studying the yield and azimuthal anisotropy of light nuclei (anti-nuclei) and comparing them with that of proton (anti-proton) we can gain insight in the particle production mechanism via coalescence and physical properties of the expanding system at the thermal  freeze-out. Unlike the quark coalescence phenomena of identified hadrons, nucleonic coalescence is directly measurable as both the light nuclei and nucleons (proton and anti-proton) are measured by the detectors in a given experiment.

So from the NS observations, one can provide some constraints on DM properties such as the mass and the cross sections. Here we propose some new effect.

Poster Session,poster,Soft pion production signals of new phenomena at the LHC,"Begun, Viktor",UJK,Unknown,"The LHC data on hadron production, transverse-momentum spectra, and particle correlations in Pb+Pb collisions demonstrate a peculiar behavior [1,2], which can be interpreted as a coherent emission of pions with low momenta [2-5]. It can be a consequence of the prior gluon condensation [6,7], or the overcooling of the quark-qluon plasma deeply into the hadronic phase [8]. In both cases a possible consequence is the formation of the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of pions at the freeze-out. The presence of the condensate decreases the non-equilibrium parameters [5], and therefore improves the agreement of the non-equilibrium thermal model with the data for heavy nuclei. The combined analysis of the hadronic multiplicities and the pion transverse momentum spectra indicates that about 5% of pions at each centrality of the collision could be in the condensate [5]. The data on two- and three-pion correlations support even larger coherent fraction of 23% [2]. This could be the consequence of the fact that correlations are much more sensitive observables [9]. The correlated pions have a momentum below 150-200 MeV [5,8]. It is on the edge of the current acceptance range of the LHC [1,8]. Therefore some efforts are required in order to clarify whether the BEC of pions is reached. However, if the BEC of pions is formed, then its temperature is 10^10 times higher than the temperature of the famous BEC of ultra-cold atoms.

A full assessment of this suppression requires understanding of nuclear effects which may affect the production of quarkonium states even in the absence of the medium.  The study of quarkonium production in proton-nucleus collisions serves as a baseline for understanding heavy-ion collisions and furthers our knowledge of such nuclear effects.  Using proton-lead and proton-proton collision data collected at the LHC in 2013, the ATLAS experiment measures J/psi, psi(2S) and Upsilon(nS) production.

Electromagnetic Probes II,parallel,System-size and energy dependences of dielectron excess invariant-mass spectra at STAR,"Yang, Shuai",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Dilepton measurements play an essential role in the study of hot and dense nuclear matter, created in heavy-ion collisions. Dileptons are produced in the whole evolution of the system and escape with minimum interaction with the strongly interacting medium. Thus, they provide information about the various stages of the system during the evolution. In the low mass region ($M_{ee}<1.1$ $GeV/c^{2}$), they retain information about the in-medium modifications of vector mesons which are considered as a link to chiral symmetry restoration. Recently, it is found in a model calculation that the charged particle multiplicity normalized dilepton excess yield in the low mass region is proportional to the lifetime of the hot, dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 6-200 $GeV$ [1]. The energy density created in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ is expected to be higher by about 20% and the medium created might have a longer lifetime compared with the Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 $GeV$. Thus it would be interesting to compare the normalized dielectron excess yields in U+U and Au+Au collisions. 

In this talk, we will present the invariant mass, transverse momentum, and centrality dependent measurements of dielectron production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$. With the acceptance correction applied, we will report the invariant dielectron excess mass spectra in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 $GeV$ and in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27, 39, and 62.4 $GeV$. Comparisons with the NA60 results and the STAR measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 19.6 and 200 $GeV$ will be shown. System-size and energy dependences of low mass excess yield will be discussed together with model comparisons.

Poster Session,poster,Long-range correlations in the deconfined phase of QCD,"Tywoniuk, Konrad",Universitat de Barcelona,Unknown,"Experimental evidence indicates that the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC behaves like a strongly coupled liquid. These features are intimately related to the infrared (IR) behavior of QCD at finite temperature and present a challenge for conventional perturbative approaches. A way to tackle this obstacle is to improve the description of soft non-Abelian gauge degrees of freedom (DoF) using Gribov's quantization. In consequence, a physical scale, which at high temperature corresponds to the (chromo)magnetic scale, is induced in the system. We discuss how this novel framework affects the relevant quark collective DoF's. Strikingly, we uncover a previously unknown massless mode which is protected by a novel non-Abelian magnetic scaling. As a result, the quark spectral function violates positivity, a well-known feature of confinement. This sheds new light on the interplay of quasi-particle DoF's and genuine long-range modes in the deconfined pase of QCD. Within the same framework, we also discuss the impact of the modified IR dynamics on the jet quenching parameter. We calculate its temperature dependence and find a strong enhancement near the phase transition that is in line with the expectation of a strongly coupled QGP.

After their production, they propagate through the quark gluon plasma and lose energy by colliding with quarks and gluons and by radiating gluons. After their production, they may also get fragmented into heavy mesons by picking up light quarks/antiquarks and in turn may decay through leptonic channels. These leptons would carry information of the initial stage of heavy ion collisions and also the evolution of the plasma.  In this work, we calculate the elliptic flow of muons from heavy flavours decay at forward rapidities in Pb+Pb collision. 
The transverse momentum distribution of heavy quarks produced from the initial fusion of partons, is calculated by FONLL ( Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Logarithms) approach. We consider both radiative and collisional energy loss along with a boost-invariant expansion of the plasma for the calculation of elliptic flow. The fragmentation of heavy quarks into mesons is governed by Peterson fragmentation function.  We compare our result at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE Preliminary data.

Poster Session,poster,Beam energy dependence of Specific Heat in Ultra-relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Nayak, Tapan",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),India,"Experiments at RHIC and LHC are on the quest to unearth the nature of
the QCD phase transition and to get a glimpse of how matter behaves at
such extreme conditions. Phase transitions are governed by a set of
thermodynamic parameters, like, temperature ($T$), pressure, entropy,
and energy density ($E$), and can be further characterized by their
response functions, like, specific heat,
compressibility, and susceptibility. In thermodynamics, the heat
capacity ($C$) is defined in terms of the ratio of the event-by-event
fluctuations of the energy of a part of a finite system in thermal
equilibrium to the energy ${(\Delta E^2)} = {T^2}C(T)$. This can be
applied for a locally thermalized system produced during the evolution
of heavy-ion collisions. But for a system at freeze-out, specific heat
can expressed in terms of the event-by-event fluctuations in temperature
of the system where volume is fixed: $ \frac{1}{C} = \frac{(\langle T^2
\rangle - \langle T \rangle ^2 )}{\langle T \rangle ^2}$. We define the
specific heat as the heat capacity per pion multiplicity within the experimentally available phase space in rapidity
and azimuth. For a system in equilibrium, the mean values of temperature
and energy density are related by an equation of state. However, the
fluctuations in energy and temperature have quite different behavior.
Energy being an extensive quantity, its fluctuations have a component
arising from the volume fluctuations, and not directly suited for
obtaining the heat capacity.
Here, we obtain the specific heat for heavy-ion
collisions at SPS, RHIC beam energy scan energies and for LHC energy.
Experimental results from NA49, STAR, PHENIX, PHOBOS and ALICE are
combined to obtain the specific heat as a function of beam energy. The
results are compared to results from AMPT event generator, HRG model and

"Future Experimental Facilities, Upgrades, and Instrumentation",unknown,Studies of high density baryon matter with high intensity heavy-ion beams at J-PARC,"Sako, Hiroyuki","ASRC/J-PARC, Japan Atomic Energy Agency",Unknown,"We are developing a future heavy-ion program at J-PARC, which is one of the world’s highest intensity proton synchrotrons. In heavy-ion collisions at J-PARC, matter whose density is 8-10 times as high as the normal nuclear density, comparable to that of the neutron star core will be created. There, we aim at exploring QCD phase structures such as the critical point and phase boundaries, and studying modifications of the strong interaction at high baryon density through the investigation of hadron properties and production of exotic hadrons and nuclei.
Ions up to U will be accelerated to 1-19 AGeV ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2-6.2$ GeV) at the beam rate up to $10^{11}$ ions per cycle of Main Ring synchrotron (MR). We have designed a heavy-ion acceleration scheme with a new linac and a booster as the injector, combined with the existing 3-GeV Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 50-GeV MR that have been proven to accelerate high-rate proton beams. 
In heavy-ion experiments, we will measure electrons and muons to study the chiral restoration of vector mesons, and the event-by-event fluctuations of conserved charges to search for the critical point in addition to the conventional systematic studies of various hadrons in the wide energy range. We will also measure particle correlations to study the properties of particle interactions. Last but not least, we will also search for exotic hadrons and nuclei such as dibaryons, kaonic nuclei, and measure hypernuclei at high density, which is one of the important topics in hadron physics. We are designing a large acceptance heavy-ion spectrometer based on a Toroidal magnet to measure hadrons, lepton pairs, and event-by-event fluctuations. We are also designing a closed geometry spectrometer to measure hypernuclei to study weak decays and magnetic moments.
In this presentation, the preliminary version of the designed acceleration scheme, as well as the spectrometers and their expected performance and physics results are presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hiroyuki', 'last_name': 'Sako', 'fullName': 'Sako, Hiroyuki', 'id': '932621', 'affiliation': 'ASRC/J-PARC, Japan Atomic Energy Agency', 'emailHash': '1d10206d4ddc9abadda3eb6a7baaa088', 'db_id': 932621, 'person_id': 998418}"
Poster Session,poster,"LHC and RHIC as Glueball Factories - Pure Gauge 1. Order Phase Transition in pp, pA and AA and direct GlueBall-Hagedorn hadronization","Horst, Stoecker",GSI Helmholzentrum fuer Schwerionenforschung GmbH,Germany,"pp, pA and AA collisions at RHIC, LHC, FCC and in cosmic rays show according to QCD transport theory (Blaizot et al, Biro et al, Alam et al, Shuryak et al, Xu et al, Senzel et al) fast (over)saturation and chemical equilibration of gluons, t_g << 1fm/c. In stark contrast, soft light quarks are according to these calculations created much more slowly (saturation times t_q >> 3 fm/c). 

Hence, a change of paradigm seems appropriate for decribing the initial states of collisions at collider energies:

- the system evolves from a CGC through the Glasma state (McLerran and Venugopalan) 
-into a saturated pure gauge Yang Mills quarkless gluon plasm. 
- This 'pure' glue plasma expands until it reaches the 1. Order Phase Transition FOPT with a critical temperature T_c~270MeV to the GlueBall fluid as predicted by pure gauge thoery (Svetitsky&Yaffe, Brown et al, Meyer, Borsanyi et al).

Quarkonia IV,parallel,Dynamical upsilon-suppression in the Schroedinger-Langevin approach,"Gossiaux, Pol",Subatech,Unknown,"The suppression of upsilon Y(1S) states in AA collisions, observed by the STAR collaboration at RHIC and by the CMS and ALICE collaboration at LHC, is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the quark gluon plasma. The precise survival of excited Y(2S) and Y(3S) states vs ground state could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions, according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature. 

In our contribution, we address the question of upsilon dissociation resorting to a dynamical approach, i.e. the non-linear Schroedinger-Langevin equation (SLE). In this scheme, the time-dependent real potential implements the Debye-screening while the stochastic forces express the (hard) interactions between the QGP and the $b\bar b$ state, possibly leading to instantaneous dissociation. The SLE preserves unitarity and enables to treat the transitions between bound and open quantum states, which are mocked up resorting to imaginary potential in other treatments. It allows to consider a realistic compact initial state, made of a linear superposition of upsilon eigenstates and to preserve quantum coherence in the time-evolution of the $b\bar b$ pair.
In a stationary QGP, our SLE naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of {Y(1S), Y(2S),...} following correct statistical weights, which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination. This sanity check is a unique feature of our approach.
 
We will describe the main ingredients of our SLE as well as some of its most important properties. We will then present the suppression prediction resulting from SLE embedded in state-of-the-art evolution scenario of the QGP background, both for RHIC and LHC energies. The relations with other theoretical frameworks will also be described.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness I,parallel,Identified light and strange hadron spectra at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=14.5~GeV and systematic study of baryon/meson effect at intermediate transverse momentum with STAR at RHIC BES I,"Brandenburg, James",Rice University,USA,"With the recently measured Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 14.5~GeV, STAR completed its first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC.

Amongst the various collision energies of 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39~GeV, that have been previously presented by STAR, collisions at 14.5~GeV will provide data set in the relatively large chemical potential gap between the 11.5 and 19.6~GeV center-of-mass energies.

The spectra from both light and strange particles cover a significant range of the intermediate transverse momentum (2 $<p_T<$ 5~GeV/c) in all beam energies.

Quark Matter in Astrophysics,unknown,Hot Neutron Stars with Hadron-Quark Crossover,"Masuda, Kota",The Univ. of Tokyo / RIKEN,Unknown,"Recent observations of 2-solar-mass neutron stars (NSs) give us the problem, ''to be or not to be"" for the exotic components such as deconfined quarks in dense matter of NS cores.
This is because the first-order phase transition to exotic matter leads to a softening of the equation of state (EOS) so that 2-solar-mass NSs cannot be sustained.
In our previous works [1,2], we have constructed the EOS, “CRover-C” EOS (EOS with crossover for cold NSs), assuming a hadron-quark crossover transition from a view that hadrons are not point-like particles but are composed of quarks and a quark percolation would occur when hadrons come near with each other.
We have shown this EOS can sustain the massive NSs in spite of the participation of quark degrees of freedom.
The point is that the EOS with crossover is made stiff, contrary to the conventional first-order transition, as far as the percolation begins at rather low-density.

The purpose of the present work [3] is to discuss the properties of hot NSs at birth by extending CRover-C EOS to the finite temperature case.
Hot NSs are composed of supernova matter characterized by an isentropic nature and a constant lepton fraction owing to a neutrino trapping.
In a manner analogous to the cold case, we construct a new EOS of supernova matter, ''CRover-H” (EOS with crossover for hot NSs) and obtain hot-NS models.
It is found that the crossover has important effects not only on generating the stiff EOS to sustain 2-solar-mass hot NSs, but also on lowering the internal temperature.
It is remarked that during the thermal evolution from hot to cold NSs, the gravitational energy of amount 0.04 solar-mass is released due to the contraction and the spin up of about 14% occurs, in the case of the canonical mass NSs.

In this talk, based on the recent work of Ref. [1], we show that its contribution to isospin-averaged observables is, to a surprising accuracy, canceled by the repulsion from the pion-pion scalar-isotensor channel. As a result, in practice one should not incorporate f0(500) in standard hadronic resonance-gas models for studies of isospin averaged quantities. In our analysis we use the formalism of the virial expansion, which allows one to calculate the thermal properties of an interacting hadron gas in terms of derivatives of the scattering phase shifts, hence in a model-independent way directly from experimentally accessible quantities. A similar cancellation mechanism occurs for the scalar kaonic interactions between I=1/2 channel (containing the alleged K∗0(800) or the κ meson) and the I=3/2 channel.

Among them, strangeness enhancement, a phenomenon associated with soft particles in the bulk matter, can be accessed through the measurement of the ratio $\phi$ /($\rho+\omega$). Low mass vector meson production in p+p collisions provides a reference for this study. In addition, vector meson production in p+p collisions is an important tool to study QCD, providing data to tune soft phenomenological QCD models and to compare to hard pQCD calculations.

The PHENIX experiment at RHIC is capable of studying low-mass vector meson production with two muon spectrometers covering the rapidity range $1.2<|y|<2.2$, offering a complementary measurement to the one done at mid-rapidity.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness II,parallel,event by event correlations between light and heavy mesons,"aichelin, joerg",Subatech/CNRS,Unknown,"Heavy mesons are one of the few probes which allow for studying the properties of a plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. To do this we have to follow the heavy quarks from their production point through the QGP up to the final rescattering of heavy mesons with hadrons after the hadronization. 
The interaction of heavy quarks in the QPG is calculated in pQCD with a running coupling constant and including elastic as well as radiative collisions (arXiv 1307.5270). Due to event by event fluctuations the interaction of heavy mesons in the hadronic phase depends on the light quarks/mesons which are produced simultaneously with the heavy quarks during the initial phase of the heavy ion reaction. Therefore the observables of the heavy and light hadrons are correlated and both have to be studied simultaneously. 
Combining the event generator EPOS with our Heavy Quark approach we can for the first time present event-by-event results simultaneously for the light and heavy meson sector and overcome by this uncertainties of the heavy quark observables due to the ambiguities in the plasma expansion  (arXiv:1102.1114).

These corrections are of quantum origin and their leading terms are of second order in the gradients of the thermodynamic fields. The relevant coefficients can be expressed in terms of correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the Lorentz group. With respect to previous assessments, we find that there are more second order coefficients and that all thermodynamic functions including energy density receive acceleration and vorticity dependent corrections. Notably, also the relation between $\rho$ and p, that is the equation of state, is affected by acceleration and vorticity. We have calculated the corrections for a free real scalar field -- both massive and massless -- and we have found that they increase, particularly for a massive field, at very high acceleration and vorticity and very low temperature. Finally, these non-ideal terms depend on the explicit form of the stress-energy operator, meaning that different stress-energy tensor of the scalar field -- canonical or improved -- are thermodynamically inequivalent.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Eduardo', 'last_name': 'Grossi', 'fullName': 'Grossi, Eduardo', 'id': '932683', 'affiliation': 'University of Florence & INFN Florence', 'emailHash': 'c626a766eb3b8b9ec0c7b0e9ec7a9a1c', 'db_id': 932683, 'person_id': 998476}"
Jets and High pT Hadrons II,parallel,Jet Hadronization via Recombination of Parton Showers in Vacuum and in Medium,"Fries, Rainer",Texas A&M University,USA,"We have developed a hadronization model for jet parton showers based on the quark recombination model. Gluons at the end of a perturbative shower evolution undergo a non-perturbative splitting into quark and antiquark pairs, then a Monte-Carlo version of instantaneous quark recombination is applied. Finally remnant quarks (those which have not found a recombination partner) are connected by color strings and subjected to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to parton showers from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, the final hadron spectra from our calculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been hadronized with the default Lund string fragmentation. This hadronization model readily generalizes to jet showers emerging from a quark gluon plasma by allowing recombination of shower partons with thermal partons, sampled from fluid dynamics or blast wave models.  We find that the recombination of shower and thermal partons leads to a significant enhancement of intermediate transverse momentum pions and protons at both RHIC and LHC. Our results thus suggest that medium modification of jet fragmentation provides a plausible explanation for the enhanced production of intermediate transverse momentum hadrons and the changed hadron chemistry observed in experiments. A computer code based on this vacuum and medium hadronization model has been developed within the JET collaboration and can be combined with existing jet shower Monte Carlo codes.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rainer', 'last_name': 'Fries', 'fullName': 'Fries, Rainer', 'id': '932685', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'emailHash': '043accfcafd1e7abcdeef2818eef1890', 'db_id': 932685, 'person_id': 998478}"

  Here we present results from a first simulation of quarkonium dynamics in a realistic quark-gluon plasma, based on the concept of stochastic potential [1]. The values of this proper potential is extracted from first principles (Nf=2+1) lattice QCD simulations and does not contain modeling input [3].

  Initializing with the wave function of a localized quark-antiquark pair obtained in non-relativistic QCD effective theory [4], we solve the stochastic Schrödinger equation for Bottomonium according to the local temperature obtained from 2+1 dimensional hydrodynamics [5]. Including the effect of feed down after bottomonium hadronization, we compare our results with experimental data, in particular the centrality dependence of the bottomonium nuclear modification factor R_AA. Possible signatures of thermalization are discussed by comparing to the predictions of the statistical model of hadronization.

Poster Session,poster,Is heavy quark diffusion applicable? -- A new time scale introduced by decoherence,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Stony Brook University,USA,"Interaction of heavy quarks with particles in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) results in the heavy quark energy loss. In the nonrelativistic regime, the effective theory for this process is the Langevin equation, a classic example in the nonequilibrium physics. In the heavy-ion collisions, several studies have applied the Langevin dynamics to phenomenology and tried to interpret the experimental data of nuclear modification factor (R_AA) and elliptic flow (v2) of charm quarks.

  In this talk, I would like to introduce a new aspect to the Langevin dynamics, namely the dynamics of heavy quark color charge [1]. In the perturbative picture, each scattering rotates heavy quark color into a new color state and causes a macroscopic superposition state (Schrödinger's cat state) of the momentum. To derive classical descriptions of the Langevin dynamics, the quantum interference of the superposition must be destroyed by decoherence. I estimated this time scale to be \sqrt(M/\gamma), where \gamma is the momentum diffusion constant of heavy quarks. This time scale should be the lower limit of the discretization of the Langevin equation. Interestingly, this is estimated to be about 3-5fm for charm and bottom quarks, which is not small enough compared to the QGP lifetime so that the naïve application of Langevin equation to heavy-ion physics might be questioned.

The $v_{jet}^{2}$ is in good agreement with the recent ATLAS data. However, the $v_{jet}^{3}$ shows a smaller magnitude than $v_{jet}^{2}$ , and approaches zero at a larger transverse momentum. It is attributed to the path-length dependence in which the jet energy loss fraction depends on the azimuthal angles with respect to different orders of event planes. The ratio $v_{jet}^{n}$ /$ε_{n}$ increases from peripheral to noncentral collisions, and $v_{jet}^{n}$ increases with the initial spatial asymmetry ($ε_n$) for a given centrality bin. These behaviors indicate that the $v_{jet}^{n}$ is produced by the strong interactions between jet and the partonic medium with different initial geometry shapes. Therefore, azimuthal anisotropies of reconstructed jet are proposed as a good probe to study the initial spatial fluctuations, which are expected to provide constraints on the path-length dependence of jet quenching models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maowu', 'last_name': 'Nie', 'fullName': 'Nie, Maowu', 'id': '932717', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)', 'emailHash': '0c05d4ac4a0db61e91ab517bd4e3dade', 'db_id': 932717, 'person_id': 998508}"

On the other hand, only dissipation has been taken into account in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for the past years. In addition to dissipation, thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution (a.k.a., hydrodynamic fluctuation) must be taken into account to consistently describe the dynamics of the QGP. To study this, causal fluctuating hydrodynamics was formulated [1] and implemented in numerical hydrodynamic simulations recently [2]

   In this study, we apply this framework to the (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion and show that, under some limited conditions, the dynamics of the QGP satisfies ""stationary fluctuation theorem"" [3] which was established in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Through this theorem, we focus on the entropy fluctuation and claim that the thermal fluctuation becomes more important in the smaller systems such as p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. We further investigate the effects of finite relaxation time in causal hydrodynamics and find it significantly affects the final entropy distribution. This suggests we have an opportunity to extract some information about relaxation time from final observables on multiplicity.

We have studied the dependance of radiative decay width on the mass of the constituting mesons  and on the binding energies. Besides this, we have also included finite size effects in terms of size parameter $\Lambda_H$ which gives appropriate physical description of the heavy hadron molecule. This analysis can shed light on their still unresolved structure. In this work, we have focused particularly on $Y(3940)$ and $Y(4140)$ states. We have predicted $Y(3940)$  state as a molecular bound state of $D^{*0}$ and $ \bar D^{*0}$ and $Y(4140)$ as a loosely bound molecular state of ${D}_s^{*}$ and $\bar {D}_s^{*}$. The narrow decay widths of these states are in good agreement with the available experimental data given by BELLE and BaBar experiments.  The predictions for the radiative decays can serve further to distinguish between the different structure identification of these heavy hadron states.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium production with soft gluon radiation in the CGC framework,"Watanabe, Kazuhiro",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We study initial soft gluon radiation effect on quarkonium production at low transverse momentum in the color glass condensate (CGC) framework. 
In high energy pp (pA) collisions, the quarkonium production at forward rapidity can be described 
by adopting usual collinear pdf for dilute proton and the dipole gluon distribution function for dense proton (nucleus) [1]. 
The small-$x$ quantum correction is embedded in the dipole amplitude which follows the BK equation with running coupling effect (rcBK). 
In the CGC framework, the parton saturation is expected to characterize the low-$P_\perp$ spectrum.
Meanwhile, the initial soft gluon radiation also can affect the low-$P_\perp$ spectrum [2]. 
Therefore, in order to study the parton saturation quantatively, both the small-$x$ resummation and the low-$P_\perp$ resummation have to be considered simultaneously.

In this talk, we consider the Sudakov factor associated with the initial soft gluon resummation by following the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism [3].
We will present some numerical results of quarkonium production at the LHC including both the small-$x$ resummation and the low-$P_\perp$ resummation.

Measurements of non-prompt J/ψ produced from B hadron decays are very interesting because they may provide an opportunity to access bottom quark production in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Such measurements have become possible with the installation of the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) and Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) into the STAR experiment in 2014. The HFT can precisely measure track impact parameters, and thus allows a separation between prompt and non-prompt J/ψ through measuring their decay lengths. The MTD enables J/ψ reconstruction in the dimuon channel at STAR for the first time, which is important for J/ψ measurements at transverse momentum $p_{T}$<5 GeV/c and complementary to those in the dielectron channel at higher $p_{T}$.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness III,parallel,Heavy-flavour correlations and multiplicity dependence in pp and p--Pb collisions with ALICE,"Colamaria, Fabio Filippo","Universita e INFN, Bari (IT)",Italy,"The study of heavy-quark production (charm and beauty) in pp collisions at LHC energies allows us to test perturbative QCD calculations and provides a reference for studies in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements in p--Pb collisions help to characterize the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the collision (cold nuclear matter effects). ALICE has provided measurements of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$ in the heavy-flavour sector. More differential measurements of charm and beauty production in pp and p--Pb collisions can provide further insight on the above topics.

The analysis of angular correlations between heavy-flavour particles and charged particles allows us to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and is sensitive to their production mechanism. Differences between the measurements in pp and p--Pb collisions can give insight on how cold nuclear matter effects affect the heavy-quark production and hadronisation in p--Pb collisions. In the analysis of hadron-hadron correlations in p--Pb collisions, a double-ridge long-range structure was observed, possibly coming from a collective behavior of the system or gluon saturation in the initial state. This feature can be investigated for heavy quarks as well through heavy-flavour correlation studies. Moreover, the study of heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of the charged-particle multiplicity is a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between hard and soft QCD processes responsible for particle production in hadronic collisions and provides information on the role of multi-parton interactions. 

We present ALICE measurements of azimuthal correlations between prompt D mesons and heavy-flavour decay electrons with charged hadrons in pp collisions at $\sqrt s$ = 7 TeV and p--Pb collisions at  $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}$= 5.02 TeV.

modification of charm quark production in heavy -ion collisions and
signatures of their interactions with the created medium are imprinted
on the final kinematics of charmed mesons which can be studied

below the free nucleon-nucleon threshold. In baryon dominated matter K$^+$ and K$^-$ mesons exhibit different properties,
since only K$^-$ can be resonantly absorbed by nucleons. 

Although strangeness exchange reactions have been proposed to be the
dominant channel for K$^-$ production in this energy regime, the production yield
could also be explained in Ar+KCl-reactions at 1.76 AGeV based on a
statistical hadronization model fit to the measured particle yields. To guarantee strangeness conservation, strangeness is calculated canonically
within R$_c$ in these models, and therefore the ratio of $\phi$/K$^-$ is predicted to rise with
decreasing beam energies and as a consequence the feed-down of $\phi$-mesons to kaons becomes important. 

In total 7.3 Billion 40% most central Au(1.23 GeV per nucleon)+Au collisions have been analyzed for this investigation.

Poster Session,poster,Collective flow in small systems from an integrated dynamical model,"Kawaguchi, Koji",Sophia Univ,Unknown,"Whether hydrodynamic flow is generated in small systems such as p+Pb
collisions at LHC and d+Au collisions at RHIC is hotly debated open problem. We analyze these systems by employing a fully 3-dimensional integrated dynamical model [1] in which an initial model with various kinds of fluctuations, hydrodynamic QGP evolution and hadronic transports are incorporated. For this purpose, we develop a novel type of hydrodynamic initialization model by combining an event generator, PYTHIA [2], Brodsky-Gunion-Kuhn type initial nuclear effects [3] and MC-Glauber model. In addition to the fluctuation of transverse profile having been discussed frequently so far, this newly developed model enables us to demonstrate multiplicity fluctuation, longitudinal fluctuations and highly asymmetric longitudinal profile, which have not been available in the conventional MC-Glauber model. Since the size of the system is small and, in turn, the lifetime of the QGP fluid is short, the hadronic afterburner must play a major role in the whole dynamical evolution. So we investigate this by switching on/off the hadronic rescatterings in the integrated dynamical model so that we can quantify how much the hydrodynamic evolution of the QGP is attributed for the observed collective-flow-like behaviors in the experimental data.

In order to fully exploit the longitudinal boost invariance of this problem, we use a basis in which the mode functions are labelled by the Fourier conjugate $\nu$ of the spatial rapidity. This choice has also the virtue of being suitable for a lattice implementation in which the rapidity $\eta$ is used as longitudinal coordinate. We have derived analytic expressions for the initial value (at $Q_s\tau_0\ll 1$) of these mode functions, and based on them we will present preliminary results for the spectrum of produced quarks in the CGC.

The self-energy of the $\rho$ meson contains the quark-loop contribution, i.e. the leading order contribution in $1/N_c$ expansion. It is found that the charged $\rho$ meson mass decreases as the magnetic field increases and drops to zero at a critical magnetic field $eB_c$. The charged vector meson condensation, i.e. the electromagnetic superconductor can be induced  above the critical magnetic field. We find that at zero density,  in the temperature range $200-500~ {\rm MeV}$, the critical magnetic field for charged $\rho$ condensation is in the range of $0.2-0.6~ {\rm GeV}^2$, which indicates that high temperature superconductor could be created at LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hao', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Hao', 'id': '932815', 'affiliation': 'IHEP', 'emailHash': '1b6a5d35553a0562b9b2abb88dfee514', 'db_id': 932815, 'person_id': 998595}"
Poster Session,poster,A critical reassessment of cold nuclear matter effects in proton-nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC,"Xing, Hongxi",LANL,USA,"Recent results from the p+Pb run at the LHC on light hadron, heavy flavor, and jet production reveal highly non-trivial nuclear cross section modifications, when compared to p+p collisions. These discoveries complement similar earlier findings form d+Au reactions at RHIC. In this talk we present recent calculations and theoretical interpretation for two such examples - the nuclear enhancement for heavy meson production in the backward rapidity region and single inclusive jet production in both d+Au and p+Pb collisions. We demonstrate that the incoherent multiple parton scattering can describe rather well the observed Cronin-like nuclear enhancement in the intermediate pT region of heavy meson production at RHIC and the LHC [1,2]. On the other hand, we show that initial-state inelastic parton processes in p+A collisions lead to attenuation of the jet production cross section, which is amplified at very high pT and forward rapidity. We demonstrate quantitatively to what extent parton energy loss effects in cold nuclear matter can explain the attenuation of the recently observed jet production yields in p(d)+A reactions at RHIC and the LHC [3]. We further show the consistency between the observed scaling behavior of the nuclear modification factor as a function of the jet energy and the initial-state parton energy loss picture.

The production of photons from virtual quarks considered here is of order $\mathcal{O}(\rho_p)$, while the bremsstrahlung process 
$q \to q\gamma X$ seems to be the leading contribution parametrically. However, the bremsstrahlung process should involve also the real quark distribution function in the initial state that brings in theoretical uncertainties, but our formula is free from such external input and closed within the McLerran-Venugopalan model.

Poster Session,poster,Radiative 3<->2 transport and thermalization,"Molnar, Denes",Purdue University,USA,"The mechanism of rapid thermalization in heavy-ion reaction is still an open problem. While 2->2 perturbative QCD rates do not thermalize sufficiently fast (e.g., Molnar & Gyulassy anno 2000), it has been claimed a decade ago by Xu & Greiner using their BAMPS code that perturbative 3<->2 rates shorten thermalization time-scales in A+A at RHIC and LHC energies to 1 fm/c or smaller. Later it has been argued, however, (e.g., Deng et al) that the BAMPS calculation may have missed the rates by a factor of 3!=6. We investigate the thermalization question using the transport code MPC/Grid, which algorithmically is quite similar to BAMPS (it has scatterings implemented via sampling test particles in small spatial cells in discrete timesteps). The new code has been verified against every analytic test we could think of, and in 2->2 mode also against earlier A+A results from the geometric MPC/Cascade code. On one hand, we do find that the inclusion of 3<->2 rates speeds up thermalization very significantly, however, the rates are still not as high as those published from BAMPS. The difference in 3<->2 rates, however, is not simply a factor of 6 even when we try to reproduce their calculation exactly.

QCD at High Temperture,unknown,The topological structures in strongly coupled QGP with chiral fermions on the lattice,"Sharma, Sayantan",BNL,USA,"The nature of chiral phase transition for two flavour QCD is an interesting but unresolved problem. One of the most intriguing issues is
whether or not the anomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavour sector is effectively restored along with the chiral symmetry.
 This may determine the universality class of the chiral phase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is essentially
non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to address this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry
on the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of  2+1 flavour dynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The
latter also optimally preserves chiral and flavour symmetries on the lattice, since it is known that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light
quarks influences the scaling  of the chiral condensate [1] in the crossover
transition region. We observe that the anomalous U(1) is not effectively
restored in the chiral crossover region. This effectively means that the eta' excitations remains distinct from the pion excitations well into
the QGP medium. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects since the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it.
We also provide a glimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium that are responsible for the strongly interacting
nature of the quark gluon plasma phase. We study the effect of these microscopic constituents through our first calculations for the topological susceptibility of QCD at finite temperature, which could be a crucial input for the equation of state with a finite chiral chemical potential.

In this hybrid approach, it is found that the temperature-dependent bulk viscosity plays a crucial role
in simultaneously describing the multiplicity, mean $p_T$ and the integrated $v_n$ of all identified particles.
Importantly, the extraction of the shear viscosity of QGP very much depends on the bulk viscosity 
resulting in smaller value of the shear viscosity.
These calculations are also in good agreement with HBT measurements.

Finally, it will be shown that a hybrid approach is critical
in describing identified particle $p_T$-spectra and the $v_n$ including baryons and multi-strange hadrons.
The afterburner is also found to be important in describing the angular correlations.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness II,parallel,Measurements of heavy-flavour nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV with ALICE,"Dubla, Andrea",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Unknown,"Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are sensitive probes of the medium 
produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They are produced in the early 
stage of the collisions and are expected to experience the whole history of 
the collision evolution interacting with the medium constituents via both 
elastic and inelastic processes.

The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) and the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) 
are two of the main experimental observables that allow us to investigate the 
interaction strength of heavy quarks with the expanding medium.
$R_{\rm AA}$ accounts for the modification of heavy-flavour hadron yields in 
Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions, after the proper binary 
collision scaling is applied on the latter system. The comparison of the 
$R_{\rm AA}$ of charm, beauty and light-flavour hadrons can provide 
information about the colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of the parton 
energy loss. $v_{2}$ is the second Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal 
distribution of particle momenta in the transverse plane with respect to the 
reaction plane. At low $p_{\rm{T}}$ it is sensitive to the degree of 
thermalization of heavy quarks in the deconfined medium, and at high 
$p_{\rm{T}}$ it carries information on the path-length dependence of 
in-medium parton energy loss.

The ALICE collaboration has measured the production and elliptic flow of 
open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays to 
electrons at mid-rapidity and to muons at forward rapidity in Pb--Pb

Moreover the LHC has started the Run 2 operations this year, and the study of D-meson production in  pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV could provide a measurement of heavy-flavour production cross section at an unprecedented energy. In p--Pb collisions, heavy-flavour measurements are essential to assess the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the initial state, such as the modification of the parton densities and the $k_{\rm T}$-broadening resulting from multiple soft scatterings of the partons.
In this poster we will focus on D$^{+}$-meson measurements as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision. These measurements are sensitive to the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production in p--Pb collisions and, in particular, could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies. The measurement is performed in  p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector in 2013. D$^{+}$ mesons are reconstructed in their hadronic $K^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ decay channels in the central rapidity region, and their yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\rm T}$ intervals.

Plasma instabilities play an important role in thermalization. 
Since the glasma initial condition consists of longitudinally polarized color-flux tubes, 
possible instabilities should reflect this background.
Recently, classical gluon fields in a nonexpanding geometry are found to show parametric instability 
under a longitudinally polarized background with homogeneous intensity [1]. 
The growth rates of low momentum modes are large enough compared with other instabilities proposed so far. 
The rapid growth is caused by the spin-magnetic field interaction.

Surprisingly, parametric instability survives even in an expanding geometry [2]. 
We introduce the conformal coordinates which enable us to map an expanding problem into a nonexpanding problem. 
We find that fluctuations with finite longitudinal momentum can grow exponentially 
due to the suppression of effective momenta coming from the longitudinal expansion. 
We also discuss the relevance of the parametric instability to the early stage dynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Characterization of the initial state and QGP medium from a combined Bayesian analysis of RHIC and LHC data,"Bernhard, Jonah",Duke University,USA,"A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), notably its transport coefficients, such as the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$.  Since these properties are not directly measurable, one relies on a comparison of the data to computational models of the time-evolution of the collision to connect measured observables to the properties of the transient QGP state.  The computational model parameters are tuned such that simulated observables optimally match experimental data.

We employ a Bayesian model-to-data comparison method for extracting QGP properties [1303.5769, 1502.00339].  First, we choose a set of salient model parameters -- including physical properties such as $\eta/s$ -- then evaluate a modern event-by-event heavy-ion collision model at a small set of points in the multidimensional parameter space, varying all parameters simultaneously.  We use a Gaussian process emulator to non-parametrically interpolate the parameter space, providing fast predictions at any point in parameter space with quantitative uncertainty.  Finally, we systematically explore the parameter space with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain rigorous constraints on all parameters simultaneously, including all correlations.

In this work, we apply the Bayesian methodology to the new TRENTO initial condition model [1412.4708] and standard MC-Glauber initial conditions, coupled to event-by-event viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics and UrQMD [1409.8164].  We calibrate several initial condition and medium parameters to experimentally observed particle yields, spectra, and flows from RHIC and the LHC.

This systematic model-to-data comparison yields rigorous constraints on the nature of the initial state and on fundamental QGP medium properties.  The method is general and easily extensible to future studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jonah', 'last_name': 'Bernhard', 'fullName': 'Bernhard, Jonah', 'id': '932888', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': 'e1e4bed92542141fb326b2e63f77f689', 'db_id': 932888, 'person_id': 998660}"

Poster Session,poster,Event-by-Event Fluctuations in Identified Particle Ratios in ALICE at LHC,"Jena, Deepika",Panjab University (IN),Unknown,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the nuclear matter undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter to a state of quark and gluons. Phase transitions are often associated with enhanced fluctuations in various globally conserved quantities, such as electric charge, baryon number, strangeness, etc. Therefore, the study of the event-by-event fluctuations of these quantities can be a probe to explore the properties of the matter created in heavy ion collisions and its phase structure. A study of particle ratio fluctuations has been carried out by using the variable $\nu_{dyn}$ which, by its construction, is free from collisional biases, i.e. impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of particles within the detector acceptance. We present the first results on event-by-event dynamical fluctuations of identified particle ratios, such as, K/$\pi$, p/K and p/$\pi$ in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. In order to gain insight into the origin of these fluctuations, we measure $\nu_{dyn}$ for all like-sign and unlike-sign particle pairs as a function of number of participants.

Poster Session,poster,J/psi production measurements in p-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Hadjidakis, Cynthia",Universite de Paris-Sud 11 (FR),France,"In heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, the ALICE experiment studies nuclear matter at very high energy densities where the formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected. Quarkonium production is an important probe to characterize the properties of the QGP. 

High precision data in pp and p-Pb collisions serve, respectively, to provide the baseline  for the Pb-Pb measurement and to quantify the amount of initial and/or final state effects related to cold nuclear matter, that are largely unknown at LHC energies. Since 2010, the LHC delivered Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, pp collisions at various energies and, in 2013, p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

The inclusive J/$\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV was studied by ALICE down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in the backward (-4.46 < $y_{cms}$ < -2.96) and forward (2.03 < $y_{cms}$ < 3.53) center-of-mass rapidity intervals in the dimuon decay channel and in the mid-rapidity region (-1.37 < $y_{cms}$ < 0.43) in the dielectron decay channel. The two former rapidity intervals correspond to the Pb-going and p-going directions, respectively. In this presentation, the J/$\psi$ nuclear modification factors will be presented as a function of the J/$\psi$ rapidity and $p_{\rm T}$ and of the centrality of the collision, as estimated from the energy deposited in the Zero Degree Calorimeters. The forward-to-backward ratios and the average $p_{\rm T}$-square values will be also reported. The measurements will be compared to theoretical models and the implication of these measurements to the interpretation of the nuclear modification factor measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cynthia', 'last_name': 'Hadjidakis', 'fullName': 'Hadjidakis, Cynthia', 'id': '932897', 'affiliation': 'Universite de Paris-Sud 11 (FR)', 'emailHash': '89f18e36fcb7a4983e7a9eecdf10ce6d', 'db_id': 932897, 'person_id': 998668}"
Poster Session,poster,Velocity-induced dissociation of Heavy Quarkonium  in the  gauge-gravity prescription,"Khanchandani, Himanshu",Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Unknown,"Using the gauge-gravity duality we have obtained the potential 
between a heavy quark and an antiquark pair, which is
moving transverse to the direction of orientation.
For the purpose we work on a metric in the gravity side, {\em viz.} OKS-BH geometry, whose
dual in the gauge theory side runs with the energy and hence proves to be a
better background for thermal QCD. 
The potential obtained has confining term both in vacuum and medium,
in addition to the Coulomb term alone usually reported in the literature.
As the velocity of the pair is increased the screening of the potential 
gets screened, which may be understood by the decrease of effective 
temperature with the increase of velocity. The chief finding of
our work is that the potential develops an imaginary part
beyond a critical separation of the heavy quark pair, which
is nowadays beleived to be the main source of dissociation.
The imaginary part is found to vanish at small $r$, thus agrees with the 
perturbative result. Finally we have estimated the thermal width
for the ground and first excited states and found that
non-zero rapidities lead to an increase of thermal width.
This implies that the moving medium fecilitates the dissociation of quarkonium states 
than in the static medium, thus agrees with other calculations. However, the 
width in our case is larger than other calculations due to the presence 
of confining terms and hence dissolutes earlier.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Himanshu', 'last_name': 'Khanchandani', 'fullName': 'Khanchandani, Himanshu', 'id': '932898', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee', 'emailHash': '08a04f64b41306e191ec870876058581', 'db_id': 932898, 'person_id': 998669}"
Poster Session,poster,Entanglement Entropy of Several Bosonic Quantum Field Theories,"Pang, Jin-Yi",National Taiwan University,Unknown,"We investigate how entanglement entropy behaves in general non-conformal
quantum field theories which describe kinds of physical systems. The
scalar field in $O(N)$ $\sigma-$model and non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge
field on lattice are concerned as two typical bosonic models in our
study. By virtue of divergency structure of entanglement entropy,
we distinguish different phases of $O(N)$ $\sigma-$model, symmetric
phase with positive mass square and symmetry-breaking phase with negative
one. The ultra-violet divergences in entanglement entropy of field
theories, further more, are demonstrated to be cancelled by counter-terms
induced on the interface between two subregions entangling to each
other. It is consistent with that topological entanglement entropy
as non-divergent part of entanglement entropy is renormalizable quantity
which is understood as cosmological constant living on interface.
In non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge field theories, at the same time, interface
cosmological constant becomes more important because it is able to
clarify ambiguity emerging from different choices of boundary conditions
on the interface in gauge field theories simultaneously. In order
to extract physical quantity from the disputed issue, we continue
to calculate finite temperature dependence, susceptivity to size of
subsystem and mutual information which are related to physical parts
of entanglement and as well irrelevant to interface counter-terms.

Correlations and Fluctuations I,parallel,Higher moments of net-proton and net-charge multiplicity distributions at 14.5 GeV measured in  Au+Au collisions at mid-rapidity with STAR at RHIC,"Thaeder, Jochen",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,USA,"Studying fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon number (B) and charge (Q), provides insight into the properties of matter created in high-energy nuclear collisions. Lattice QCD calculations suggest that higher moments of these quantities are sensitive to the phase structure of the hot and dense nuclear matter created in such collisions.

The Beam Energy Scan (BES)-I program at RHIC, spanning center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV of Au+Au collisions, provided measurements at different baryochemical potentials, µB, to map the QCD phase diagram. In the years 2010 and 2011, STAR collected data of Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 62.4 GeV, leaving a wide gap of about $\mu_{\rm B}$ ~110 MeV between 19.6 ($\mu_{\rm B}$ ~206 MeV) and 11.5 GeV  ($\mu_{\rm B}$ ~316 MeV).   

In this talk, we present first experimental results of higher moments and their products of net-charge and net-proton distributions in Au+Au collisions at 14.5 GeV, measured with the STAR detector at RHIC at mid-rapidity and a transverse momentum up to $p_{\rm T}$ = 2 GeV/c. Their pseudo-rapidity and rapidity dependence will be shown as well. The corresponding value of the chemical potential from the top 5% central collisions is about $\mu_{\rm B}$ ~260 MeV, so that these results fill the largest gap of previous measurements, in $\mu_{\rm B}$, to complete the BES I program. 

Moreover, the energy dependence of higher moments of net-proton distributions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV in a much larger $p_{\rm T}$ range, utilizing the PID capabilities of the Time-of-Flight detector, are shown. Detector effects, including tracking efficiency, are taken into account. Implications of these results will be discussed in light of the recent Lattice QCD calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jochen', 'last_name': 'Thaeder', 'fullName': 'Thaeder, Jochen', 'id': '932924', 'affiliation': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '8a1487d6c9003065a1332506507952f5', 'db_id': 932924, 'person_id': 998692}"
Poster Session,poster,Lifshitz point for the inhomogeneous chiral phase transition in the magnetic field,"Tatsumi, Toshitaka",Kyoto U.,Unknown,"The possible existence of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram has recently received enhanced attention.
We elucidate some peculiar features of the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the magnetic field. Taking the dual chiral density wave (DCDW) [1], we have found that the energy spectrum of the Dirac operator exhibits the spectral asymmetry in the lowest Landau level, which is closely related to chiral anomaly [2]. It is a topological effect due to the phase od the chiral condensate inherent in the DCDW phase and gives rise to some interesting consequences such as a novel Lifshitz point [2], spontaneous magnetization [3] or appearance of the hybrid chiral condensate [4].
A new term appears in the generalized Ginzburg-Landau (gGL) expansion and the Lifshitz point appears on $\mu=0$ in the chiral limit. Such point should be directly explored by the lattice QCD simulations [2].
We can further pursue the Lifshitz point in a realistic situation, where quark mass is finite. Within the gGL theory the thermodynamic potential should include an additional term proportional to the quark mass and disfavor DCDW: DCDW is greatly modified around the Lifshitz point by the mass term, and it is shifted to larger $\mu$.  As a result one may expect a shift of the Lifshitz point from $\mu\sim 0$. On the other hand, it is well known that this term changes the usual chiral transition to be cross over at high temperature but small $\mu$. Note that the inhomogeneous to homogeneous phases should exhibit a clear phase transition due to the difference of symmetry between them. 
We discuss how the finite mass effect modifies our earlier findings and some implications on the lattice QCD simulations.

QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Direct photon production and jet quenching in small systems,"Gale, Charles",McGill University,Unknown,"Signatures usually associated with hydrodynamic behavior have been recently observed in high and intermediary multiplicity proton-nucleus (pA) collisions at the LHC. Even though these signals suggest the creation of a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in such collisions, they do not represent concrete proof. In order to better address this problem, other signals must be investigated.

In this work we calculate the thermal photon radiation produced by a small and rapidly expanding QGP droplet [1] and evaluate how much energy jets can loose when penetrating through such a small system.  We find that a significant amount of thermal radiation is produced in proton-nucleus collisions, with thermal photons accounting for ~50% of the direct photons produced in high multiplicity pA collisions at low $p_T$. Furthermore, we show that despite the small system size, jets still loose a significant fraction of their initial energy, leading to a charged hadron Raa of 0.7--0.8 at a transverse momentum of ~10 GeV.  If these two signatures can be accessed by the experiments, they will serve as additional evidence that a strongly coupled QGP is being produced in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC. To complete the analysis, we study direct photon production and jet quenching in other small systems, such as d-Au and He-Au collisions at RHIC energies.

Poster Session,poster,Status of Jet Reconstruction in Cu+Au collisions at 200 GeV from PHENIX,"Timilsina, Arbin",PHENIX,Unknown,"Jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions is a vital tool to explore medium effects, including energy loss and modification of parton fragmentation functions. In 2012, the PHENIX experiment collected a large sample of minimum bias Cu+Au collision data at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Asymmetric heavy ion collisions offer unique geometrical configurations and studying reconstructed jets in such systems provides the opportunity to understand the interplay between collision geometry and initial and final state effects. Energy densities in Cu+Au collisions are similar to those in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV but without the low-density 'corona' region.

Poster Session,poster,Charge Asymmetry Correlations to Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect from Beam Energy Scan by STAR,"Tu, Biao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"STAR has reported the measurement of charge asymmetry correlations with respect to the event plane in search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect [1]. The charge separation parameter $\Delta$ after model-independent subtraction of elliptic flow ($v_2$) background, was measured to be 1.3$\pm$1.4(stat.)$_{-1.0}^{+4.0}$ (syst.)$\times10^{-5}$ for $20-40\%$ Au+Au collisions at 200GeV, consistent with zero.In this talk we report results obtained with higher statistics data. A statistically significant finite signal is observed. The improved statistical precision allows systematic studies of the charge separation and investigation of possible further physics background. It is found that the charge separation parameter $\Delta$ increases with decreasing centrality, but shows a weak beam-energy dependence.  

We also report the application of a multi-particle correlation method [2] for the measurement of charge separation with model-independent background subtraction by the mixed-event technique. By comparing correlation functions along and perpendicular to the event plane, potential upper limits are set on the charge separation parameter in the high statistics 200 GeV Au+Au data.  

These results will be discussed in terms of the possible Chiral Magnetic Effect and/or physics background.

Using the same flow analysis method, we predict the collective flow in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with three different
baseline calculations, including: 1. UrQMD hadronic cascade simulations with the assumption that high energy pp collisions 
only create pure hadronic systems, 2. VISHNU hybrid model simulations that connect viscous hydrodynamics for the QGP expansion 
and UrQMD for the hadron resonance gas evolution, using smooth initial conditions, 
3. VISHNU simulations with fluctuating initial conditions. We find that triangular flow (if observed) is one of the 
unique observable directly associated with the domain structures in the created small pp systems.

The interplay between these fluctuations and the generally non-linear evolution of fluid flow makes the existence of a well-defined hydrostatic limit ambiguous.
We investigate these issues taking microscopic thermal perturbations into account non-perturbatively via lattice field theory techniques, where their effect is absorbed into the functional integral.
 
We find intriguing evidence, that the vacuum of such a theory is non-trivial, casting doubts on whether the gradient expansion can provide a good effective field theory for this type of system. The non-trivial vacuum looks like a ""turbulent"" state where some of the entropy is carried by macroscopic degrees of freedom. We describe further steps to strengthen or falsify this evidence, and conclude with a discussion of the role of these issues in the ""perfect fluid"" phenomenology of heavy ion collisions.

and Drell-Yan pairs in proton-nucleus interactions in the kinematic region 
corresponding to LHC experiments. Real photons and lepton pairs produced 
in a hard scattering are not accompanied with any final state interaction, 
either energy loss or absorption. Consequently, such observables as transverse momentum pT and rapidity distributions of real photons and lepton pairs at low and high dilepton invariant masses M may, therefore, serve as more efficient and cleaner probes for nuclear modification effects than inclusive hadron production. 

We have shown that shadowing effects in production of lepton pairs coming from the coherence are suppressed at large invariant masses and at very large pT at mid-rapidities. So naively one should not expect any nuclear effects
is this kinematical regime. Contrary to this expectation, we found 
a significant large-pT suppression which was already observed by PHENIX 
experiment in d+Au and central Au+Au collisions, as well as by fixed-target 
FNAL E772 and E866 experiments at large Feynman xF. This new effect can be 
treated as an effective energy loss proportional to the initial energy and 
is universally induced by multiple initial state interactions.

Besides, we present a systematic analysis of the nuclear effects in 
production of real photons and Drell-Yan pairs in p+Pb interaction at the LHC. We perform predictions for nuclear suppression as a function of pT, rapidity and dilepton invariant mass that can be verified by the LHC experiments.

We show that the low-lying Dirac modes, which are essential for chiral

Heavy quarks are created during early stages of heavy-ion collisions in hard processes before the QGP is formed. Their identities are not lost during the evolution of the QGP and subsequent phases, which makes them a good probe for the study of the properties of the QGP. Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) that originate from semileptonic decays of $D$ and $B$ hadrons can serve as a good proxy for heavy flavor quarks. The nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ of NPE is sensitive to the interaction of heavy quarks with the QGP and thus the QGP properties.

Measurements of NPE $R_{AA}$ have revealed a strong suppression at high $p_T$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200 $ GeV at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. In the year 2012 STAR collected data in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 193$ GeV. In the most central U+U collisions a higher energy density can be achieved than that in Au+Au collisions, which is expected to enhance the suppression of NPE.

In this talk we use this model to study the dependence of the crossover temperature with an external magnetic field. Remarkably, our results for the pressure of the plasma and the crossover temperature [1] are in quantitative agreement with current lattice data for values of the magnetic field $0< eB < 0.3$ GeV$^2$, which is the relevant range for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision applications.

We establish a comprehensive framework to describe the full heavy flavor evolution in heavy-ion collisions: the QGP medium is described in a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics model, the dynamics of heavy quarks are studied in an improved Langevin framework incorporating both radiative and collisional energy loss, and the hadronization of heavy quarks is described with a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination.\\

In this talk, we present first calculations of heavy flavor energy loss and collective behavior in p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The Nuclear modification factor shows a centrality dependence: in the untra-central collisions, in-medium energy loss leads to suppression of heavy quarks; while cold-nuclear-matter effects are dominant in mid-central to peripheral collisions. The comparison between the elliptic flow of mesons and light charged hadrons indicates an incomplete coupling of heavy quarks with the medium due to the reduced temperature and medium size. We propose to use centrality dependence of the observables in p+Pb collisions in order to disentangle hot-nuclear-matter effects from cold-nuclear-matter effects. In addition, we go beyond the typically studied systems in heavy-ion collisions and focus on small systems (Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV) and on a lower collisional energy ( Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 GeV).

We construct an Israel-Stewart-like theory containing these 13 temperature-dependent transport coefficients that is suitable for phenomenological applications in the context of numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We give parametrizations for the temperature dependence of all the second-order transport coefficients that appear in this theory in a format that can be easily implemented in current numerical hydrodynamic codes.

Their formula is valid only for small values of the transverse momentum of the small-x gluon from the target; it has TMD gluon distributions, but on-shell hard matrix elements. We extend their formula to all ranges of $k_t$ by including off-shell matrix elements. We also add finite $N_c$ corrections. The derivation is done with a standard Feynman diagram technique, and, independently, with a color ordered amplitudes method. The new formula encompasses both, the TMD factorization for small $k_t$ on the order of the saturation scale, and the High Energy Factorization (HEF) for large $k_t$ on the order of the momentum of the jets. The TMD and HEF factorizations can be derived from the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formula for forward di-jet production in the appropriate limits.

New Theoretical Developments II,unknown,In-medium jet evolution: interplay between broadening and decoherence effects,"Apolinario, Liliana",Instituto Superior Tecnico (PT),Unknown,"The description of the modifications of the coherence pattern of the parton shower when in the presence of a QGP has been actively addressed in recent studies. Among the several achievements, finite energy corrections, transverse momentum broadening due to medium interactions and interference effects between successive emissions has been extensively improved as they seem to be essential features for a correct description of heavy-ion collisions results. In this work, based on the insights of our previous work [2], we fully explore the physical interplay between broadening and decoherence, by generalising previous studies of medium-modifications of the antenna spectrum [1] - so far restricted to the case where transverse motion is neglected. The result allow us to identify two quantities controlling the decoherence of a medium modified shower that can be used as building blocks for a successful future generation of Jet quenching Monte Carlos: a generalisation of the $\Delta_{med}$ parameter of the works of [1] - that controls the interplay between the transverse scale of the hard probe and the transverse scale of the medium - and of the $\Delta_{coh}$ in [2] - that dictates the interferences between two emitters as a function of the transverse momentum broadening acquired by multiple scatterings with the medium.

In A+A reactions we have shown that covariance matters because compared to the ""vanilla"" (D)GLV energy loss model it gives about 50% higher v2 for pions, and also D and B mesons, due to an interplay between jet propagation direction and collective flow of the medium. I will now present results on the nuclear modification factor (R_AA) and harmonic flow (v_n) in p+Pb collisions at LHC energies. This is especially interesting because hydrodynamics requires high opacities which should then be visible in energy loss. I will discuss whether hydrodynamics in p+A reactions can be reconciled with (D)GLV energy loss and experiments, especially in view of measurements finding R_AA close to unity but with significant v2 at modestly high pT.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deke', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, Deke', 'id': '933007', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': '82bd33cffc796752018d0ba3388554ce', 'db_id': 933007, 'person_id': 998761}"
Poster Session,poster,(Non-)Critical fluctuation signals and their fate in heavy-ion collisions,"Bluhm, Marcus",North Carolina State University,Unknown,"A major goal of ongoing experiments in heavy-ion physics is the exploration of the QCD phase diagram with the potential discovery of the QCD critical point. Here, fluctuation observables are considered to be promising quantities for achieving this goal. Present experimental results alone are however inconclusive and need to be accompanied by advanced theoretical calculations which capture the relevant aspects of heavy-ion collisions.

In this talk we address two main topics in this context: the dynamical modelling of fluctuations within fluid dynamics and the impact of late stage effects on the (non-)critical signals in the fluctuation observables. In the first part we report on the inclusion of fluctuations into the fluid dynamical evolution equations. We show that (thermal) noise can be consistently incorporated in fluid dynamics and check our results against known equilibrium fluctuations and analytical results for Bjorken flow. This framework also allows one to study the evolution of critical fluctuations, for example by applying transport coefficients with critical behavior or by coupling the sigma-field to a fluid dynamical background. In the second part we assume that critical fluctuations have formed in the collision dynamics according to universality arguments and parametrizations of the correlation length. We study how resonance decay and regeneration as well as the distance of the system's trajectory and the chemical freeze-out from the critical point alter the signals that are expected to be seen in net-proton and net-charge fluctuations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marcus', 'last_name': 'Bluhm', 'fullName': 'Bluhm, Marcus', 'id': '933009', 'affiliation': 'North Carolina State University', 'emailHash': 'dc5db70727484b8566194e326570c192', 'db_id': 933009, 'person_id': 998762}"

The CVW has its microscopic origin at the quantum anomaly and macroscopically arises from interplay between vector and axial charge fluctuations induced by chiral vortical effects. An intuitive picture for the underlying mechanism of CVW will be provided, and the CVW wave equation will be derived both from anomalous hydrodynamic current equations and from chiral kinetic theory framework. The solutions of such wave equation show nontrivial CVW-induced charge transport from various initial conditions, which could give rise to observable signals. Using the rotating quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions as a concrete example, we demonstrate the formation of induced flavor quadrupole in QGP and estimate the elliptic flow splitting effect for Lambda baryons that may be experimentally measured.

Poster Session,poster,Constraining the validity of hydrodynamic approaches by using a new exact solution of the Boltzmann equation,"Noronha, Jorge",University of Sao Paulo,United States,"Relativistic hydrodynamics plays an important role in the quantitative description of the space-time evolution of the strongly coupled QGP created in Ultrarelativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions. Thus, it is necessary to have under control the physical assumptions made in the hydrodynamical modelling.  In this work we present a new exact solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation. This solution describes a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric radial expansion for arbitrary shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. The resulting solution is invariant under the $SO(3)_q \otimes SO(1,1) \otimes Z_2$ group symmetry. We test the efficiency of various hydrodynamic approximation methods by comparing the evolution of the moments of the exact solution (such as energy density and shear viscous tensor) with the corresponding solutions of the macroscopic hydrodynamic equations. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase-space evolution of this new exact solution and the physical constraints on its applicability.

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium I,parallel,Centrality and pseudorapidity dependence of transverse energy flow in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV with CMS,"Murray, Michael",University of Kansas (US),USA,"The CMS Collaboration has measured the pseudorapidity and centrality dependence $dE{T}/d\eta$ for 5.02 TeV pPb collisions over 10 units of pseudo-rapidity. This was carried out in a systematic way by measuring centrality using different experimental definitions. As the centrality increases the mean pseudorapidity moves backwards and the $1/N dE_{T}/d\eta$ distribution widens. For the most central pPb collisions the maximum $1/N dE_{T}/d\eta$ reaches 25 GeV. The rate of change of dEt/deta with eta and centrality is characterized by the ratio $S_{pc} (eta, centrality) = E_{T} (\eta, centrality)/E_{T}(\eta, centrality=0-10\%)$. This ratio depends very strongly upon the definition of centrality and shows strong auto-correlations if a particular eta region is used to define centrality. For the most central events there is a large overlap in the event classes selected by different centrality measurements, but for peripheral events different centrality measures select quite different. This is quite different to the situation in PbPb and suggests that event-by-event fluctuations in the pseudorapidity distribution of particles are much stronger in pPb than in PbPb.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Murray', 'fullName': 'Murray, Michael', 'id': '933021', 'affiliation': 'University of Kansas (US)', 'emailHash': '8f75899199011d39b28025ed4bff7cf2', 'db_id': 933021, 'person_id': 998772}"

These spectra measurements are performed with pp reference at 5.02 TeV constructed by interpolation or extrapolation from different $\sqrt{s}$, and on steeply falling power-law spectra. As the jet fragmentation function is only evolving logarithmically with $\sqrt{s}$, this further underscores the importance of a direct measurement. Together with the CMS results in pPb inclusive jets and charge hadron $R_{pPb}$, we introduce the new CMS measurement of fragmentation function in pPb collisions, where within our uncertainties, jets in pPb is found to have identical fragmentation property vs. pp jets.

A surprising dependence of the excited over the ground state ratio, as a function of the global event activity, was also found in pPb data.

For this purpose we employ the infrared-improved Gribov dispersion relation of gluons in the kinetic theory setup in the relaxation time approximation and determine the exact in- and out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system. In the static case the resulting equation of state of the studied system provides a good qualitative description of the pure-glue lattice QCD data down to the vicinity of the phase transition [2,3,4], thus permitting a study of the non-equilibrium phenomena in a plasma that exhibits crucial features of the QCD phase transition. In the case of local thermal equilibrium we observe Bjorken-like cooling of the boost-invariant expanding system. Out of equilibrium, by matching to the first order viscous hydrodynamics, we calculate bulk [3] and shear [5] viscosity of the system. We find significant enhancement of the bulk to shear viscosity ratio close to the transition temperature and its universal scaling behavior, in line with the one expected in a strongly-coupled theories [5]. We interpret the onset of strongly-coupled features in the system as the possible explanation of the close to perfect fluid behavior of the quark-gluon plasma.

Collective Dynamics II,parallel,Hydrodynamic fluctuations and dissipation in an integrated dynamical model,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Thermal fluctuations arising during hydrodynamic evolution of
the system (a.k.a., *hydrodynamic fluctuations*) [1] play an important role
in event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. For example, entropy
production fluctuates during the expansion even if we start from a common
initial condition in a macroscopic sense [2]. On the other hand, the
effect of the fluctuations must be significant in small colliding systems
such as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions [2]. Stability of thermal
equilibrium systems is a consequence of an interplay between thermal
fluctuations and dissipation. Thus it is indispensable to take the
hydrodynamic fluctuations into account in causal dissipative hydrodynamic
simulations.

In this study, we develop a new (next-generation) integrated dynamical
model to investigate the effects of the hydrodynamic fluctuations on
observables in high-energy nuclear collisions. We implement the
hydrodynamic fluctuations in a fully 3-D dynamical model consisting of
the hydrodynamic initialization models such as Monte-Carlo
Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi model and Monte-Carlo Glauber model, causal
dissipative hydrodynamics, and the subsequent hadronic cascades. By
analyzing the hadron distributions obtained by massive event-by-event
simulations with both of the hydrodynamic fluctuations and the
initial-state fluctuations, we discuss the effects of the hydrodynamic
fluctuations on the flow harmonics, $v_n$, and their fluctuations. This
sheds a new light on extracting transport coefficients from observables.

On one hand, perturbative and lattice computations indicate that the potential describing the interaction of two heavy quarks in a plasma has an imaginary part that effectively takes into account the collisions of the heavy quarks with the plasma constituents. There are also experimental indications that recombination plays an important role in determining the observed suppression. Both of these developments force us to deepen our understanding of the dynamics of quarkonia in a medium, beyond the static or equilibrium picture that prevails in most discussions. In this talk we investigate the quantum evolution of quarkonium in a thermal medium, including finite momentum effects that are usually ignored in potential models. By treating color degrees of freedom in a rigorous way we are able to understand under which circumstances a classical evolution, similar to that given by a Langevin equation, can be obtained. This classical equation can be generalized to an arbitrary number of heavy quarks, allowing us to study within the same formalism quarkonium suppression and recombination.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Miguel angel', 'last_name': 'ESCOBEDO ESPINOSA', 'fullName': 'ESCOBEDO ESPINOSA, Miguel angel', 'id': '933057', 'affiliation': 'CEA Saclay-CNRS', 'emailHash': 'd01141026ad41cba6e2ebc15f91a3e65', 'db_id': 933057, 'person_id': 998800}"

Quarkonia III,parallel,Measurements of Quarkonium Polarization and Production versus Charged-Particle Multiplicity in p+p Collisions at √s = 500 GeV in the STAR experiment,"Trzeciak, Barbara",Czech Technical University in Prague,Unknown,"Good knowledge of quarkonium production mechanism in p+p collisions is crucial for interpretation of the heavy-ion results. However, it is still not well understood after decades of effort. Simultaneous measurement of quarkonium spectrum and polarization in a wide kinematic range, notably at high transverse momentum, is suggested as a necessary step towards determination of quarkonium production mechanism. Moreover, an intriguing trend of a sharp increase of the quarkonium yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity was observed in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$= 7 TeV at the LHC. Such a behavior could be qualitatively explained in the framework of multiparton interactions, hydrodynamic evolution, or the percolation model and the latter two assume the formation of a high density medium. Therefore it is very interesting and important to study if such effects are also present at much lower energies in order to discriminate among these theoretical interpretations.

In this talk, we will present new J/$\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ measurements in p+p

interaction kernel for a pair of particles, which is related to the

At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is sensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the medium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms - gluon radiation vs. collisional processes.

Recently, first steps were taken to extend SCET and describe jet evolution in strongly-interacting matter. In this talk I will demonstrate that the newly constructed theory, called SCETG, allows us for the first time in more than a decade to go beyond the traditional energy loss approximation in heavy ion collisions and unify the treatment of vacuum and medium-induced parton showers. It provides quantitative control over the uncertainties associated with the implementation of the in-medium modification of hadron production cross sections and allows us to accurately constrain the coupling between the jet and the medium. I will further show how SCETG is implemented to present predictions for inclusive hadron suppression in Pb+Pb collisions at the highest LHC energies of 5.1 ATeV and discuss the relative significance of cold and hot nuclear matter effects.

They provide new insights into the mechanism of heavy flavor propagation and energy loss in dense QCD matter. B-jets are also an important physics thrust of the RHIC heavy ion program. In this talk we present recent theoretical advances in understanding single inclusive beauty jet production, as well as photon-tagged and B-meson-tagged b-jet production in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We find that predictions for the nuclear-induced attenuation of inclusive b-jets, based on the theory of coherent energy loss in the QGP, agree well with recent CMS experimental data at a center-of-mass energy 2.76 TeV. We further extend our results to photon-tagged and B-meson tagged b-jet production at 5.1 TeV for comparison to data from the upcoming LHC Pb+Pb run.  We find that photon-tagged b-jets exhibit smaller momentum imbalance shift in nuclear matter, and correspondingly smaller energy loss, than photon-tagged light flavor jets. Our results show that B-meson tagging is most effective in ensuring that the dominant fraction of recoiling jets originate from prompt b-quarks. Interestingly, in this channel the large suppression of the cross section is not accompanied by a significant momentum imbalance shift, a behavior quite different from the one observed in dijet asymmetry distributions. Last but not least, we present comparison between the b-jet attenuation and the quenching of open heavy flavor (D and B mesons) in heavy ion collisions.

The largest source of uncertainty in these model-to-data extractions is the choice of theoretical initial conditions used to model the distribution of entropy (energy) at the hydrodynamic thermalization time. 

In this work we adopt a data driven approach and introduce a new parametric initial condition model that is constrained by systematic model-to-data comparison [1412.4708]. Starting from a participant nucleon model, we eschew binary collision scaling and parameterize the mapping from participant nucleon density to entropy deposition using a family of functions known as generalized means. These functions — described by a single continuous parameter — interpolate between the minimum and maximum of the local participant thickness functions and reduce to well known harmonic, geometric and arithmetic means for certain special cases.

We demonstrate that this new ansatz is flexible and can be used to emulate a broad class of initial condition models which are not described by a two-component wounded nucleon and binary collision parameterization. The model is then embedded in a state of the art hybrid simulation, and Bayesian model-to-data comparison is used to constrain initial state and medium properties simultaneously [1502.00339].

Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are  important probes of this matter, as they are produced in initial hard scattering processes and  they experience all the stages of the medium evolution. Therefore measurements of heavy-flavour hadron production provide important information on the early stage of the collision and the parton-medium interaction. Open heavy-flavour production measurements in pp collisions provide the necessary baseline to understand the results in Pb-Pb collisions and a test of pQCD (perturbative quantum chromodynamics) calculations. Furthermore, the study of open heavy-flavour production in pp collisions as a function of charged-particle multiplicity allows us to investigate the interplay between hard and soft mechanisms in particle production. In particular, it could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions (MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occurring in a single collision at high centre-of-mass energies.

In this contribution, the measurement of  open heavy-flavour per-event yields as a function of  charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ =7 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector will be presented.

The ALICE detector at the LHC collected data in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 2.76, 7, 8 TeV and, starting from June 2015, at 13 TeV, as well as in Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV and in p--Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV.
In ALICE, $\rm{D}^{*+}$ mesons are reconstructed at mid-rapidity via the $\rm{D}^{\star +} \rightarrow \rm{D}^0$ $\pi^+$ $\rightarrow \rm{K}^-$ $\pi^+$ $\pi^+$ decay channel.

In this contribution, we present the latest results on the $\rm{D}^{\star +}$-meson nuclear modification factor in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}= 2.76$ TeV as well as discuss prospects for $\rm{D}^{\star +}$-meson measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the LHC run-2 data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Annelies Marianne', 'last_name': 'Veen', 'fullName': 'Veen, Annelies Marianne', 'id': '933103', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': '2b9fc3b5be93c7adb11d6b027cf7e76c', 'db_id': 933103, 'person_id': 998826}"
Poster Session,poster,Torque effect and long-range rapidity fluctuations,"Bozek, Piotr",AGH University of Science and Technology,Poland,"We investigate the torque effect (decorrelation of event planes in rapidity) [1,2] and find
that the recent CMS results for p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions suggest specific fluctuations of the initially 
deposited entropy. In our model, the extent in rapidity of the initial sources is randomly distributed over 
the available range. These fluctuations increase the event-plane decorrelation: for Pb+Pb they bring the 
results closer to the data, while for p+Pb collisions they are essential to generate sizable decorrelation.

We also make predictions of the torque effect for the collisions of Au+Au and Cu+Au at RHIC energies,

The measurement of the D-meson nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) is sensitive to the in-medium energy loss of charm quarks.

Prominent results from the LHC Run1 involved the measurement of single and dimuons in the ALICE Muon Spectrometer (MS) at -4 < η < -2.5 to look for low mass vector mesons, rare probes from the charmonium and bottomonium families, and open-heavy flavor. These probes allow to investigate the chiral symmetry restoration, to test the predictions from the lattice QCD about the melting temperature of a tightly bound heavy 
<i>qqbar</i> pair, to test the in-medium regeneration scenario, and to scrutinise the gluon density in the QGP using the in-medium heavy-quark energy loss. By the end of the Run2, the ALICE experiment will accumulate around 1/nb of Pb–Pb collisions. However, at least 10/nb will be needed to conduct high precision multidifferential studies on rare probes. To that end, LHC will be able to provide high rate running conditions for Run3 and beyond, i.e. 50 kHz for Pb–Pb collisions.
The ALICE apparatus will have to inspect all heavy-ion collisions to achieve the physics goals. We will present the required upgrade for the MS. The new Front-End and Read-Out Electronics are designed to cope with a peaking readout rate of 100 kHz, to be compared with the current capability of 1 kHz.
In addition, a new CMOS monolithic pixel tracking detector, the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), will be added upstream of the absorber located before the MS, to provide vertexing capabilities at -3.6 < η < -2.45. On top of substantially improving the current performances of the MS, the MFT also opens a wealth of new measurements not accessible presently, such as open charm/beauty separation, ψ(2S) in central Pb–Pb collisions, prompt and non-prompt J/ψ separation.

Majority of cosmic-ray nuclei is known to vary from proton to iron, and their target in the atmosphere is light nuclei such as nitrogen and oxygen.  To study the high-energy cosmic rays with low flux, atmospheric air showers are observed instead of primary particles.  To interpret the air shower observation to the properties of primary particles, the knowledge of the high-energy interaction is indispensable.
  The Large Hadron Collider forward (LHCf) experiment was designed to study the particle production at LHC. Though the ultimate target of the experiment is the ultrarelativistic nucleus collisions, LHCf has so far measured precise cross sections in the LHC proton-proton collisions.  LHCf has measured particle production at pseudo-rapidity >8.4, where the secondary particles carry a large fraction of collisions energy, with the LHC sqrt(s)=0.9, 2.76, 7 and 13 TeV proton-proton collisions.  To study the nuclear effect at an extreme condition, measurements with the sqrt(s_NN)=5 TeV proton-lead collisions were also performed.
   The observed production cross sections of pi^0’s and neutrons, nuclear effect of the pi^0 production in p-Pb collisions are so far well explained by the major interaction models used in the cosmic-ray physics.

lead to an enhancement in the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$/D$^0$ ratio. Therefore, it is of great
interest to study the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryon production to further understand the hadronization
scheme in the charm sector and constrain total charm yield in heavy-ion collisions. The
possible $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$/D$^0$ enhancement in heavy-ion collisions will introduce additional
suppression for charm decay electrons due to smaller semi-leptonic decay branching
ratios of $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$, which could lead to a different interpretation of the heavy flavor decay
electron results.


$\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryons have an extremely small lifetime ($c \tau \sim 60$ $\mu$m) and have not been measured
in heavy-ion collisions yet. The newly installed STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) has
shown high efficiency and a superior pointing resolution that facilitate the reconstruction of hadronic decays in

QGP in Small Systems II,parallel,Causal hydrodynamic fluctuation in Bjorken expansion,"Nagai, Kenichi",Sophia university,Unknown,"We investigate effects of causal hydrodynamic fluctuation on dynamics of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) in Bjorken expansion in high-energy nuclear collisions. The space-time evolution of the QGP can be well described by relativistic hydrodynamics. In the recent hydrodynamic analyses, effects of event-by-event (e-by-e) initial fluctuation on final flow observables have been focused. Moreover, it is hotly debated whether the same hydrodynamic models can be applicable even in small systems such as p-p, p-A, and peripheral A-A collisions. 

In this study, we focus on thermal fluctuation during hydrodynamic evolution which must be also important on an e-by-e basis of hydrodynamic description, in particular, in small systems.
We first introduce causal hydrodynamic fluctuation, namely the thermal noises arising during the hydrodynamic evolution, into the boost invariant Bjorken expansion. We next perform hydrodynamic simulations of the Bjorken model with hydrodynamic fluctuation on an e-by-e basis. 

We find the final entropy fluctuates around the mean value even if the initial condition is fixed in a macroscopic sense. We also find the entropy can temporally decreases during the time evolution, which is allowed by the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical physics. Fluctuation of entropy results in multiplicity fluctuation as an observable. Through the fluctuation-dissipation relation, hydrodynamic fluctuation is intimately related with dissipation. Thus final multiplicity fluctuation contains transport properties of the QGP. The fluctuation effect would be significant in small system such as p-p, p-A and peripheral A-A collisions. Therefore we may have a chance to constrain the transport properties in such small systems. 

We further discuss rapidity　dependent hydrodynamic fluctuation on top of boost-invariant Bjorken expansion to see whether long-range rapidity correlation can be contaminated by hydrodynamic fluctuations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenichi', 'last_name': 'Nagai', 'fullName': 'Nagai, Kenichi', 'id': '933119', 'affiliation': 'Sophia university', 'emailHash': 'fab9a3b3de60218bed97d2b94013f284', 'db_id': 933119, 'person_id': 998511}"

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,Resumming large radiative corrections in the high-energy evolution of the Color Glass Condensate,"Iancu, Edmond",IPhT Saclay,France,"The Color Glass Condensate effective theory is the perturbative QCD description of the initial state for proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The BK-JIMWLK equations describing the evolution of this theory with increasing energy have recently been extended to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy, which should allow for direct comparisons with the phenomenology.  However, some of the NLO corrections turn out to be extremely large, since amplified by (double and single) `collinear’ logarithms, i.e. logarithms of ratios of transverse momenta. As a result, the evolution at NLO becomes unstable and void of any predictive power. This difficulty points towards the existence of large radiative corrections to all orders in $\alpha_s$, which must be computed and resummed in order to restore the predictive power of the perturbative expansion. 

In Ref. [1], we performed such a resummation for the largest corrections — those where each power of $\alpha_s$ is accompanied by a double transverse logarithm. Subsequently, in Ref. [2], we have extended this resummation by including single transverse logarithms and running coupling corrections. This led us to a `collinearly improved’ version of BK equation, which resums the largest radiative corrections to all orders. Numerical studies of this equation show that the evolution is now stable and also considerably slowed down by the resummation. To demonstrate the usefulness of this equation as a tool for phenomenology, for have used it for fits to the HERA data for electron-proton deep inelastic scattering at high energy [2]. We have obtained excellent fits with a reduced number of free parameters and with initial conditions at low energy taken from perturbative QCD.

For the first time, the multiplicity distributions for pp collisions are measured over a wide kinematic range at the LHC (pseudorapidity coverage of $-3.4<\eta<+5.1$).

Poster Session,poster,Global and Local Temperature Fluctuations in High Energy Heavy-ion Collisions,"Nayak, Tapan",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),India,"Heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies create matter at extreme conditions of energy density and temperature, similar to the ones that existed within a few microseconds after the Big Bang. The fireball produced in the collision goes through a rapid evolution from an early partonic phase of deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to a hadronic phase and ultimately freezing out after a few tens of fm. 
Temperature fluctuations have been discussed in the literature as a means of characterizing the evolving system. The fluctuations may have two distinct origins, first, quantum fluctuations that are initial state fluctuations, and second, thermodynamical fluctuations. We discuss a method of extracting the thermodynamic temperature from the mean transverse momentum of pions, by using controllable parameters such as centrality of the system, and range of the transverse momenta. Event-by-event fluctuations in global temperature over a large phase space provide the specific heat of the system. We present Beam Energy Scan of sp. heat from data, AMPT and HRG model prediction. For Pb-Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, because of the production of a large number of particles in every event, it is possible to divide the phase space into small bins and obtain local temperature for each bin. Event-by-event fluctuations in local temperature can be obtained by following a novel procedure of making fluctuation map of each event. 
The origin of the local fluctuations has been studied with the help of event-by-event hydrodynamic calculations, which shows that the system exhibits fiercely large fluctuations at early times after the collision, which diminishes with the elapse of time. Any observation of non-zero local fluctuations may imply that a part of the early fluctuations might have survived till freeze-out. We discuss the hydrodynamic calculations and a feasibility study at LHC using AMPT simulated data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tapan', 'last_name': 'Nayak', 'fullName': 'Nayak, Tapan', 'id': '933142', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': '3eb0d7389968fcaf9ef891c87c9016c2', 'db_id': 933142, 'person_id': 998413}"
Correlations and Fluctuations II,parallel,Systematics of higher order net-baryon number fluctuations at small values of the baryon chemical potential: A comparison of lattice QCD and beam energy scan results,"Karsch, Frithjof",Brookhaven National Laboratory & Bielefeld University,USA & Germany,"Fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges of strong 
interactions have long been considered sensitive observables 
for the exploration of the structure of the phase diagram of QCD. Cumulants 
of conserved charge fluctuations are the most promising experimental observables 
in the search for a critical point in the phase diagram of QCD performed in the 
beam energy scan (BES) at RHIC. The published data on cumulants of net-proton number 
fluctuations and, in particular, the still preliminary data set on net-proton 
fluctuations which covers a larger transverse momentum range show obvious 
deviations from the thermodynamics of a hadron resonance gas (HRG). This 
naturally raises the question whether ratios of cumulants of net-proton number 
fluctuations, and the relation between them and net electric charge cumulants 
measured by STAR and PHENIX can be understood in terms of equilibrium 
thermodynamics obtained from lattice QCD calculations.

We present results for cumulants of net-baryon number and net electric
charge fluctuations calculated 
in a next-to-leading order (NLO) Taylor series in the baryon chemical potential
($\mu_B$). We discuss the resulting pattern of ratios of cumulants, 
e.g. $\kappa_B\sigma_B^2\equiv \chi_4^B/\chi_2^B$ and 
$S_B\sigma_B^3/M_B\equiv \chi_3^B/\chi_1^B$. We note that both quantities are 
identical at $\mu_B=0$ and that the curvature of the 
latter is about three times larger than the former. Comparing this generic 
structure with STAR results on net-proton number fluctuations we conclude that 
current BES results at energies $\sqrt{s} \ge 19.6$~GeV 
are compatible with QCD thermodynamics and can be understood in a NLO Taylor 
expansion. We also discuss changes of freeze-out parameters that arise from the new, 
preliminary STAR data on net-proton fluctuations compared to the published data and the
recent PHENIX data on electric charge fluctuations.",
Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic evolution of the event-by-event fluctuating initial state,"Lacey, Roy",Stony Brook University,USA,"In high energy heavy ion collisions of RHIC and LHC, a strongly interacting quark gluon plasma (sQGP) is created. Due to the finite number of nucleons, the initial distribution fluctuates on an event-by-event basis. This medium undergoes a hydrodynamic evolution, before it freezes out to form a hadronic matter. In the last years it has been revealed that if measuring relative to higher order event planes $\Psi_n$, higher order flow coefficients $v_n$ for $n>2$ can be measured. It also turned out that Bose-Einstein (HBT) correlation radii also show 3rd order oscillations if measured versus the third order event plane $\Psi_3$. The initial transverse plane anisotropy causing these phenomena can be translated into a series of anisotropy coefficients or eccentricities: $\epsilon_2$, $\epsilon_3$, $\epsilon_4$, etc. These anisotropies then evolve in time, and result in measurable momentum-space anisotropies, to be measured with respect to their respective symmetry planes. In our work we investigate the time evolution of the asymmetries and the mixing of spatial and momentum space anisotropies via numerical viscous hydrodynamics and via analytic solutions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Roy', 'last_name': 'Lacey', 'fullName': 'Lacey, Roy', 'id': '933150', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': 'c1129d5060eac3f589873103b9f63418', 'db_id': 933150, 'person_id': 998856}"

We construct the equations of state following the 3-window description proposed by Masuda-Hatsuda-Takatsuka: at low density, we use the APR equation of state; at high density we use the NJL model with supplemental vector and diquark interactions that are inferred from the hadron spectroscopy and nuclear physics; at intermediate density we interpolate the low and high density equations of state. The 3-window approach allows us to consider a class of quark equations of state which have been implicitly omitted in the conventional hybrid construction.

The suppressions exhibit strong nucleus A and also kinematic dependences, especially with Feynman-x (or rapidity) and transverse momentum pT. Such suppression in heavy ion collisions is predicted to be an important signature for the formation of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) due to color screening, however, there are also other non-QGP effects, such as initial state parton energy loss, parton shadowing and final state breakup, that affect the formation of charmonia. It is important to quantify the contributions from the cold nuclear matter, and it could be achieved through studying charmonia and Drell-Yan productions in proton-nucleus collisions where no significant QGP is expected. E906/SeaQuest is a fixed-target dimuon experiment at Fermilab using the 120 GeV proton beam from the Main Injector.

Jets and High pT Hadrons I,parallel,Thermalization of mini-jets in a quark-gluon plasma,"Wu, Bin",CEA-Saclay,Unknown,"We complete the physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma by investigating the thermalization of the soft components of the jet. We argue that the following scenario should hold: the leading particle emits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via quasi-democratic branchings and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the order of the medium temperature T. Via elastic collisions with the medium constituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the plasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical lifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind the hard components of the jet. We support this scenario, first, via parametric arguments and, next, by studying a simplified kinetic equation, which describes the jet dynamics in longitudinal phase-space. We solve the kinetic equation using both (semi-)analytical and numerical methods. In particular, we obtain the first exact, analytic, solutions to the ultrarelativistic Fokker-Planck equation in one-dimensional phase-space. Our results confirm the physical picture aforementioned and demonstrate the quenching of the jet via multiple branching followed by the thermalization of the soft gluons in the cascades.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bin', 'last_name': 'Wu', 'fullName': 'Wu, Bin', 'id': '933160', 'affiliation': 'CEA-Saclay', 'emailHash': 'f7ca681d86612ffe1ea83babd5a78bcd', 'db_id': 933160, 'person_id': 998866}"
Jets and High pT Hadrons III,parallel,Consistency of Perfect Fluidity and Jet Quenching in semi-Quark-Gluon Monopole Plasmas,"Xu, Jiechen",Columbia University,USA,"We utilize a new framework, CUJET3.0, to deduce the energy and temperature dependence of the jet quenching parameter, $\hat{q}(E>10\;{\rm GeV},T)$, from a combined analysis of available data on the nuclear modification factor and azimuthal asymmetry of high $p_T$ light hadrons and open heavy flavors in high-energy A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC. Extending a previous perturbative QCD based jet energy loss model (known as CUJET2.0) with (2+1)D viscous hydrodynamic backgrounds, this new framework includes three novel features of nonperturbative physics origin: (1) the Polyakov loop suppression of color-electric scatterings and (2) the enhancement of the jet scattering due to emergent chromomagnetic monopoles near $T_c$ and (3) thermodynamic properties constrained by lattice QCD data. CUJET3.0 reduces to CUJET2.0 at high temperatures $T > 400$ MeV, but greatly enhances $\hat{q}$ near the QCD deconfinement transition temperature. This enhancement accounts well for the observed elliptic harmonics of jets with $p_T>10$ GeV. Extrapolating our data-constrained $\hat{q}$ down to thermal energy scales, $E \sim 2$ GeV, we find for the first time a remarkable consistency between the high energy jet quenching and bulk perfect fluidity with $\eta/s\sim T^3/\hat{q} \sim 0.1$ near $T_c$.

Possible signatures of a softening of the QCD equation of state have been reported at BES energies, and directed flow (rapidity-odd $v_1(y)$) is one of the more striking examples in this category. This talk will focus on $v_1$, and its slope $dv_1/dy$, near midrapidity. Ten identified particle types will be presented: $\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda$, $\phi$, $K^0_s$, $K^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, and $\pi^\pm$ produced in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV as a function of rapidity. For $\Lambda$, $K^0_s$, $K^\pm$, $p$ and $\pi^\pm$, all results are presented in the centrality bins $0-5\%$, $5-10\%$, $10-20\%$, $20-30\%$, $30-40\%$, $40-50\%$, $50-60\%$, $60-70\%$ and $70-80\%$.    

At intermediate centrality (10-40\%), $dv_1/dy$ shows a minimum near 14.5 GeV for several particle species while $p$ and $\Lambda$ also show a sign change. The $\phi$ meson appears to follow $\bar{p}$ at the higher BES energies, while protons, kaons and pions have a lower magnitude than $\bar{p}$ at 14.5 GeV and above. $\Lambda$ and $p$ are consistent within errors at all energies. $dv_1/dy$ shows a strong centrality dependence, especially for $p$ and $\Lambda$ at the lower beam energies. Results for net kaons and net protons will also be discussed.  

The UrQMD model shows a qualitatively similar trend for only a subset of the ten particle types under investigation.

Poster Session,poster,Dilepton and photon production in the semi-quark gluon plasma,"Hidaka, Yoshimasa",RIKEN,Unknown,"We discuss the dilepton and photon production in the semi-quark gluon plasma (semi-QGP), at temperatures above but near the critical temperature for deconfinement. Working to leading order in the coupling constant of QCD, we find that there is a mild enhancement, ~ 20%, for dilepton production in the semi-QGP over that in the perturbative QGP. In contrast, we find that photon production is strongly suppressed in the semi-QGP, by about an order of magnitude, relative to the perturbative QGP. In the perturbative QGP photon production contains contributions from 2->2 scattering and collinear emission with the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In the semi-QGP we show that the two contributions are modified differently. The rate for 2->2 scattering is suppressed by a factor which depends upon the Polyakov loop. In contrast, the collinear rate is suppressed not by the Polyakov loop, but by 1/N. We compute the rate from 2->2 scattering to the leading logarithmic order and the collinear rate with the LPM effect to leading order in the semi-QGP.

Quarkonia IV,parallel,Observation of a J/psi yield enhancement at very low pT in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV,"Martinez-Garcia, Gines",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),Unknown,"We report on the first measurement of an excess in the yield of J/psi at 
very low transverse momentum with respect to expectations from hadronic

Remarkably, the measured nuclear modification factor of J/$\psi$ in the 
rapidity range 2.5<$y$<4.0 reaches about 7 (2) for Pb-Pb collisions in 
the $p_\mathrm{T}$ range 0-300 MeV/$c$ and in the 70--90% (50--70%) centrality class.
The excess is observed at very low $p_\mathrm{T}$, below 300 MeV/c, evoking the $p_\mathrm{T}$ 
distribution of J/$\psi$ coherent photoproduction measured in ultra 
peripheral Pb-Pb collisions.
The J/$\psi$ production cross section associated with the observed 
enhancement in the yield is obtained under the hypothesis that coherent 
photoproduction is the underlying physics mechanism.
If this hypothesis is confirmed, the observation of J/$\psi$ coherent 
photo-production in Pb-Pb collisions at impact parameters smaller than 
twice the nuclear radius opens new theoretical and experimental

Poster Session,poster,Effects of Momentum Cuts on Higher Order Cumulants of Conserved Charges,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We discuss the effects of momentum cuts in the fluctuations of conserved charges in the following contexts:

1) Kinematic momentum cuts of pions in electric charge fluctuations.
2) Soft momentum scale in net-baryon number fluctuations at chiral crossover.

In 1),we show that the normalized kurtosis $\kappa\sigma^2$ is substantially reduced by the $p_T$ cut because it suppresses the effect of Bose statistics.
The reduced value of $\kappa\sigma^2$ is found to be consistent with the recently measured data by PHENIX [1].

In 2), using the functional renormlization group (FRG) method, we calculate the higher order cumulants of net-baryon number as a function of infrared momentum scale $k$ in a chiral quark-meson model [2]. We show that the characteristic negative values of the sixth order cumulants at vanishing $\mu$ and fourth order one at large $\mu$ turn to positive if the momentum scale below $2m_\pi$ are not taken into account.

Recently, significant developments are achieved in construction of realistic hydrodynamic models with viscosity effects and event-by-event fluctuations. As a result, we can discuss the bulk feature of the QGP such as transport coefficients and the equations of state in detail from comparison between hydrodynamic calculations and experimental results at RHIC and LHC. One of the current hottest topics is higher flow harmonics which has the information of initial conditions through event-by-event fluctuations and the space-time evolution of the QGP matter. In particular, it is pointed out that the higher flow harmonics is related to the ridge structure which is remnant of long correlations in the longitudinal direction [1]. The dynamics in the longitudinal direction may affect that on the transvers plane. Here, we investigate the effect of longitudinal fluctuations to the higher flow harmonics, using a hydrodynamic simulation [2]. Especially, we discuss possible existence and time evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy ion collisions. If the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability occurs through longitudinal fluctuations, the vortexes form, which may affect the expansion in the transvers direction. We also argue the influence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to physical observables such as particle distributions and higher flow harmonics.

Poster Session,poster,Analysis of charmonium at finite temperature from complex Borel sum rules,"Araki, Kenji",Tokyo Institute of Technology,Unknown,"Recently, we proposed a new type of QCD sum rules i.e. the complex Borel sum rules (CBSR) [1]. It has been found that the CBSR is superior to the conventional QCD sum rules from the point of view of the maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis. Specifically, we have demonstrated that our novel method can be used to study the excited states of hadrons. The suppression of quarkonium states (e.g. J/psi and upsilon) is an important signature of the hot matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Recently, the behavior of the excited states at finite temperature, which can be different from the ground state, has attracted much attention. The suppression of the quarkonium ground states has already been analyzed by conventional QCD sum rules with MEM [2,3].
 In this presentation, we report on the results of a reanalysis by CBSR with MEM to investigate the thermal behavior of the charmonium excited states.

 non-abelian gauge theories, a dual QCD gauge theory is constructed in terms
 of magnetic symmetry, which manifest the topological structure of the symmetry group in a non-trivial way. The topological magnetic charges associated with monopoles have been  brought into the dynamics by the possible homotopy $\Pi_{2}[SU(3)/U(1) \otimes U^{'}(1)]$. The dynamical breaking of the magnetic symmetry has been shown to impart
 the dual superconducting properties to the magnetically condensed QCD vacuum which ultimately leads to a unique flux tube configuration in QCD vacuum responsible for enforcing the color confinement. The color singlet physical spectrum in accordance with the color confinement has been achieved through the requirement of the color reflection invariance which provides two magnetic glueballs as the collective excitations of the magnetically condensed dual superconducting QCD vacuum which in turn, are intimately connected to the flux confining parameters (penetration length and coherence length) of the superconducting vacuum. Furthermore, in view of the relevance of the phase transitions at finite temperatures, utilizing the path-integral formalism, dual QCD theory has also been extended to the thermal domain to examine the deconfinement phase transition. The effective potential at finite temperature has, thus, been derived to compute the critical temperature for phase transition which has been shown to be  in good agreement with the lattice results. A large reduction of color monopole condensate
 and glueball masses near the critical temperature has been shown to lead to a first order deconfinement phase transition and the complete evaporation of color monopole condensate in the high temperature domain reveals to the restoration of magnetic symmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Garima', 'last_name': 'Punetha', 'fullName': 'Punetha, Garima', 'id': '933232', 'affiliation': 'Center of Advanced Study, Department of Physics, Kumaun University, Nainital-263001 (India)', 'emailHash': 'bb876c820329b42531d089648ba7d8a8', 'db_id': 933232, 'person_id': 998926}"

A novel aspect of the NLO analysis is a consistent description of wider-angle bremsstrahlung (semi-collinear emissions) which smoothly interpolates between 2to2 scattering and collinear bremsstrahlung. Similarly, the NLO treatment describes how the soft collinear emissions can be incorporated into the drag coefficient at NLO. We describe how many of the ingredients of the NLO transport equations (such as the drag coefficient) can be computed using a Euclidean formalism pioneered by S. Caron-Huot.
In the second part of the talk we show how the same framework can be used to address the shear viscosity at NLO, up to a coefficient which cannot be determined using the Euclidean formalism. By treating this coefficient as an unknown parameter (within an estimated range) we can however estimate the NLO corrections to $\eta$.

The detection of vector mesons through their decay in dileptons has the advantage, with respect to hadronic channel, that the decay products are not affected by final state interactions.
Measurements in pp and p-A systems, where hot nuclear matter effects are not expected, are used as a reference.

Measurement of charged particles at high pT (above 30 GeV) show an increase in yields with respect to the expectation from binary scaling which is larger than any deviations seen in the jet measurements.

Remarkably, the new constraints turn out to be highly insensitive to the amount - or even presence - of quark matter inside the stars. 

In this framework, we also present a simple effective equation of state for cold quark matter that consistently incorporates the effects of interactions and furthermore includes a built-in estimate of the inherent systematic uncertainties.

Recent results have shown that both soft and hard processes may be significantly influenced by event-to-event fluctuations (variations) in the structure of the proton. In this talk, the latest measurements of the centrality dependence of charged particle, jet, and Z boson production with the ATLAS detector at the LHC will be used to explore these questions. In particular, the sensitivity of the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution in proton--lead collisions to the choice of centrality variable will be discussed. Separately, the strong centrality dependence of jet production in proton--lead collisions has raised questions about energy production at large rapidities in collisions involving a large proton-$x$.

These results are needed interpret the strong modifications in the rates of jet and dijet production in centrality-selected p+Pb collisions observed by ATLAS and CMS. The mean value of the transverse energy in the acceptance of the ATLAS forward calorimeter, where the centrality in p+Pb collisions is characterized, is reported in pp events with a dijet in the central region. This quantity is presented as a function of the average pseudorapidity and transverse momentum of the dijet, and also as a function of the scaled longitudinal momenta xproj and xtarg, estimated event-by-event from the dijet kinematics, of the hard-scattered partons in the protons headed away from and towards, respectively, the region of transverse energy production. The transverse energy is observed to decrease strongly with increasing xtarg, which in the analogy with p+Pb collisions represents one of the nucleons in the Pb nucleus. On the other hand, the transverse energy depends only weakly on xproj, which represents the proton in p+Pb collisions. These results provide counter-evidence to claims that the observed modifications in the jet production in p+Pb collisions arise from a correlation between hard scattering kinematics and soft particle production in the individual NN collisions.",

Correlations and Fluctuations II,parallel,Correlated fluctuations near the QCD critical point,"Song, Huichao",Peking University,Unknown,"Recently, STAR beam energy scan (BES) measured the multiplicity distributions of net protons with the maximum transverse momentum extended from 0.8 GeV to 2 GeV. The related higher cumulants (moments) present large deviations from the poisson baselines, showing the potential of discovery the QCD critical point in experiment. 

  In this talk, we introduce a freeze-out scheme for  the dynamical models near the QCD critical point through coupling the classical particles with the correlated fluctuating sigma field [2]. For an infinite and stationary medium, such freeze-out scheme can reproduce the standard Staphanov formulas for cumulants presented in Ref[3].

  Within this framework, we calculate the correlated fluctuations of net protons emitted from the hydrodynamic freeze-out surface at various collision energies.  A comparison with recent STAR BES data shows that our model could reproduce kurtosis (and C4) through tuning the related parameters. However, the critical fluctuations in our model (also in the Stephanov formula) always give positive contributions to the cumulants C2 and C3, which over-predicts the data with poisson expectations served as the thermal fluctuation baselines[2].  In order to qualitatively /quantitatively describe these cumulants data, the effects from dynamical evolution and the deviations from poisson thermal fluctuations should be investigated in the near future.

Poster Session,poster,Universality of particle production and energy balance in hadronic and nuclear collisions,"Grinbaum Sarkisyan, Edward",University of Texas at Arlington (US),USA,"A study of the universality of multihadron production in nucleus-nucleus and pp/p ̄p collisions is performed using the dependenceies of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities and of the mean multiplicity on the collision energy and on the number of nucleon participants, or centrality, in the energy range from a few GeV to a few TeV. The approach in which the multiparticle production is driven by the dissipating centrality-dependent effective energy of participants is introduced exploiting the earlier proposed consideration that combines the constituent quark picture with Landau hydrodynamics. Within this approach, the data on the energy dependence of the global variables studied and the pseudorapidity spectra from the most central nuclear collisions are well reproduced. The centrality dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity and transverse energy densities of charged particles are well described pointing to a similarity in the most central collisions and centrality data. The study of the mean multiplicty centrality dependence reveals a new scaling between the measured and calculated pseudorapidity spectra. Using this scaling, called the energy balanced limiting fragmentation scaling, one reproduces the pseudorapidity spectra at all centralities. The obtained scaling clarifies on the differences in the multiplicty centrality dependence from RHIC and LHC as well as on the dependence of the midrapidity pseudorapidity density vs. multiplicity at RHIC. A complementarity in the multiplicity energy dependence in the most central collisions and centrality data is obtained. A new regime in heavy-ion collisions is pointed out to occur at ∼ 1 TeV. The pseudorapidity spectra of photons are also well reproduced within the proposed approach in the entire collision energy range and an explanation of their centrality independence is given. Predictions are made for the forthcoming higher-energy measurements in pp and heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Edward', 'last_name': 'Grinbaum Sarkisyan', 'fullName': 'Grinbaum Sarkisyan, Edward', 'id': '933315', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas at Arlington (US)', 'emailHash': 'b8151b032d817e35edf7b6c754ebf51d', 'db_id': 933315, 'person_id': 998981}"
Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness II,parallel,Charm degrees of freedom above deconfinement,"Petreczky, Peter",BNL,USA,"The heavy quarks are one of the most versatile probes of the strongly
coupled QCD medium created in the heavy ion collision experiments. 
However, the interactions of the heavy quarks or heavy quark bound 
states with the strongly coupled medium is still not well understood. 
One of the ways to look at such interactions is to study the behaviour 
of open charm hadrons in the thermalized medium.  
In our earlier study [1] we have shown that open charm hadrons 
are the relevant degrees of freedom below the QCD transition temperature. 
However, very little is known about the excitations of the charm degrees 
of freedom above the QCD transition temperature. 
In this work we study the nature of the
excitations carrying charm in deconfined QCD medium from first
principles using the lattice data on fluctuations of charm and its
correlations with baryon number and strangeness. Assuming that
the total charm pressure can be written as the sum of the partial
pressures of charm mesons, charm baryons and charm quarks we
extract the corresponding partial pressures from the lattice data.
We observe that the partial meson and baryon pressures
are significant till temperatures of about 200 MeV, implying
that meson and baryon excitations survive well beyond the QCD transition
temperature till about 200 MeV. Above that temperature quark 
like excitations start dominating. We also probe the relative importance 
of excitations carrying different quantum numbers,
specifically we show that possible diquark excitations carrying a
charm quantum number are not important for thermodynamics.
Our studies could be important in understanding the
energy loss mechanism and flow of the heavy quarks in the QGP as
well as the hadronization mechanism of the open charm states.

Poster Session,poster,Fate of meson states and broken symmetries at high temperature,"Maezawa, Yu","Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan",UK,"Thermal fluctuations cause modifications of meson bound states as well as restoration of broken chiral and $U_A(1)$ symmetries. The former (latter) plays an important role in the analysis of sequential melting patterns of open-flavor mesons (the nature of phase transition in QCD) in hot and dense matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

We present recent results on lattice QCD calculations of meson correlations which express in-medium modifications of mesonic excitations containing up/down, strange and charmed quarks. Thermal effects are clearly visible in the spatial correlations which, unlike the temporal correlations, can be calculated at separations larger than the inverse of temperature. This makes them more sensitive to thermal modifications of hadrons. Moreover the spatial correlations provide a direct signal for the thermal modification of spectral functions which carry all the information about in-medium properties of mesons and their dissolution.

As a consequence of lattice QCD simulations using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks with physical strange quark mass and (nearly) physical up/down quark masses, we find that light-unflavored, open-strange and open-charm mesons in the pseudo-scalar ($\pi$, $K$ and $D$) and vector ($\rho$, $K^\ast$ and $D^\ast$) channels show significant modifications even below the critical temperature ($T_c$). The modification pattern of these mesons is very similar below $T_c$, whereas a clear flavor dependence appears above $T_c$ where lighter mesons suffer larger modifications. The strange meson ($\phi$) and strange-charmed mesons ($D_s$ and $D_s^\ast$) show slight modification already at $T_c$, while the charmonium states ($\eta_c$ and $J/\psi$) feel thermal effects only at $T>1.2T_c$. This confirms that 1S charmonium states can survive beyond $T_c$. From degeneracies of parity partner it is also found that at $T_c$ the chiral symmetry is restored, whereas the breaking of the $U_A(1)$ symmetry is significant.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yu', 'last_name': 'Maezawa', 'fullName': 'Maezawa, Yu', 'id': '933286', 'affiliation': 'Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University, Japan', 'emailHash': '080dc64507877cea44385aded1691b09', 'db_id': 933286, 'person_id': 998964}"

ALICE's excellent tracking, vertexing and particle identification capabilities allow it to fully reconstruct the hadronic decays of open-charmed D mesons, as well as enabling the study of leptons stemming from charm and beauty decays at forward and mid-rapidity.

Measurements in p--Pb collisions allow us to disentangle experimental observations arising due to the hot and dense medium from those occurring due to cold nuclear matter effects such as momentum broadening, initial-state energy loss, and the modification of nuclear PDFs in the Pb nucleus. In particular, it is possible to measure nuclear modification factors in p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions in order to determine whether the observed suppression of particles at high $p_\mathrm{T}$ in central Pb--Pb collisions is a medium-induced effect. Further insight into cold nuclear matter effects can be obtained by examining the yields of D mesons as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in p--Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Renormalization and temperature dependence of dimension 6 gluon operators,"Kim, HyungJoo",Yonsei University,Unknown,"Understanding the temperature dependence of the gluon condensate in the purge gauge theory offers a useful picture on the nature of the QCD phase transition.

We found the scale invariant operators are given as follows:
\begin{equation}
\phi_1=\alpha_s^{-9/11}\left\langle O_1\right\rangle ,\\
\phi_{2,3}=\alpha_s^{-(15 \mp \sqrt{17})/44}\left\langle \frac{-653 \pm 21\sqrt{17}}{424}O_1+\frac{1 \mp \sqrt{17}}{8}O_2+O_3\right\rangle.

Together with the dim 6 scalar operators whose renormalization has been worked out before[2],
our result completes the calculation of renormalization of all the dim 6 gluon operators, hence is  a first step toward identifying their mixing and thus a systematic analysis in the operator product expansion (OPE) of heavy quark correlation functions up to dimension 6.  After using the equation of motion in the purge gauge theory, only $O_1$ remains nonzero. 

As an application, we rewrite the dim 6 scalar and twist 4 operators as $f^{abc}B^a\cdot(B^b \times B^c)$ and $f^{abc}B^a\cdot(E^b \times E^c)$ and estimate their temperature  dependence using inputs  of dim 4 electric and magnetic condensate extracted from lattice gauge theory. We then improve the previous QCD sum rules for $J/\Psi$ mass near the $T_c$ based on dim 4 operators, by including the contribution of the dim 6 operators to the OPE. We find an enhanced stability in the sum rule and confirm that the $J/\psi$ will undergo an abrupt change in the property across $T_c$.

Poster Session,poster,Yang-Lee Zeros and Phase Boundary From Net-Baryon Number Multiplicity Distribution,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"Fluctuations of conserved charges provide us information on the state of
matter at freeze-out temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu$.
Since the underlying multiplicity distribution of the net-baryon number
is related to the canonical partition function $Z(T,V,N)$, one can
construct the partition function $\mathcal{Z}(T,V,\mu)$ as a series of
fugacity [1], $ \mathcal{Z}(T,V,\mu) =
  \sum_{N=-N^*}^{N^*}Z(T,V,N)e^{\mu N/T}$,where $N^*$ is maximum baryon number the system can possess.
While one may be able to obtain thermodynamic quantities and
fluctuations from the partition function in this way, this also enables
us to study Yang-Lee zeros, which is the zeros of the partition
functions in complex chemical potential and provides information on the
phase boundary.

In this work, we show that the information on the phase boundary
extracted from Yang-Lee zeros of the truncated partition function is
stable under the truncation up to some orders, by making use of a
chiral random matrix model [2].
We compare the zeros from the exact solution of the model with those
from truncated partition function and from the corresponding Skellam
partition function.
We also show that the behavior of the zeros in the model against the truncation has a
significant difference  compared to those from the Skellam partition function.
We also discuss statistics necessary for obtain such zeros in heavy ion
experiments.

Poster Session,poster,QCD Kondo effect in quark matter with heavy flavor impurities,"Yasui, Shigehiro",Tokyo Institute of Technology,Unknown,"The Kondo effect has been known as a phenomenon in electron systems with heavy mass impurities having finite spins. This phenomena is caused by imperfect cancelation of the infrared divergences of particle and hole excitations and is realized by a combination of the following ingredients; (0) heavy mass of impurity, (i) existence of Fermi surface, (ii) quantum loop effects, (iii) non-Abelian nature of interaction (e.g. the spin-spin interaction). These are indeed identified in a (light) quark matter with small number of heavy flavor quarks as impurities. In the quark matter, the non-Abelian properties of the interaction is given by the color exchange by gluons (S. Yasui and K. Sudoh, Phys. Rev. C88, 015201 (2013)). This is called the QCD Kondo effect, which modifies the transport properties of the quark matter with heavy flavor impurities, and can be relevant to experiments in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. 

In this presentation, we discuss how the effective coupling strength, between a heavy flavor impurity and a light quark, evolves in the low energy effective theory near the Fermi surface (K. Hattori, K. Itakura, S. Ozaki and S. Yasui, arXiv:1504.07619 [hep-ph]). We investigate the renormalization group flow at the leading log accuracy on the basis of the high-density QCD where the gluon propagator has the static screening mass and the dynamical screening effect for the electric and magnetic components, respectively, and show that the effective coupling becomes divergently large at a certain infrared scale near the Fermi surface, which is called the Kondo scale. This indicates the presence of a strongly coupled regime in the dynamics of the quark matter containing heavy flavor impurities. We find that, while the dynamical magnetic screening provides the dominant effect in the color superconductivity, it is sub-dominant compared to the static electric screening in the QCD Kondo effect.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shigehiro', 'last_name': 'Yasui', 'fullName': 'Yasui, Shigehiro', 'id': '933319', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': '6705014005278045b8eae45737aeae06', 'db_id': 933319, 'person_id': 998984}"
Electromagnetic Probes I,parallel,Thermal photons from a modern hydrodynamical model of heavy ion collisions: status of the direct photon puzzle,"Paquet, Jean-Francois",McGill University,Unknown,"Early fluid-dynamical calculations of direct photon spectra and momentum anisotropy were found to be systematically smaller than measurements from the RHIC and the LHC, an observation that became known as the ""direct photon puzzle"". It is shown in this work that the use of a modern hydrodynamical model of heavy ion collisions [1] together with more complete photon emission rates greatly improves agreement with both ALICE and PHENIX data, supporting the idea that thermal photons are the dominant source of direct photon momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions. The event-by-event hydrodynamical model used includes, for the first time, both shear and bulk viscosities, along with second order couplings between the two viscosities. Different photon emission rates are investigated, including one that takes into account the effect of confinement on photon emission [2]. The effect of both shear and bulk viscosities on the photon rates is studied and is shown to have a measurable effect on the photon momentum anisotropy. The inclusion of parton energy loss on prompt photons and its importance for comparisons of direct photon calculations with experiments is discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Quantifying deviations from local equilibration in a coarse-grained transport approach,"Oliinychenko, Dmytro","Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev 03680, Ukraine",UK,"Event-by-event hybrid models construct the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution from non-equilibrium approaches by matching the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. After splitting the obtained energy-momentum tensor and four-current into
ideal-hydrodynamics part and viscous correction, it often appears that the ""correction"" is large. However, all the existing models neglect viscous correction, assuming instant thermalization and violating angular momentum conservation.

Here we study the complete time evolution of heavy ion collisions within the coarse-grained UrQMD transport approach and quantify deviations from local equilibrium. Since these deviations are expected to be larger at lower beam energies and in more peripheral collisions, Au+Au collisions from $E_{lab} = 5 - 160 A$ GeV at different centralities are investigated. At every position in space-time the energy-momentum tensor and net baryon four-current are determined in the Landau rest frame.

We find that the largest contribution to the deviation from local equilibrium is the pressure difference in the transverse and
longitudinal direction, while the off-diagonal components of the tensor and baryon charge flow play a minor role in most of the cases. In addition, for every considered energy and centrality there exists a rather sharp time $t_0$, after which energy-momentum tensor from UrQMD is close to ideal hydrodynamics in a vast space region. This time $t_0$ decreases with collision energy and slightly increases with centrality, being larger than the typical times of hydrodynamics initialization found in the literature. By comparing the result from single events to the average result we also investigate the effect of event-by-event fluctuations on $t_0$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dmytro', 'last_name': 'Oliinychenko', 'fullName': 'Oliinychenko, Dmytro', 'id': '933330', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, D-60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev 03680, Ukraine', 'emailHash': '360431e70e5701f7d46d282d1207c13b', 'db_id': 933330, 'person_id': 998988}"

$C(Q,K)$ has been used as a sensitive probe for
the source size in nucleus-nucleus collisions, but recently has been
investigated for $\Lambda\Lambda$ pairs to probe their interaction [1].

The $N\Omega$ system with $S=-3$ is particularly interesting, since it
is one of two multiplets in which the Pauli blocking does not take place thus can form a bound state. 
Indeed, a recent lattice QCD calculation by the HAL QCD collaboration [2] predicts the existence of $N\Omega$ bound state in the $^5 S_2 (J=2, S=2)$ channel. 
We adopt the $N\Omega$ interaction potential obtained by the HAL QCD
collaboration and calculate the $N\Omega$ correlation
function through the relative wave function $\Psi(x_1,x_2;Q)$. Moreover, we also study the variation of the correlation
function against the change of the property of the bound state.

We show that the correlation function $C(Q)$ is sensitive to whether the system has a bound state or not (see figure). If the
system has a bound state, the behavior of $C(Q)$ at low $Q$ also depends
on the binding energy. We discuss how the behavior the scattering wave
function can influence the behavior of $C(Q)$ and its interplay with the
source size. Our result indicates that high energy heavy ion collisions
at RHIC and LHC may provide information on the possible existence of the
$N\Omega$ dibaryon.

Topmetal-II- sensor is designed with a low power consumption of 104 mW and low ENC value of 30 e-. From our measurement by injecting pulse signal into the top metal of each pixel, we got the ENC value of 13 e-, which is even better than the design value. Furthermore, the noise distribution of the sensor is almost uniform among pixel matrix.

centrality-selected proton--lead collisions at the LHC are observed to
grossly violate geometric models of the relationship between jet
production at mid-rapidity and soft particle production in the nuclear
fragmentation region. These modifications have been, variously,
attributed to the suppression of soft gluons in proton configurations
with a high Bjorken-$x$, taken as a direct observation of proton color
fluctuations, or interpreted as the result of a rapidity-separated
energy conservation between soft and hard processes. This poster
reports the measurement of high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ jet production in

Poster Session,poster,Centrality dependence of photon anisotropic flow at RHIC,"Chatterjee, Rupa",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"We calculate elliptic and triangular flow of thermal photons for different collision centralities at RHIC using event–by-event hydrodynamic model with fluctuating initial conditions.

However, $v_2(p_T)$ rises much faster than $v_3(p_T)$ towards peripheral collisions and $v_3(p_T)$ is found to be largest for 20—40% centrality bin. 

We study the event-by-event distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ and their corresponding initial state anisotropies to understand the correlation between them. A significant linear correlation between $v_2$ and $\epsilon_2$ is observed at different $p_T$ values, however we do not see any correlation between photon $v_3$ and the initial triangularity $\epsilon_3$. This is unlike the case of hadrons where a clear mapping between hadronic $v_3$ and $\epsilon_3$ has been observed. We conclude that indirect effects of initial state fluctuations, such as buildup of large transverse flow velocity contribute significantly to the observed $v_3$ results beyond leading to an overall triangular geometry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rupa', 'last_name': 'Chatterjee', 'fullName': 'Chatterjee, Rupa', 'id': '933340', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '641dd4c47ff16b98a37c70846715855d', 'db_id': 933340, 'person_id': 998416}"

Poster Session,poster,Sensitivity of flow harmonics to sub-nucleon scale fluctuations in heavy ion collisions,"Noronha-Hostler, Jacquelyn",Columbia University,USA,"Event by event hydrodynamic simulations of AA and pA collisions involve initial energy densities with large spatial gradients. This is associated with the presence of large Knudsen numbers ($K_n \sim 1$) at early times, which may lead one to question the validity of the hydrodynamic approach in these rapidly evolving, largely inhomogeneous systems. A new procedure to smooth out the initial energy densities is employed to show that the initial spatial eccentricities, $\varepsilon_n$,  are remarkably robust with respect to variations in the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients, $\lambda$. For $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV LHC initial conditions generated by the MCKLN code[1], $\varepsilon_n$ (across centralities) remains nearly constant if the fluctuation scale varies by an order of magnitude, i.e., when $\lambda$ varies from 0.1 to 1 fm. Given that the local Knudsen number $K_n \sim 1/\lambda$, the robustness of the initial eccentricities with respect to changes in the fluctuation scale suggests that the $v_n$'s cannot be used to distinguish between events with large $K_n$ from events where $K_n$ is in the hydrodynamic regime. We use the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code v-USPhydro[2] to show that this is indeed the case: anisotropic flow coefficients computed within event by event viscous hydrodynamics are only sensitive to long wavelength scales of order $ 1/\Lambda_{QCD}\sim 1$ fm and are incredibly robust with respect to variations in the initial local Knudsen number (see [3]). This robustness can be used to justify the somewhat unreasonable effectiveness of the perfect fluid paradigm in heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Mott-Hagedorn resonance gas and lattice QCD thermodynamics,"Turko, Ludwik","University Wroclaw, Poland",Poland,"We construct a combined effective model reproducing the equation of state of strongly interacting matter as obtained in recent lattice QCD simulations. The model reproduces basic physical characteristics of
the hadronic resonance gas at low temperatures and embodies the crucial effect of hadron dissociation. The quark and gluon degrees of freedom are described within an effective mean-field theory, the Polyakov-loop improved Nambu, Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The  hadron dissociation is obtained by the Mott effect within a generalized Beth-Uhlenbeck approach. The
lowering of the thresholds for the two- and three-quark scattering state continuous spectrum triggers the
transformation of hadronic bound states to resonances in the scattering continuum. We postulate a generic temperature dependent behavior of the scattering phase shifts in these channels. The in-medium phase shift model is in
accordance with the Levinson theorem. This results in the vanishing of hadronic contributions to the thermodynamics at high temperatures. The crucial in-medium effect responsible for the hadron-to-quark matter phase transition is the lowering
of the quark masses in the chiral restoration transition which itself is a result of the behavior of the chiral condensate. We aim at a selfconsistent solution of the model. The used PNJL model is improved over its standard versions by adding
perturbative corrections in $0(\alpha_s)$ for the high-momentum region above the three-momentum cutoff. This leads to the broadening of the quarks, while the quark  selfenergy is calculated from the same kind of diagrams as hadronic selfenergy.

Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Forward-backward multiplicity fluctuation and longitudinal harmonics in high-energy nuclear collisions,"Huo, Peng",State University of New York (US),USA,"One of the largest uncertainties in the modeling of heavy-ion collision arises from present poor understanding of the early-time dynamics especially in the longitudinal direction. Forward-backward (FB) multiplicity correlation has been regarded as a power observable on the early time dynamics since it probe directly the initial state density fluctuations in pseudorapidity. Previous studies of FB multiplicity correlation  were primarily based on two-bin or multi-bin correlation method in selected $\eta$ ranges, whose connection to underlying dynamics is complicated by statistical smearing due to finite multiplicity and residual centrality or volume effects. In a recent paper (1506.03496), we have developed a data-driven two-particle correlation method which overcome both limitations and hence allow direct connection between the correlation function and underlying heavy-ion collision dynamics. The robustness and physics potential of the method are demonstrated using the AMPT and HIJING simulation. We found that the long-range component of the FB correlation is captured by a few longitudinal harmonics, with the first component driven by the asymmetry in the number of participating nucleons in the two colliding nuclei and the second component reflecting the EbyE fluctuation of nuclear-stopping. The higher-order longitudinal harmonics are found be strongly damped in AMPT compare to HIJING, due to weaker short-range correlations as well as the final-state effects present in the AMPT model. Two-particle pseudorapidity correlation reveals interesting charge-dependent short-range structures in AMPT model that are absent in HIJING model. The proposed method opens a new avenue to elucidate the particle production mechanism and early time dynamics in heavy-ion collisions. Future analysis directions and prospects of using the pseudorapidity correlation function to understand the centrality bias in p+p, p+A and A+A collisions are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peng', 'last_name': 'Huo', 'fullName': 'Huo, Peng', 'id': '933362', 'affiliation': 'State University of New York (US)', 'emailHash': 'aaea26f14f5a4cfc1337ebed5b4107fe', 'db_id': 933362, 'person_id': 999005}"

We also confirm that the entropy production rate is positive definite quantity and our equation satisfies the Onsager’s reciprocal theorem. All these confirmation strongly support the validity of our formulation.

New Theoretical Development I,unknown,Third order relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics in heavy-ion collisions and astrophysics,"Muronga, Azwinndini",University of Johannesburg,Unknown,"The development of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is a very important scientific achievement of the last two decades. It has inspired many authors to apply its methodology to lots of possible applications in physical problems. For example it allows to derive hydrodynamical like equations for  relativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysics, cosmology and plasma physics. So far a symmetric hyperbolic system of evolution equations for the independent field variables has been obtained up to second order with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium. However the exploitation to third order is desirable in order to study the couplings between the three major dissipative fluxes which contribute to the entropy generation in a single-component fluid. In this paper the development of relativistic fluid dynamics is carried through
to third order with respect to thermodynamic equilibrium. The set of obtained field equations is closed by imposing the relativity principle and the entropy principle up to third order. Imposing these conditions up to third order affects and restricts the lower order terms. This, in turn, affects the equilibrium expressions which are already explicitly known.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Azwinndini', 'last_name': 'Muronga', 'fullName': 'Muronga, Azwinndini', 'id': '933374', 'affiliation': 'University of Johannesburg', 'emailHash': 'af9c69d91a1b1691e26c79eebae5cc40', 'db_id': 933374, 'person_id': 999014}"
Poster Session,poster,MC study of proton-Nitrogen collisions at RHIC for cosmic-ray physics,"SUZUKI, Takuya",Waseda University,Japan,"To understand the origin of high-energy cosmic rays, many experiments were carried at ground level, thereby observing air showers. Many measurements confirm a steepening and a flattening of the all-particle spectrum at $10^{15.5}$ and $10^{18.5}$ eV, that are called 'knee' and 'ankle', respectively. Both are considered to be the indices of change in propagation or origin of cosmic rays. Despite the high statistics, interpretation of the results depend strongly on the hadronic interaction model used in the Monte Carlo calculation which has larger uncertainties than the statistical errors. Chemical composition of cosmic ray (from proton to iron nucleus) is one interest of astroparticle physics, but results are not settled yet. Calibration of interaction models is an urgent need for air shower measurements.
 LHCf experiment has measured data of the forward region in proton-proton collision at $\sqrt{s}=0.9$, 7 and 13 TeV and proton-lead collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV at LHC. Nuclear effect must be well understood, since air shower consists of interactions between cosmic ray (proton to iron nucleus) and the atmosphere (mainly nitrogen); lead and gold are too heavy target. Unfortunately, no high energy collision of light ion has been provided. RHIC and LHC are good candidates that can provide such collisions. We focus on the result expected with proton-nitrogen inelastic collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV ($10^{14}$ eV in lab frame) where we use the LHCf detector in the forward region ($\eta>6$) of the proton-remnant side at RHIC. We compare the energy spectrum with that of proton-proton inelastic collision at $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV to evaluate the nuclear effect. A MC calculation shows that it is possible to discriminate nuclear effect incorporated in some models widely used in air shower measurements and demonstrates that it can be the first good test to evaluate air shower.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takuya', 'last_name': 'SUZUKI', 'fullName': 'SUZUKI, Takuya', 'id': '933375', 'affiliation': 'Waseda University', 'emailHash': 'bcd9157e3cd0d8857561f5f7f2189339', 'db_id': 933375, 'person_id': 999015}"
Poster Session,poster,Viscous Leptons and Fluid-like Photons in the Strongly Coupled Quark Gluon Plasma,"Yang, Di-Lun",RIKEN/University of Crete,Unknown,"In the quark gluon plasma (QGP), the transport properties of electromagnetic (EM) probes such as leptons and photons could be modified by the lepton/photon-parton scattering compared with the case in the QED plasma. In order to incorporate the non-perturbative effects from the strongly couple QGP on the lepton/photon-parton collisions, a semi-holographic approach which combines the Boltzmann equation and the gauge/gravity duality is applied to compute the shear viscosity of thermal leptons and photons. It is found that the lepton shear viscosity due to the lepton-quark scattering is inversely proportional to the ratio of electric conductivity of the QGP to temperature up to the leading logarithmic order of the EM coupling and is suppressed compared with the one from lepton-lepton scattering. On the other hand, the photon shear viscosity up to the leading order of the EM coupling is suppressed by the photon-parton scattering, where the suppression is favored by the coupling of the QGP. Such suppression stems from the blue shift of the thermal-photon spectrum at fixed temperature when the coupling of the QGP is increased. On the contrary, the lepton shear viscosity behaves oppositely due to the decrease of electric conductivity of the QGP at stronger coupling. Moreover, in a holographic model breaking conformal symmetry, both the conductivity and the amplitude of the thermal-photon spectrum scaled by temperature decrease rapidly near the deconfinement transition. Accordingly, a sharp enhancement of the shear viscosity of both thermal leptons and thermal photons close to the critical temperature is observed. In conclusion, our findings imply that the thermal leptons and photons in the QGP are less viscous than in the QED plasma. In particular, thermal photons may become fluid-like in the strongly coupled scenario. We argue that it may strengthen the anisotropic flow of direct photons.

Poster Session,poster,Interpreting single jet measurements in heavy ion collisions,"Spousta, Martin",Charles University,Unknown,"Recent measurements of jet and charged particle suppression and single jet fragmentation in heavy ion collisions at the LHC provide important experimental information on the quenching of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma. Important features such as the variation of jet $R_{AA}$ with $p_T$, the pattern of modification of the jet fragmentation functions and the evolution of the charged particle $R_{AA}$ with $p_T$, taken together, should provide insight on the physics mechanism responsible for the quenching. While a proper understanding of the data requires a detailed theoretical model of jet quenching in a dynamically evolving medium, we argue that multiple features of the data including those listed above arise from a common origin. Using a phenomenological model with minimal assumptions on the parametric behavior of the parton energy loss, we can reproduce most of the features of the single-jet data. Results of our analysis will be presented and used to argue that there are important features of the underlying jet production that may need particular attention in jet quenching models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Martin', 'last_name': 'Spousta', 'fullName': 'Spousta, Martin', 'id': '933382', 'affiliation': 'Charles University', 'emailHash': '5a941a99be92c66d16d5afd0a19d03d6', 'db_id': 933382, 'person_id': 999021}"
Poster Session,poster,"Fluctuations, Instabilities and Collective Dynamics","Csernai, LaszloPal",UiB,Unknown,"Fluid dynamical processes became a dominant direction of research in high energy heavy ion reactions. The QuarkGluon plasma formed in these reactions has low viscosity [1], which leads to significant fluctuations and turbulent instabilities [2]. One has to study and separate these two effects [3], but this is not done yet in experiments. When such separation is performed, both fluctuations and new collective effects, like rotation and turbulence and the arising polarization [4] and two particle correlations [5] can be studied. The polarization arises from the shear flow based on the equipartition principle between local flow vorticity [6] and particle spin. Vorticity increases with beam energy in peripheral collisions, while higher temperatures counteract spin alignment. Due to these two effects polarization is expected to be observable at lower energies also [6].

The aptitude of the STAR detector for mid-rapidity measurements has previously been leveraged to measure identified particle yields and spectra to extract bulk properties for the BES energies in this kinematic window. However, to extract information on expansion dynamics and full phase space particle production it is necessary to study identified particle rapidity density distributions.

In this talk, we present the first rapidity density distributions of identified pions from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, and 19.6 GeV from the Beam Energy Scan program as measured by the STAR detector. We use these distributions to obtain the full phase space yields of the pions to provide additional information of the system's chemistry. Further, we report the width of the rapidity density distributions compared to the width expected from Landau hydrodynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Chiral Hall Effect and Chiral Electric Waves in Strongly Coupled Plasmas,"Yang, Di-Lun",RIKEN/University of Crete,Unknown,"The electromagnetic-field-induced transport related to the axial chemical potential may play an important role in many chiral systems such as the quark gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. It has been found that the presence of both a vector and an axial chemical potential could induce an axial current parallel to the applied electric field known as the chiral electric separation effect (CESE), where the axial conductivity is proportional to the product of the small vector and axial chemical potentials in QED and weakly coupled QCD plasmas. By implementing the gauge/gravity duality, we qualitatively obtain the same relation in the strongly coupled scenario. On the other hand, we find that an axial Hall current can also be generated when introducing an electric field and a magnetic field perpendicular to each other with an axial chemical potential, which could be dubbed as the chiral Hall effect (CHE). The fluctuations of chemical potentials will further result in chiral electric waves (CEW) as propagating density waves led by the applied electromagnetic fields. Interestingly, the Hall density waves propagating perpendicular to both applied fields may exist even at zero chemical potentials and become non-dissipative. The transport coefficients including the Hall conductivities, damping times, wave velocities, and diffusion constants of CEW in a strongly coupled plasma via the AdS/CFT correspondence will be presented. We argue that the CHE could lead to nontrivial charge distributions at different rapidity in asymmetric heavy ion collisions. The presentation is based on  Phys.Rev.

New Theoretical Development I,unknown,Chiral drag force,"Sadofyev, Andrey",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"We provide a holographic evaluation of novel contributions to the drag force acting on a heavy quark moving through strongly interacting plasma. The new contributions are chiral in that they act in opposite directions in plasmas containing an excess of left- or right-handed quarks and in that they are proportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly. These new contributions to the drag force act either parallel to or antiparallel to an external magnetic field or to the vorticity of the fluid plasma. In all these respects, these contributions to the drag force felt by a heavy quark are analogous to the chiral magnetic effect on light quarks. However, the new contribution to the drag force is independent of the electric charge of the heavy quark and is the same for heavy quarks and antiquarks. We show that although the chiral drag force can be non-vanishing for heavy quarks that are at rest in the local fluid rest frame, it does vanish for heavy quarks that are at rest in a frame in which there is no local entropy current. In this frame, the heavy quark at rest sees counterpropagating momentum and charge currents, both proportional to the axial anomaly coefficient, but feels no drag force. This provides strong concrete evidence for the absence of dissipation in chiral transport, something that has been predicted previously via consideration of symmetries. Along the way to our principal results, we provide a general calculation of the corrections to the drag force due to the presence of gradients in the flowing fluid in the presence of a nonzero chemical potential. We close with a consequence of our result that is at least in principle observable in heavy ion collisions, namely an anticorrelation between the direction of the CME current for light quarks in a given event and the direction of the kick given to the momentum of all the heavy quarks and antiquarks in that event.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrey', 'last_name': 'Sadofyev', 'fullName': 'Sadofyev, Andrey', 'id': '933398', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '0bb56d8cda56b23d9930f2827d975f3c', 'db_id': 933398, 'person_id': 998529}"

This has been postulated as stemming out of a common underlying mechanism--both systems are strongly interacting and expand hydrodynamically--despite of the very different nature of their interactions.

Baryon Rich QCD Matter,unknown,Measurement of hadron suppression at 14.5GeV and study of its connection with the disappearance  of other QGP signatures at low $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ in Au+Au collisions with STAR at RHIC in BES I,"Horvat, Stephen",STAR,Unknown,"At top RHIC energies and at the LHC, the suppression of high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) hadrons provides evidence for partonic energy loss in a QGP. We study jet quenching in the RHIC BES by investigating the centrality dependence of the binary-collision-scaled high-$p_{T}$ yields. In this representation we can see if the scaled yield decreases as we go to larger overlap regions and higher energy densities.  Phenomena like radial flow that increase the yield in this measurement are all expected to become stronger for more central collisions. Measurement of a decrease in the scaled yield while studying more central collisions can serve as possible evidence for jet quenching if initial state effects can be accounted for. One such effect is the suppression of per nucleon cross sections in heavier nuclei relative to lighter nuclei for Bjorken $x>$0.3 first measured by the European Muon Collaboration (EMC). Even at energies and centralities where this signature is lost a QGP may still be formed since the suppression caused by energy loss must overpower all the phenomena responsible for enhancement. Measurements will be shown for several ranges of $p_{T}$ for 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV data showing that relative hadron suppression persists for collisions at least down to 14.5 GeV. 

Models have also shown that the development of $v_{3}$ and a ridge requires the presence of a low viscosity QGP phase. To further investigate the presence of the QGP at these lower energies and whether the observed hadron suppression coincides with onset of other QGP signatures, we cross-examine the energy and centrality dependence of $v_{3}$. We find that for collisions with $N_{\mathrm{part}}<$50, the ridge and $v_{3}$ disappear for energies below 14.5 GeV, suggestive of a turn-off of the QGP. But for $N_{part}>$50, $v_{3}$ and the ridge persist down to the lowest energies, consistent with the hadron suppression defined in the new variable at the lower beam energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stephen', 'last_name': 'Horvat', 'fullName': 'Horvat, Stephen', 'id': '933413', 'affiliation': 'STAR', 'emailHash': 'f42118a75f294f5af261dde347dacfb3', 'db_id': 933413, 'person_id': 999039}"

 We will present the status of the analysis of single electrons from heavy flavor decays in Au+Au collisions from the PHENIX Run14 dataset.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness III,parallel,Medium-effects on heavy-flavour production in large and small systems,"Beraudo, Andrea","INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)",Italy,"Predictions obtained with the up-to-date version of our POWLANG transport code for heavy-flavour production in high-energy nuclear (A-A and now also p-A) collisions will be presented. To the usual Langevin evolution in the plasma we added a new modeling of the hadronization stage including the recombination with thermal partons from the medium at the decoupling hypersurface, to form colour-singlet strings eventually fragmented according to the Lund model implemented in PYTHIA. The additional radial and elliptic flow inherited by the heavy-flavour hadrons from the light quarks will affect the final observables, providing a better agreement with the experimental data for RAA and v2.

If the interaction with the medium tends to partially wash-out the initial Q-Qbar angular correlation, the elliptic flow acquired in the medium and at hadronization will tend to introduce a common correlation of all the heavy-flavour hadrons with the reaction plane, which will also contribute to the experimental signal.
Finally we will display the first results of our ongoing study on heavy-flavour observables in small systems, like the ones produced in p-Pb or d-Au collisions, trying to check whether the presence of a hot medium suggested by observables in the light sector (e.g. double ridge, elliptic flow...) can leave its fingerprints also in heavy-flavour signals.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '933423', 'affiliation': 'INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 933423, 'person_id': 998889}"

After reviewing shortly the method used, I will discuss the results obtained, explain how to understand them in terms of in-medium screening and show that this potential can be used to obtain a gauge invariant definition of the Debye screening mass [2].
This finite temperature potential also enables a description of quarkonium in a thermal medium with a Schrödinger equation, similar to what is done for the spectroscopy at zero temperature. I will show how these physical spectra inform us about the phenomenology of quarkonium melting and recombination [3] in heavy ion collision.

Correlations and Fluctuations II,parallel,Heavy-light flavor correlations and the QCD phase boundary,"Sasaki, Chihiro",FIAS & Uni of Wroclaw,Unknown,"Modifications in  magnitude of fluctuations for different observables
are an excellent probe of a phase transition or its remnant.
In heavy-ion collision, fluctuations related to conserved charges 
carried by light and strange quarks play an important role to identify
the QCD chiral crossover and deconfinement properties.

Recent Lattice QCD simulations have revealed that the charmed mesons
are deconfined together with light-flavor mesons in the temperature 
range where the chiral symmetry is partially restored. This result 
strongly suggests that the light-flavor dynamics interferes non-trivially
with the heavy flavors.

We discuss correlations between the light and heavy-light flavored
mesons at finite temperature within a chiral effective theory implementing
heavy quark symmetry. We show that the heavy quark dynamics is tied to 
the light flavor physics, and the thermodynamics is strongly dragged by 
the chiral crossover dominated by the non-strange flavors. Consequently,
the fluctuations carried by the states with strangeness can  be used to characterize the onset of the chiral symmetry restoration.

The charm production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion
collisions is studied based on the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)
transport approach.  The initial charm quarks are produced by the
Pythia event generator tuned to fit the transverse momentum
spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from
Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. 
The shadowing effect is accounted for the nuclei collisions.
The produced charm quarks  scatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)
with the off-shell partons whose masses and widths are given by
the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which reproduces the
lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The relevant
cross sections are calculated in a consistent way by employing the
effective propagators and couplings from the DQPM.  Close to the
critical energy density of the phase transition, the charm quarks
are hadronized into $D$ mesons through coalescence and
fragmentation. The hadronized $D$ mesons then interact with the
various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections
calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark
spin symmetry. The nuclear modification factor
$R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$ mesons from PHSD are
compared with the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration
for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV
and to the ALICE data for Pb+Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =2.76 TeV.
We find that in the PHSD the energy loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be
dominantly attributed to partonic scattering while the actual
shape of $R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects the  heavy-quark
hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation.
Also the hadronic rescattering is important for the $R_{AA}$
at low $p_T$ and enhances the $D$-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

It includes the equation of motion for finite baryon number, and employs an equation of state with finite net-baryon density to allow for calculations in a large range of beam energies. The parameter space of the model is explored, and constrained by comparison with the experimental data for bulk observables from SPS and the phase I BES at RHIC. The favored value of the shear viscosity coefficient over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ in the fluid phase depends on collision energy.

Poster Session,poster,Beyond the thermal model,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"The statistical hadronization (or thermal) model was initially developed by Hagedorn for hadron collisions above 10 GeV/c primary laboratory momentum [1]. In relativistic heavy-ion physics, many authors have developed it further and compared to a large amount of data in particular for hadron production rates, e.g. [2,3,4], where it  yields excellent results. 

To decide whether the system is indeed in thermal equilibrium, the distribution functions rather than production yields are decisive:
In the transverse momentum distributions of produced particles, deviations from thermal behaviour plus collective expansion occur beyond about 8 GeV/c. Not only the rapidity distributions of net baryons, but also the pseudorapidity distributions of produced mesons deviate from pure thermal behaviour: the thermal model does not generate a plateau in dN/dy, or a dip in dN/deta. 

Such non-equilibrium effects can to a certain extent be accounted for in a relativistic diffusion model [5,6] with three sources - two fragmentation sources, and a mid-rapidity source arising from gluon-gluon collisions - that merges with the thermal model only for time to infinity. Given the short interaction times of AuAu at RHIC or PbPb at LHC, the fragmentation sources still contribute substantially, providing good results when compared [6,7] to data from PHOBOS and ALICE, and also for asymmetric systems such as dAu at RHIC and pPb at LHC.

The formulation includes hydrodynamic expansion of the medium, the relativistic Doppler effect on the dissociation, and the running of the strong-coupling constant. For the centrality-dependent Y(1S) suppression agreement with the CMS data is found. The momentum dependence of the

The suppression is a clear, albeit indirect, indication for the presence of a Quark-Gluon Plasma at LHC energies. A prediction for the centrality-dependent Y(1S) suppression at the forthcoming LHC energy of 5.125 TeV

This will necessarily shift the direction of the phase transition from a “cross over” to a first order phase transition.
Strange quark nuggets (SQM) with baryon number of $\sim$ $10^{44}$ as relics of this phase transition will survive$^2$ the entire cosmic time scale upto now. The presentation will demonstrate the SQM’s can be the most plausible candidate of cold dark matter discovered around 1996. The “MACHO” observations and the recent observations of strangelets of Bose Institute (Kolkata) seem to corroborate the just mentioned concept.
This is quite natural within the ambit of the standard model; exotica like axioms even WIMPS, not observed, do not have to be invoked.

With the come out of recent LHC results on particle production of various species, we find it a good opportunity to use this approach to interpret the data. The transverse-momentum spectra, from both $p+p$ and Pb+Pb collisions, are systematically studied within the Tsallis Blast-Wave (TBW) model, and compared to the RHIC results. Good agreement between the data and the fit is achieved over a broad kinetic range - 0-10 GeV/$c$ for $p+p$ collisions from 200 to 7000 GeV, and 0-5 GeV/$c$ for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV.

From the fit the kinetic freeze-out temperature T, the average radial flow velocity <β> and the parameter q, which is a measure of the degree of non-equilibrium of the system, can be extracted. The evolution of these parameters with collision energy and centrality will be presented. For $p+p$ collisions, the radial flow is found to be consistent with zero at beam energy below 900 GeV and increases to $\sim0.3$ at 7 TeV. For Pb+Pb collisions, the TBW model illustrates better fit stability compared with the normal BW model. The centrality dependence of T, <β> and q are demonstrated. A detailed fit to non-strange, single-strange and multi-strange particle species separately will be given.

In order to confirm the conjecture that the non-monotonic behavior could suggest the existence of the QCD critical point [1], we need calculation of cumulant ratios 
hopefully in lattice QCD at finite density. 

We have recently calculated the cumulant ratios of net baryon numbers 
at finite density in the chiral limit in the strong-coupling lattice QCD [2].
Fluctuation effects beyond the mean field treatments are included 
in the auxiliary field Monte-Carlo method [3].
We find that $\kappa\sigma^2$ show oscillatory behavior;
one negative valley around the phase boundary is sandwiched by 
two positive peaks as a function of $T$.
With increasing lattice size, 
the negative $\kappa\sigma^2$ region is narrowed while the amplitude grows.
This behavior may be in agreement with the potential surface argument [1]
and the scaling function analysis [4].

In the presentation, we will briefly introduce the strong-coupling lattice QCD,
and show results of higher-order cumulant ratios around the phase boundary.
We may also discuss recent developments including $1/g^2$ effects in the strong-coupling expansion.

Further, required boundary conditions are automatically satisfied due to the geometry of the collision. The chiral transition is, therefore, completed by a propagating interface, exactly as for a first order transition, even though the transition actually is a crossover for relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Same thing also happens when we consider the initial confinement-deconfinement transition with Polyakov loop order parameter.

Poster Session,poster,Effects of soft/hard correlation and initial state geometry on heavy quark observables,"Ke, Weiyao",Duke University,USA,"Heavy quarks observables, such as the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow coefficient $v_2$, are sensitive to the transport properties and space-time evolution of the quark-gluon-plasma. Generally this connection is made via transport calculations of the time-evolution of the collision. However, how the choice of the initial condition model for the QGP medium as well as spatial correlations between the medium and the initial production vertices of the heavy quarks affect these observable is still unclear. Of particular interest is the effect of initial correlation between heavy quark production vertices with the underlying event (referred as soft-hard correlation). Experimentally, open charm production in pp collisions is found to increases with charged particle multiplicity, indicating a strong correlation between the heavy quark production with sub-nucleonic fluctuation of soft matter density, which is often overlooked in  existing initial conditions.

In this work, we focus on the response of heavy quark observables to various initial condition models with different hard-soft correlation behavior and soft matter geometry. We study D meson $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ in AA collision with TRENTo, a recently developed effective model for initial entropy deposition, and a Langevin transport model. Comparing calculations with and without initial sub-nucleonic hard-soft correlations, and for different modes of entropy deposition, we assess the sensitivity of heavy quark observables to these correlations. Results will be presented for Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Weiyao', 'last_name': 'Ke', 'fullName': 'Ke, Weiyao', 'id': '933539', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '1240602cf275b01cbc3a4cc9b6afb783', 'db_id': 933539, 'person_id': 999117}"

This is because these fluctuations can relax to the thermal hadronic value only due to charge diffusion in the hadronic stage and cannot change from thermal QGP value immediately.
We discuss the non-Markov effects on the time evolution of higher order cumulants of conserved charges for the first time in order to describe diffusion phenomena in heavy ion collisions and to relate the observables to these properties of the QGP in a more realistic way.
Specifically, we obtain charge fluctuations with non-Markov effects from the solution of Cattaneo equation and also directly from Langevin equation for phase space and compare both results. In addition, we show that Cattaneo equation is derived from Langevin equation by eliminating the fast variable.

It is commonly believed that the electromagnetic flux tubes decay into a huge number of particles to form the quark-gluon plasma, however, its physical mechanics is not well understood.  

We discuss the quark production from an expanding electromagnetic flux tube based on the Schwinger mechanism.  Emphasis is put on the effects of the expanding geometry and/or the existence of magnetic fields in addition to electric fields.  In the first part of this presentation, we analytically compute the time evolution of the produced quarks by ignoring their backreaction to the electromagnetic flux tube, and show that (i) the quark distribution is consistent with the Schwinger formula for small transverse mass $m_T$, but it has a power-dependence $m_T^{-4}$ for large transverse mass $m_T$; (ii) the higher Landau level contributions are not exponentially suppressed.

New Theoretical Development I,unknown,What flows in the chirally anomalous transport?,"Fukushima, Kenji",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"The chirally anomalous transport including the chiral magnetic effect seems to get established from the theoretical side, but some theorists address serious concerns about the physical interpretation of $\langle\Omega|\boldsymbol{j}|\Omega\rangle$.  In my talk I will emphasize how the conventional scenario can be verified from the dynamical process of the particle production.

If $|\Omega\rangle$ is an equilibrated static state, a current which is a real-time phenomenon, cannot flow and $\langle\Omega|\boldsymbol{j}|\Omega\rangle$ is not a current but should be a polarization.  Such an interpretation is manifest for the chiral separation effect.  Besides, in a quick derivation of the chiral magnetic effect using the Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory, the anomalous current appears in the same way as the Maxwell's displacement current, and we all know that the displacement current is a source of the magnetic field but there is no flow of electric carriers.  Logically, it is possible that $\langle\Omega|\boldsymbol{j}|\Omega\rangle$ is also such a current containing no flow of charged particles, which is actually the case if the chiral magnetic current is formulated in the chiral perturbation theory.

I would however, emphasize that the genuine current generation occurs at the same time as the particle production with glasma flux tubes that locally violate P- and CP-symmetries together with an external magnetic field.  The distribution function in momentum space is dynamically determined by microscopic processes of the particle production and I will present some results from the numerical simulation.  A non-trivial observation found in the numerical simulation includes a quantitative estimate of the response time of the system until the anomalous current starts growing up after the switch-on of the background fields, which has a practically important implication for the detection of the physical observables sensisive to the chrally anomalous transport in experiments.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenji', 'last_name': 'Fukushima', 'fullName': 'Fukushima, Kenji', 'id': '933555', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': 'bc65164eacbcd969f2958266a92bc286', 'db_id': 933555, 'person_id': 999124}"
Electromagnetic Probes I,parallel,Jet fragmentation photons in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Hattori, Koichi",RIKEN-BNL Research Center,USA,"Electromagnetic probes have been expected to be penetrating probes of the early-time dynamics and quark-gluon plasma. Indeed, the photon spectra measured in the recent RHIC and LHC experiments provide us with an opportunity to deepen understanding of the photon emission mechanism, as they have significantly larger anisotropies compared to theoretical estimates by the hydrodynamic modeling of the bulk properties, implying a missing photon production mechanism giving rise to the large anisotropy. This also implies that the sensible production mechanism should be able to provide a good amount of photons so the anisotropy survives in averaging over various photon sources.

We discuss a photon production mechanism associated with the fragmentation of jets of quarks and antiquarks. We show theoretical estimates of the photon yield obtained from a convolution of the phenomenological jet distribution and the photon emission rate by the bremsstrahlung after the hard parton scatterings at the impact of heavy-ion collisions. 

Our estimate shows a significant photon yield in a few GeV transverse momentum range and a power low behavior. This transverse momentum dependence may be consistent with a recent observation that the photon spectra measured in distinct collision energies can be fitted by power low exponents and the saturation momentum which characterizes the energy scale before and just after the collisions [Klein-Boesing, McLerran, Phys. Lett. B 741 (2015)]. An implication from this observation is the early-time emission of photons before other scales come into play. As a possible interpretation of the early-time emission, we argue that the power low behavior of the phenomenological jet distribution with an infrared cutoff by the saturation momentum is taken over by the photon spectrum. We also discuss anisotropy of the photon spectrum due to the jet energy loss which captures the anisotropic spatial geometry of the matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Koichi', 'last_name': 'Hattori', 'fullName': 'Hattori, Koichi', 'id': '933556', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN-BNL Research Center', 'emailHash': '249a701e18344f65bedc16d4b398fab6', 'db_id': 933556, 'person_id': 998985}"

Poster Session,poster,Probing Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s{\rm NN}} = $ 2.76 TeV using spectator neutrons,"Mohanty, Bedangadas",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN),India,"The primary goal in heavy ion collision (HIC) experiments is to characterise 
the properties of the hot and dense strongly interacting matter produced after 
the collision. A precise comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental 
data helps to select one theoretical model over another. However, one of the 
significant challenges in such endeavors is the ignorance of the initial condition 
at the time of collision. The nuclei being extended objects, there are event by 
event geometric fluctuations in addition to quantum fluctuations of the nuclear 
wave function. The standard method of analyzing the collisions in bins of centrality 
is only able to select events with the initial condition averaged over many possible 
initial states. 

   In this work, we perform an additional binning in terms of total spectator neutrons 
in an event. A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model has been used in our analysis.
We have used the left ($L$) going and right ($R$) going spectator neutrons to form the 
observable $L+R$ that can be measured in experiments using Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC). 
The spectator binning helps us to analyse rarer events whose property usually get masked 
in the standard analysis with centrality bins. We find that in a given centrality bin, events 
with different ellipticity can be selected with $L+R$ binning. This serves as a complementary 
technique to $q_2$-binning to analyse intial event shape. The advantage in using spectators 
is that they are never part of the fireball produced and hence are pristine carriers of the 
initial state information. We find that the scaling relation between $v_2/\varepsilon_2$ and 
$\left(1/S\right)dN_{ch}/d\eta$ obeyed by different centrality bins is broken by the $L+R$ bins, 
instead the hydrodynamic response for both centrality as well as $L+R$ bins exhibit scaling

For various $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction potentials in literature, summarized in the figure with corresponding low energy scattering parameters, we compute the $\Lambda\Lambda$ relative wave function $\Psi(x_1,x_2;Q)$ by assuming modification of the wave function in $S-$wave and discuss the relation between the scattering parameters and the behavior of the correlation function

where $S(x,K)$ denote the source function which is the phase space distribution of $\Lambda$ at freeze-out.

Employing a Gaussian source model with longitudinal and transverse
expansion as a source function of $\Lambda$, we discuss the parameter
ranges of the scattering length $a_0$ and the effective range
$r_{\text{eff}}$ constrained from experimental data in Au+Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$GeV measured by the STAR collaboration [2].
The contribution from electromagnetic decay $\Sigma^0 \rightarrow \Lambda \gamma$
is found to be important. We also point out the existence of residual
correlation in the high $Q$ region which cannot be explained in the
present framework. 

Consequently, we obtained a constraint on the scattering length 
$1/a_0 < -0.8 \text{fm}^{-1}$. 
We will also address an application of this method to other systems,

This class of detectors, which include Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs), Micro-MEsh Gaseous Structure detectors (MicroMegas) and similar, usually require the measurement of small currents (pA) at high potentials (kV) with respect to ground. While only this in itself presents an obstacle, the measurements very often need to satisfy other strict requirements, such as small current resolution, low power consumption, high readout frequencies (1 kHz) or simultaneous readouts of multiple channels.

Several instruments that overcome some of these difficulties have been proposed or developed, often lacking in characteristics that would make them universally applicable. We present a description of a high-resolution picoammeter developed in our laboratory. Tests of the prototype with a local Gas Electron Multiplier sheet setup demonstrate that it satisfies all the aforementioned requirements, including a current resolution of less than 15pA, a readout frequency of 1kHz, the ability of simultaneous readout of multiple channels (up to 16) and low battery power consumption.

Poster Session,poster,Nuclear Symmetry Energy in QCD degree of freedom,"Jeong, Kie Sang",Yonsei University,Unknown,"Nuclear symmetry energy is an important ingredient in understanding asymmetric nuclear configuration starting from rare isotopes at nuclear matter density to the core of neutron star at extremely high density.
The symmetry energy in continuous matter can be defined as
\begin{equation}
\bar{E}(\rho_N,I)=E_0(\rho_N)+E_{\textrm{sym}}(\rho_N)I^2 +
O(I^4)+\cdots,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_N$ is the nuclear medium density and $I =
(\rho_n-\rho_p)/(\rho_n+\rho_p)$ the asymmetric parameter. Our goal
is to understand the iso-spin asymmetric nature of the nuclear
matter using the QCD degree of freedom.

For the hadronic phase, by taking the
difference between the  neutron and proton self-energies calculated in the QCD sum rules, we obtained the
symmetry energy in terms of local operators [1]. We
find that the scalar (vector) part gives a negative (positive)
contribution to the nuclear symmetry energy, which is consistent
with the results from relativistic mean field theories.

For the  quark phase, we used hard dense loop (HDL) resummation for
the normal phase and considered BCS pairing in 2-color
superconductor (2SC) phase [2]. In the normal
phase, the effect of gluonic interaction to the symmetry energy,
obtained from the HDL resumed free energy, was found to be small. In
the 2SC phase, the BCS paring gives enhanced symmetry energy as the
gapped states are forced to be in the common Fermi sea reducing
iso-spin asymmetrizable states. Also, in the 2SC phase, the gluonic
contribution to the symmetry energy is expected to be minimal as
only the unimportant Meissner mass has iso-spin dependence. The
different symmetry energy in each phase will affect the iso-spin
density of the dense matter and subsequently lead to different
prediction for the particle yields in HIC experiment.

Poster Session,poster,Nuclear modification of jet structure in proton-lead collisions at the LHC,"Qin, Guang-You",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The collective anisotropic flows observed in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC and the agreement with hydrodynamic calculations strongly support that a hot and dense QGP may be formed in such small collisions systems. However, the current experimental measurement showed no indication of nuclear modification on the production of large transverse momentum hadrons and jets in minimum-bias proton-lead collisions. As is well known, jet quenching has been one of the most important evidences for the formation of QGP in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and the LHC. Thus, the search for the signature of jet modification is essential to our understanding of high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.

We study the nuclear modification of full jets and their structure in proton-lead collisions at the LHC. The evolution of full jet shower in dense QCD matter is simulated via a pQCD-based Monte-Carlo transport model which includes the medium effects from both radiative and collisional processes. The space-time evolution of the hot and dense nuclear matter produced in proton-lead collisions at the LHC is simulated utilizing a (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions as obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber-based energy deposition model, from which we calculate the anistropic flows and compare to the experimental data. We are particularly interested in the multiplicity dependence and the rapidity dependence for the nuclear modification of the inner structure of single inclusive jets and photon-triggered jets in proton-lead collisions. Comparing to the single inclusive hadron or jet spectra, the modification of full jet structure is more sensitive to the details of jet-medium interaction. We argue that the multiplicity and rapidity dependences for the nuclear modification of full jet structure, once observed, should clearly signal the formation of QGP in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guang-You', 'last_name': 'Qin', 'fullName': 'Qin, Guang-You', 'id': '933589', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '07d521d0766c2824bed3b66cdef7109a', 'db_id': 933589, 'person_id': 999141}"

Chemical equilibration of strange quarks formed in such medium happens faster than would be the situation in hadronic scenario [2].

QGP in Small Systems I,parallel,Effects produced by multi-parton interactions and color reconnection in small systems,"Paic, Guy",Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX),MX,"Multi-parton interactions (MPI) and color reconnection (CR) have raised special interest due to the fact that they can produce QGP-like effects in small systems, specifically, flow-like patterns. Now we will show that the same mechanisms produce an explicit dependence of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra with the number of constituent quarks. In addition, a Cronin-like peak, at intermediate transverse momentum (2 $<  p_{\rm T} <$ 10 GeV/$c$), and a sort of binary scaling, at higher $p_{\rm T}$, are also observed in events with large number of MPI in pp collisions. While those effects have been revealed in pA collisions at  RHIC and at  LHC. In pp collisions, the last two effects have not been reported. This suggests that if MPI and CR are the mechanisms which originate the observed effects, then, the conditions for jet quenching would not be satisfied in small systems.

In addition, we will discuss the experimental challenges to select on MPI. Specifically, the limitations and the biases of the event multiplicity, when, it is calculated in certain kinematic regions. We will show that such a selection can be improved using new approaches based on event shapes. Among the findings we will report that the multiplicity selection bias may affect the average \pt at high multiplicity, producing the so-called second rise of $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ as reported by the ALICE Collaboration. Also, it will be argued that the average expansion velocity extracted from the analysis of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra can be increased by the same kind of bias. Results for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 13 TeV, and comparisons with the available experimental data will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guy', 'last_name': 'Paic', 'fullName': 'Paic, Guy', 'id': '933613', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX)', 'emailHash': '90bebb431e8645cf97f2491dd1ae432c', 'db_id': 933613, 'person_id': 999156}"

We approximate the conditions met in heavy ion collision by enforcing strangeness neutrality and a constant baryon number to electric charge ratio. We show that the fourth-order equation 
of state is suitable for the modeling of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions with center-of-mass energies down to
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \sim 20$ GeV. Sixth-order results for Taylor expansion coefficients are used to estimate truncation errors 
of the fourth-order expansion. We will further discuss lines of constant pressure and energy density in comparison to the 
freeze-out and chiral critical lines.

The presented results will be close to final, *i.e.*, many of the quantities will be continuum extrapolated, based on lattice calculations performed with the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action (HISQ) in the temperature range 140 MeV < T < 330 MeV, with lattice sizes $24^3 \times 6$, $32^3 \times 8$ and $48^3\times 12$. The strange quark mass is tuned to its physical value 
and we use a strange to light quark mass ratio $m_s/m_l = 20$, which in the continuum limit corresponds to a pion mass of about
160 MeV.

We show that while for bottom the motion appears quite close to a Brownian one, this does not seems to be the case for charms quarks.
We address the difficulties of the present theoretical approaches to have a
self-consistent description of the experimental data at both RHIC and LHC. 
In particular a puzzling relation between the nuclear modification factor
$R_{AA}(p_T)$ and the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ related to heavy quark has been
observed which challenged  existing models. We discuss how the
temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient can
account for a large part of such a puzzle. We point out that for the
same $R_{AA}(p_T)$ one can generate 2-3 times more $v_2$ depending on the
temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag coefficient [3]. 
A non-decreasing drag coefficient as T→Tc, as in liquids and not in gas, is a major ingredient 
for a simultaneous description of $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2(p_T)$ along with hadronization by coalescence.

However, the QGP equation of state needs to be interpreted in terms of effective degrees of freedom (d.o.f). Considering the QGP as a dynamical quasi-particle medium of massive off-shell particles (as described by the dynamical quasi-particles model “DQPM” [2]), we reproduce the lQCD results at finite temperature and chemical potential including the speed of sound. Moreover, we simultaneously describe the quark number density and susceptibility. Within our study, we determine the momentum, temperature and chemical potential dependencies of the QGP d.o.f. within the dynamical quasi-particle model [3].

In the same approach, we compute the transport properties (shear and bulk viscosities, electric and heat conductivities, etc) of the QGP at finite temperature and chemical potential. The cross sections at finite temperature and chemical potential, used in our study, are evaluated for these dynamical quasi-particles using the leading order Born diagrams [4]. We, furthermore, provide a comprehensive comparison between perturbative and non-perturbative QCD based models on the determination of the QGP transport coefficients [5].

This process can, however, occur also in peripheral and semi-central nucleus-nucleus collisions, where there are large spectator fragments, which can act as photon sources and targets.

As this presentation will show, one can expect significant photoproduction of J/\psi in Pb+Pb collisions with impact parameters in the range 10 - 15 fm at the LHC.  This contribution is important to understand in order to be able to determine the true centrality dependence of the J/\psi yield from hadronic sources. It also addresses some interesting questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in a semi-central collision: if the number of photons is ""frozen"" before the collision and all protons contribute to the photon flux, or if only the protons in the spectator fragments contribute. Similarly, it is not clear if the photon target is restricted to the spectator fragments or if production can occur also in the participant region. In the latter case, photoproduction will provide a novel probe of strongly interacting matter, and the interplay with hadronic production, e.g. regarding regeneration and thermalization, would merit further experimental and theoretical study.

The model used to calculate the photoproduction cross section will be discussed and the expected yield as function of centrality will be compared with the expected hadronic contribution. The transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of the two production mechanisms will be compared.  The calculations indicate that the yield from photoproduction changes from a few percent of the hadronic yield for the 50-60% most central collisions to around 50% of the hadronic yield for the 80-90% most central collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joakim', 'last_name': 'Nystrand', 'fullName': 'Nystrand, Joakim', 'id': '933689', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen (NO)', 'emailHash': 'cea77e55aed8319d570a00d5ec090d51', 'db_id': 933689, 'person_id': 999206}"

This is confirmed by simulations using various initial-state models.

It has been argued that non-Gaussianities may not reflect underlying
microscopic dynamics. On the contrary, there are indications that they
are to a large extent
universal and arise from the global condition $|\varepsilon_n|<1$.
On the other hand, systematic investigations of second and
fourth-order cumulants $\varepsilon_n\{2\}$ and $\varepsilon_n\{4\}$
reveal deviations from this universal behavior in large systems,
which suggests that non-Gaussianities may carry non-trivial dynamical
information.

In this talk, we present results from Monte Carlo simulations and
analytic calculations which we have done in order to
investigate what non-Gaussianities tell us about the early stage of
heavy-ion collisions.
We find that the non-Gaussianities are essentially universal in p+Pb

three hot spots created by the impact of the three $^3$He nucleons

Correlations and Fluctuations III,parallel,PHENIX results on fluctuations and Bose-Einstein correlations in Au$+$Au collisions from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan,"Garg, Prakhar",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"The RHIC Beam Energy Scan focuses on mapping the QCD phase diagram

conserved quantities, measured as a function of centrality and
collision energy, are promising tools in these studies.  Recent
lattice QCD and statistical thermal model calculations predict that
high order cumulants of the fluctuations are sensitive indicators of
the phase transition.  Products of these cumulants can be used to
extract the freeze-out parameters and locate the critical point.
Two-pion interferometry measurements are predicted to be sensitive

Analysis of data from LHC Run1 and first look at data from Run2 had demonstrated excellent performance both for particle identification via dE/dx and tracking. A summary of the performance will be presented. 
For RUN 3 and RUN 4, where collision rates of 50 kHz are expected, our aim is to preserve this excellent performance while removing the inherent rate limitation imposed by the gating grid, such that 50 kHz read-out rate can be achieved. 
To this end, a new concept for continuous readout at a minimum of space-charge build-up in the drift volume will be adopted. A novel configuration of GEM detectors has been developed that allows one to maintain excellent particle identification and effective ion trapping, by stacking four GEM foils with different hole pitches and operated under an ad hoc field configuration. Results of intensive R&D to achieve this goal will be summarized, including the demonstration of robustness against discharges.

In this poster, we report jet azimuthal distributions relative to neutral pion triggers in pp 7 TeV and Pb-Pb 2.76 TeV from ALICE at the LHC. For neutral pion identification, an electro-magnetic calorimeter (EMCal) is used. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles measured by a Time-Projection Chamber (TPC) and Inner-Tracking System (ITS).
The high $p_T$ neutral pion sample is enhanced by using the EMCal gamma trigger in combination with a shower shape analysis to identify neutral pions.

Jet quenching has been observed at RHIC and the LHC, and it has been extensively studied at both colliders.

Recently a new aspect of jet physics has been revealed at RHIC and the LHC.
The jet energy deposition in the medium (jet-quenching effect) was found to result in an increased production of low $p_{T}$ particles at large angles opposite to the survived jet or triggered gamma direction.
However, there are still remaining open questions how the quenched jet energy is re-distributed in geometrical space, and how the QGP medium responds to it.

The HBT correlations using quantum interferometry of identical particles provide a unique tool to measure the source size at kinetic freeze-out.
In particular, azimuthally sensitive HBT with respect to the event plane($\Psi_{2}$) offers the detailed analysis of freeze-out source shape.

In order to obtain more detailed information on    the jet modification effect in geometrical space, the HBT technique can be extended and applied relative to jet axis.

We present a study on the stability of a Fulde-Ferrell type inhomogeneous chiral condensed phase, the so-called dual chiral density wave (DCDW) phase, of dense quark matter against low energy fluctuations about a spatially modulated order parameter [1]. We find that the DCDW phase exhibits a flavor-translation locking symmetry from the symmetry point of view. We also show that the Nambu-Goldstone modes, whose dispersion relations are spatially anisotropic and soft in the directions transverse to the modulation, wash out the long-range order at non-zero temperatures, but sustain quasi-long-range correlations (algebraically decaying long-range correlations), starting with a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson effective Lagrangian. Consequently, at finite temperatures the DCDW phase is found to be a quasi-one-dimensional ordered phase as in smectic phases of liquid crystals.

It is said that inhomogeneous chiral condensation phases in which neutral pion condense can exist in high density and low temperature region near the chiral restoration point. Then, we put heavy-light mesons into such phases and investigate what happens. At first, we put heavy-light mesons on some inhomogeneous phases and see the modification of their masses. In this case, heavy-light mesons carrying different spin and iso-spin mix each other. And this causes the mass splitting of heavy-light mesons, e.g., $D(0^-)$ and $D^*(1^-)$ degenerated in the vacuum. Furthermore, these splitting patterns reflect what kind of inhomogeneous phase occurs. Next, we show the dispersion relations for heavy-light mesons in the Chiral Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW is one of the inhomogeneous phases where scalar mode and neutral pseudo-scalar mode can condense. In this phase, potentials for heavy-light mesons are periodic, so that we have to employ the Bloch’s theorem to get the dispersion relations. Thereby, dispersion relations drastically change, i.e., the existence of the Brillouin zones and the emergence of collective modes. These modifications are signal of the existence of the inhomogeneous phases.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daiki', 'last_name': 'Suenaga', 'fullName': 'Suenaga, Daiki', 'id': '933687', 'affiliation': 'Nagoya University', 'emailHash': 'eaea4be45e0e45ef7b5f2766d8523df6', 'db_id': 933687, 'person_id': 999205}"
Poster Session,poster,Extracting the shear viscosity of the QGP in the presence of bulk viscosity,"Noronha-Hostler, Jacquelyn",Columbia University,USA,"The interplay between shear and bulk viscosities on the flow harmonics, $v_n$’s, at RHIC is investigated
using the 2+1 hydrodynamical code v-USPhydro [1] that includes bulk and shear viscosity effects (on an event by event basis) both in the hydrodynamic evolution and also at freeze-out. While shear viscosity is known to attenuate the flow harmonics, the inclusion of bulk viscosity
decreases the shear viscosity-induced suppression of the flow harmonics at RHIC bringing them closer
to their values in ideal hydrodynamical calculations [2]. 

In this talk, NeXuS initial conditions [3] are used to investigate not only how initial flow can alter the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma but also how different models for bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\zeta/s$, ranging from strong coupling holographic models to hadron gas+lattice calculations, can be used to determine the sensitivity of current hydrodynamic modelling to temperature dependent transport coefficients. We find that flow harmonic data at RHIC can only be adequately described with viscous hydrodynamics [4] if the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma is two to three times as large as the AdS/CFT viscosity bound.

Baryon Rich QCD Matter,unknown,Real time evolution of non-Gaussian cumulants in the QCD critical regime,"Mukherjee, Swagato",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Enhanced near critical fluctuations can be quantified by the variance of the critical field (the Gaussian cumulant), as well as higher non-Gaussian cumulants such as skewness and kurtosis. These non-Gaussian cumulants are accessible through measurements of event-by-event fluctuations of various particle multiplicities. Non-Gaussian event-by-event fluctuations of multiplicities are generically expected to show nonmonotonic behavior in the proximity of the critical point.  These expectations are entirely based on the assumption that the soft modes responsible for critical fluctuations are in equilibrium with the medium. However, the expanding medium created in heavy-ion collisions only spends a limited amount of time in the QCD critical regime and it is unlikely the critical modes remain in equilibrium in this duration.

We derive a coupled set of equations that describe the non-equilibrium evolution of cumulants of critical fluctuations for space-time trajectories on the cross-over side of the QCD phase diagram. In particular, novel expressions are obtained for the non-equilibrium evolution of non-Gaussian Skewness and Kurtosis cumulants. Utilizing a simple model of the space-time evolution of a heavyion collision, we demonstrate that, depending on the relaxation rate of critical fluctuations, Skewness and Kurtosis can differ significantly in magnitude as well as in sign from equilibrium expectations. Memory effects are important and shown to persist even for trajectories that skirt the edge of the critical regime. We use phenomenologically motivated parameterizations of freeze-out curves, and of the beam energy dependence of the net baryon chemical potential, to explore the implications of our model study for the critical point search in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Swagato', 'last_name': 'Mukherjee', 'fullName': 'Mukherjee, Swagato', 'id': '933691', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '6567fbf8f5b7e140f7a1b81fe83d35b2', 'db_id': 933691, 'person_id': 998636}"

An interesting system is (2+Nf)-flavor QCD at finite density, where two light flavors and Nf massive flavors exist. 
For large Nf, we can easily investigate the critical surface terminating first order phase transitions in the parameter space of the light quark mass, the heavy quark mass and the chemical potential. 
We determine the critical surface by looking at the shape of distribution functions. 
Another interesting system is QCD with a complex chemical potential.

In particular, we focus on the resulting distributions of charged leptons from W decays, which can be measured with relatively low backgrounds. By inspecting the corresponding leading-order expressions within the collinearly factorized QCD we find that the center-of-mass energy dependence at forward/backward direction should be describable by a simple power law. The physical interpretation of the scaling exponent is in the small-x behaviour of the parton densities. The most thrilling consequence, however, is the resulting extremely simple scaling law for the lepton charge asymmetry which also relates measurements in different collision systems. For example, this allows an almost-direct comparison of measurements in p-p and p-Pb or in p-Pb and Pb-Pb, pairwise, even if the center-of-mass energies would be different! The expectations are contrasted with the existing data and a very good overall agreement is indeed found.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation Evolution in Au+Au Collisions at FAIR energy,"Ahmad, Shabir","University of Kashmir, Srinagar J&K India",Unknown,"Event by event fluctuations of particle multiplicities and their ratios are considered to be sensitive probes to the exotic phenomena in high energy heavy ion collisions like phase transtion or the occurence of critical point. These phenomena might take place at different time after the collision based on fulfilling the required conditions at a particular time. Fluctuations are therefore expected to show non-monotonic behaviour at the of time of occurence of these phenomena. Experimentally, fluctuations are measured at freezeout. In this work, using the hybrid version of the UrQMD event generator, we have investigated the propagation of fluctuations of particle multiplicities, their ratios and the ratio of total positive and negative charges in AuAu collisions at E$_{lab} < $ 90 AGeV. Two commonly used experimental measures i.e., $\sigma^2$/mean and $\nu_{dyn}$ have been used in the analysis in a given acceptance. The hybrid model, i.e., UrQMD with hydrodynamic evolution has been used to  study the effect of hydrodynamic evolution on these conventional fluctuation measures. It is observed that the fluctuations as measured by $\sigma^2$/mean and $\nu_{dyn}$ gets reduced considerably at freezeout. The dominat structures present at the initial stage of the evolution get smoothen out. However, the energy dependence of the fluctuations remain preserved till the freezeout. The hydrodynamic evolution of the model with chiral equation of state shows considerably higher fluctuation at lower collision energy as compared to pure hadronic transport version or the hybrid version with hadronic equation of state. The time evolution of the higher order moments of net-proton distributios for particles in a specified coverage showed similar behaviour.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shabir', 'last_name': 'Ahmad', 'fullName': 'Ahmad, Shabir', 'id': '933707', 'affiliation': 'University of Kashmir, Srinagar J&K India', 'emailHash': '803ce7a755fc0aca1436bc7282388e50', 'db_id': 933707, 'person_id': 999215}"
Poster Session,poster,Chiral mirror-baryon-meson model and nuclear matter beyond mean-field,"Weyrich, Johannes",Technical University Darmstadt,Unknown,"We describe the liquid-gas transition of nuclear matter together with chiral symmetry restoration in the high baryon-density phase considering a chiral baryon-meson model for nucleons and their parity partners in mirror assignment interacting with pions, sigma and omega mesons. 
The model is known to provide a phenomenologically successful description of nuclear matter properties within the mean-field approximation. Here, we go beyond this approximation and include mesonic fluctuations by means of the functional renormalization group. 
We concentrate on cold nuclear matter in the vicinity of the  nuclear-matter transition but also consider finite temperatures to study the full phase diagram of the model.
While including beyond mean-field fluctuations does not lead to major qualitative changes in the phase diagram of the model, in the vacuum one is no longer free to adjust the parameters so as to reproduce the binding energy per nucleon, the nuclear saturation density, and the nucleon sigma term all at the same time.
However, the prediction of a clear first-order chiral transition at low temperatures inside the high baryon-density phase appears to be robust.
Moreover, combining an extended mean-field approximation for the grand potential in the vacuum with thermal fluctuations at finite density provides a promising approach to explore the phenomenological consequences of the chiral transition of this model inside the high baryon-density phase for an equation of state of neutron matter and the mass-radius relation of neutron stars.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Johannes', 'last_name': 'Weyrich', 'fullName': 'Weyrich, Johannes', 'id': '933712', 'affiliation': 'Technical University Darmstadt', 'emailHash': '8353ef800205e5a7d0cd92850b4b0251', 'db_id': 933712, 'person_id': 999219}"

Hints of similar behavior are observed when $v_3\{2\}$ and $v_4\{2\}$ are scaled by $v_2\{2\}$. We will discuss the relevance of this observation in terms of a possible pressure minimum, and how such a minimum might relate to critical point searches in the Beam Energy Scan.

Besides, we present a variety of predictions for the nuclear suppression as function of transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass of the lepton pair that can be verified by experiments at RHIC and LHC. We found that the nuclear suppression is caused predominantly by effects of quantum coherence (shadowing corrections) and by the effective energy loss induced by multiple initial state interactions. Whereas the former dominates at small Bjorken x2 in the target, the latter turns out to be significant at large x1 in the projectile beam and is universal at different energies and transverse momenta.

In this talk we will discuss the HFT hardware design, and current detector status and performance.

The HFT was successfully commissioned during the 2014 RHIC run, taking data in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV.

Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Charge-dependent correlations from event-by-event anomalous hydrodynamics,"Hirono, Yuji",Stony Brook University,USA,"The chiral magnetic effect (CME) has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly in the context of heavy-ion collisions. The anomaly-induced transport effects like the CME are macroscopic and are incorporated into hydrodynamic equations giving rise to ""anomalous hydrodynamics"". Theoretically, the CME is expected to occur in heavy-ion collisions. The data reported by STAR[1] and PHENIX[2] collaborations at RHIC and ALICE collaborations [3] at the LHC show a behavior consistent with the CME, but the quantitative understanding is still lacking. In order to reach a definitive conclusion, a reliable theoretical tool that can describe the charge-dependent observables is indispensable.

In this contribution, we report our recent attempt of quantitative modeling of the CME for heavy-ion collisions. We develop an event-by-event hydrodynamic model which includes the anomalous transport effects. We perform 3+1 dimensional anomalous hydrodynamic simulations, with constitutive equations that contain the anomaly-induced effects. We also develop a model of the initial condition for the axial charge that captures the statistical nature of random chirality imbalance created by color flux tubes. Basing on the event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for hundreds of thousands of collisions, we calculate the correlation functions that are measured in experiments, and discuss how the anomalous transports affect the observables.

These measurements comprehensively demonstrate that a significant fraction of the higher order flow (n>3), is in fact generated from the hydrodynamic response to lower order eccentricities.

Poster Session,poster,Heavy hadron systems in a magnetic field,"Suzuki, Kei",Tokyo Institute of Technology,Unknown,"Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in a strong magnetic field is one of the most exciting topics in hadron physics. In relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments performed in RHIC and LHC, it is predicted to be produced a strong magnetic field by non-central collision of charged nuclei. In particular, hadron properties under such external field can be drastically modified by perturbative and non-perturbative effects. 

In this study, we investigate theoretically the properties of heavy hadrons (especially, D mesons) including a charm quark in a magnetic field by using some theoretical approaches such as the QCD sum rules and effective models. 
From our approaches, we can predict the D meson mass shifts by magnetic effects such as the Landau level for a charged particle, the mixing effect between different hadron states and magnetic field dependence of condensates. Technically, in the QCD sum rules, the OPE up to the order of the square of magnetic field is calculated and the magnetic field dependences of condensates are taken from the recent results of lattice QCD or effective field theory. For the phenomenological side, we introduce a new structures induced by a magnetic field to go beyond the analysis by (conventional) ``pole + continuum"" assumption.

As a result, we discuss some magnetic properties of the hadrons induced by a magnetic field, such as Landau level of the charged meson, mixing effect with other hadron states and magnetic field dependence of QCD condensates. Furthermore, we discuss comparison with recent indications from the lattice QCD and experimental possibilities.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kei', 'last_name': 'Suzuki', 'fullName': 'Suzuki, Kei', 'id': '933753', 'affiliation': 'Tokyo Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': '415fd184e963884e75de5f38544bfc0c', 'db_id': 933753, 'person_id': 998911}"

The resulting fluctuations and correlations are consistent with Lattice QCD results at the chiral crossover pseudocritical temperature Tc ≃ 155 MeV. This agreement lends strong support to the assumption that the fireball created in these collisions is of thermal origin and exhibits characteristic properties expected in QCD at the transition from the quark gluon plasma to the hadronic phase. Since Lattice QCD calculations are performed at a baryochemical potential of mu$_B$ = 0, the comparisons with LHC data are the most direct due to the vanishing baryon transport to midrapidity at these high energies.

In our investigations into strong coupling light flavor energy loss, we found that the results are extremely sensitive to the initial conditions of the string in AdS space.

Poster Session,poster,Initial State fluctuations in ultra-central collisions in an event-by-event transport approach,"Plumari, Salvatore",University of Catania (Italy),Unknown,"We discuss the generation of anisotropic flows $v_n$ for a fluid at fixed $\eta/s(T)$ by means of an 
event-by-event transport approach. Such an approach, as shown in [1], recovers the universal features 
of the ideal hydrodynamics showing an agreement with the recent analitical solutions.
We discuss the effect of the $\eta/s$ and its temperature dependence on the 
build up of the $v_n(p_T)$ revealing that only in ultra-central collisions ($0-0.2\%$) the $v_n(p_T)$ have a stronger sensitivity to the T dependence of $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase and this sensitivity increases with 
the order of the harmonic n. 
Moreover, the study of the correlations between the initial spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$ and the final 
flow coefficients $v_n$ shows that at LHC energies there is more correlation than at RHIC energies. 
The degree of correlation increases from peripheral to central collisions, but only in ultra-central 
collisions at LHC, we find that the linear correlation coefficent $C(n,n) \approx 1$ for $n=2,3,4$ and $5$. This suggests that 
the final correlations in the ($v_n$,$v_m$) space reflect the initial correlations in the ($\epsilon_n$,$\epsilon_m$) space. 
Moreover the recent event shape engineering (ESE) [4]  tecnique allows to have a new insight into the initial state fluctuations and $\epsilon_n$ correlations [5].
Finally, we discuss in ultra-central collisions the structure of the integrated ($v_n,n$) plot and its relation with the

Poster Session,poster,Bottomonium production in coupled Langevin and transport approach,"Young, Clint",M,Unknown,"In heavy ion collisions, quarkonium is produced in a rapidly thermalized deconfined medium. Quarkonium production can be understood in terms of Langevin dynamics of heavy quarks interacting through medium modified potential [1].

with a lattice QCD inspired potential. It also explains the J/psi production at LHC including its centrality independence [3].

We extend this framework to upsilon production by including the thermal dissociation of formed bottomonia.  This is done with a transport (local
rate) equation followed by Langevin dynamics of the correlated $Q\bar{Q}$ states. The bulk evolution of the medium is treated using MUSIC, a 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamical simulator of heavy ion collisions, while we make use of the latest lattice results on the $Q\bar{Q}$ potential. We make
prediction for the bottomonium production at full LHC energy.

However, it has been difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the chosen values of input parameters, due to the massive amount of computational resources required for evaluating all possible input parameter combinations. A way to reduce the computational effort is to run a set of simulations for semi-random, space-filling selection of points in parameter space, and then use an emulator trained on this data to predict the output for arbitrary input. Gaussian processes are an attractive choice for the emulator, as they are very flexible and predict probability distributions with quantitative uncertainty.

In this study, we investigate the input parameters, including the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\eta/s$, of the UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model[1]. Focusing on Au+Au collisions at the higher end of the RHIC beam energy scan energy range, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=62.4$ and $39$ GeV, we determine the most probable parameter values and their uncertainties using the state-of-the-art statistical analysis based on Bayesian statistics. Following the methods described in [2,3], the probability distributions for the parameters are produced by calibrating the model to experimental data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, utilizing Gaussian processes to emulate the hybrid model behavior for uninvestigated input values. The results illustrate how much the input parameters are constrained by a given set of observables and reveal the correlations between the parameters.

For the analysis of the chiral inhomogeneous phase, the generalized chiral condensate $\Delta := -2G\left[\left<\overline\psi\psi\right>+i\left<\overline\psi i\gamma^5\tau^3\psi\right>\right]$ is used.
The dual chiral density wave (DCDW) and the real kink crystal (RKC) have been commonly used as typical form of the chiral condensate: DCDW is a plane wave configuration, $\Delta(x) =me^{iqx}$, and RKC is a multi-soliton configuration, $ \Delta(x)
=\frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left( \frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}},
\nu\right) $.
 The thermodynamic properties of the DCDW phase in the magnetic field has been studied by Frolov et al., and it has been shown that the DCDW phase develops in the wide density region in the presence of the magnetic field.
 However, they have only considered DCDW, while it has been suggested that the RKC phase may be favored without the external magnetic field.

Here we figure out the properties of the chiral inhomogeneous condensate in the presence of external magnetic field, taking into account the possibility of the RKC phase. We introduce a hybrid configuration (HCC) which has the feature of both DCDW and RKC,
$
 \Delta(x) = \frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left(
\frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}},\nu \right)e^{iqz}$, to this end.
Note that it smoothly connects both configurations by changing modulus $\nu$.
There never appears the pure RKC phase, and DCDW and RKC coexist as HCC in the weak magnetic field at moderate density.
Eventually DCDW becomes most favorable in the strong magnetic field.
It is also shown that there is a first order phase transition between inhomogeneous phases in the presence of magnetic field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazuya', 'last_name': 'Nisihiyama', 'fullName': 'Nisihiyama, Kazuya', 'id': '933807', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto university', 'emailHash': 'e4baa09ad2cb9e9b91bcc3a0209f3507', 'db_id': 933807, 'person_id': 998696}"

Immediately after a collision, which is a crucial stage of the problem, strong gluon field is dominant and quantum fluctuations on the top of the classical configurations (glasma) induce instabilities. It may trigger the chaotic behavior of the gauge field and eventually give rise to entropy production. In this work, we investigate thermalization of glasma by using the Husimi-Wehrl (H-W) entropy defined by Husimi function which is a coarse-grained quantum distribution function. We calculate the semi-classical time evolution of the Husimi function and the H-W entropy in Yang-Mills field theory with two numerical methods based on Monte-Carlo method, and also discuss the time scale of the entropy growth.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hidekazu', 'last_name': 'Tsukiji', 'fullName': 'Tsukiji, Hidekazu', 'id': '933810', 'affiliation': 'Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kyoto University', 'emailHash': '7b20c7c2bcc922df1fff35e71a3c8ffd', 'db_id': 933810, 'person_id': 999272}"
Jets and High pT Hadrons I,parallel,Interplay between Mach cone and radial expansion in jet events,"Tachibana, Yasuki","Nishina Center, RIKEN",Unknown,"As we see expansion of bulk quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in high-energy nuclear collisions is well described by relativistic hydrodynamics, fluidity is one of the key properties of the QGP. At the same time, the QGP has a large stopping power against propagation of jets: The jets lose a large amount of their energies while traversing the QGP fluid due to strong interactions between them. The deposited energy of the jet induces a shock wave, a.k.a. Mach cone, in the QGP as a hydrodynamic response. Such a hydrodynamic response is also a clear manifestation of the fluidity of the QGP. Since the structure of shock wave is characterized by various properties of the QGP, e.g., sound velocity, stopping power, and viscosity, we have a great opportunity to extract the property of the QGP by analyzing this phenomenon.

We study the hydrodynamic response to jet propagation in the expanding QGP and investigate how it reflects the particle spectra after the hydrodynamic evolution of the bulk QGP. We perform simulations of the bulk dynamics of the QGP specifically in di-jet and gamma-jet events by solving (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms. Mach cones are formed and largely develops in the QGP fluid. However, the double peak in the azimuthal particle distribution, which is believed to be an intuitive signal of the Mach cone, is smeared out by the diffusion wake, the distortion by the radial flow and freeze-out processes. Instead, we find a novel phenomenon of the interplay between the Mach cone and radial expansion when the jets travel through the off-central trajectories: Propagation of Mach cone pushes back the radial flow. As a result, the particle production is suppressed in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation. This is the direct signal of hydrodynamic response to jet propagation and even includes the information about the jet passage in the expanding QGP fluid.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yasuki', 'last_name': 'Tachibana', 'fullName': 'Tachibana, Yasuki', 'id': '933815', 'affiliation': 'Nishina Center, RIKEN', 'emailHash': '601eb4b4a9f614e3bed0e069c852b5f0', 'db_id': 933815, 'person_id': 999275}"
Poster Session,poster,Collective flow in event-by-event partonic transport plus hydrodynamics hybrid approach,"Bhalerao, Rajeev",TIFR,Unknown,"Complete evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is studied within a coupled Boltzmann and relativistic viscous hydrodynamics approach [1]. For the initial non-equilibrium evolution phase, we employ A MultiPhase Transport model that explicitly includes event-by-event fluctuations in the number and positions of the participating nucleons as well as of the produced partons with subsequent parton transport. The ensuing near-equilibrium evolution of quark-gluon and hadronic matter is modeled within the (2+1)D relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. (1) We probe the role of parton dynamics in generating and maintaining the spatial anisotropy in the pre-equilibrium phase. Substantial spatial eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ are found to be generated in the process of parton production from initial NN collisions. (2) For ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, the model is able to explain qualitatively the unexpected hierarchy of the flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-6)$ observed at LHC. (3) We find that the results for $v_n(p_T)$ are rather insensitive to the variation (within a range) of the time of switchover from AMPT parton transport to hydrodynamic evolution. (4) The usual Grad and the recently proposed Chapman-Enskog-like single-particle distribution functions are found to give very similar results for $v_n(p_T)~(n=2-4)$. (5) The model describes well both the RHIC and LHC data for $v_n(p_T)$ at various centralities, with a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio 0.08 and 0.12, respectively. (6) The event-by-event distributions of $v_{2,3}$ are in good agreement with the LHC data for mid-central collisions. The linear response relation $v_n = k_n \varepsilon_n$ is found to be true for $n=2,3$, except at large values of $\varepsilon_n$, where a larger value of $k_n$ is required, suggesting a small admixture of positive nonlinear response even for $n=2,3$.

evolution with the strongly coupled dynamics which dominates the soft
exchanges between the fast partons in the jet shower and the
strongly coupled plasma itself. We implement this
approach in a Monte Carlo, which supplements the DGLAP shower with the
energy loss dynamics as dictated by holographic computations, up
to a single free parameter that we fit to data. We
confront our model with available single jet, dijet and photon-jet data in
Pb-Pb collisons at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$~ATeV and we obtain a satisfactory
description after fitting one single parameter. We use our model to
predict a broad range of dijet, photon-jet and Z-jet observables for
the upcoming LHC Run II, at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$~ATeV. We then augment
the model by incorporating the transverse momentum picked up by
each parton in the shower as it propagates through the medium, at
the expense of adding a second free parameter.  We use this model to
discuss the influence of the transverse broadening of the partons in a jet
on intra-jet observables. In addition, we explore the sensitivity of such
observables to the back-reaction of the plasma to the passage of the jet.
Finally, we comment on the sensitivity of the different observables we

recorded Au + Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6,
27, 39, and 62.4 GeV within a pseudo rapidity range of |\eta|< 1.
Recently reported results from identified particle elliptic flow in
minimum bias (0–80%) collisions revealed an energy dependent
difference in elliptic flow between particles and antiparticles [2].
This difference is increasing with decreasing collision energy and is
almost identical for all baryons. These observations attracted various
theory groups, that tried to reproduce the results with different
assumptions in their model calculations [3].

In this talk, we present the elliptic flow of identified particle for
three centrality classes in Au + Au collisions at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7 -
62.4 GeV. The centrality dependence and the data at \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 14.5
GeV are new. Except at the lowest beam energies, we observe a similar
relative v2 baryon-meson splitting for all centrality classes which is
in agreement within 15% with the number-of-constituent quark scaling.
The larger v2 for most particles relative to antiparticles, already
observed for minimum bias collisions shows a clear centrality
dependence, with the largest difference in the most central collisions.
The new beam energy (14.5 GeV) and centrality dependence would be useful
to distinguish between the different models or to improve their input
parameters.

Jets and High pT Hadrons II,parallel,Consequences (and a possible explanation) of the $R_{pA}^{\rm jet}$ - $R_{pA}^{\rm hadron}$ puzzle,"Wiedemann, Urs",CERN,Switzerland,"The experimental finding that in pA collisions at the LHC, $R_{pA}^{\rm jet}$ is consistent with unity at high transverse energies, while $R_{pA}^{\rm hadron}$ exceeds unity above $p_T \sim 30$ GeV poses a fundamental problem for our understanding of high-$p_T$ processes in nuclear collisions. It can neither be accounted for in a collinear factorized formalism with process-independent fragmentation functions, nor can it be understood as a final state modification of the final state parton shower (on which standard jet quenching models in nucleus-nucleus collisions are based). We argue that these findings, point to a process-dependent element in the high-$p_T$ fragmentation mechanism. We note that the color recombination mechanisms implemented in general purpose event generators like SHERPA provide for such a process-dependent mechanism, since they imply that single inclusive hadron production depends not only on the factorized hard partonic interaction,
but also on the density of the underlying event within which this hard process color recombines during hadronization. We demonstrate both on the level of qualitative arguments and with Monte Carlo simulations that by simply accounting for the factor 3 higher underlying event activity in pA collisions as compared to pp collisions, this mechanism can account for
the observed nuclear modification factors of  jet and hadron spectra in pA collisions. We emphasize that if the proposed mechanism is confirmed, it has interesting consequences for the understanding of high-pT hadron spectra in proton-proton collisions, since it allows one to quantify the size of a process-dependent correction to the standard collinearly factorized framework.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Urs', 'last_name': 'Wiedemann', 'fullName': 'Wiedemann, Urs', 'id': '933843', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'b3e9ac8536071cc26fac1dbcff7b76ac', 'db_id': 933843, 'person_id': 999287}"

Poster Session,poster,PHENIX Results on Excited Charmonia Production at Forward and Backward Rapidity,"Durham, J. Matthew",Los Alamos National Laboratory,USA,"Recent measurements from RHIC and the LHC have shown that the excited charmonium state $\psi(2s)$ is preferentially suppressed over the more tightly bound $J/\psi$ in ultrarelativistic $p (d)$ + A collisions.  The exact mechanism behind this difference in suppression is not immediately clear.  Since all primordial charm quark production is subject to similar initial state effects inside the nucleus, and the time the $c \bar{c}$ pair spends in the nucleus is so short, it may be that interactions outside the nucleus with co-moving particles are partially responsible for the disruption of the charmonium wavefunction.  Therefore it is interesting to study charmonium production at forward and backward rapidity, where the co-moving particle density varies considerably between the Au-going and $p$-going directions.  The introduction of the Forward Silicon Vertex Tracker (FVTX) in front of the PHENIX muons arms has improved the dimuon mass resolution such that the $\psi(2s)$ peak can now be distinguished from the $J/\psi$ peak and measured at forward and backward rapidity.

interest for investigating the properties of the medium.

In the quark coalescence picture of particle production, the baryon formation probability can be influenced by these local parton density fluctuations that lead to clustering and voids in the distribution of hadrons in the phase space. We propose to use the normalized distribution of produced particles in coarse azimuthal angular bins to study the fluctuations. The shape of the normalized distribution is expected to be sensitive to clustering in the phase space. We use Poisson and Binomial distributions to generate reference comparisons. Clustering of particles is introduced empirically in the Monte Carlo to investigate the sensitivity of various moments of the normalized distribution.

The results from the NA49 experiment at CERN have been used to claim that the onset of deconfinement occurs at a collision energy around a center-of-mass energy of 7 GeV, the low end of the BES range [1]. Data from lower energies are needed to test if this onset occurs. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES II with the same detector to energies that are likely below the onset of deconfinement. Currently, STAR has inserted a gold target into the beam pipe and conducted test runs at center-of-mass energies 3.9 and 4.5 GeV. Tests have been done with both Au and Al beams. First physics results from a Coulomb analysis of Au + Au fixed-target collisions, which are found to be consistent with previous experiments, will be presented. These results demonstrate that STAR has good particle identification capabilities in this novel detector setup. Furthermore, the Coulomb potential, which is sensitive to the Z of the projectile and degree of baryonic stopping, will be compared with published results from the AGS. Additional results and comparisons will be presented if available.

We argue that the trace anomaly peak and the local minimum of the generalized specific volume observed   
at a laboratory energy of 11.6 AGeV provide a signal for the formation of   
a mixed phase between the QGP and the hadron phase. This is also supported by an independent meta-analysis [3]: we compare the quality of hadron spectra and multiplicities description from 10 different models in the range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ from 2.1 GeV to 17.3 GeV and find that at 5-10.8 GeV and above 12 GeV models assuming QGP perform notably better, while at 4.4­-4.87 GeV and 10.8­-12 GeV QGP models perform as good as purely hadron ones.

Measurements of Non-Photonic Electron (NPE) production from open heavy flavor hadron decays have revealed strong suppression at large transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Such suppression has been attributed to energy losses of heavy flavor quarks within the QGP. Theoretical predictions that are able to describe existing NPE data suggest that bottom quarks lose less energy than charm quarks, but it varies among models how exactly they differ. Therefore it is important to experimentally constrain such model calculations, which can further improve our understanding of parton interactions with the QGP and the QGP properties. Electrons from bottom hadron decays can be statistically separated thanks to the long lifetime of the bottom hadrons by comparison of the impact parameter distributions.

Quarkonia II,parallel,In-medium quarkonium properties from a lattice QCD based effective field theory,"Rothkopf, Alexander",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"In order to understand the experimental data on quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC it is necessary (though not sufficient) to pinpoint the properties of heavy quarkonium in the deconfined QGP medium, including their dissolution. Studying quarkonium spectral properties at non-zero temperature, directly in lattice QCD, have proven to be difficult and detailed quantitative information on quarkonium in-medium properties is still lacking.

Lattice QCD based effective theories, such as lattice NRQCD, have seen impressive success in the determination of quarkonium properties in vacuum (e.g. their masses and decay widths), with the underlying framework being applicable in principle also at finite temperature. In combination with realistic lattice QCD simulations of the QGP medium with light pion masses by the HotQCD collaboration [1] gaining reliable first-principles insight into in-medium behavior is now is in reach.

Here we present our recent results on the temperature dependence of bottomonium and charmonium correlators, as well as their spectral functions in lattice NRQCD for temperatures 140 MeV < T< 400 MeV [2,3]. The spectra are reconstructed based on a novel Bayesian prescription [4], whose systematic uncertainties are thoroughly tested. We present indications for sequential melting of different quarkonium species with respect to their vacuum binding energies and discuss implications for phenomenology.

The PHENIX Collaboration has previously measured open heavy flavor production via the yields of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. The results indicate a significant suppression of the combined charm and bottom decay electrons for $p_T>5$ GeV/$c$, but by themselves provide little constraint on the modification of the separate parent hadron distributions. The installation of the PHENIX silicon vertex detector in 2011 allowed for the measurement of the displaced vertex of these electrons for the first time at RHIC. In order to separate the contributions from charm and bottom hadrons, Bayesian unfolding techniques can be applied to the $p_T$ and displaced vertex dependence of the yield of electrons from open heavy flavor decays.

Poster Session,poster,Spectral function analysis of the hydrodynamical mode around the QCD critical point with use of functional renormalization group,"Yokota, Takeru","Kyoto University, Japan",Unknown,"One of the unique points of QCD phase diagram is the existence of QCD critical point (CP), which is the end point of the phase boundary of the first-order chiral transition at low temperature. It is noteworthy that the phase transition turns to a second order at the CP, where fluctuations of some physical quantities should be divergent in the system with infinite degrees of freedom. People are thus interested in identifying such physical quantities which divergent behavior can be nicely detectable in experiment. It has been suggested that the soft modes at the QCD CP are hydrodynamical modes such as the baryon density fluctuation (particle-hole excitation) and entropy fluctuation, using RPA analysis of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory [1, 2]. A notable point is that these modes are coupled to the scalar mode or the fluctuating mode of the chiral order parameter at finite chemical potential off the chiral limit. We examine whether this suggestion remain valid even when the thermodynamic fluctuations are fully taken into account. For this purpose, we calculate the spectral function of the collective modes coupled to the scalar mode using functional renormalization group. We employ the quark-meson model and set spatial momentum finite to investigate particle-hole excitations. On the basis of the numerical calculation of the spectral function around the QCD CP, we explore possible development and softening of the collective modes in the space-like as well as the time-like region.

Poster Session,poster,Technique for Performing High Accuracy Forward-Backward Multiplicity Correlation Measurements,"Gulbrandsen, Kristjan",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"Forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements are used to study the soft component of high energy collisions. The observable is sensitive to the dynamics of the collision and is relatively less affected by the following hadronization processes. In proton-proton collisions, forward-backward multiplicity correlation measurements allow one to study the underlying event while, in heavy-ion collisions, they can provide insight into effects such as gluon saturation. 

The measurement requires one to determine the variances of and covariance between the forward and backward multiplicities. Realistic detector effects such as acceptance and efficiency alter the required measured quantities. Exactly how these quantities are altered is neither straightforward nor intuitive compelling one to use Monte Carlo simulations to determine the unaltered values. However, the robustness of using Monte Carlo simulations is difficult to determine as they depend on the initial assumptions.

A Monte Carlo independent technique to determine multiplicity correlation measurements which accounts for acceptance and efficiency is presented here. The goal is to allow one to perform these measurements while minimizing measurement bias and allowing one to exploit the full capability of their detector (full acceptance and largest pseudorapidity separations), where one may otherwise limit the acceptance with a fiducial cut. Larger separations and highest accuracy provide the maximum ability to distinguish between various models implementing different mechanisms for particle production.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kristjan', 'last_name': 'Gulbrandsen', 'fullName': 'Gulbrandsen, Kristjan', 'id': '933888', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '783a504216987a0fd2b56675c12b34ee', 'db_id': 933888, 'person_id': 999316}"

Utilizing this tool requires accurate suppression predictions for different experiments, probes and experimental conditions, and their unbiased comparison with experimental data. With this goal, we developed the dynamical energy loss formalism towards generating predictions for non-central collisions; the formalism takes into account both radiative and collisional energy loss computed within the same theoretical framework, dynamical (as opposed to static) scattering centers, finite magnetic mass, running coupling and uses no free parameters in comparison with experimental data. Within this formalism, we will provide predictions, and a systematic comparison with experimental data, for a diverse set  of suppression data: all available light and heavy flavor probes, lower and high momentum ranges, various centrality ranges and various collision energies at RHIC and LHC. We will also provide clear qualitative and quantitative predictions for the upcoming RHIC and LHC experiments. Comprehensive agreement between our predictions and experimental results provides us with a good deal of confidence that our dynamical energy loss formalism can well explain the jet-medium interactions in QGP, which will be further tested by the obtained predictions for the upcoming data.

Poster Session,poster,Predictions for the upcoming LHC data: an interplay of energy loss and initial disctibutions,"Djordjevic, Marko",University of Belgrade,Unknown,"High momentum hadron suppression is considered to be an excellent probe of jet-medium interactions in QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The dynamical energy loss formalism is shown to be able to accurately explain suppression measurements at 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC and 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [1,2]. With the upcoming LHC measurements at notably higher collision energies, there is a question of what differences, with respect to the current (2.76 TeV) measurements, can be expected. We will concentrate on light and heavy flavor suppression at the upcoming 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb collisions energy at the LHC. Naively, one would expect a notably (∼30% ) larger suppression at 5.1 TeV collision energy, due to the estimated (significant) energy loss increase when transitioning from 2.76 to 5.1 TeV. Surprisingly, more detailed calculations predict nearly the same suppression results at these two energies; note that this prediction is in agreement with the similar suppression patterns observed for light flavor observables at lower beam energies at RHIC and LHC. We will show that this unexpected result is due to interplay of the following two effects [3], which essentially cancel each other: i) flattening of the initial distributions with increasing collision energies, and ii) significantly slower than naively expected increase in the energy loss. Therefore, the obtained nearly the same suppression provides a clear (qualitative and quantitative) test of the dynamical energy loss formalism.

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,Charge-dependent anisotropic flow in Cu+Au collisions,"Niida, Takafumi",Wayne State University,United States,"At the early stages of non-central heavy-ion collisions, a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the reaction plane is created. In asymmetric Cu+Au collisions, due to the difference in the number of spectators, not only the magnetic field but also a strong electric field (E-field) would be created along the reaction plane and pointing from the Au-nucleus to Cu-nucleus. The lifetime of the E-field would be short, of the order of a fraction of a fm/c. The quarks and antiquarks that have been already produced at this time would experience the Coulomb force, which result in charge separation of directed flow. Thus, the measurement of the charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au provides an opportunity to test different quark (charge) scenarios, e.g Pratt’s two-wave quark production, and shed light on the (anti-)quark production mechanism in heavy-ion collisions in general. Understanding the time evolution of the quark densities in heavy-ion collisions is also very important for detailed theoretical predictions of the Chiral Magnetic Effect and Chiral Magnetic Wave, which various experiments are actively searching for.
￼The transverse-momentum dependence of the directed (dipole) flow in Cu+Au collision is also very sensitive to the system initial density gradients in the transverse plane, which can only be observed in symmetric systems as a result of density fluctuations. Measurements of the higher-harmonic flow also allows further study of hydrodynamics and the properties of QGP.
In this talk, the charge-dependent directed flow in Cu+Au collisions at ¥sqrt{s_{NN}} =200 GeV measured in the STAR experiment will be presented. The results are compared with existing model predictions and implications for the dynamics of quarks production and system evolution will be discussed. Higher-harmonic flow will be also presented and compared with A+A collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takafumi', 'last_name': 'Niida', 'fullName': 'Niida, Takafumi', 'id': '933904', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': 'c4073608d1393fe037bedfb7a2ece684', 'db_id': 933904, 'person_id': 999324}"

We also include the collisional energy loss and transverse momentum broadening for both leading and radiated partons of the full jets due to elastic collisions with the medium constituents. We keep track of both the energies and the transverse momenta of all partons within the full jet shower, thus the modification of both jet energy and jet structure due to jet-medium interaction can be studied straightforwardly. Combining with realistic (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculation for the space-time profile of the hot and dense nuclear medium produced in Pb+Pb collisions, we apply our formalism to calculate the nuclear modification of single inclusive jet spectra, and the momentum imbalance of photon-jet and dijet pairs at the LHC. The jet shape function and jet fragmentation function (at the partonic level) are also studied for the quenched/modified jets in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC.

Poster Session,poster,Photon flow harmonics $v_n$ with chemical equilibration and non-ideal gas distribution,"Monnai, Akihiko",RIKEN BNL Research Center,USA,"Elliptic flow $v_2$ of direct photons are found to be larger than those from most hydrodynamic estimations at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is recognized as the ""photon $v_2$ puzzle"". The recent discovery of large triangular flow $v_3$ hints that this is at least partially due to the medium properties. Theoretical explanation of the photon data should be essential for understanding the dynamical properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

We discuss enhancement of direct photon flow harmonics due to (i) quark chemical equilibration [1] and (ii) in-medium corrections to phase-space distributions [2], both of which modify the photon emission rate. The former scenario is motivated by the observation that chemical equilibration can be slower than thermalization in the transition from the gluon-rich color glass condensate to the QGP [3]. In the latter scenario, we consider non-ideal gas distributions using a quasi-particle picture so that they reproduce the equation of state from (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD. Both mechanisms reduce the effective number of degrees of freedom for the quark distribution. This suppresses early photons with smaller anisotropy, leading to larger anisotropy in total direct photons. 

We use a hydrodynamic model to numerically estimate thermal photon $v_2$ and $v_3$ with and without the above effects. The calculations show visible enhancement of the photon flow harmonics. Quadrangular ($v_4$) and pentagonal ($v_5$) flow are also estimated as theoretical guides to quantify possible anomalous enhancement of anisotropy.

Once produced, these photons will not interact strongly with the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions, providing a calibrated measure of the pre-energy loss properties of the opposing parton and giving unique insight into how jets interact with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). To understand the observed modification to jets opposite a direct photon, it is necessary to make similar base-line measurements within a reference system. Previously this was done using p+p collisions, however cold nuclear matter effects may also play a role, making similar baseline measurements in d(p)$+$A important.

Poster Session,poster,Latest developments in anisotropic hydrodynamics,"Tinti, Leonardo",Jan Kochanowski University,Unknown,"In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions nuclear matter is heated to a temperature exceeding that necessary to create a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Traditionally, second order viscous hydrodynamics has been used to reproduce the soft collective flow of the QGP and hadronic spectra; however, due to rapid longitudinal expansion in the early stages of evolution, the system may possess substantial pressure anisotropies which are a consequence of large viscous corrections, even for small shear viscosity over entropy ratios.

These large corrections violate the viscous hydrodynamics assumption of small deviation from local equilibrium. They may lead to unphysical results, and, comparing to the exact 0+1 solutions of the Boltzmann equation, they often badly reproduce the longitudinal pressure (especially for initial stages) and provide the wrong asymptotic behavior.

In order to more accurately treat systems possessing large pressure anisotropies, a new approach called anisotropic hydrodynamics was recently developed. In this approach, the pressure anisotropy is treated in a non perturbative manner at the leading order in the hydrodynamic expansion. In previous works simplifying symmetries were considered in order to extract the leading order of of anisotropic hydrodynamics, like longitudinal boost invariance, or cylindrically symmetric radial expansion. The equations have been extended to the 3+1-dimensional expansion, however in the first attempt it were not possible to fully recover the very good agreement with the exact solutions of the Boltzmann equation. We present the very latest prescription, which is lacking any symmetry constraint on the space-time evolution, it is fully consistent with second order hydrodynamics in the close-to-equilibrum limit, and it is providing an unprecedented agreement with the exact solutions in the 0+1 dimensional expansion, comparing to other leading order prescriptions and second order viscous hydrodynamics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leonardo', 'last_name': 'Tinti', 'fullName': 'Tinti, Leonardo', 'id': '933912', 'affiliation': 'Jan Kochanowski University', 'emailHash': '8dac539203aad13c6fa6ff61c5cad3fd', 'db_id': 933912, 'person_id': 999328}"
Poster Session,poster,Non-perturbative Approach to Open Heavy Flavor in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions,"He, Min",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,Unknown,"We evaluate open heavy-flavor (HF) transport in relativistic heavy-ion 
collisions utilizing a strong-coupling treatment for both macro- and 
micro-dynamics of the problem [1]. The former is realized through a 
hydrodynamic evolution quantitatively constrained by bulk-hadron spectra 
and elliptic flow. The HF transport is based on non-perturbative $T$-matrix
calculations of heavy-light parton scattering in the Quark-Gluon Plasma 
(QGP) [2], yielding a diffusion coefficient consistent with lattice QCD, 
and on effective interactions of $D$-mesons with light hadrons in hadronic 
matter [3]. The $T$-matrix interactions in the QGP lead to resonance 
formation close to $T_c$ which are implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface, providing a seamless treatment of HF interactions throughout the bulk-medium evolution. We deploy this 
framework for a comprehensive study of open HF observables from 
62-2760 GeV [4,5,6]. A fair description of current experimental data for the 
nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of $D$, $D_s$, $B$ mesons and 
HF leptons emerges at low and intermediate transverse momenta $p_T$. Discrepancies arise toward high $p_T$, which allows us to determine the onset of radiative energy loss processes.

Correlations and Fluctuations I,parallel,Nonlinear hydrodynamic response confronts LHC data,"Yan, Li",CNRS,Unknown,"Higher-order harmonics of anisotropic flow ($v_n$ with $n\ge 4$) can

with respect to the $v_2$ plane.
We show that one can scale these measurements by quantities involving
lower-order harmonics in such a way that the
ratio is independent of initial conditions, and solely involves the
medium nonlinear response.
The resulting ratios allow to directly confront hydrodynamics with
experimental data [1].

We construct four independent such ratios involving $v_4$, $v_5$ and
$v_6$ and extract their values from LHC data on Pb+Pb collisions, as a
function of centrality.
We then calculate these ratios using single-shot hydrodynamics and
using the transport model AMPT [2].
Model calculations are in very good agreement with data.
We point out that hydrodynamics predicts simple scaling relations
between these response coefficients, which can be read off directly from
data.

A substantial response ratio in the seventh harmonic is found
in theoretical calculations (both in AMPT and in hydrodynamics), from
which we argue that a nonzero $v_7$ signal should be seen when
measured with respect to elliptic and triangular flow. We present
predictions for $v_7$ versus centrality in Pb+Pb collisions at the
LHC.

Finally, we point out that combined measurements of higher-order
harmonics with their own plane and with respect to lower-order planes
can  be quantitatively related to
event-plane correlations. As an illustration, we show that CMS data on

Poster Session,poster,Systematic searches for the chiral magnetic effect and chiral vortical effect using identified particles at RHIC/STAR,"Wen, Liwen",UCLA,Unknown,"QCD allows for chirality imbalance as a consequence of the vacuum transition$[1]$.  When coupled with the strong magnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions, the chirality imbalance in local domains can lead to electric charge separation along the magnetic field direction, manifested as the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, an analogous effect, the chiral vortical effect(CVE)$[2]$ was also theorized, in which the vorticity of the collision system replaces the magnetic field, and a baryonic charge separation appears instead of the electric charge separation. This would result in a distinct hierarchy in the particle dependent correlation magnitudes: $proton-K_s^0$ (no CME/CVE), $proton-\pi^{\pm}$ (CME only), $proton-\Lambda$ (dominated by CVE), and $proton-proton$ (both CME and CVE). In order to explore this physics, we report correlation measurements for these identified particle pairs in Au+Au at 200GeV with the STAR detector.

Suppression of $\Upsilon$ states is expected at a sufficiently high temperature in the QGP and can be measured using the nuclear modification factor $\mbox{$R_{\textit{AA}}$}$. Measurements of $p_{T}$ spectra for separate $\Upsilon$ states in $\mbox{${\it p}+{\it p}$}$ collisions provide constraints for models of the quarkonium production, which is an important factor in the interpretation of the heavy-ion results. In addition, high quality data from $\mbox{${\it p}+{\it p}$}$ collisions at $\mbox{$\sqrt{s}=500\:\mathrm{GeV}$}$ can be used as a baseline for $\mbox{$R_{\textit{AA}}$}$ as a function of $p_{T}$ in $\mbox{${\it Au}+{\it Au}$}$ collisions at $\mbox{$\sqrt{s}=200\:\mathrm{GeV}$}$, after rescaling to lower energy. Also, studies of ratios of $\Upsilon$ states as a function of event multiplicity may help better understand the interactions with hadronic co-movers, because the higher states have larger geometrical sizes and thus should have larger cross section for such interactions compared to $\Upsilon(1S)$.

The silicon vertex tracker upgrade (VTX) will be used to reject this background allowing the measurement of the charged hadron spectrum out to a significantly higher momentum.

Poster Session,poster,Towards a Unified Picture of Jet Modifications in the QGP Using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory,"Chien, Yang-Ting",Los Alamos National Laboratory,USA,"Theoretical investigations and experimental measurements of jet substructure modifications in heavy ion collisions allow us to disentangle cold nuclear matter effects and jet-medium interactions in the quark-gluon plasma, providing a direct probe of the QGP properties. Precision calculations of jet substructure observables will thus become the key to extracting the medium properties. Jet shapes and jet fragmentation functions give the transverse and longitudinal energy profiles inside jets and are sensitive to the jet formation mechanism in the medium. In this talk we will demonstrate the resummation of jet shapes at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory. This is the first time phase space logarithms in this observable are resummed using renormalization group techniques. We will then present the calculation of jet shape modification in heavy ion collisions caused by Glauber gluon interactions in the background QGP medium. The study of jet shape modification is closely related to the calculation of jet energy loss. Taken together, these observables provide a comprehensive description of the energy distribution of the in-medium parton shower. We will show first results for the modifications of jets beyond the soft gluon emission limit for 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and present predictions for the 5.1 TeV Pb+Pb run.

Consistent and analytically verifiable numerical solutions are critical for phenomenological studies of the collective behavior of QGP in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. A novel analytical solution based on the conformal Gubser flow which is a boost-invariant solution with transverse fluid velocity is presented. Due to the non-linear nature of the equation, the analytical solution is non-perturbative and exhibits features that are rather distinct from solutions to usual linear hydrodynamic equations. It is used to verify with high precision the numerical solution with a newly developed state-of-the-art (3+1)-dimensional second-order viscous hydro code (CLVisc). The perfect agreement between the analytical and numerical solutions demonstrates the reliability of the numerical simulations with the second-order viscous corrections.

Open Heavy Flavors and Strangeness IV,parallel,Heavy quark suppression and D-hadron (D-D) correlations in heavy-ion collisions,"Cao, Shanshan",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,USA,"Heavy quarks are valuable probes of the dense nuclear matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a comprehensive framework that describes their entire temporal evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadron gas. The dynamics of open heavy quarks in the QGP is described using either an improved Langevin approach [1,2] or a linearized Boltzmann approach [3] that both simultaneously incorporate the quasi-elastic scattering and medium-induced gluon radiation processes. The hadronization of heavy quarks into their mesonic bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid model of fragmentation plus heavy-light quark coalescence [1,2]. And the final rescatterings of heavy hadrons inside the hadron gas are described using the UrQMD model. 

Within this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; and the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate $p_\rm{T}$. Our numerical results provide a good description of the $R_\rm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of both $D$ meson and $B$-decay non-prompt $J/\psi$ measured at RHIC and LHC. 

In addition, two-particle correlation functions of heavy flavor are explored [4]. We show that while the nuclear modification of the $p_\rm{T}$ imbalance of $D-\bar{D}$ pairs reflects the total energy loss of heavy quarks, their angular correlations are sensitive to the detailed energy loss mechanisms. $D$-hadron correlations are also calculated and shown to be a potential observable quantifying the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles.

The resulting centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, and flow coefficients from this pQCD + saturation + hydro (""EKRT"") framework are then compared simultaneously to the LHC and RHIC measurements. We also show that the computed probability distributions of relative event-by-event fluctuations of the flow coefficients, that mostly constrain the initial conditions, match well with the LHC measurements.  With such a systematic multi-energy and multi-observable analysis we can test the initial state calculation and applicability of hydrodynamics, and also constrain the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity-to-entropy ratio of QCD matter in its different phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that correlations of two and three event-plane angles provide additional constraints to the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity. As shown in [3], we can describe all these different flow coefficients and correlations remarkably consistently with the shear viscosity that is independent of the collision energy. Using these constraints from the current RHIC and LHC measurements we then predict the charged hadron multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra, flow coefficients and event-plane correlations for the forthcoming 5 ATeV Pb+Pb collisions.

Correlations and Fluctuations III,parallel,Observable consequences of event-by-event fluctuations of HBT radii,"Plumberg, Christopher",The Ohio State University,USA,"One of the major lessons from the field of heavy-ion physics in the past several years has been the significance of the role played by event-by-event fluctuations in the evolution of a heavy-ion collision.  Their important effects on many momentum-space observables (particle yields and spectra, anisotropic flows, etc.) have already been studied systematically, and some of the properties of their event-by-event distributions, and their consequences for the extraction of medium properties such as the specific viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), are already known.

In this talk it is pointed out that similar event-by-event fluctuations of spatiotemporal observables provide complementary constraints on our understanding of the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions. The relation of Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) radii extracted from ensemble-averaged correlation function measurements to the mean of their event-by-event probability distribution is clarified, and a method to experimentally determine the mean and variance of this distribution is proposed and demonstrated using an ensemble of fluctuating events generated with the viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. The sensitivity of the mean and variance of the HBT radii to the specific QGP shear viscosity $\eta/s$ is studied using simulations with the same code. We report sensitivity of the mean pion HBT radii and their variances to the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ near the quark-hadron transition at a level similar (10-20%) to that which was previously observed for elliptic and quadrangular flow of charged hadrons.

Between the many predictions about signals to detect the phase transition point: fluctuations [1], hydrodynamics [2], baryon-baryon correlations [3], etc., in our previous studies [4-5] we found as an interesting tool for the analysis of relativistic nuclear collisions: the “nuclear matter jets”. Having a non- partonic origin, the number of jets indicates the centrality of the collision, i.e. the amount of incident energy pumped into the system, and the jet-kinematic and dynamic properties allowed us to make assumptions about their origin. A liquid-gas nuclear phase transition was indicated by the disappearance of jets. At CBM energies, varying the projectile mass, we intend to study the evolution of the number and characteristics of nuclear matter jets when passing from the small projectile (p+Au) whose energy is converted into thermal energy leading to mutifragmentation, to a symmetric projectile (Au+Au) when flow is unleashed. For this, we made jetology studies on UrQMD and AMPT simulations (performed at the computing system YaPT from “Nuclear Matter in Extreme Conditions” Research Center – Faculty of Physics, Bucharest University)in the 4-25 A GeV incident energies range. We will extract the usefulness of the “nuclear matter jets” variable for relativistic nuclear collisions.

Blaise Pascal Clermont-Fe. II (FR)",France,"The LHC heavy-ion physics program aims at investigating the properties of QCD matter at extremely large temperature and energy density, where the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are regarded as efficient probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a very short time scale in initial hard scattering processes and subsequently interact with the medium.

At high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), heavy-flavour yields are suppressed due to in-medium parton energy loss. This suppression is quantified by the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of the particle yield measured in Pb-Pb collisions to the cross section in pp collisions scaled with the average nuclear overlap function.

At low $p_{\rm T}$ the heavy-flavour azimuthal anisotropy provides insight into whether heavy quarks participate in the collective expansion of the medium, and at high $p_{\rm T}$ it carries information on the path-length dependence of parton energy loss.
The heavy-flavour azimuthal anisotropy is quantified via the measurement of the second order coefficient ($v_2$) of the Fourier expansion of particle azimuthal distributions, also called elliptic flow.

With ALICE, designed and optimised for the study of heavy-ion physics, we can measure open heavy flavours at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y< 4$)
via their muonic decays. The latest results on the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zuman', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Zuman', 'id': '934003', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University CCNU (CN), Univ.

They are primarily produced in hard scattering processes in the early stage of the collision, after which they experience the full evolution of the system. Previous measurements have shown that the production of prompt D mesons in central Pb--Pb collisions is strongly suppressed in comparison to binary-scaled pp collisions. This suppression may be interpreted as an energy loss of the heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium due to collisional and radiative processes. To obtain a more complete picture on the Pb--Pb results, an understanding of cold nuclear matter effects in the initial and final state such as modification of parton densities in nuclei, $k_{\rm T}$ broadening and energy loss in cold nuclear matter, is required. These effects are accessible in p--Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of D meson$-$charged particle azimuthal angular correlations in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Rajput, Sonia",University of Jammu (IN),India,"A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a general purpose heavy-ion experiment with the main goal of exploring the characteristics of the medium formed in high-energy nuclear collisions, composed of deconfined and strongly-interacting quarks and gluons (Quark-Gluon Plasma, QGP). Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are produced in the initial hard scatterings and interact with the medium constituents throughout its whole evolution. Therefore, they serve as sensitive probes to study the properties of the medium. 

The study of the angular correlation between D mesons and charged particles can provide relevant information on the processes by which heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and help to spot possible modifications of the charm parton shower and hadronisation induced by the presence of the medium. The measurement of this observable in pp collisions, besides furnishing the necessary reference for future Pb$-$Pb studies, is interesting to study the  fragmentation of charm quarks as well as their production mechanism providing a testing ground for perturbative QCD calculations. Data from p$-$Pb collisions are important to constrain possible modifications of the angular correlation pattern that could be induced by cold nuclear matter effects in the initial and final state of the nuclear collision.

In this contribution, we present the results of the measurement of azimuthal correlations between D mesons and charged particles using the data collected with ALICE in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. They are compared to the results obtained in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. D mesons were reconstructed from their hadronic decays at central rapidity ($|y| <$ 0.5) in the transverse momentum range 3 $<$ $p_{\rm T}(\rm D)$ $<$ 16 GeV/$c$ and were correlated with charged hadrons reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| <$ 0.8.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sonia', 'last_name': 'Rajput', 'fullName': 'Rajput, Sonia', 'id': '934005', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu (IN)', 'emailHash': '413609f7c3075230e89af95ef7e715f8', 'db_id': 934005, 'person_id': 999372}"
Poster Session,poster,Spontaneous magnetization of quark matter in the inhomogeneous chiral phase,"Yoshiike, Ryo",Kyoto university,Unknown,"Recently, a possible appearance of the inhomogeneous chiral phase has been extensionly studied by the use of the effective models of QCD like the NJL models. Here, we study the magnetic properties of the inhomogeneous chiral phase, taking the contribution of “dual chiral density wave (DCDW)” [1], where both scalar and pseudoscalar condensates are spatially modulated. We study the response of quark matter to a tiny external magnetic field to show the spontaneous magnetization in the DCDW phase. In an external magnetic field, the energy spectrum of quarks becomes asymmetric about zero in the lowest Landau level [2], and it gives rise to chiral anomaly [3].
   We find that this spectral asymmetry also gives rise to the spontaneous magnetization, since a new term linearly proportional to the magnetic field is induced in the thermodynamic potential. Furthermore, this spontaneous magnetization includes not only the contribution of chiral anomaly [4] but also one of valence quarks. Such spontaneous magnetization might be a candidate of the origin of the strong magnetic field in neutron stars.
   We also show the peculiar behavior of magnetic susceptibility at the ferromagnetic transition point: it never diverges unlike the usual ferromagnetic transition, which suggested a different mechanism of spontaneous magnetization from spin alignment.

Therefore, measurements of jets containing heavy-flavour hadrons can shed light on underlying QCD dynamics. Measurements of inclusive heavy-flavour cross sections do not allow to distinguish between different production mechanisms of heavy quarks (pair production, gluon splitting and flavour excitation). More exclusive studies using dijet events might provide further insight on the relevant production mechanisms.

Photons and neutral mesons ($\pi^{0}$, $\eta$, $\omega$) are reconstructed via complementary methods, using the ALICE electromagnetic calorimeters, PHOS and EMCal, and by the central tracking system, identifying photons converted into $e^+e^-$ pairs in the material of the inner barrel detectors (TPC and ITS).  Prompt direct photons produced in Compton ($q+g \rightarrow \gamma+q$) and annihilation ($q+\bar{q} \rightarrow \gamma+g$) processes can be identified in the EMCal calorimeter combining two techniques: electromagnetic shower shape analysis; and isolation cut analysis (no other particle production along the photon direction in the hard process), making use of the measured particle activity in the EMCal and in reconstructed tracks close to the prompt photon candidate. These methods are efficient in getting rid of photons from neutral meson decays ($\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$), dominant at high-energy collisions produced at LHC.

Measurements of isolated photons and neutral meson spectra in pp collisions provide valuable data for pQCD calculations and allow us to study scaling properties of hadron production at LHC energies and to constrain the proton parton distribution function.  ALICE measured the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ for the $\pi^{0}$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV at different collision centralities showing a clear pattern of strong suppression in a hot QCD medium with respect to $pp$ collisions.

In this work, we present the current status and strategy for the measurement of the elliptic flow of neutral pions in mid and high pT range in Pb + Pb collisions at ALICE with Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal)[1].

Both photons and jets are excellent probes of QGP. Photons are produced during the different stages of the expansion of the initial hot matter fireball. They do not interact strongly with the medium and passing through it, they carry information on the properties of the matter at the space-time point of their emission. The direct photons are formed at the early stage of the collision in two processes: annihilation ($q \bar{q} \to g \gamma$) and Compton scattering ($qg \to q\gamma$). They enable a test of perturbative QCD constraining parton distributions and fragmentation functions. Moreover, they estimate the energy of correlated back-to-back jet.

A parton formed in the hard scattering at the early stage of the collision lose the energy when traversing the hot and dense matter and then fragments into a spray of particles called jet. Modification of the jet structure in medium compared to vacuum can provide hints to the properties of QGP.

Both direct photons and jets have been measured by the ALICE experiment at LHC. However, back-to-back correlation between photon and reconstructed jet in the ALICE experiment can be observed only with large statistics available in Run 2 due to the relatively small cross-section.

These results pose the fundamental question of how small a system can exhibit thermalized behavior.

We show that the approach correctly predicts the evolution of the $p_T$ spectra from RHIC to LHC energy and in particular the baryon-to-meson ratios $p/\pi, \bar p/\pi, \Lambda/K$ that reach a peak  value of the order of unit at $p_T \sim 3$ GeV, while  $p/\phi $ remains nearly constant showing the mass against the quark number effect in the coalescence process.
Recombination of minijet partons with the partons from the QGP is also included and plays a

The more recent availability of experimental data up to $p_T \sim 10$ GeV for the spectra as well as for  $p/\pi$, $\bar p/\pi$, $\Lambda/K$ ratios allows to spot some lack of yield in a limited $p_T$ range around 6 GeV.
Finally, we discuss also the origin of a significant breaking of the quark number scaling of the elliptic flow $v_2$.

Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing collective behavior and particle spectra, there are still theoretical shortcomings that may question the validity of the approach in heavy-ion experiments conditions. Large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion produce very large pressure corrections, in contrast to the founding hypothesis of small deviation from local equilibrium and the perturbative treatment viscous corrections. One way to address this problem is anisotropic hydrodynamics. Most of the theoretical investigations about hydrodynamics started from a kinetic underlying substrate of a single species of particles. Unfortunately the striking agreement of anisotropic hydrodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation was not preserved in the case of a mixtures of quarks and gluons.
We recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics prescription for massless particles in 1+1-dimensions to the case of mixtures of fluids, largely improving the agreement with the exact solutions compared to previous works [1-3]. We allow quarks and gluons to have different momentum scales during the evolution and a non vanishing baryon chemical potential. We take the dynamical equations from the zeroth, the first and the second moment of the Boltzmann equation [4]. We performed a test of the new formulation, comparing the results of anisotropic hydorodynamics with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for a mixture of fluid in the Bjorken flow limit, finding a very good agreement [5].

Poster Session,poster,Chiral magnetohydrodynamics from quantum field theory,"Hongo, Masaru",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamics is a low-energy effective theory which describes a long-distance and long-time behavior of many-body systems. It has been recently pointed out that quantum anomalies affect macroscopic transport properties and generate novel anomaly-induced transports. One example is the chiral magnetic effect, which represents the existence of a dissipationless vector current along the magnetic field and is expected to occur in heavy-ion collisions.

For the description of the anomaly-induced transport in the QGP, we have established formalism, so-called anomalous hydrodynamics, that captures effects of quantum anomalies. Since the QGP consists of electrically charged particles, it is necessary to consider a back reaction to electromagnetic fields in order to describe the space-time evolution of them together with that of the QGP. However, in the conventional anomalous hydrodynamics, electromagnetic fields are treated as external ones and the back reaction is neglected. Moreover, the magnitude of magnetic fields is assumed to be small. Therefore, we need to construct chiral magnetohydrodynamics in the strong magnetic field in order to assess the contribution from anomalous transports.

In this study, considering the recent development of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamics under strong magnetic fields from the underlying microscopic theory, that is, the quantum field theory. In order to derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation, we use a solid basis in our previous study on the derivation of the first-order hydrodynamics [1], in which we assume that the local Gibbs distribution is realized at initial time. As a result, we derive the chiral magnetohydrodynamic equation with the the field theoretical expression of Green-Kubo formulas for the all transport coefficients.

One of the main results of heavy ions collision at relativistic energy experiments is the  very small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, close to the conjectured lower bound eta/s=1/4\pi for systems in the infinite coupling limit. Another key transport coefficient, but less studied than shear viscosity, is the electric conductivity that represents the response of a system to an applied external electric field.
In heavy Ion Collisions very high electromagnetic fields are expected to be generated with a decay time depending on the value of the electric conductivity and their impact on pressure isotropization depending on the \eta/s of the plasma.

We discuss the connection between shear viscosity and electric conductivity and explain why the ratio $(\eta/s)/(\sigma_{el}/T)$ supplies a measure of the quark to gluon scattering rates whose knowledge would allow to significantly advance in the understanding of the QGP phase.
We also predict that the ratio should increase near the critical temperature contrary to the flat behaviour predicted by  a conformal theory.
We show that $(\eta/s)/(\sigma_{el}/T)$, independently on the running coupling $\alpha_s(T)$, 
should increase up to about $\sim 20$ for $T \rightarrow T_c$, while it goes down to a nearly flat behavior around $\simeq 4$ for $T \geq 4\, T_c$.
Therefore we in general predict a stronger T dependence of $\sigma_{el}/T$ with respect to $\eta/s$ as $T\to T_c$.

Poster Session,poster,Charmonium suppression in QGP at LHC energy using temperature dependent formation time,"Mishra, Madhukar","Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Pilani Campus",Unknown,"The charmonium wavefunction is expected to expand with the temperature of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in the heavy-ion collision experiments. We model the effect of this expansion on the formation time of the charmonium bound states and eventually, the effect of this temperature dependent formation time on the $J/\psi$ suppression in the QGP medium. The effect of charm quark and anti-charm quark via recombination to form secondary charmonium states is also incorporated in the present work. A set of coupled rate equations is established which incorporates color screening, gluonic dissociation, collisional damping and recombination of uncorrelated $c$ and $\bar{c}$ pair in the QGP medium. The effect of light quarks is also evaluated. Shadowing as a cold nuclear matter (CNM) effect is also incorporated in the current work. The final $J/\psi$ suppression, thus determined as a function of centrality, is compared with the ALICE (low $p_T$) experimental data at both, mid rapidity and forward rapidity and CMS (high $p_T$) experimental data at mid rapidity obtained from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at center-of-mass energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV. We find that our predicted result on suppression depicts reasonably good agreement with the data. We also find that contribution of color screening in determining the total suppression of $J/\psi$ in QGP medium becomes insignificant due to employing temperature dependent formation time.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Madhukar', 'last_name': 'Mishra', 'fullName': 'Mishra, Madhukar', 'id': '934115', 'affiliation': 'Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani, Pilani Campus', 'emailHash': 'd70bdbc3ec5026bafcd91fe5240995b2', 'db_id': 934115, 'person_id': 999418}"

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium I,parallel,Initial state azimuthal anisotropies in small collision systems,"Lappi, Tuomas",University of Jyvaskyla,Unknown,"Recent experimental results have revealed a surprisingly rich structure of  multiparticle azimuthal correlations in high energy proton-nucleus collisions. Final state collective effects can be responsible for many of the observed effects, but it has recently been shown that a part of these correlations are present already in the wavefunctions of the colliding particles. A domain structure at length scales of the inverse saturation scale, present in the classical color field of a high energy nucleus, naturally leads to such multiparticle correlations. This talk discusses recent work on azimuthal anisotropy coefficients originating from the initial stage color fields. In particular, we describe a recent calculation [1] of the momentum space 2-particle cumulant azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v_n{2}, n=2,3,4 from fundamental representation Wilson line distributions describing the high energy nucleus. These would correspond to the flow coefficients in very forward proton-nucleus scattering. This calculation finds significant differences between Wilson lines from the MV model and from JIMWLK evolution. The talk also discusses the relation [2] of this calculation to earlier work on the ridge correlation obtained in  the ""glasma graph"" approximation [3], and to the ""field domain model"" [4] where the correlations would originate from a novel nongaussian fluctuation structure in the nuclear color field.

the relativistic quantum molecular dynamics.
Specifically, we use the JAM transport model with potentials.
Our approach reproduces the rapidity dependence of directed flow data up to

However, the slopes of $dv_1/dy$ at mid-rapidity are positive
at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.7$ and 19.6 GeV, and becomes negative above 27 GeV.
Thus the result from a JAM hadronic transport model with nuclear mean-field approach is incompatible with the data.

Poster Session,poster,Nucleon-nucleon interactions within an extended linear sigma model,"Teilab, Khaled",Goethe-University Frankfurt,Unknown,"In the intermediate- and low-energy regime, hadrons (instead of quarks and gluons) are the relevant degrees of freedom. Their masses and interactions can be well described by effective approaches to QCD. The extended linear sigma model is an effective model based on chiral and dilatation symmetries (together with their explicit as well as spontaneous breaking). It includes (axial-) vector mesons in addition to (pseudo-) scalar ones, which turns out to be very successful in describing the mass spectrum and decay widths of mesons up to 1.7 GeV [1,2].

Moreover, including two baryon doublets in the so-called mirror assignment as suggested in [3] allows for introducing a chirally invariant mass term for baryons as well as the interaction with a low-mass four-quark field, related to the resonance $f_0$(500). Thus, the mass of the nucleon arises not solely from the chiral condensate, but also from the four-quark condensate [4,5,6].

The model has been used to describe elastic nucleon-nucleon collisions as well as inelastic nucleon-nucleon interactions involving the production of mesons and electromagnetic radiation. A comparison of the theoretical results with experimental data will be shown.

Poster Session,poster,Simulation studies of beauty-jet tagging in p--Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE,"Corrales Morales, Yasser",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are predominantly produced via initial hard parton scatterings in the early stages of hadronic collisions. Thus, they are ideal probes 
of the QCD matter since they lose energy by means of elastic scatterings and radiative 
processes while propagating through the strongly-interacting medium created in 
high-energy heavy-ion collisions. According to theoretical models, the parton energy 
loss is colour charge and parton mass dependent. In particular, it is expected that 
beauty quarks lose less energy than charm and light quarks. These dependencies can be 
studied by comparing the nuclear modification factor of beauty jets with that of charm 
or light-parton jets. The measurement of beauty-jet production in p-Pb collisions is 
needed to quantify cold nuclear matter effects, a fundamental step for the 
interpretation of Pb-Pb results.
 
  In this poster we present Monte Carlo based performance studies of beauty-jet 
tagging via displaced secondary vertex reconstruction, obtained with ALICE for p-Pb 
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The tagging technique, its

Poster Session,poster,The curvature of the chiral phase transition line at small values of the quark chemical potentials,"Hegde, Prasad",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"One of the goals of the ongoing Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC is to look for evidence of the conjectured QCD Critical Point. The feasibility of detecting the critical point however depends on how close the QCD chiral phase transition line is to the freeze-out curve. In the two-flavor chiral limit, this transition is expected to be second-order at zero and  small values of $\mu$, the quark chemical potential. The critical temperature $T_c$ however, tends to decrease as $\mu$ is increased; this shift is characterized, for small values of $\mu$, by the curvature of the transition line $\kappa$. 

While the current lattice QCD results [1-5] on the curvature are significantly smaller than the phenomenological parametrization of the freeze-out line given by Cleymans and Redlich [6], it must be noted that they differ by more than a factor of two among themselves. In this talk, we will present an upper bound for the light and strange curvatures $\kappa_q$ through extrapolation to the chiral limit. We work in 2+1-flavor QCD and with five different pion masses between 80 MeV $\leq m_\pi \leq$ 160 MeV. Our new results improve on our earlier result [1], both by working at a smaller lattice spacing and through the use of the HISQ action, which has considerably smaller cutoff effects than the actions that were previously used.

The mass spectra of vector mesons are theoretically connected to qbar-q contents of a QCD medium. Even in nucleus matter, modifications of vector mesons are predicted[1].
The KEK-PS E325 experiment was performed to study mass properties of vector mesons and partial chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear medium. The KEK experiment measure mass spectra of phi mesons using electron-positron decays. The experiment reports significant mass modification in nucleus[2]. New experiment is being prepared at J-PARC to continue this measurement. In this presentation, details of new experiment are presented. 
A new beam line is under construction at the Hadron Experimental Facility of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) to perform the experiment. A new beam line delivers a primary 30 GeV proton beam and intensities of the beam is 10^10 Hz. 
The first experiment using the beam line is under preparation. The experiment will measure mass spectra of vector mesons in nucleus with 100 times larger statistics than the KEK-PS E325 experiment. The new experiment aims to confirm results of the previous KEK experiment and have a large statistics to discuss more details. The new experiment uses new detector techniques, such as a GEM tracker and a Hadron Blind Detector, to achieve such a large statistics.

Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium II,parallel,The influence of pre-equilibrium dynamics on heavy-ion collision observables,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,USA,"In order to bracket the importance of the pre-equilibrium stage on relativistic heavy-ion collision observables at RHIC and LHC energies, we compare simulations in which the pre-equilibrium stage is modeled by free-streaming partons with others where it is modeled fluid dynamically. The first (second) case implements the assumption of extremely weak (strong) coupling in the initial collision stage. We introduce a switching time parameter for the duration of the weakly coupled stage; after this time the system is assumed to stay in the strongly coupled hydrodynamic stage (with a specific shear viscosity that we can vary) until freeze-out. Based on event-by-event simulations of fluctuating initial conditions, we first study observables (radial, elliptic and triangular flow) systematically as a function of the switching time from free-streaming to viscous hydrodynamics (""thermalization time""), leaving other parameters fixed. We then perform a three-dimensional simultaneous parameter fit of the switching time, specific shear viscosity and freeze-out temperature by comparing the numerical results with a set of 5 experimental observables, for four different types of initial conditions. We find that the strongest constraint on the thermalization time does not come of anisotropic flow measurements, as previously thought, but from the mean transverse momentum of hadrons with different masses (i.e. radial flow). First results from a campaign that includes bulk viscous effect and a hadronic afterburner to describe the freeze-out stage, with particular focus on the mass-ordering of the elliptic and triangular flow for protons and Lambda hyperons which is incorrectly described by VISHNU without pre-equilibrium flow, will also be shown.

Poster Session,poster,CP violation in $B^0$ and $\bar B^0$ decay and the flavor-tagged Δt distributions,"Furui, Sadataka","Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Teikyo University",Unknown,"The BABAR experiment shows that the flavor-tagged Δt distribution of $B^0\to J/\Psi K^0_L$ agrees with the theoretical prediction, but that of $\bar B^0\to J/\Psi \bar K^0$ shows discrepancy at large |Δt| region[1]. 
The difference could appear from the presence of tree diagrams of $\bar B^0\to \bar K^0_L J/\Psi$ but absence corresponding tree diagram of $B^0\to K^0_L J/\Psi$, in the Cartan's supersymmetry[2].

The tree diagram could contain retarded time effect before $J/\Psi$ creation during propagation of the W boson.
The model can be extended to the decay of $B^0\to K^+\pi^-$ and $\bar B^0\to K^-\pi^+$[3], and $B^0\to D^{*-}X\ell^+\nu$[4]. 

The $Z_3$ symmetry of leptons and quarks[5] suggests that CP violation effects 
in the $B^0\to D^{*-}X\ell^+\nu$ cannot be detected by our electromagnetic detectors.

Possibility of detecting the retarded time effect by rapidly moving the detector[6] will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Fluctuation-induced effects in inhomogeneous chiral phases,"Karasawa, Shintaro",Kyoto university,Unknown,"We discuss the effect of fluctuations for the inhomogeneous chiral phase in the thermodynamics of QCD.

Inhomogeneous chiral phase is characterized by the spatially modulated chiral condensate, $M(z) = -2G ( \langle \bar{q} q \rangle +i \langle \bar{q} i \gamma_{5} \tau_{3} q \rangle ) =m(z) e^{i \theta(z)}$.
There are two typical types of condensates.
One is called real kink crystal (RKC), which is modulated only in the amplitude; $M(z)=m(z)$[1].
The other one is called dual chiral density wave (DCDW), which is modulated only in the phase; $M(z)=me^{i\theta(z)}$[2].
Here, we concentrate on the analysis for sinusoidal condensate.

Within the mean field approximation, it is known that there appears the inhomogeneous phase between the homogeneously broken and the normal phases in QCD phase diagram.
Both RKC and DCDW have characteristic behavior: there is the second order phase transition line between inhomogeneous and chiral restored phases.

If we consider the fluctuation effects, this behavior is remarkably changed.
Brazovskii has shown that the thermal fluctuation effect changes the order of phase transition between the inhomogeneous and normal phases [3].
Dyugaev has also shown that the quantum fluctuation induces similar effect [4].
Here, we develop these works and apply to the inhomogeneous chiral condensate: we consider both the thermal and quantum fluctuations.

As a result, we show the effects of the quantum and thermal fluctuations change the order of the phase transition.
Also we show that these effects disfavor the inhomogeneous condensate, the region of the inhomogeneous phase in QCD phase diagram is decreased.

Jets and High pT Hadrons IV,parallel,Jet suppression and the flavor dependence of partonic energy loss with ATLAS,"Kosek, Tomas",Charles University (CZ),CZ,"In relativistic heavy ion collisions, a hot medium with a high density of unscreened color charges is produced. One manifestation of the energy loss of jets propagating through the medium is a lower yield of jets emerging from the medium than  expected in the absence of medium effects. Therefore modifications of the jet yield are directly sensitive to the energy loss mechanism. Furthermore, jets with different  flavor content are expected to be affected by the medium in different ways. Parton showers initiated by quarks tend to have fewer fragments carrying a larger fraction of  the total jet energy than those resulting from gluons. Jets containing heavy quarks may lose less energy as the large quark mass suppresses the amount of medium-induced  radiation. This would lead to different relative contributions of inelastic and elastic energy loss. In this talk, the latest ATLAS results on single jet suppression will  be presented. Measurements of the nuclear modification factor, RAA, for fully reconstructed jets are shown. The rapidity dependence of jet suppression is discussed, which  is sensitive to the relative energy loss between quark and gluon jets. New measurements of single hadron suppression out to pT~150 GeV are also presented, which provide  complementary information to the jet suppression measurements. Finally, a new measurement of the RAA for b-tagged jets is presented. At low b-jet pT, the role of the  heavy quark mass is expected to be maximal and b-jets are dominated by hard scattering processes where the b quark carries most of the momentum. As the jet pT increases,  the flavor dependence of the energy loss is expected to be reduced and a significant contribution to b quark production develops from gluon splitting in the parton shower.  This measurement covers a kinematic range including both regimes and the interplay between the various effects is discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomas', 'last_name': 'Kosek', 'fullName': 'Kosek, Tomas', 'id': '934163', 'affiliation': 'Charles University (CZ)', 'emailHash': '5638f8d678265a695ebd21a9e4519f77', 'db_id': 934163, 'person_id': 999445}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of W and Z-boson production in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Zhu, Jianhui",Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN),China,"The high collision energies available at the LHC allow for an abundant production of hard probes, such as quarkonia, high-$p_{\rm T}$ jets and vector bosons (W, Z). The latter are produced in initial hard parton scattering processes and they decay before the formation of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is a deconfined phase of QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, their leptonic decay products do not interact strongly with the QGP. The electroweak boson introduces a way for benchmarking in-medium modifications to coloured probes. In Pb--Pb and p--Pb collisions, precise measurements of W and Z-boson production can constrain the Nuclear Parton Distribution Functions (nPDFs), which could be modified with respect to the nucleon due to shadowing or gluon saturation, and they can be used to test the scaling of hard particle production with the number of binary nucleon--nucleon collisions. Especially in p--Pb collisions, the measurement of W yields at forward and backward rapidity allows us to probe the modification of nPDFs at small and large Bjorken-$x$, respectively. Such measurements can be benchmarked in pp collisions, where W and Z-boson production is theoretically known with good precision. Also, the charge asymmetry of leptons from W-boson decays is a sensitive probe of up and down quark densities in a nucleon inside a nucleus.

The production of W and Z bosons in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV is measured with the ALICE muon spectrometer via the inclusive $p_{\rm T}$-differential muon yield and the invariant mass of opposite-sign muon pairs, respectively. The rapidity coverage of the muon spectrometer is -4.46 $< y^\mu_{\rm cms} <$ -2.96 and 2.03 $< y^\mu_{\rm cms} <$ 3.53, which is complementary to the one of ATLAS and CMS.

Poster Session,poster,Photon production from gluon mediated quark-anti-quark annihilation prior to hadronization,"Campbell, Sarah",Columbia University,USA,"Heavy ion collisions produce direct photons at low transverse momentum, $p_{T}$ from 1-3 GeV/c, in excess of the $p$+$p$ spectra scaled by the nuclear overlap factor, $T_{AA}$.  These low $p_{T}$ photons have a large azimuthal anisotropy, $v_{2}$, suggesting late-stage production.  Theoretical models, including hydrodynamic models, struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large low $p_{T}$ direct photon excess and $v_{2}$.  This talk investigates increased photon production as the system becomes color neutral from soft-gluon mediated $q$-$\bar{q}$ interactions in a process analogous to coalescence.  This production mechanism will generate photons that follow constituent quark number, $n_{q}$, scaling of $v_{2}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of two for direct photons.  A $\chi^{2}$ comparisons of the published direct photon and identified particle $v_{2}$ measurements and a coalescence-like Monte Carlo is used to test this description.  The $\chi^{2}$ comparison finds that $n_{q}$-scaling applied to the direct photon $v_{2}$ data prefers the value $n_{q}=1.8$ and agrees with $n_{q}=2$ within errors in most cases.  The coalescence-like Monte Carlo simulation calculates the direct photon $v_{2}$ while describing the shape of the direct photon $p_{T}$ spectra in an internally consistent manner.  The simulation, while systematically low when compared to the data, is in agreement with the 0-20% and 20-40% Au$+$Au PHENIX measurement at $p_{T}$ less than 3 GeV/c.  This model predicts that higher order flow harmonics, $v_{n}$, in direct photons will follow the modified $n_{q}$-scaling laws seen in identified hadron $v_{n}$ with an $n_{q}$ value of approximately two.  Comparisons to preliminary direct photon results, including higher-order anisotropies and the status of simulations at LHC energies, will also be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sarah', 'last_name': 'Campbell', 'fullName': 'Campbell, Sarah', 'id': '934167', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University', 'emailHash': '9f2b38a6a844c823e59cb40d6fb770ac', 'db_id': 934167, 'person_id': 999448}"

We present the results of femtoscopic analyses for different identified particle systems measured by ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. Hydrodynamic models predict a decrease of the radii with increasing pair transverse $m_T$ due to radial flow. Correlation measurements of heavy particles extend the range over which the transverse mass dependence of the source radii can be studied and thus can serve, as a tool to learn about the dynamics of he deconfined medium. Particularly, we compare the measured 3D kaon radii with a model where the hydrodynamic phase is succeeded by a hadronic rescattering phase and a purely hydrodynamical calculation. The latter predicts an approximate mT scaling of source radii obtained from pion and kaon correlations. This $m_{\mathrm{T}}$ scaling appears broken in our data, which indicates strong rescattering in the hadronic phase at LHC energies. The emission duration and the decoupling time of the system are also estimated using the three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis for kaons, and compared with such estimates obtained from pions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ludmila', 'last_name': 'Malinina', 'fullName': 'Malinina, Ludmila', 'id': '934168', 'affiliation': 'Joint Inst. for Nuclear Research (RU)', 'emailHash': '3df8349538f2e077a75abb57416d0bcb', 'db_id': 934168, 'person_id': 999449}"

Detailed measurements of centrality-dependent dijet imbalance in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV PbPb collisions using data collected in the 2011 LHC heavy ion run are presented. The new analysis fully corrects to the particle level. The results show a centrality-dependent modification of the dijet asymmetry distribution accompanied by an unmodified angular correlation between two jets in the dijet system. Detailed studies of the dijet asymmetry as a function of the leading jet transverse momentum and jet radius are presented. The reference measurement of the dijet asymmetry in the pp collisions at the same center of mass energy is also shown. The dijet asymmetry measurements are also done while selecting the leading jet at different angles with respect to the second order event-plane. This effectively probes the path-length dependence of the dijet asymmetry at fixed centrality. The variation of the dijet asymmetry with the soft particle $v_2$, at fixed centrality are also measured.
   To further constrain the energy loss models, the measurement of the correlations between jets that are at small relative angles was performed. The measured neighbouring jet pairs result primarily from hard radiation by the parton that occurs early in the process of the shower formation.
   These dijet and multijet measurements can provide a better understanding of the correlation of the parton energy-loss with the underlying geometry, help elucidating the role of the fluctuations in the energy loss as well as put some constrains to models in which a part of the parton shower radiates coherently in the response of the medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dennis Vadimovich', 'last_name': 'Perepelitsa', 'fullName': 'Perepelitsa, Dennis Vadimovich', 'id': '934173', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)', 'emailHash': '05b83b006d2a82b1427598a90d8b4548', 'db_id': 934173, 'person_id': 998993}"

Poster Session,poster,Heavy meson mass spectrum at finite temperature based on AdS/CFT,"Kim, Minjung",Inha University (KR),KR,"In heavy-ion collisions, the medium experiences hard and soft scatterings as it expands and a temperature cools down. Therefore the temperature of the medium plays a key role for getting the dynamical information of the medium, such as the energy/momentum distributions of emitting hadrons.
Existing meson types at each stage can provide the temperature information of the medium since each meson has its own melting temperature. These temperatures can be estimated from their masses at those temperatures but the only experimental information is given at zero temperature. At non-zero temperatures, there are several models to estimate the meson masses, where the temperature-dependence of quark-quark interactions is necessary. Most calculations use the free energies from Lattice results or their modifications, for this input.
Recently, AdS/CFT offered the temperature-dependent potentials between quarks by introducing infrared cutoff on the AdS Schwarzschild space, which inhibit the two characteristic features, confinement at long rages and asymptotic freedom at small ranges. We adopted these temperature-dependences on our model potential, which is composed of a screened Coulomb-type strong potential plus a Coulomb potential as a vector potential and the linear plus constant potential as a scalar potential. Here the temperature dependence of the screening radius and tangent of the linear potential is determined based on AdS/CFT. For two quark system, we used the Dirac’s constraint dynamics to get the Schrodinger-type equations with all dynamical and spin-dependent terms expressed by our model potential.
In this presentation, we calculated the meson mass spectrum, especially for quarkonia and B_{c} meson. Heavy meson masses are almost constant for T=0~0.4T_{c} but decrease after 0.4T_{c} as temperatures increase up to 1.4T_{c}, especially linearly after T=T_{c}.

It was recently realized that event-by-event initial fluctuations lead to correlations between different harmonics (correlations of $v_{n}$ and $v_{m}$ when $n≠m$), present also in transport model calculations. The strengths of some of these correlations are much more sensitive to QGP transport properties (e.g. $\eta$/s) compared to standalone $v_{n}$ measurements [1]. In this talk, we report the first ALICE measurements of the correlation strength between various anisotropic flow harmonics. The correlation strength is characterized with multi-particle cumulants of mixed harmonics, which by construction depend only on the fluctuations of magnitudes of the anisotropic flow vectors.

In particular, we will show new studies on event by event correlations of radial and anisotropic flow, and discuss how these studies can place extra constraints on the initial conditions. We will demonstrate how the pion, kaon, proton spectra evolve with the event-wise anisotropic flow, and use a blast wave model to determine changes in the radial flow velocity. We will also review the sensitivity of the ESE technique, by comparing results using different ALICE sub-detectors. Finally, we will discuss the feasibility of more statistically demanding ESE studies for the upcoming LHC run 2 and 3 data.

Collective Dynamics IV,parallel,Higher harmonic anisotropic flow of identified particles in Pb-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector,"Mohammadi, Naghmeh",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Netherlands,"Anisotropic flow plays a critical role in establishing the equation of state for the Quark Gluon Plasma. The results at the LHC have demonstrated that the matter created in heavy-ion collisions behaves as a nearly perfect fluid reflected in the low value of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\eta$/s). The higher flow harmonics are particularly sensitive to the value of $\eta$/s in hydrodynamic calculations. In this talk, we present the first ALICE results on $p_{\rm T}$ differential $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, $v_{4}$ and $v_{5}$ for π$^{\pm}$, K$^\pm$, $\mathrm{p}$($\overline{\mathrm{p}}$) from the high statistics 2011 heavy-ion run. We investigate how all $v_{n}$ coefficients evolve with particle mass and centrality for 0-1%, 20-30% and 40-50% centrality percentiles. These new measurements aim at differentiating between models that use different initial conditions, constraining further the value of $\eta$/s and allowing to decouple the influence of the late hadronic stage from the hydrodynamic evolution of the system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Naghmeh', 'last_name': 'Mohammadi', 'fullName': 'Mohammadi, Naghmeh', 'id': '934188', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': '24c9d13684e56502fd673207c63f315f', 'db_id': 934188, 'person_id': 999463}"
Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Forward-central two-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV,"Kryshen, Evgeny",CERN,Switzerland,"A double-ridge structure has been observed in two-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions at midrapidity and its origin is actively debated. Measurements at larger relative pseudorapidity can further improve our understanding of this phenomenon. The results on two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward pseudorapidity range (2.5 < |η| < 4.0) and associated particles at mid-rapidity (|η| < 1.0) in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV are reported in the talk. The trigger particles are detected by the ALICE muon spectrometer, and the associated particles by the ALICE central barrel tracking detectors. The reconstructed trigger particles mainly originate from weak decays of primary pions and kaons at low transverse momentum ($p_T$), and heavy-flavor particles at high $p_T$. The ridge is found to persist to the pseudorapidity ranges studied here, and the second-order Fourier coefficients for these measured trigger particles are extracted after subtracting the correlations obtained in low-multiplicity events from those in high-multiplicity events. The Fourier coefficients have a similar pT dependence in the p-going and Pb-going directions, and the ratio of Fourier coefficients in the two directions is calculated as a function of $p_T$. The results are compared with calculations from a parton-cascade model.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Evgeny', 'last_name': 'Kryshen', 'fullName': 'Kryshen, Evgeny', 'id': '934189', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '3f4b94bf0add83e3ad5c87e201ff78f7', 'db_id': 934189, 'person_id': 999464}"
Correlations and Fluctuations IV,parallel,Multiplicity and transverse momentum dependence of electric charge balance functions,"Christakoglou, Panos",Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL),Netherlands,"We report comprehensive results on the balance function as a function of the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle difference, ∆η and ∆φ respectively, between two charged particles. Results on the multiplicity and transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence measured with ALICE in pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collisions at 7 TeV, 5.02 TeV, 2.76 TeV are presented. The balance function in both ∆η and ∆φ becomes narrower with increasing multiplicity in all three systems for particles with 0.2 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c. The experimental findings favor models that either incorporate some collective behavior (e.g. AMPT) or mimic this using different mechanisms (e.g. PYTHIA8 with color reconnection). For higher values of transverse momenta the balance function becomes even narrower but exhibits no quantitative difference between the three systems. The results add constraints to models that describe collective effects down to small systems (for low values of $p_T$), and particle production mechanisms such as coalescence and fragmentation processes (for inter- mediate and high values of $p_T$).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Panos', 'last_name': 'Christakoglou', 'fullName': 'Christakoglou, Panos', 'id': '934190', 'affiliation': 'Nikhef National institute  for subatomic physics (NL)', 'emailHash': 'eb31b84fa8a7711e6939eb76aa9f2876', 'db_id': 934190, 'person_id': 999465}"
