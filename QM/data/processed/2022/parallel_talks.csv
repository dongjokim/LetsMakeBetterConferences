Parallel Session T14: Hadron production and collective dynamics,parallel,Search for collective effects in small systems obtained in ep collisions at HERA,"Sun, Chuan",Stony Brook University,USA,"Measurements of two- and multi-particle angular correlations are presented in both $ep$ deep-inelastic scattering at $\sqrt{s}=319$ GeV and in photoproduction off protons at energies $W_{\gamma p}=270$ GeV, as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. No long-range ridge structure is observed in the correlation functions. The second-order ($V_{2∆}$) and third-order ($V_{3∆}$) azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics are extracted. Further, $C_2\{4\}$ signals are extracted from four-particle correlations for the first time in $ep$ collisions and are found to be positive or consistent with 0. In summary, collective behavior has not been observed in collisions of protons with virtual or quasi-real photons at HERA energies.

"Parallel Session T02: Chirality, vorticity and spin polarization",parallel,Collectivity in intermediate-scale QGP and extended hydrodynamic regime,"Yin, Yi","Institute of modern physics, Chinese Academy of Sciencessti",Unknown,"The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a fluid at a long wavelength and becomes a collection of weakly-coupled partons at an asymptotically short wavelength. However, its properties at the ""mesoscopic"" length scale, which is too short for a fluid description and too long for a perturbative treatment, remain elusive. In this work, we consider the response of QCD-like plasma to energy/momentum disturbance as a function of the gradient. For both N=4 super-Yang Mills theory in strong coupling limit and kinetic theory under relaxation time approximation, we find that hydrodynamic modes continue dominating medium's response even in the region where Knudsen number is large. However, in this extended hydrodynamic regime, both the first-order and second-order hydrodynamics fail to characterize medium's behavior. Inspired by the recent development in extended hydrodynamics, such as Hydro+ [1], we construct a simple yet not trivial extension of the Muller-Israel-Stewart theory, namely MIS*, and show this novel framework can quantitatively describe hydrodynamic modes in both hydrodynamic and extended hydrodynamic regimes with a suitable choice of model parameters for representative microscopic theories with and without quasi-particle descriptions [2]. As an illustration, we apply MIS* to study how a Bjorken-expanding QGP responds to a moving energetic parton [3].

Parallel Session T06: Lattice QCD and heavy-ion collisions,parallel,Lattice QCD results for the heavy quark diffusion coefficient,"Altenkort, Luis",Universität Bielefeld,Unknown,"We present a novel approach to nonperturbatively estimate the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient, which is a key input for the theoretical description of heavy quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions, and is important for the understanding of the elliptic flow and nuclear suppression factor of heavy flavor hadrons. In the heavy quark limit, this coefficient is encoded in the spectral functions of color-electric and color-magnetic correlators that we calculate on the lattice to high precision by applying gradient flow. In our study we consider quenched QCD at $1.5\,T_c$, where we perform a detailed study of the lattice spacing and flow time dependence of color-electric and color-magnetic correlators, and, using theoretically well-established model fits for the spectral reconstruction,
we estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient.

So far, quantum computing has seen ample application in areas such as quantum chemistry or condensed matter, but its usage in high energy physics is still in its infancy. In the particular case of QCD jets, these technologies might offer a way to, for the first time, fully understand the intricate interference pattern arising from the multi-parton cascade. In jet quenching, such aspects are intimately related to the natural scales at which the jet probes the medium. In this talk, we introduce a strategy to quantum simulate single particle evolution in a stochastic background field. We discuss how jet evolution can be translated to a digital quantum circuit and which measurement protocols can be implemented to extract physically relevant quantities. Future extensions of this strategy to include gluon radiation are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'João', 'last_name': 'Barata', 'fullName': 'Barata, João', 'id': '6511670', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fe4acb8d1beeb5499f57f94d4f131590', 'db_id': 6511670, 'person_id': 6331280}"

with Bi+Bi collisions at 9.2 GeV, in particular planned for first run.
It is expected that an excited QCD matter with high baryonic density

general MPD capabilities to study this exotic state of matter.

MPD is an international collaboration consisting of 44 institutions
from 13 countries. The construction and commissioning of the detector

2023. The status of all subsystem preparations as well as their design
performance will be presented. MPD aims to study the phase diagram of
QCD matter at maximum baryonic density, determine the nature of the
phase transition between the deconfined and hadronic matter and search
for the critical end point. The physics programme, with emphasis on
potential first physics measurements with initial beams will be
discussed and it will be shown how MPD results can be used to
characterize the QCD matter created in heavy-ion collisions, including
the relevance of these investigations to other physics areas such
as astrophysics, particle physics and neutron star composition.

Parallel Session T14: Hadron production and collective dynamics,parallel,Strong and Electromagnetic Collective Effects from NA61/SHINE,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,"The NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS obtained new data on proton and pion collective flow in Pb+Pb collisions, and on the distortion of charged pion spectra by the spectator electromagnetic field in Ar+Sc reactions. The latter is the first ever measurement of this effect in small systems at the CERN SPS.

The data on both effects are shown as a function of collision centrality and energy and compared to model predictions, as well as to existing results from the NA49 experiment. In Pb+Pb collisions, the negative pion directed flow changes sign as a function of transverse momentum, an effect which strongly depends on collision energy. For protons and pions, the difference in sign of directed flow slope at midrapidity reflects the momentum exchange between expanding matter and spectators.

In Ar+Sc collisions, in spite of their small spectator charge, a very significant electromagnetic distortion of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ distributions is apparent as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity, qualitatively similar to heavy ion reactions where the spectator charge also results in splitting of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ directed flow. This brings specific implications for the space-time evolution of the fireball which are studied by model calculations. The latter also point at the role of spectator fragmentation, and estimate the influence of vorticity in the observed phenomena.",
Parallel Session T01: Initial state physics and approach to thermal equilibrium,parallel,Constraints on neutron skin thickness and nuclear deformations using relativistic heavy-ion collisions from STAR,"Xu, Haojie",Huzhou University,Unknown,"RHIC's capability to perform relativistic collisions of various ion species provides a unique opportunity to explore and constrain neutron skin thickness and deformation parameters of nuclei. 
 

The study of neutron skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$ of nuclei can help us directly infer nuclear symmetry energy. Such information is of critical importance to the equation of state of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars and the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. The $\Delta r_{np}$ has traditionally been measured in low-energy hadronic and nuclear scattering experiments over decades. An alternate recent measurement using parity-violating electroweak interactions by the PREX-II experiment has yielded a large neutron skin thickness of Pb nucleus [1] that is in tension with the world-wide data established in hadronic collisions. In isobar collisions at relativistic energies, the effect of neutron skin was predicted [2] to yield different multiplicities and elliptic flows. They, in turn, provide an unconventional but more precise method to probe the neutron skin [3]. The idea is to compare the produced hadron multiplicities ($N_{\rm ch}$) [3], the mean transverse momenta ($\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$) [4], and the net charge multiplicities ($\Delta Q$) [5] to trace back to the neutron skin differences between the isobar nuclei. 

Nuclear deformation, a ubiquitous phenomenon for most atomic nuclei, reflects collective motion induced by the interaction between valence nucleons and shell structure. In most cases, the deformation has a quadrupole shape that is characterized by overall strength $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and/or an octuple shape $\beta_3$. In relativistic collisions of two nuclei such deformations enhance the fluctuations of bulk observables that are sensitive to initial state geometry [6]. The deformation parameters can be constrained from the precision measurements of the ratios of harmonic anisotropy coefficients $v_2$, $v_3$, mean transverse momentum $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ fluctuations (mean, variance and skewness), and their Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ between two isobar systems [7]. In Au+Au and U+U collisions the same can be done by performing measurement of $v_2$, cumulants of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ distributions, and $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ [8]. 

In this talk we will discuss the aforementioned measurements in Au+Au, U+U and isobar $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV using the STAR detector. We will discuss how we extract the neutron skin thickness and the symmetry energy slope parameter from these data. We will contrast our results in the context of the global data on symmetry energy and tension with the PREX-II data. We will discuss how the significant deviations of the ratios of $v_2$ and $v_3$ from unity in isobar collisions are indicative of large quadrupole and octuple deformations in Ru and Zr nuclei, respectively [9]. We will also discuss how the relative enhancement of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$-skewness, sign-change of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$-kurtosis and the suppression of $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ in U+U relative to Au+Au collisions are consistent with a large prolate deformation of the uranium nuclei.

Parallel Session T14: Hadron production and collective dynamics,parallel,Probing initial and final state effects of heavy-ion collisions with STAR experiment,"Yan, Gaoguo",Unknown,Unknown,"Understanding the initial conditions, the transport properties, and the dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma are central objectives of the heavy-ion program at RHIC. The transverse momentum correlator $G_{2}\left(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi\right)$ has been shown to be sensitive to the shear viscosity $\eta/s$~[1,2]. On the other hand, the $\rho(v^{2}_{2},\langle p_{T} \rangle)$ correlator indicates more sensitivity to the initial-state than to final-state effects~[3,4].  A comprehensive set of  $G_{2}\left(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi\right)$ and $\rho(v^{2}_{2},\langle p_{T} \rangle)$ measurements for Au+Au collisions spanning the beam energy range $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 11.5-200 GeV will be presented for several centralities and event shape selections. Furthermore, we also explore the initial-state effects in longitudinal directions using the de-correlation observables which measure the factorization ratio for  flow harmonics, $r_{n}(\eta)(n = 2,3)$ and $R_{2}(\eta)$. The new results from isobar collisions as well as BES II energy Au+Au collisions will provide important insights on the 3D modeling of initial-state of heavy-ion collisions, especially its collision energy and collision size dependence.

Parallel Session T08: Strongly coupled systems,parallel,"The splitting of directed flow for identified light hadrons (\pi, K, and p) and strange baryons (\Xi and \Omega) in Au+Au and isobar collisions at STAR","Ikbal, Ashik",Unknown,Unknown,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the directed flow ($v_1$) of hadrons can provide insights into the ultra-strong electromagnetic (EM) field~[1-2], the constituent quark content of hadrons~[3], and the role of transported quarks~[4]. Here, the first measurement is reported for rapidity-odd directed flow of $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV, as well as $v_1$ for identified charged hadrons with unprecedented precision in Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV.  
The coalescence sum rule is examined with various combinations of hadrons where all constituent quarks are produced. For such combinations a systematic violation of the sum rule is observed with increasing difference in the electric charge and the strangeness content of the associated constituent quarks. By comparing with the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics model that includes an EM field, the results suggest that the constituent quark sum rule could be violated in the presence of a strong EM field that drives the $v_1$ of produced quarks and anti-quarks to opposite directions. The splitting of $v_1$ slope with rapidity ($\Delta (dv_1/dy)$) between positively and negatively charged hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, $p$) is also studied with large statistics. A clear transition of $\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ from positive in central collisions to negative in peripheral collisions is observed for protons and kaons. With the effects of both transported quarks and the EM field considered, it is found that the significant negative values in peripheral events can only be explained by the presence of an EM field with the Faraday or Coulomb effect being dominant.

"Parallel Session T02: Chirality, vorticity and spin polarization",parallel,Measurements of hyperon polarization in heavy-ion collisions at \sqrt{sNN} = 3 - 200 GeV with the STAR detector,"Adams, Joseph",Ohio State University,USA,"In heavy-ion collisions, the observation of the global hyperon polarization, $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$, ranging from $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=7.7$~GeV to 5.02~TeV has revealed the existence of large vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to system's orbital angular momentum. We present recent results on $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$, and differential measurements thereof, extended to the low energies of 3 and 7.2~GeV~[1]. A notable advantage of the STAR acceptance at low $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ is the ability to measure the dependence of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ on $y$ across the full range of hyperon production in $y$ which can test the predictions of numerous model calculations. Further studies of differential measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ are presented as well using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=19.6$ and $27$~GeV which allow for comparisons to the low-$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ measurements presented here and to the high-energy measurements studied in Ref.~[2]. Studies of the vortical flow structure's dependence on system size are also possible using Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV which are presented here as well. Furthermore, while $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ reveals information about the vorticity driven by angular momentum, a recent study~[3] measuring local polarization along the beam direction, $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$, revealed vorticity in the QGP arising from collective flow. The measurement stands in disagreement with a number of model calculations and, to shed light on the matter, measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$ can be conducted in smaller systems than Au+Au or relative to higher-order event-plane angles. These measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$ in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV presented here will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of flow-driven vorticity.

Parallel Session T05: QGP in small and medium systems,parallel,System size dependence of particle production and collectivity from the STAR experiment at RHIC,"Liu, Tong",Yale University,USA,"The medium modification to particle spectra and the origin of collectivity in small collision systems are widely debated topics in our community. 
To address these open questions we propose the study of particle production and collectivity for varying system sizes, presented in decreasing order (Au+Au $>$ Ru+Ru/Zr+Zr $>$ $^{3}$He+Au $>$ d+Au $>$ p+Au $>$ p+p $>$ $\gamma$+Au), available at RHIC using the STAR detector. 

We present the first measurements of charged hadron yields in isobar (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. We perform measurements of identified particle spectra at low transverse momenta ($p_\mathrm{T}$) as a function of rapidity and event centrality. We also perform the centrality dependent measurements of nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. Combined with the existing results in smaller systems (p/d+Au), these results provide an additional handle in studying system size and collision geometry dependences of the medium modification to particle production.

We also revisit the measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) anisotropies in p+Au, d+Au and $^{3}$He+Au collisions at 200 GeV including a comprehensive evaluation of the non-flow effects using different subtraction methods.
In addition to the results obtained from the mid-rapidity ($|\eta|<$1), we also use the Event Plane Detectors that span over 2.1$<|\eta|<$5.1 to investigate the potential influence of longitudinal flow de-correlations in $v_n$ measurements using peripheral Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions.

However, their production mechanisms are currently not well understood. Measurements of the yield and collective flow are sensitive to their production mechanisms and the dynamics of the produced medium. In particular, hypernuclei measurements may also bear implications on the hyperon-nucleon interaction, which is critical to understanding the nuclear equation of state in high baryon density medium including strangeness degrees of freedom. 

The STAR Beam Energy Scan Phase II program, including fixed target Au+Au collisions and carried out during 2018-2021, is particularly suited for such studies. In this talk, the collision energy dependence of light hypernuclei $({}^{3}_{\Lambda}$H, ${}^{4}_{\Lambda}$H, ${}^{4}_{\Lambda}$He$)$ production yields in $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=3, 19.6$ and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions will be presented. We will also report the energy dependence of light nuclei directed and elliptic flow as well as the first observation of hypernuclei $({}^{3}_{\Lambda}$H, ${}^{4}_{\Lambda}$H) directed flow in $3$ GeV collisions. These results will be compared to thermal and transport model calculations.

The measurement of two-particle correlations for various light nuclei combinations provides a unique tool to obtain detailed information about the spatial and temporal evolution of the particle emitting source as well as the isospin dependence of strong interaction. This analysis can be further applied to investigate the production mechanism of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, such as coalescence vs. thermal production. 
    
For the case of strange particles, such as kaons and hyperons, the correlation functions are sensitive to the early stage of the collision evolution and provide different information about particle-emitting sources compared to pions. Information on the final state interactions amongst the particles under study can also be extracted from the measurement. Further, one could investigate hyperon-nucleon interactions which is little known.

According to different models, it has been associated with a meson, considered as a tetraquark, or as a KK molecule. In this talk we address two complementary avenues to study the nature of the f$_0$(980) resonance. 

The first method exploits the excellent tracking and particle identification of the ALICE experiment to measure the differential spectra and integrated yield of the f$_0$(980) meson produced in pp and p-Pb collisions at an energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 5 TeV. The results are discussed in the comparison with models and the properties of other hadrons.

Thus, in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets can be used as dynamical probes to investigate the jet-medium interaction at various scales. JETSCAPE is a framework that enables simulations describing physics at varying scales involved in in-medium jet evolution. The JETSCAPE framework incorporates multiple models, each effective at an individual scale range, and switches between them at appropriate scales while mediating their communication.

As a new feature, the jet quenching strength q-hat with an explicit virtuality dependence depending on the resolution scale evolution of jets is now supported by JETSCAPE.

However, whether the magnetic fields survive in the late stage of heavy-ion collisions and experimental measurements of various observables are reminiscent of the initially-created magnetic fields still remain elusive. In this talk we show that fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, strangeness and electrical charge can be useful to probe the imprint of the magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions. This is based on the fact that 1) these fluctuations and correlations have been shown to be very useful in understanding the QCD phase structure in the vanishing magnetic fields and 2) our very recent lattice QCD studies on these quantities in magnetic fields.


We will show the first lattice QCD results of the second-order fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD in the presence of a background magnetic field. Lattice QCD simulations are performed on $32^3\times N_\tau$ lattices using the highly improved staggered fermions in a fixed scale approach with $N_\tau\in[8,96]$ [1,2]. We study these quantities from zero temperature up to $\sim$1.7 $T_{pc}$ with 15 values of the magnetic field strength $eB\in[0,60~m_\pi^2]$ with pion mass $m_\pi=$220 MeV [1]. We also extend the above lattice QCD studies to the realistic case with physical pion mass $m_\pi=135$ MeV, and focus on a smaller temperature interval around the pseudo-critical temperature ranging from 0.9 $T_{pc}$ to 1.1 $T_{pc}$. To mimic the magnetic field strength produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collision experiments we now have 6 different values of the magnetic field strength up to $\sim$10$m_\pi^2$ with $m_\pi=135$ MeV [3].


We discuss the temperature and $eB$ dependences of the second-order fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness. We find that these second-order fluctuations and correlations are substantially affected by $eB$. They even develop peak structures at sufficiently large $eB$ which could be related to a possible critical end point in the $T-eB$ plane. We propose to investigate these quantities in experiments in different centrality classes and collision systems where $eB$ could be different.

In this talk, we will compare prompt photon to $\pi^0$ production measured by PHENIX in $d$+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV to demonstrate that the apparent centrality dependence is not related to a nuclear modification of hard scattering processes, but likely due to deviations from the proportionality of event activity and centrality in the underlying standard Glauber model calculations. Furthermore, we will use prompt photon production in $d$+Au relative to $p+p$ collisions to empirically determine the effective number of binary collisions $N_{coll}$ of a given event sample. We find that for all event selections, except for those with the highest event activity, $R_{xA}$ of $\pi^0$ is consistent with unity.

Furthermore, the system size dependence of the yield, expressed through the power $\alpha$, remains independent of $p_T$ over the entire observed range from 1 to 6~GeV/c.

We compare the semi-inclusive recoil jet yields in pp and Pb-Pb collisions over a broad $p_\mathrm{T}$ jet range, which probes energy loss due to jet quenching. We report the first measurement of hadron-jet acoplanarity in pp collisions.  The comparison of acoplanarity measurements in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at low  $p_\mathrm{T}$ jet gives unique and incisive exploration of medium-induced jet deflection. The measurements are compared to theoretical calculations based on pQCD, and to models incorporating jet quenching.
The jet substructure measurements can also help us understand the interaction dynamics of high-energy partons with the quark-gluon plasma. We present two new infrared and collinear safe observables: the angle between different definitions of the jet axis, $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$, as well as jet energy flow measurements using jets reconstructed with different resolution parameters R. Both the jet energy flow and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ measurements can help us gauge the comparative strength of competing energy loss mechanisms in a heavy ion environment. The first measurement of the  $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ observable, both in pp and Pb-Pb, are  presented and discussed in the context of event generators and analytic calculations. A new measurement of jet energy flow in pp collision data  is compared to prediction of various pp event generators.

The resulting improvement in pointing resolution will allow better measurements of heavy-flavour hadrons and dielectrons. In addition, a Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) is proposed to provide unique constraints on the low-x gluon structure of protons and nuclei via forward measurements of direct photons. The FoCal combines a high-resolution electromagnetic Si-W calorimeter with a conventional hadronic calorimeter.

The latter is the difference between the total centre-of-mass energy and the energy of leading baryons emitted at forward/backward rapidities. The superior tracking and particle-identification capabilities of ALICE make this detector unique in measuring (multi)strange hadrons via the reconstruction of their weak decays over a wide momentum range.

Such an asymmetry depends on both the spatial position along the transverse gradient of the dense matter and path length of a propagating parton as shown by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann transport in the simplified form of a drift-diffusion equation. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, this asymmetry with respect to a plane defined by the beam and trigger particle (photon, hadron, or jet) with a given orientation relative to the event plane is shown to be closely related to the transverse position of the initial jet production in full event-by-event simulations within the linear Boltzmann transport model.

We test the sensitivity to the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ signal process by requiring or not the additional presence of b-tagged jets, and hence demonstrate the feasibility to identify top quark decay products irrespective of interacting with the medium (bottom quarks) or not (leptonically decaying W bosons). To that end, the inclusive cross section ($\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) is derived from likelihood fits to a multivariate discriminator, which includes different leptonic kinematic variables with and without the b-tagged jet multiplicity information.

Parallel Session T05: QGP in small and medium systems,parallel,Search for jet quenching in high-multiplicity pp collisions using inclusive and semi-inclusive jet production in ALICE,"Krizek, Filip",Czech Academy of Sciences (CZ),CZ,"Small collision systems exhibit features that are characteristic of collective flow, a hallmark of QGP formation. However, jet quenching in small systems has not yet been observed, and quantifying or setting limits on the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems is a key element in understanding the limits of QGP formation. In this talk we present a search for jet quenching effects in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\ \mathrm{TeV}$ based on two jet observables: inclusive jet production, and the semi-inclusive yield of jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\rm T}$ hadron. Both measurements are carried out differentially in event multiplicity, which varies the size of the collision system. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm, with $R$ between 0.3 and 0.7. The $R$-dependent inclusive jet cross section is compared to pQCD calculations. To search for jet quenching effects, the shape of the inclusive jet yield in different multiplicity intervals is compared to the one obtained in minimum-bias (MB) events. The jet yield increases as a function of charged-particle multiplicity, which is similar to the one observed from soft sectors. In the semi-inclusive analysis, recoil jet acoplanarity is measured for events selected on high multiplicity (HM) and compared to the MB population. A striking modification of the acoplanarity distribution, which is nominally characteristic of jet quenching, is observed in the measured HM population. Its origin is elucidated by comparison to model calculations, with implications for the larger LHC small-systems program.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Filip', 'last_name': 'Krizek', 'fullName': 'Krizek, Filip', 'id': '6564548', 'affiliation': 'Czech Academy of Sciences (CZ)', 'emailHash': '59779b305edf821ebf6c15602f913239', 'db_id': 6564548, 'person_id': 6323406}"

In the experiment, 30 GeV primary proton beam is irradiated on carbon and copper targets to produce vector mesons, ${\rho}$, ${\omega}$ and ${\phi}$. We measure the spectra of these mesons at nuclear density from their dilepton decay.
 In order to obtain large statistics, we constructed a new spectrometer having high rate capability to detect dileptons produced in pA reaction. The spectrometer consists of Silicon Strip Detectors (SSD), GEM TRackers (GTR) for tracking, and Hadron Blind Detectors (HBD) and Lead Glass calorimeters (LG) for electron identification. GTR is used to cope with the expected high particle rate 5 kHz/${\textrm{mm}^2}$. The spectrometer is designed 5.8 MeV/${c^2}$ mass resolution for ${\phi}$ mesons and 99.97 % pion rejection power.
 The experiment has been successfully launched at a J-PARC high momentum beam line in 2020, and three commissioning runs have been carried out so far. The first physics run is planned in 2022-2023. In the physics run, we will obtain 15,000 ${\phi}$ mesons.

Suppression can also take place in hadron-nucleus collisions due to cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects where the presence of QGP is not expected. The hadron-nucleus collisions are therefore important as they help to disentangle the effects of the QGP from those due to CNM. Charmonium production in hA collisions at fixed-target energies is sensitive to the effects of nPDF and the partonic energy loss in nuclear matter. It is conveniently complemented by the well-known Drell-Yan process.

A negative pion beam with a momentum of 190 GeV/c was impinging on ammonia, aluminum, and tungsten targets. The preliminary results for the ratios of heavy to light targets for both charmonia production and Drell-Yan show suppression towards high $x_{\rm F}$.

In addition to the widely studied thermal vorticity effect, we identify an undiscovered contribution from the fluid shear [2]. We obtain the explicit expression for shear-induced polarization (SIP) from quantum kinetic equation and linear response theory. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we find SIP effect competes with the thermal vorticity effect and shows right sign (trend) to the azimuthal dependent local spin polarization $P_y(\phi)$ and $P_z(\phi)$. Especially, in the scenario that Lambda inherits and memorizes the spin polarization of strange quark, SIP wins the competition and the obtained local $P_y(\phi)$ and $P_z(\phi)$ qualitatively agree with the data measured at top RHIC energy [2].

Furthermore, we extend the calculation to event-by-event simulations for various collision systems at RHIC and LHC. We calculate the 2nd order Fourier coefficient of $P_z$, which qualitatively agrees with the ALICE measurements in 5.02 A TeV Pb+Pb collisions [3, 4]. We also predict the 3rd order Fourier coefficients, which provide more details for spin polarization and can be measured in the RHIC isobar run with high statics [4].

Illinois at Urbana Champaign (US),USA,"It has been shown that high-energy partons lose energy when traversing the hot, dense medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. However, the mechanism of the energy loss, including its dependence on the path-length of the shower in the medium and sensitivity to the jet substructure, is not fully understood. This talk presents a new measurement of single jet yields as a function of the azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Because partons produced at different angles with respect to the event plane traverse, on average, different path lengths of the medium, this measurement gives insight into the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. The azimuthal angle dependence of the yields is characterized by the parameter $v_n^{jet}$, which quantifies the magnitude of the modulation of the azimuthal angle distribution with respect to the $n^{th}$ order event plane. While ATLAS has previously reported the $v_2^{jet}$ in Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV, this is the first ATLAS measurement of higher-order $v_n^{jet}$. The $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ are measured for jets with $p_T = 71-398$ GeV as a function of $p_T$ and collision centrality. A nonzero value of $v_2$ is observed in all but the most central collisions. A smaller nonzero value of $v_3$ is measured, suggesting that fluctuations in the initial state play a small but distinct role in jet energy loss.

These measurements provide unique information on many aspects of strongly-coupled systems, like the genuine three-body interaction, the formation of light nuclei and the search for exotic bound states. Among those, many-body interactions, also including hyperons, are an important ingredient in the calculation of the equation of state of neutron stars. 

The results presented in this talk are obtained using high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. The first measured three-body correlations include p-p-p and p-p-$\Lambda$. Their genuine three-body interactions are obtained by subtracting the known two-body effects from the measured correlation functions for the triplets. In both systems, a non-zero three-particle cumulant is observed, providing a hint to the existence of a genuine three-body effect. Another class of many-body interaction studies is identified in the correlations of hadrons with light nuclei.

One of the dominant uncertainties present in such a study originates from poorly constrained initial conditions. In this talk, we present the final results of anisotropic flow measurements with high-order cumulants for inclusive and identified hadrons over the transverse momentum range of 0.2 < $p_{\rm T}$ < 20 GeV/c in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The measurements are also performed for the inclusive charged hadrons with a large coverage in pseudorapidity of 3.5 < $\eta$ < 5.0. With the combinations of two- and multiparticle cumulants, the relative flow fluctuations are studied in both transverse and pseudorapidity directions, providing unique insights into initial eccentricity fluctuations. In addition, the investigation on the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations, originating in the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial geometry, is performed in Pb-Pb collisions. For the first time, we separate the potential contributions from flow angle and flow magnitude fluctuations via two newly proposed flow observables and report the first discovery of both effects with a confidence of more than 5$\sigma$. Finally, the latest results of correlations between mean transverse momentum and anisotropic flow coefficient, $\rho(v^2_n, [p_{\rm T}])$, which are expected to provide direct access to the correlations between initial size and shape of the created hot QCD matter, will be shown for Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. Together with the comparisons to the various hydrodynamic model calculations, we will highlight that the models based on the T$_{\rm R}$ENTo initial state model and tuned using the Bayesian analyses fail to describe measured values of the $\rho(v^2_n, [p_{\rm T}])$.

Jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the mass of the fragmenting parton as well as its QCD color charge.
For light quarks and gluons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung, which is sensitive to the QCD color factor, is expected to dominate. In the case of heavy-quark-initiated jets, the radiative energy loss is expected to be suppressed by the dead cone effect and collisional energy loss may play a more important role.
In this talk, we report two new measurements by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. First, we present a measurement of photon-tagged jets which exploits the known difference in the fraction of quark-/gluon-initiated jets with and without the photon tag. Second, we present a measurement of $b$-tagged jets, identified through the semileptonic decays of $B$-hadrons into muons.

In this talk, we present a novel derivation of second-order relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation for multicomponent reactive mixtures with $N_{\text{spec}}$ particle species and with $N_q$ conserved charges.

In pp collisions, W bosons can be produced by pair annihilation but also by higher order processes with additional hadron production. An investigation of these bosons, in relation to the hadrons in the rest of the event, can give insight into multi-parton interactions in high-multiplicity events and the role of color-reconnection mechanisms.
Electroweak bosons are studied with ALICE in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, p–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV and Pb–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV via their leptonic decays in the muon and electron channels at forward rapidity (−4 < $\eta$ < −2.5) and midrapidity (|$\eta$| < 0.8), respectively. The observations in p–Pb and Pb–Pb collisions at forward rapidity give access to low Bjorken-x values, a phase-space region poorly constrain by heavy-ion experiments.
A review of the most recent results on the production of W$^+$, W$^−$ and Z bosons is presented. The results include differential measurements of the normalised production yields, production cross sections and nuclear modification factors as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum, collision centrality and charged-particle multiplicity.

investigate a linear quark-meson $\sigma$ model in and out of
equilibrium employing Schwinger-Keldysh real-time techniques to derive a
set of coupled Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (BUU) equations for the
$\sigma$-mean field (the order parameter of the phase transition) and
the quark- and meson phase-space distribution function from a
$\Phi$-derivable approximation, which is then numerically solved using
an accurate quadrature algorithm to evaluate the collision terms. This
numerical scheme is used to evaluate the grand-canonical baryon-number
fluctuations for an expanding fireball. Even when starting with a purely
Gaussian initial distribution the evolution results in a temporary
buildup of higher-order fluctuations of the net-baryon number like the
curtosis at low momenta when the system is evolving close to the
critical point or the first-order phase-transition line. This is mainly
caused by the slowly evolving $\sigma$-mean field, i.e., the order
parameter of the phase transition. This is partially counterballanced by
the further dissipative evolution due to collisions of the quarks,
mesons, and the mean field, leading to a considerable weakening of the
final fluctuations, depending on the expansion rate of the fireball.

High energy partons (e.g. those in jet showers) traversing the QGP, capable of triggering these high-momentum exchanges with the medium constituents, have the potential to reveal the presence of such quasi-particles. 

In this work we present an implementation of this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model in which, prior to this work, only the non-perturbative aspects of parton energy loss had been accounted for. Interaction with the quasi-particles results in elastic Moliere scatterings, leading to deflection of the direction of the jet parton that induced the process as well as the excitation of partons from the thermal medium that recoil after being kicked. Throughout the in-medium evolution, the system of jet partons and recoils, which might further re-scatter, inject energy and momentum into the QGP, producing wakes. We analyze a variety of setups, such as boson-jet systems, c-cbar systems, as well as dijet systems, at different jet transverse momenta and reconstruction radius, R. We will discuss the effect of Moliere scatterings on acoplanarity distributions, as well as on some of the most widely used groomed and ungroomed jet substructure observables. 

Given the large impact of the wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the medium on jet observables, as well as the presence of selection biases, finding unique signatures of the presence of the elastic scatterings is a challenging task. We will present some strategies that may be followed with a view toward enhancing and isolating the effect under consideration. These include the application of momentum cuts, differential studies of the angular distribution of particles around the jet, and, most revealing, the properties of the subjets (jets within jets) distributions.

Recent results in proton-proton collisions have suggested that J/$\psi$ mesons are produced with much more jet activity than model predictions, which indicate that the amount of isolated J/$\psi$ mesons with respect to the total production cross section plays an important role in interactions between charmonia and the QGP medium. In this presentation, we present the second-order and third-order Fourier coefficients, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for prompt and nonprompt J/$\psi$, and prompt $\psi(2S)$ mesons, with reporting the $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for prompt $\psi(2S)$ mesons for the first time in heavy ion collisions. The results are discussed with theoretical calculations and discussed in terms of suppression and recombination effects. Also, we show the final results of the measurement of J/$\psi$-jets in pp and PbPb collisions.

The second order Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of Z bosons are measured to be compatible with zero, showing that Z bosons do not experience significant final-state interactions. Yields of Z bosons are compared to Glauber model predictions and are found to deviate from these expectations in peripheral collisions, indicating the presence of initial collision geometry and centrality selection effects. The precision of the measurement allows, for the first time, for a data-driven determination of the nucleon-nucleon integrated luminosity as a function of lead-lead centrality, thereby eliminating the need for its estimation based on a Glauber model. The results of the Drell-Yan process are also reported in pPb collisions at center-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV. The differential cross sections are presented in a wide dimuon mass range down to 15 GeV/$c^{2}$.

Compared to the results from promptly produced $D^0$, the nonprompt $D^0$ $v_2$ flow coefficients are systematically lower. But those results have a similar dependence on $p_\mathrm{T}$ and centrality. A non-zero $v_3$ coefficient of the nonprompt $D^0$ is seen in PbPb data.

The effect of a predicted non-constant  $\eta/s(\mu_B)$ is largely unexplored in hydrodynamic simulations. Previous studies focus only on a temperature dependence[1-3] or even only a constant effective shear viscosity[4]. This work addresses this issue by studying qualitatively the effect of a generalized $\eta/s(T,\mu_B)$ in the novel hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH[5] and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE[6]. In order to reduce the bias of the result on the equation of state used in the hydrodynamic part of the model, $\eta/s$ is parameterized directly in the energy density and baryon number density.  The parameterization takes into account the constraints of matching to the transport coefficients in the hadronic phase[7], as well as of recent Bayesian analysis results. This work compares the impact of the density dependence for different system sizes and energies and constrains the behaviour of $\eta/s(T,\mu_B)$ by ruling out regions of the parameter space. This is achieved by comparing the observables with experimental results in the RHIC - BES region $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 4.3 - 17.3 GeV, as the effect of this generalisation is especially relevant for intermediate collision energies, for which the system is in equilibrium for a relevant amount of time, but the net baryochemical potential does not vanish.

However, even the state-of-the-art phenomenological models which can correctly explain spectra and anisotropic flows of charged hadrons underpredict yield and elliptic flow of photons [1]. It is known as “photon puzzle”. 

Here, we propose photon emission at hadronization as a possible resolution to the photon puzzle [2].
First, we calculate yields and collective flows of thermal photons at RHIC and the LHC, using a relativistic viscous hydrodynamical model which is combined with a hadron-based event generator, UrQMD [3]. Initial conditions are given by TRENTO. Our calculated  yields and elliptic flows of thermal photons are smaller than  those of experimental data at RHIC  and the LHC, which is consistent with the previous study [1]. 

Then, we discuss the effect of radiative hadronization on thermal photons from fluid. We find that radiative hadronization enhances both direct photon yields and elliptic flows as the same time and reproduces experimental data at RHIC and the LHC. The ratio of yield of pions produced through the radiative hadronization to that from the original recombination model at RHIC is 20 %. It means that the radiative recombination does not break the nature of quark number scaling in elliptic flow which is expected from the original recombination model [4]. On the other hand, in spite of the small contribution in hadron production, the radiative recombination process increases both the yield and collective flows of direct photon. The ratio at the LHC is 5 % which is smaller than that at RHIC. We show the detailed analyses on photon production during space-time evolution of fluid and at hadronization in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

Over the past two decades, our understanding of the QGP has evolved significantly, from measurements of nuclear modification functions of jets due to energy loss in medium to the realization of the applicability of hydrodynamics in matching the soft particle spectra. Direct photons exclude those from hadronic decays, and have proven themselves as versatile probes of the QGP. They are emitted at all stages of the evolution and can be soft but penetrating probes of the medium due to their electromagnetic nature and lack of final state interactions [1]. An important channel of photon production in jet-medium interactions is the conversion process, where a high energy quark or anti-quark is converted to a photon via a soft exchange with the medium [2]. In this talk, we present a new and modern calculation of direct photons created by the interaction of hard partons with the viscous relativistic fluid-dynamical medium. We calculate the conversion photon contribution to the total photon spectrum as well as to the photon $v_2$. We find that in the mini-jet domain of transverse momenta ($4 − 10$ GeV), jet- medium photons can contribute as much as 20% of the total photon yield with a significant portion coming from the conversion mechanism. We also explore the  potential of conversion photons as a probe of different energy loss approaches. We perform this comparison using the conversion photon spectrum from the evolving parton distributions computed with the AMY-McGill[3] and CUJET[4,5] parton energy loss formalisms.

Parallel Session T13: Electroweak probes,parallel,Thermal radiation and direct photon production in Pb-Pb and pp collisions with dielectrons in ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Electromagnetic probes such as photons and dielectrons are a unique tool to study the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. They are produced by a variety of processes during all stages of the collision with negligible final-state interactions. At low dielectron invariant mass ($m_{\rm ee}$), thermal radiation from the hot hadron gas contributes to the dielectron spectrum via decays of $\rho$ mesons, whose spectral function is sensitive to chiral-symmetry restoration. At larger $m_{\rm ee}$, thermal radiation from the QGP carries information about the early temperature of the medium. It is nevertheless dominated by a large background of correlated heavy-flavour hadron decays affected by energy loss and flow in the medium. Alternatively, the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T,ee}$) of virtual direct photons, including thermal photons at low $p_{\rm T,ee}$, can be extracted from the dielectron data together with inclusive photon measurements. In proton--proton (pp) collisions, such measurement serves as a fundamental test for perturbative QCD calculations and as a baseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities have been found to exhibit interesting phenomena showing surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions. Low-mass dielectrons could provide additional information regarding the underlying physics processes in such collisions.

In this talk, the latest ALICE results on dielectron studies in Pb-Pb and pp collisions at the center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV will be presented using the large data sample collected during the LHC Run 2. The results will be compared to the expected dielectron yield from known hadronic sources and predictions for thermal radiation from the medium.

They have provided unique insights into the parton energy loss and the degree of thermalization in the hot medium, but an inadequate knowledge of the hadronization processes has hampered the interpretation of experimental results. In heavy-ion collisions, charm hadron production can occur via coalescence, where charm quarks combine with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. The relative coalescence contribution is expected to be more significant for hadrons with a larger number of constituent quarks, so the modification of the baryon-to-meson ratio in heavy-ion collisions will reflect the effect of coalescence, and the effect is stronger for particles with more than three constituent quarks. Therefore, measurements of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and X(3872) production can provide important input to the understanding of coalescence. The high luminosity datasets collected by the CMS detector have been used to measure $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and X(3872) production via $\Lambda_{c}^{+} \to p^{+} K^{-} \pi^{+}$ and $\mathrm{X}(3872) \to \mathrm{J}/\psi \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$.

Recent measurements of charm-baryon production at midrapidity in small systems show a baryon-to-meson ratio significantly higher than that in $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions, suggesting that the fragmentation of charm is not universal across different collision systems. Thus, measurements of charm-baryon production are crucial to study the charm quark hadronization in a partonic rich environment like the one produced in pp collisions at the LHC energies.

Muons from both charm and bottom hadrons are found to have significant non-zero, second- and third-order azimuthal anisotropies in Pb+Pb collisions, with larger anisotropies for muons from charm hadrons than for muons from bottom hadrons. We highlight that a precise measurement of $v_3$ for bottom is presented.
Muons from both sources are also observed to be strongly suppressed with respect to the $pp$ baseline, in a way that depends on the mass of the parent hadron at low to moderate muon $p_\mathrm{T}$.
These studies can help to determine whether collisional or radiative processes dominate the energy loss of HF quarks as they traverse the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, the simultaneous measurement of multiple observables for both charm

Measurements of charm-hadron production in nucleus-nucleus collisions are therefore useful to study the properties of the in-medium charm-quark energy loss via the comparison with theoretical models. Moreover, the comparison of different colliding systems provides insights in the dependency on the collision geometry. 
Models describing the heavy-flavour transport and energy loss in an hydrodynamically expanding QGP require also a precise modelling of the in-medium hadronisation of heavy quarks, which is investigated via the measurement of prompt $\mathrm{D_s^+}$ mesons and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^{+}$ baryons.

We study the connection of such hybrid EoS with the mass-radius relation of cold compact stars, including the intriguing possibility of additional families, as a consequence of the presence of an early and strong phase transition. Special emphasis is devoted to the simultaneous fulfillment of the new NICER mass and radius constraint from PSR J0740+6620 and the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817 which require the EoS to be soft at about twice saturation density and then to stiffen. Such a pattern is provided by anBlaschke early and strong deconfinement transition.

We present the first NLO study of this process in heavy-ion collisions [1], building our numerical code on the NLO calculation of Ref. [2]. Approximating the generalized parton distributions involved in this process with collinear PDFs, we quantify the NLO contributions in the cross section, show that the real part of the amplitude must not be neglected, study the nuclear quark-PDF contributions, and chart the uncertainties due to the scale choice and PDFs. We compare our calculations with ALICE, CMS and LHCb J/Psi data in Pb+Pb UPCs, exclusive J/Psi photoproduction data from HERA, and LHCb data in p+p. We show that for the y-differential cross sections the scale dependence is significant but a scale choice can be found which reproduces the UPC data both at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV collision energies. In particular, we show that the NLO gluon contribution partly cancels against the LO one in the amplitude, making the process clearly more sensitive to the nuclear quark PDFs than thought before.

Following up on the first examination in $e^+e^-$ annihilation events using the small archived  ALEPH dataset, high-statistics Belle datasets at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 10.52$ GeV ($89.5 {\rm fb}^{-1}$) and 10.58 GeV on the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance ($333.2 {\rm fb}^{-1}$) are analyzed.

Measurements are reported as a function of the charged particle multiplicity over the full relative azimuthal angle $(\Delta \phi)$ and three units of pseudorapidity $(\Delta \eta)$. Correlation functions calculated in two coordinate systems with respect to different reference axes –– the conventional beam axis and the event thrust axis –– are measured. The thrust-reference-axis coordinate is the more natural representation for $e^+e^-$ annihilating into a quark-antiquark pair for providing sensitivity to the color activity emitted transverse to the diquark fragmentation.

We have demonstrated previously that even small energy loss effect can be observed in nuclear modification factor thanks to high precision pQCD baseline calculations in inclusive oxygen-oxygen collisions. However currently there is no pp reference measurement planned at OO collision energy (6.37TeV). Therefore in our recent work we analyzed  the reliability of several techniques for computing jet and hadron spectra at different collision energies. We computed the ratio of spectra between different pp collision energies in perturbative QCD, which can be used to construct a reference spectrum. Alternatively, it can be interpolated from measured spectra at nearby energies. We estimate the precision of both strategies for the spectra ratio relevant to the oxygen run. Finally we propose taking the ratio of OO and pp spectra at different collision energies, which cleanly separates the experimental measurement and theoretical computation.

New experimental data on Z-hadron correlation in Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider show, however, an enhancement of soft hadrons in the direction of both the Z and the jet.  Using a coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model, we demonstrate that medium modification of partons from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) gives rise to a soft hadron enhancement that is uniform in azimuthal angle that can overwhelm the signal of the diffusion wake.  To make the effect of diffusion wake visible in the near-side Z-hadron correlation, we use a mixed-event procedure to subtract the contribution from MPI.

I study in detail the contributions from initial state radiation to different jet substructure observables in p+p and A+A collisions, and show how they can compromise the interpretation of these observables in heavy ion collisions in terms of medium effects. This is done with an extended version of JEWEL, in which partons emitted from the initial state parton shower interact in the background medium in the same way as final state partons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Korinna', 'last_name': 'Zapp', 'fullName': 'Zapp, Korinna', 'id': '6508411', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '6fe7565adeafb919cb2211d64959c2c0', 'db_id': 6508411, 'person_id': 6337828}"

"Parallel Session T10: Baryon rich matter, neutron stars, and gravitational waves",parallel,Gravitational Waves Probing Quark Matter Crossover,"Fukushima, Kenji",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"**Crossover Scenario**
If there were a first-order phase transition, some signatures could be expected, but the most challenging is an experimental confirmation of realistic crossover scenario.  It is already known from the NS observations / pQCD calculations that a crossover transition to quark matter is likely to occur around 3-5 times normal nuclear density, where a slope parameter on the energy-pressure plane exhibits a significant change.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the relevant density is too high even in cores of heavy NSs.

**Gravitational Waves Signal**
We will discuss prospects of gravitational waves to distinguish the EoSs with/without not a first-order but a crossover transition to quark matter.  To this end, we will emphasize the importance of multiple observations as follows.

[*Inspiral Stage*]
So far, we still have to wait for the post-merger signals, and it is crucial to make analysis to clarify what we can infer from the inspiral stage (before binary NSs merge).  We show the gravitational waves obtained from the numerical relativity to constrain the tidal deformation parameter from which we can make extrapolation of EOS to high density in a scenario with/without crossover.

[*Post-merger Stage*]
We then demonstrate the effect of crossover in the post-merger stage (after binary  NSs start merging).  We will report a prominent difference between two scenarios with/without crossover.  The life time from the merger till the collapse into a blackhole significantly depends on the softened EOS in the dense region of 4-5 times normal nuclear density.  We also quantify theoretical uncertainties from the finite-temperature extension that is parameterized by the thermal index.  We point out that it is of tremendous importance to take account of the density dependence of the thermal index.

**Conclusion**
We can make use of already available gravitational wave signal in the inspiral stage to constrain the EOS of cold and dense matter before crossover.  Since the uncertainty in this density region is sufficiently reduced (and the finite-temperature uncertainty is absent!), we can apply it to the post-merger analysis up to an hypothetical (but very likely) crossover density, which enables us to probe the crossover from the life time after the merger, which has been quantified by our simulations of the numerical relativity with the most realistic EOS.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenji', 'last_name': 'Fukushima', 'fullName': 'Fukushima, Kenji', 'id': '6508740', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '74a302a970a5cdf95b4b50c8441fdb67', 'db_id': 6508740, 'person_id': 6302757}"

While the improved procedure is not expected to significantly change the present results regarding the global spin polarization, it may affect the estimates of the magnitude of the polarization and its energy dependence.

The global spin alignment of vector mesons, quantified by the $00^{th}$ element of spin density matrix ($\rho_{00}$), can offer information on the spin-orbital interactions of the QCD medium. Surprisingly large signal of vector meson $\rho_{00}$ compared to hyperon spin polarization poses challenges to the conventional theoretical understanding of polarization in HIC. Preliminary observations from Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) of large deviations of $\rho_{00}$ from 1/3 for $\phi$ mesons can only be explained by introducing the vector meson strong force fields.

In this talk, we will present transverse momentum and collision centrality dependence of  $\phi$, $K^{*0}$, $\overline{K^{*0}}$, $K^{*+}$, and $K^{*-}$ vector mesons using recent high statistics Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) data of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 - 27 GeV, and isobar collisions (Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The BES-II data will provide unprecedented precision in $\rho_{00}$ at these energies.

When considering heavy-ion collisions, quarkonium polarization could also be used to investigate the characteristics of the hot and dense medium (quark-gluon plasma) created at LHC energies. In ALICE, this observable was extracted for the first time in Pb-Pb collisions and a significant difference with respect to a corresponding pp measurement  of LHCb was found. This discrepancy could be related to the modification of the J/$\psi$ feed down fractions, due to the suppression of the excited states in the QGP, but also to the contribution of the regenerated J/$\psi$ in the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ region. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that quarkonium states could be polarized by the strong magnetic field, generated in the early phase of the evolution of the system, and by the large angular momentum of the medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions. This kind of information can be assessed by defining an ad hoc reference frame where the quantization axis is orthogonal to the event plane of the collision.
In this contribution, the new result of J/$\psi$ polarization with respect to the event-plane in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential measurement is performed at forward rapidity (2.5 $<$ y $<$ 4) and the results will be shown for different centrality classes.

Parallel Session T16: Light nuclei production,parallel,Properties and production of hypernuclei in relativistic ion reactions,"Botvina, Alexander",Univ. Frankfurt,Unknown,"The study of hypernuclei and their production mechanisms open new opportunities for nuclear/particle physics and astrophysics. The hyperons influence many nuclear properties in finite nuclei and in neutron stars (infinite nuclear matter). We review the main processes leading to the production of hypernuclei in nuclear reactions including relativistic ion collisions. Such deep-inelastic high-energy interactions do lead to fragmentation and multifragmentation of nuclear matter, and hyper-fragments can be abundantly produced [1,2]. The binding energies of hyperons influence the hypernuclei formation [3,4] and this gives a chance to evaluate experimentally the hyperon effects in nuclear matter. The promising process for such a hypernuclear research is a disintegration of  large excited hyper-nuclear residues produced in peripheral relativistic  nucleus-nucleus collisions. In central collisions, there is another mechanism  responsible for combining hyperons and other baryons into light clusters [5]:   The primary nuclear clusters can be formed at the subnuclear densities from  the dynamically produced baryons. These clusters are excited and their  subsequent decay is able to explain all phenomena of the fragment production  observed in central heavy-ion collisions. Our approach is able to describe  the FOPI experimental data, in particular, nuclei yields, nuclei kinetic energies, and the modification of the nuclear isotope yields with increasing the beam energy. Previously, it was not reachable with other models. Also our mechanism can lead to the correlations of the produced nuclear species and to unstable hypernuclear states. We use the transport, coalescence and statistical models to describe the whole process, and demonstrate the important regularities of the hypernuclei formation and the advantages of such reactions over the traditional hypernuclear methods: A broad distribution of predicted hypernuclei in masses and isospin allows for investigating properties of exotic hypernuclei. We point at the abundant production of multi-strange nuclei that will give an access to multi-hyperon systems and strange nuclear matter. The realistic estimates of hypernuclei yields in various collisions are presented.

Parallel Session T06: Lattice QCD and heavy-ion collisions,parallel,Computing jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in lattice QCD,"Kumar, Amit",Wayne State University,United States,"The jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ is the leading coefficient that characterizes the transverse broadening of the hard parton traversing QGP. The transverse kicks received from the medium changes the off-shellness of the hard parton, which leads to enhancement in the gluon emissions. Since the transverse broadening is the dominant mechanism responsible for the suppression of the high-transverse momentum charged-hadrons and jets, understanding the temperature and parton’s momenta dependence of $\hat{q}$ are crucial. 
In this talk, we present for the first time a lattice QCD calculation of $\hat{q}$ in pure gluonic plasma and  $n_{f}=3$ QCD plasma. In this formalism[1,2,3], we considered a light-like hard quark undergoing a single scattering with the plasma. $\hat{q}$ is factorized and expressed in terms of matrix elements for transverse broadening and field-strength field-strength correlator. The presence of the hard scale allows one to carry out Taylor expansion of the correlator after the analytic continuation to deep-Euclidean region. The leading twist operator in the operator-product expansion is computed on both quenched and unquenched lattices for a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 200MeV < T < 1GeV. The lattice extracted $\hat{q}$ from our formalism is compared with the existing (non) perturbative calculations and phenomenology-based extractions of $\hat{q}$. The computed $\hat{q}$ shows a temperature dependence similar to the entropy density and shows considerable agreement with phenomenology-based extractions carried out by the JET and JETSCAPE collaboration.

Our method can be seen as a combination of the Taylor expansion and analytic continuation approaches. Its novelty lies in using rational (Padé) approximants for studying Lee Yang edge singularities, which provide valuable insights to the occur- rence of critical phenomena in the thermodynamic limit. Several numerical experiments have been performed to test and demonstrate its accuracy and stability.
We present a calculations of the densities of conserved charges as well as chiral condensates as a function of imaginary baryon number chemical potential, obtained with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) at temporal lattice extent of $N_\tau=4,6,8$. We construct various rational function approximations of the lattice data and discuss how the closest singularities in the complex plane can be determined from them. We confirm stability of our results under conformal mappings. We discuss the universal scaling behavior of the Lee-Yang edge singularity and its role as a brunch-cut singularity in the order parameter. We apply the scaling in the vicinity of the Roberge-Weiss and chiral phase transitions. We find a temperature scaling that is in accordance with the expected power law behavior and determine some previously unknown non-universal constants. Finally we discuss the possibility to detect also the QCD critical end-point, if it exists, by this new method.

While technically our model can be regarded as a generalization of the Dual Parton Model by Capella and Tran Thanh Van, it is fundamentally based on the number of exchanged color octets (gluons) and significantly extends the Fock space of states available for the participating protons and nucleons. 

In proton-proton collisions we provide an *exact* description of the final state proton and neutron spectrum. What is remarkable is that unlike the original DPM, GEM successfully describes the proton ""diffractive peak"" at high rapidity. 

In proton-nucleus reactions we propose a statistical scheme for the process of soft color octet (gluon) exchange, based on the assumption that probabilities to form an effective diquark are equal for all allowed pairs of quarks. The latter effective diquark can form either from two valence, one valence and one sea, or from two sea quarks. Consequently we calculate the probabilities for different color configurations involving diquarks of valence-valence, valence-sea and sea-sea type. These probabilities appear to depend on the number of exchanged gluons, which results in increasing baryon stopping as a function of the number $N$ of proton-nucleon collisions in the nucleus. As such, the baryon nuclear stopping power appears to be governed by the emergence of new color configurations as a function of $N$ rather than by the energy loss of the original valence diquark.

The advantage of our approach lies in its high predictive power which makes it verifiable by the new, precise data on proton and neutron production from the CERN SPS. The latter verification, a set of predictions for the $N$-dependence of the baryon stopping process, and a discussion of implications for proton-oxygen collisions planned at the LHC, will be included in the talk.

By combining analytical insights in the few interactions limit with numerical simulations at higher opacity, we are able to describe the development of transverse flow from very small to very large opacities, realised in small and large collision systems. Surpisingly, we find that deviations between kinetic theory and hydrodynamics persist even in the limit of very large interaction rates, which can be attributed to the presence of the early pre-equilibrium phase. We discuss implications for the phenomenological description of heavy-ion collisions and the applicability of viscous hydrodynamics to describe small and large collision systems.

This fundamental information is a crucial input for models describing the initial state of heavy ion collisions. In particular the event-by-event fluctuating proton geometry should have a strong effect on the flow and multiplicity distribution in high multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions [1], assuming that a strongly interacting medium is formed in these events. Understanding the subnucleon structure to a high degree of precision is thus a prerequisite of determining whether quark gluon plasma is created in small system collisions. 

In order to extract the proton shape fluctuations (see [2]) from HERA exclusive vector meson production data in a statistically rigorous manner, we apply Bayesian inference[3]. This approach enables us to extract likelihood distributions for the non-perturbative parameters describing the proton fluctuating profile, including their correlations. The resulting posterior distributions allow for a systematic propagation of uncertainties when simulating for example high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. 

We determine how accurately the HERA data can constrain the proton fluctuating shape, and illustrate how high multiplicity proton-proton collisions can provide complementary input to exclusive scattering data.

This makes it impossible to consistently model relativistic gases using energy dependent relaxation times or more general choices of the local equilibrium state. We propose a new relaxation time approximation which fixes these fundamental flaws [2]. In this contribution, this new formulation is used to consistently calculate the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients using QCD-inspired energy-dependent relaxation times [3] and phenomenological thermal masses obtained from fits to lattice QCD thermodynamics [4].

The “bottom-up” mechanism is the well-studied phenomenological description of its approaching to thermal equilibrium, but has been restricted to leading order coupling within kinetic theory calculation. In our recent work, we provide a next-to-leading-order (NLO) weak-coupling description of the thermalization process of far-from-equilibrium non-abelian plasmas. Starting from either over- or under-occupied initial conditions, we follow their time evolution towards thermal equilibrium by numerically solving the QCD effective kinetic equation at NLO accuracy for isotropic non-abelian plasmas . It turns out that the NLO corrections remain well under control for a wide range of couplings and that the overall effect of NLO corrections is to reduce the time needed to reach thermal equilibrium in the systems considered.

To accomplish  this purpose, a comprehensive upgrade of the detector and associated systems was devised and planned to be carried out in two phases. The Phase-I upgrade program foresees new features for the muon detector, for the electromagnetic calorimeter  trigger  system and for all trigger and data acquisition chain. These upgrades are expected to be fully functional in 2021 and will enable ATLAS to carry on its physics program at a two fold increased luminosity. For the heavy-ions program, a new Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) with improved radiation hardness will be installed. Upon reaching an integrated luminosity of 350 fb-1,  the LHC will undergo a new upgrade, becoming the High-Luminosity LHC (Hl_LHC). The HL-LHC will reach an instantaneous ultimate luminosity of 7.5x1034 cm-2s-1,  which will enable the experiments to accumulate  4 ab-1 of integrated luminosity in about 10 years of operation. The challenges the ATLAS  experiment will face during the HL-LHC  stage are paramount, as it will have to cope with more than 200 simultaneous collisions per bunch crossing with many subsystems exposed to very high radiation levels.  To preserve its performance, the ATLAS detector will require  a major upgrade program, known as Phase-II upgrade program. During the  Phase-II upgrade, a completely new all-silicon tracker with extended rapidity coverage will replace the current inner tracker detector; the calorimeters and muon systems will have their trigger and data acquisition systems fully redesigned, allowing the implementation of a free-running  readout system. Finally, a new subsystem called High Granularity Timing Detector will aid the track-vertex association in the forward region by incorporating timing information to the reconstructed tracks.

Dileptons as penetrating probes are messengers of this dense medium and can reveal the thermal properties and the lifetime of the medium but also give insight into meson properties at high densities. 
In this talk we present preliminary results of HADES on the dielectron analysis of 4.5 billion Ag+Ag collisions ($0-40\%$ centrality) at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.55 \, GeV$. The upgraded RICH detector offers excellent electron identification and suppression of conversion-pairs resulting in a signal-to-background ratio larger than 1 for $M_{e^+e^-}>500 MeV/c^2$. The high statistics data sample in combination with a strongly increased electron detection effciency and background suppression allow for a differential analysis in terms of centrality or electron-pair-momentum with a signal up to the phi meson mass region. For higher pair-momenta a signal of the omega meson is clearly seen while vanishing for lower pair-momenta. The temperature extracted from the intermediate mass region compares well with the HADES measurement in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.42 \, GeV$.

While recent studies have obtained non-perturbative contributions to the collisional broadening kernel $C(b_{\bot})$ using lattice simulation of the dimensionally reduced long-distance effective theory of QCD, Electrostatic QCD (EQCD) [1], so far all phenomenological calculations of jet quenching rely on perturbative determinations of the collisional broadening kernel. By matching the short-distance behavior of the lattice extracted EQCD broadening kernel [2], we determine the fully matched QCD broadening kernel non-perturbatively. We present results for the collisional broadening kernel in impact-parameter ($C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{b}_\perp)$) and momentum space ($C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{q}_\perp)$) and employ them to determine the rates of medium induced radiation in infinite and finite size QCD plasmas [3]. By contrasting our results with leading and next-to-leading order perturbative determinations as well as various approximations of the splitting rates employed in the literature, we investigate the effect of the non-peturbative determination of  $C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{q}_\perp)$ on medium-induced radiation rates.

By comparing the decay of various initializations on the attractor in both frameworks, we test the effectiveness of hydrodynamics in providing an accurate description of the underlying kinetic theory in far-off-equilibrium regimes. We demonstrate that inclusion of even a small mass scale in units of the system’s local temperature drastically alters the well-known attractor behavior of the shear Reynolds number as observed in a weakly-coupled gas with exactly massless excitations. For generic nonzero particle mass, neither shear nor bulk viscous pressure relaxes to a far-from-equilibrium attractor; universal hydrodynamic behavior is manifest only at small values of the inverse Reynolds numbers. In kinetic theory, we find that the scaled longitudinal pressure exhibits fast decay to an early-time attractor, driven by the rapid longitudinal expansion of the medium [1]. Second-order dissipative hydrodynamics, based on a gradient expansion around local thermal equilibrium, fails to accurately describe the attractor. These results will be discussed in the light of fixed lines and fixed points of non-conformal kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. A modified anisotropic hydrodynamic prescription that provides excellent agreement with kinetic theory and reproduces the attractor will be presented [2].

We use a Colour Glass Condensate approach, and perform an expansion in $\tau$. We show that the expansion to order $\tau^6$ can be trusted to about $\tau=0.05$ fm/c. We calculate the transverse and longitudinal pressures and show that for $\tau \lt 0.05$ fm/c they move towards their equilibrium values of one third of the energy density. We study the spatial eccentricity of the plasma, and the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal momentum distribution. Our results for the Fourier coefficients are larger than  expected, which contradicts the usual assumption that anisotropy is mostly generated during the hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma. We  find a significant correlation between the elliptic flow coefficient and the eccentricity, which indicates that the spatial inhomogeneity introduced by the initial geometry is effectively transmitted to the azimuthal distribution of the gluon momentum field, even at very early times. This result is interesting because correlations of this kind are  characteristic of the onset of hydrodynamic behaviour. We also calculate the angular momentum of the glasma and obtain results that are many orders of magnitude smaller than the initial angular momentum of two ions colliding with non-zero impact parameter. This indicates that most of the angular momentum carried by the valence quarks is not transmitted to the glasma.

Theoretical calculations predict that radiative energy loss, which is the dominant mode of energy loss for gluons and light quarks in the QGP, is suppressed for heavy quarks (such as charm and bottom) at low transverse momenta ($p_{\text{T}}$). A measurement of the $D^0 (c\bar{u})$ meson radial profile in jets from the CMS experiment at the LHC hints at its modification at low $D^0$ $p_{\text{T}}$ in heavy-ion collisions, which is qualitatively different from that of the inclusive hadrons. The excellent secondary vertex resolution provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker in the STAR experiment at RHIC enables reconstruction of $D^0$ mesons at low $p_{\text{T}}$ with high significance, making STAR ideal for similar measurements.

We generalize a previously constructed partonic $T$-matrix approach to finite chemical potential to calculate various susceptibilities, in particular for configurations containing a heavy charm quark. At vanishing chemical potential and moderate temperatures, this approach predicts large collisional widths of partons generated by dynamically formed hadronic resonance states which lead to transport parameters characteristic for a strongly coupled system. The quark chemical potential dependence is implemented into the propagators and the in-medium color potential, where two newly introduced parameters for the thermal and screening masses are fixed through a fit to the baryon number susceptibility, $\chi^B_2$. With this setup, we calculate heavy-light susceptibilities without further tuning; the results qualitatively agree with the lattice-QCD (lQCD) data for both $\chi^{uc}_{11}$ and $\chi^{uc}_{22}$. This implies that the lQCD results are compatible with a significant content of broad $D$-meson and charm-light diquark bound states in a moderately hot QGP.

This poses strong limitations not only to the search of molecular states composed of charm and non-charm hadrons, but also to the study of the rescattering of charm mesons following their formation in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In such collisions a colour-deconfined medium, called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is formed. The system experiences a hydrodynamic expansion cooling down up to the chemical freeze-out, which is followed by a hadronic phase. The knowledge of the scattering parameters of charm hadrons with non-charm hadrons would be a crucial ingredient for models based on charm-quark transport in a hydrodynamically expanding QGP to describe the typical observables of heavy-ion collisions. 

In this talk we will report on the first estimation of the scattering parameters governing the strong interaction of the D-proton channel measured by the ALICE Collaboration in high-multiplicity pp collision at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV at the LHC. The strong interaction is studied by means of correlation in momentum space and the analysis is extended to D-kaon and D-pion combinations.

This talk presents new, comprehensive and precision measurements of $v_n-[p_\mathrm{T}]$ correlation in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe and $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions for harmonics $n = 2$, 3, and 4.  The results are obtained via the standard and subevents cumulant methods to assess the role of non-flow and flow decorrelations in these observables, and they are found to be small in the mid-central and central collisions in these systems.  All PCC coefficients, $\rho_2$, $\rho_3$ and $\rho_4$ show rich and non-monotonic dependence on centrality, $p_\mathrm{T}$ and $\eta$, reflecting the fact that different ingredients of the initial state impact different regions of the phase space. For example, it was found the result depends on the centrality estimator used in the analysis, indicating a strong influence of volume fluctuations. On the other hand, the ratio of $\rho_2$ between the two systems is less sensitive to the centrality estimator, and in the ultra-central region, the value of the ratio suggests that $^{129}$Xe has large quadrupole deformation but with a significant triaxial. All current models fail to describe many of the observed trends in the data, pointing to the unprecedented constraining power enabled by this precision measurement.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Somadutta', 'last_name': 'Bhatta', 'fullName': 'Bhatta, Somadutta', 'id': '6580490', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University (US)', 'emailHash': '3f48a935c036f20fc74d145d39711304', 'db_id': 6580490, 'person_id': 6334522}"

In particular, the flow vectors at two different transverse momenta fluctuate with respect to each other. One way to probe this flow fluctuation is to study the decorrelation between the flow at two different momentum bins. However, the flow vector decorrelation 
    can occur as a combined effect of flow magnitude fluctuation and flow angle (flow direction) fluctuation. Thus, these flow fluctuations can be mapped using the flow factorization breaking coefficient. Moreover, the  factorization breaking coefficient for  second moments of flow vectors can be constructed. This additional observables allow to measure separately  the flow magnitude and the flow angle decorrelation. Following the preliminary data from ALICE, we study the correlation between the harmonic flow squared, where one of the flow is fixed at a transverse momenta and the other is averaged over the momentum range (global flow). As a result of the factorization, the independent measurement of the flow vector correlation and flow magnitude correlation can lead to the possible extraction of flow angle correlation. Our model results are compared to the data. We also study the momentum dependent correlation between mixed flow harmonics and present possible predictions, which

Parallel Session T07: Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Charmed hadron interactions and correlation functions,"Ohnishi, Akira",Kyoto University,Unknown,"Charmed hadron interactions are very important in current exotic hadron physics. For example, charmed pentaquark state ($P_c$) appears around the $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, and then $P_c$'s are suggested to be hadron molecules caused by the attraction between $\Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^{(*)}$. While it is difficult to perform charmed hadron scattering, recent femtoscopic studies allows us to get information on charmed hadron interactions. Since the correlation function $C(q)$ is given as the convolution of the source function and the wave function squared, $C(q)$ tells us how much the wave function is enhanced or suppressed from the free case provided that the source function is known. 

In this presentation, we discuss the charmed hadron interactions and correlation functions [1]. Specifically, we consider $pD^{\pm}$, $DD^{*}$ and $D\bar{D}^{*}$ pairs, which are related to the (singly) charmed pentaquark state, $T_{cc}$, and $X(3872)$, respectively. As the first step, we use one-range Gaussian potentials whose strength are determined to reproduce the scattering lengths in theoretical models ($DN$ and $\bar{D}N$) or the binding energies ($DD^*$ and $D\bar{D}^*$). The calculated correlation functions show significant dependence on the interactions and the source size. Thus measurement of these correlation functions will judge theoretical models and the molecule picture of exotic hadrons.

Parallel Session T07: Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Longitudinal Decorrelation Measurements from $pp$ to A+A with the ATLAS detector,"Seidlitz, Blair Daniel",University of Colorado Boulder (US),USA,"This talk presents a new measurement of longitudinal decorrelation in $pp$ collisions with ATLAS.  It is expected that the deposited energy in the transverse ($x,y$) plane varies, depending on the longitudinal ($z$) slice examined, which is correlated with the rapidity of the produced particles.   Thus, particles from different rapidity slices will have flow vectors that differ in magnitude and orientation due to the longitudinal variation, longitudinal decorrelation, which grows with increasing particle rapidity separation.   For flow harmonic $n$, such longitudinal decorrelations have been characterized, for large systems, in terms of $r_{n}$, the ratio of large-rapidity-gap to small-rapidity-gap correlations. This analysis performs the first measurements of $r_n$ in $pp$ collisions at 5~TeV and 13~TeV. The analysis is carried out via a two-particle correlation method, utilizing charged tracks of varying $\eta$ within $|\eta| < 2.5$ and topo-clusters of $4.0<|\eta_\text{ref}|<4.9$. Because non-flow effects are more significant in $pp$ collisions, non-flow template subtraction procedures are applied. Final results are quoted for $r_{2}$ and its slope $F_{2}$, over a range of multiplicities. Similar non-flow subtraction techniques are applied to the full multiplicity range of Xe+Xe collision data and the results are compared to the two $pp$ energies at appropriate multiplicities.

The experimental data of the STAR and ALICE Collaborations are consistent at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \geq 20$ GeV with simultaneous effects of global baryon number conservation and repulsive interactions in baryon sector, the magnitude of the latter being in line with the behavior of baryon number susceptibilities observed in lattice QCD. The STAR and HADES data at lower collision energies show indications for notable multi-particle correlations, which can indicate sizable attractive interactions among baryons due to the QCD critical point in baryon-rich region as well as the influence of volume fluctuations.

We compare the asymptotics from the opacity expansion to a recent twist-4 derivation of $\langle p_\perp^2\rangle$ and find a qualitative disagreement: the twist-4 derivation predicts a jet broadening while the opacity expansion method predicts a narrowing.

for the existence of the so-called critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram. Lattice QCD
calculations at smaller than physical quark masses, combined with our model based understanding of 
the QCD phase diagram, suggest that this critical point, if it exists, needs to be searched for at
temperatures below $T\sim 140~$MeV. Following the rather small decrease of the QCD pseudo-critical 
temperature with increasing baryon chemical potentials ($\mu_B$), it is expected that such low 
temperatures will only be reached for $\mu_B\ge 400~$MeV. These large values of $\mu_B$ and low 
temperatures are reached at freeze-out in heavy ion collisions only for beam energies less than 10 GeV.

In this low temperature, high density regime studies of QCD thermodynamics with straightforward 
Taylor expansions are likely to fail. We extend our Taylor series expansion down to temperatures of
125~MeV and use the high statistics results for conserved charge cumulants up to 8th order, obtained 
by the HotQCD collaboration, to resum Taylor expansions of the logarithm of the QCD partition function.
We will construct resumed results for cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations at low temperature and 
high density and show that the diagonal Pade-approximants for 8th order Taylor series in all three conserved 
charge chemical potentials can have real poles, signaling the occurrence of a phase transition, only at 
temperatures below 140 MeV. This gives further support for a CEP at low temperatures. 
 
We will use these Taylor expansions and their Pade resummations for a determination of freeze-out conditions

fluctuations. We compare these calculations with experimental determinations of freeze-out parameters obtained
