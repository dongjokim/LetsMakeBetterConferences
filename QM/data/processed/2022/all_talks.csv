Poster Session 3 T16,poster,Lifetime measurements of light hypernuclei in Au+Au Collisions from STAR experiment,"Li, Xiujun",USTC,Unknown,"Hypernuclei are bound nuclear systems of correlated nucleons and hyperons. Therefore, the production of hypernuclei in heavy-ion collisions provides an experimental avenue for studying the hyperon$-$nucleon (Y-N) interaction, which is an important ingredient, not only in the equation-of-state (EoS) of astrophysical objects such as neutron stars but also in the description of the hadronic phase of a heavy-ion collision. The strength of the Y-N interaction can be investigated by measuring the properties of hypernuclei. For example, light $\Lambda$-hypernuclei containing one hyperon are conventionally understood as a weakly bound system of a $\Lambda$ and a nucleus, suggesting their lifetimes are close to the free-$\Lambda$ lifetime.

In heavy-ion collisions, light hypernuclei are expected to be abundantly produced at low energies due to the high baryon density. In this poster, we will report precise lifetime measurements of $^3_{\Lambda}H$, $^4_{\Lambda}H$ and $^4_{\Lambda}He$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3 GeV and 7.2 GeV, recorded by the  STAR experiment at RHIC in the fixed-target mode in 2018.

A dedicated online software system, including the quality control and detector slow control system, is being developed. The quality control system will analyze and display the performance of MVTX in real time for online monitoring. The analysis results will be stored in the database to be retrieved later and studied over a period of time. The detector slow control system is based on WinCC. Shifters can use it to operate the MVTX detector according to real time feedback from the quality control system to maintain the functionality and safety of MVTX. The online system will be used in MVTX commissioning and in the runs to ensure high quality data taking. In this poster, the design and framework of the online system will be discussed.

The observables that enable these studies require precise tracking provided by three tracking detectors:  The innermost MAPS-based vertex detector, a high time-resolution silicon strip detector, and a compact time projection chamber (TPC) with continuous readout through a GEM-based avalanche stage.  To meet the needs of the physics program, distortions of the trajectories of drift electrons in the TPC, due to magnetic field and spacecharge effects, must be accurately measured and corrected.  In addition to monitoring time-averaged distortions through particle tracks, the TPC has several dedicated components to constrain the distortions.  The charge arriving at the readout is digitized and summed into a 'digital current', which monitors the spacecharge flowing back into the volume, and two laser calibration systems monitor the static and short-timescale components of the distortions directly. This poster will discuss the expected magnitudes and structures of the distortions, the systems that monitor those distortions, and the derivation of the necessary corrections; details of how these corrections are implemented in tracking are described in a separate poster.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ross', 'last_name': 'Corliss', 'fullName': 'Corliss, Ross', 'id': '6539921', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'a54719986952491eab64e7989c31f9ef', 'db_id': 6539921, 'person_id': 6348510}"

"Parallel Session T02: Chirality, vorticity and spin polarization",parallel,Collectivity in intermediate-scale QGP and extended hydrodynamic regime,"Yin, Yi","Institute of modern physics, Chinese Academy of Sciencessti",Unknown,"The quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is a fluid at a long wavelength and becomes a collection of weakly-coupled partons at an asymptotically short wavelength. However, its properties at the ""mesoscopic"" length scale, which is too short for a fluid description and too long for a perturbative treatment, remain elusive. In this work, we consider the response of QCD-like plasma to energy/momentum disturbance as a function of the gradient. For both N=4 super-Yang Mills theory in strong coupling limit and kinetic theory under relaxation time approximation, we find that hydrodynamic modes continue dominating medium's response even in the region where Knudsen number is large. However, in this extended hydrodynamic regime, both the first-order and second-order hydrodynamics fail to characterize medium's behavior. Inspired by the recent development in extended hydrodynamics, such as Hydro+ [1], we construct a simple yet not trivial extension of the Muller-Israel-Stewart theory, namely MIS*, and show this novel framework can quantitatively describe hydrodynamic modes in both hydrodynamic and extended hydrodynamic regimes with a suitable choice of model parameters for representative microscopic theories with and without quasi-particle descriptions [2].¬†As an illustration, we apply MIS* to study how a Bjorken-expanding QGP responds to a moving energetic parton [3].

In the heavy quark limit, this coefficient is encoded in the spectral functions of color-electric and color-magnetic correlators that we calculate on the lattice to high precision by applying gradient flow. In our study we consider quenched QCD at $1.5\,T_c$, where we perform a detailed study of the lattice spacing and flow time dependence of color-electric and color-magnetic correlators, and, using theoretically well-established model fits for the spectral reconstruction,
we estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient.

In particular, the relative sizes of the modification of quark and gluon jets differ between theoretical models. Therefore a fully data-driven technique is crucial for an unbiased extraction of the quark and gluon jet spectra and substructure. We perform a proof-of-concept study based on proton-proton and heavy-ion collision events from the PYQUEN generator with statistics accessible in Run 4 of the Large Hadron Collider. We use a statistical technique called topic modeling to separate quark and gluon contributions to jet observables. We demonstrate that jet substructure observables, such as the jet shape and jet fragmentation function, can be extracted using this data-driven method. These results suggest the potential for an experimental determination of quark and gluon jet spectra and their substructure.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yueyang', 'last_name': 'Ying', 'fullName': 'Ying, Yueyang', 'id': '6522673', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '15f4c1ab63ea6713e2a033d5e520cec4', 'db_id': 6522673, 'person_id': 6335924}"
Poster Session 3 T16,poster,Measurements of $^{3}_{\Lambda}H$ production and branching ratio fraction $R_3$ by the STAR experiment,"Ji, Yuanjing",Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,USA,"Hypernuclei are bound states of nucleons and hyperons, and thus naturally correlated hyperon-baryon systems. Hypernuclei are regarded a unique laboratory to study the hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interaction. The $Y$-$N$ interaction is an important ingredient, not only in the equation-of-state (EoS) of astrophysical objects such as neutron stars, but also in the description of the hadronic phase of a heavy-ion collision. The strength of the $Y$-$N$ interaction can be investigated by measuring the properties of hypernuclei. Precise determination of hypernucei structure parameters, such as $\Lambda$ separation energy $B_{\Lambda}$, lifetime, and branching ratios, may also shed light on the role that two-body $Y$-$N$ and three-body $Y$-$N$-$N$ interactions play in the density regime of neutron stars.

Therefore, they can probe the early, gluon rich and out-of-equilibrium stage, namely the evolving Glasma. The diffusion of heavy quarks in this system can be analyzed by coupling the Classical Yang-Mills equations for the Glasma to the relativistic kinetic equations (Wong equations) for the heavy quarks. Within this framework, we study in detail the diffusion of heavy quarks in the early stage of proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Firstly, we discuss transverse and longitudinal momentum broadening, emphasizing the impact of this on the nuclear modification factor and on the estimates of the diffusion coefficients of the heavy quarks. Then, we analyze the 2-particle correlations developed by heavy quarks in the Glasma and discuss their potential impact on D-Dbar correlations recently measured at the LHC. Finally, we compare the evolution in the Glasma with that in a gluon plasma, described by Langevin equations with transport coefficients borrowed from quasi-particle models and tuned to reproduce the nuclear modification factor of heavy mesons.

So far, quantum computing has seen ample application in areas such as quantum chemistry or condensed matter, but its usage in high energy physics is still in its infancy. In the particular case of QCD jets, these technologies might offer a way to, for the first time, fully understand the intricate interference pattern arising from the multi-parton cascade. In jet quenching, such aspects are intimately related to the natural scales at which the jet probes the medium.

Poster Session 3 T16,poster,Elliptic flow of light nuclei in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27 and 54.4 GeV,"Sharma, Rishabh ",Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati,Unknown,"High energy heavy-ion collisions provide an opportunity to study the production mechanism of light (anti)nuclei. There are two main possible models to explain the production mechanism - the thermal model and the coalescence model. The thermal model has been quite successful in explaining the yields of light (anti)nuclei produced in heavy-ion collisions. Thermal model suggests that the light (anti)nuclei are produced from a thermal source, where they are in equilibrium with other species present in the fireball. However, due to the small binding energies, the produced (anti)nuclei are not likely to survive in the high temperature conditions of the fireball. The coalescence model, on the other hand, predicts that light (anti)nuclei can be formed by the final state coalescence of nucleons. Studying the azimuthal anisotropy of light (anti)nuclei and comparing them with that of nucleons, therefore, will give insights into the production mechanism of light (anti)nuclei.

In this poster, we will present the energy and centrality dependence of elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $d$, $t$, and $^3He$ and their antiparticles in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27 and 54.4 GeV.

Poster Session 3 T11_3,poster,Heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions with JETSCAPE,"Fan, Wenkai",Duke University,Unknown,"The dynamics of shower development for a jet traveling through the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) involves a variety of scales, including the mass for heavy flavors in jets. During the high virtuality portion of the jet evolution, the mass of the heavy quark affects longitudinal drag and diffusion, stimulating additional radiation. These emissions partially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In the lower virtuality part of the shower evolution, when the mass is comparable to the transverse momentum of the parton, scattering and radiation processes off heavy quarks are different than off light quarks. All these factors result in a different shower development for heavy-flavor tagged jets. The QGP evolution is modeled on an event by event basis using the JETSCAPE Framework. Energy-momentum exchange with the medium, essential for the study of jet modification, proceeds using a weak coupling recoil approach.  We present a multi-stage calculation that explores the importance of differences between various heavy quark energy-loss mechanisms. Those differences have been explored using leading hadron and open heavy flavor observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wenkai', 'last_name': 'Fan', 'fullName': 'Fan, Wenkai', 'id': '6539114', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'ade40bbecb29c523346c38043804d03f', 'db_id': 6539114, 'person_id': 6335801}"

In order to make such a measurement, the response of the detector material to the produced primary particles has to be understood. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the detector response matrix which is then used in an iterative unfolding procedure to obtain the corrected pseudorapidity distributions.

In this context the $\phi$ meson is a very interesting candidate because of its structure, being a strangeness-neutral hadron that shows the characteristic features of strangeness enhancement, contrary to the expectations from of the strangeness-canonical implementation of thermal models.
A new analysis has been developed to measure the production of $\phi$-meson pairs in proton-proton collisions with the ALICE experiment  at the LHC. This novel approach allows one to measure the second moment (variance) of the $\phi$-meson number distribution and therefore to gain insight into deeper details of the $\phi$-meson production statistics in minimum bias pp collisions and as a function of the final-state charged-particle multiplicity.

In contrast to geometrical models (e.g. a Glauber approach) our transport approach allows to access the full phase-space information of every particle at any time. The importance of understanding the non-equilibrium angular momentum transferred to the fireball and in turn the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was highlighted by recent results of the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The spin polarization measurement of the $\Lambda$-hyperon  revealed a high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence for vorticity in the QGP for the first time. Therefore, a systematic exploration of the angular momentum within a dynamic calculation for beam energies from $\sqrt{s}_{NN}= 2.41GeV$ to $\sqrt{s}_{NN}= 200GeV$ is a crucial step towards the full description of vorticity as a fundamental property of the QGP. Results for the angular momentum of Au-Au collisions as function of the impact parameter are presented and the influence of the initial Fermi momentum is studied. Moreover, it is shown that the angular momentum exhibits a distinct maximum for a specific impact parameter, independent of the beam energy. We show that the remaining angular momentum $L_r$ of the system grows with increasing system size in a range of $A=16$ $(^{16}_8O)$ to $A=208$ $(^{208}_{82}Pb)$ while we observe that for smaller beam energies a larger fraction of the initial angular momentum is transferred to $L_r$.

Due to the nature of a jet, as a composite object of multiple particles, there are many observables one could construct and study. There is no indication that a single observable will be sufficient to understand the interaction of the parton shower with the hot QCD medium. We investigate how the correlation of jet observables is affected by jet quenching. The medium effect on this correlation is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence and a principle component analysis. We also consider the experimental constraints and the influence of the large uncorrelated background present in heavy-ion collisions on the measurement of these observables. We present a framework in which all these ingredients are combined to determine which correlation of observables can be best used to constrain the medium-jet modification while being robust against the large underlying event.

In general, this procedure gives rise to terms of order Kn^2 (second order in gradients), which are parabolic in nature and thus acausal. In this contribution, we rigorously eliminate all parabolic terms by systematically expressing the Kn^2 terms as terms of order Re^{-1} Kn (proportional to the first order gradient of the dissipative quantities). We therefore refer to this scheme as the Inverse Reynolds Dominance (IReD) approach [2]. This procedure fixes the relaxation times of the dissipative quantities in terms of the inverse of the collision matrix and thermodynamic integrals. In particular, we find that the relaxation times corresponding to higher order moments grow as their order increases, thereby contradicting the separation of scales paradigm. The formal (up to second order) equivalence with the standard DNMR approach is proven and the connection between the IReD transport coefficients and the usual DNMR ones is established.

The latter is the first ever measurement of this effect in small systems at the CERN SPS.

The data on both effects are shown as a function of collision centrality and energy and compared to model predictions, as well as to existing results from the NA49 experiment. In Pb+Pb collisions, the negative pion directed flow changes sign as a function of transverse momentum, an effect which strongly depends on collision energy. For protons and pions, the difference in sign of directed flow slope at midrapidity reflects the momentum exchange between expanding matter and spectators.

In Ar+Sc collisions, in spite of their small spectator charge, a very significant electromagnetic distortion of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ distributions is apparent as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity, qualitatively similar to heavy ion reactions where the spectator charge also results in splitting of $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ directed flow. This brings specific implications for the space-time evolution of the fireball which are studied by model calculations. The latter also point at the role of spectator fragmentation, and estimate the influence of vorticity in the observed phenomena.",

The theory of classical universal computation was laid down in 1936, was implemented within a decade, became commercial within another decade, and dominated the world‚Äôs economy half a century later. This success story relied on the progress in technology. As computers become faster they must become smaller. The history of computer technology has involved a sequence of changes from one type of physical realisation to another, with smaller and smaller components. The unavoidable step to the quantum level will be one in this sequence; but it promises something more exciting as well. It can support entirely new modes of computation that do not have classical analogues. At present it is not clear when, how and even whether fully-fledged quantum computers will eventually be built; but notwithstanding this, the quantum theory of computation already plays a much more fundamental role in the scheme of things than its classical predecessor did. I believe that anyone who seeks a fundamental understanding of either physics, computation or logic must incorporate its new insights into their world view.

We report our results on fits of the ratios of particle yields measured in a wide range of centre-of-mass energies from a few GeV up to 2.76 TeV. In particular, our analysis of the STAR experiment data on hadronic multiplicities demonstrates that taking into account the weak decays is extremely important to have a model that can describe the data with high accuracy and in a physically correct way. Moreover, the inclusion of weak decays in the analysis of BES data leads to a decrease in the chemical freeze-out (CFO) temperature of hadrons by about $10-15$ MeV. For the first time, the results for the CFO parameters obtained by the fits to the BES program data in the collision energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-200$ GeV are in complete agreement with the ones obtained earlier in different models for the ALICE energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV [2,3] as well as with the Lattice QCD results for the pseudocritical line [4]. Remarkably, it is shown that the CFO parameters of light (anti-, hyper-) nuclei obtained in [5] are not affected by these modifications. They are in agreement with the PHQMD simulations [6] and provide a solution to the so-called ‚Äúsnowballs in hell‚Äù problem.

Poster Session 3 T15 / T16,poster,Triggering for high-multiplicity events in $pp$ collisions in ATLAS,"Gilbert, Alexander Kevin",Unknown,Unknown,"Conducting inclusive studies by the ATLAS experiment requires collecting maximally unbiased collision samples. The signature of such a collision is the presence of charged particles tracked down to a very low transverse momentum.  In addition, the sample of events with high track multiplicity needs to be enriched in $pp$ and $p$+Pb collisions.  In the case of $pp$ collisions, the trigger needs to be robust to select high multiplicity collisions with high purity despite not insignificant pileup. The ATLAS trigger system consists of hardware L1 and software HLT systems. The former is incapable of initiating detector readout based on the presence of reconstructed track. Instead, it provides indications of a signal in Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators, summed energy deposit in calorimeters, or simply random events that are used to direct the events to further analysis by the HLT. The HLT in turn is capable of reconstructing tracks. 
Both systems underwent an upgrade during the LHC Long Shutdown 2. In particular, the HLT software was rewritten to be multi-threaded and thus better use modern hardware. The functionality of the inclusive trigger needed to be restored.
Given that the HLT resources are limited, the sequence of selection consists of several fine-tuned steps that need modernization and adaptations. Among various triggers the selection of high multiplicity events is particularly demanding due to the high computational cost of performing tracks reconstruction online. To mitigate that, a ZFinder algorithm for finding an approximation of the collision vertices without reconstructing charged particle tracks was developed. The ZFinder uses extrapolations of approximate helix segments through multiplets of space-points from the tracking detectors. Along with the vertex position an estimate of multiplicity is obtained and can be used for triggering on high multiplicity events in pp and p+Pb. 

 The performance studies; efficiency, purity, and pileup robustness of the ZFinder algorithm for the high-multiplicity pp collisions will be presented in the poster.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alexander Kevin', 'last_name': 'Gilbert', 'fullName': 'Gilbert, Alexander Kevin', 'id': '6580776', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fa4b3cba3770bea90d326ed7f2b021d0', 'db_id': 6580776, 'person_id': 6509013}"
Parallel Session T01: Initial state physics and approach to thermal equilibrium,parallel,Constraints on neutron skin thickness and nuclear deformations using relativistic heavy-ion collisions from STAR,"Xu, Haojie",Huzhou University,Unknown,"RHIC's capability to perform relativistic collisions of various ion species provides a unique opportunity to explore and constrain neutron skin thickness and deformation parameters of nuclei. 
 

The study of neutron skin thickness $\Delta r_{np}$ of nuclei can help us directly infer nuclear symmetry energy. Such information is of critical importance to the equation of state of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars and the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions. The $\Delta r_{np}$ has traditionally been measured in low-energy hadronic and nuclear scattering experiments over decades. An alternate recent measurement using parity-violating electroweak interactions by the PREX-II experiment has yielded a large neutron skin thickness of Pb nucleus [1] that is in tension with the world-wide data established in hadronic collisions. In isobar collisions at relativistic energies, the effect of neutron skin was predicted [2] to yield different multiplicities and elliptic flows. They, in turn, provide an unconventional but more precise method to probe the neutron skin [3]. The idea is to compare the produced hadron multiplicities ($N_{\rm ch}$) [3], the mean transverse momenta ($\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$) [4], and the net charge multiplicities ($\Delta Q$) [5] to trace back to the neutron skin differences between the isobar nuclei. 

Nuclear deformation, a ubiquitous phenomenon for most atomic nuclei, reflects collective motion induced by the interaction between valence nucleons and shell structure. In most cases, the deformation has a quadrupole shape that is characterized by overall strength $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and/or an octuple shape $\beta_3$. In relativistic collisions of two nuclei such deformations enhance the fluctuations of bulk observables that are sensitive to initial state geometry [6]. The deformation parameters can be constrained from the precision measurements of the ratios of harmonic anisotropy coefficients $v_2$, $v_3$, mean transverse momentum $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ fluctuations (mean, variance and skewness), and their Pearson correlation coefficient $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ between two isobar systems [7]. In Au+Au and U+U collisions the same can be done by performing measurement of $v_2$, cumulants of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ distributions, and $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ [8]. 

In this talk we will discuss the aforementioned measurements in Au+Au, U+U and isobar $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV using the STAR detector. We will discuss how we extract the neutron skin thickness and the symmetry energy slope parameter from these data. We will contrast our results in the context of the global data on symmetry energy and tension with the PREX-II data. We will discuss how the significant deviations of the ratios of $v_2$ and $v_3$ from unity in isobar collisions are indicative of large quadrupole and octuple deformations in Ru and Zr nuclei, respectively [9]. We will also discuss how the relative enhancement of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$-skewness, sign-change of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$-kurtosis and the suppression of $\rho(v_n^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ in U+U relative to Au+Au collisions are consistent with a large prolate deformation of the uranium nuclei.

in this work, we present a comprehensive study of the $m_{T}$-scaling at

systematic pattern in the scaling properties of mesons, which is related
to the particle quark content. In particular, light species and
ground-state quarkonia obey the same scaling, whereas open flavor
particles deviate from it because their spectra are significantly
harder. The magnitude of deviation depends on the flavor of the heaviest

the excited bottomonia states leads to the conclusion that the existing

In this context, light-flavour particle production measurements play a key role, as they can probe statistical hadronization and partonic collectivity. Recent measurements in small colliding systems (pp and p-Pb) highlight an enhancement of produced strange hadrons with increasing multiplicities.

How do we further probe whether the multiplicity in itself is the driving force behind this effect? In this contribution we will study the production of strange light-flavour hadrons at low-multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt(s)=5.02$ TeV, extending at low multiplicity the observations reported in pp, p-Pb and A-A interactions, in order to probe the onset of strangeness enhancement.

In contrast, this contribution we will discuss light-flavour particle production in pp collisions at $\sqrt(s)=13$ TeV, constrained to high multiplicities as a function of event topology. The event topology in this analysis is estimated through the transverse spherocity, which categorizes events based on the azimuthal distribution of tracks. The transverse spherocity is sensitive to the hard and soft processes and is a useful tool to distinguish the isotropic and jet dominated events in pp collisions. The interplay between multiplicity and transverse spherocity classes on light-flavour production can be understood by comparing the results obtained from the extreme selection of multiplicity and/or transverse spherocity.

These measurements will be compared with the Monte Carlo (MC) predictions obtained from models such as PYTHIA 8 and Herwig7.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adrian Fereydon', 'last_name': 'Nassirpour', 'fullName': 'Nassirpour, Adrian Fereydon', 'id': '6545227', 'affiliation': 'Lund University (SE)', 'emailHash': '45dceafc80ec6bce1a62e5115d0b16d4', 'db_id': 6545227, 'person_id': 6330973}"

Nuclear deformation enhances the fluctuations of harmonic flow and radial flow, and therefore, can be probed by $v_2$, $v_3$, and mean transverse momentum $[p_\mathrm{T}]$ fluctuations. Furthermore, deformation parameters can be constrained very precisely from ratios of flow measurements in two systems of isobar collisions. We present two sets of results:

The enhancement of $[p_\mathrm{T}]$-skewness and the suppression of $\rho(v_2^2,[p_\mathrm{T}])$ is consistent with large prolate deformation for Uranium.

Parallel Session T08: Strongly coupled systems,parallel,"The splitting of directed flow for identified light hadrons (\pi, K, and p) and strange baryons (\Xi and \Omega) in Au+Au and isobar collisions at STAR","Ikbal, Ashik",Unknown,Unknown,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the directed flow ($v_1$) of hadrons can provide insights into the ultra-strong electromagnetic (EM) field~[1-2], the constituent quark content of hadrons~[3], and the role of transported quarks~[4]. Here, the first measurement is reported for rapidity-odd directed flow of $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 27, and 200 GeV, as well as $v_1$ for identified charged hadrons with unprecedented precision in Au+Au and isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV.  
The coalescence sum rule is examined with various combinations of hadrons where all constituent quarks are produced. For such combinations a systematic violation of the sum rule is observed with increasing difference in the electric charge and the strangeness content of the associated constituent quarks. By comparing with the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics model that includes an EM field, the results suggest that the constituent quark sum rule could be violated in the presence of a strong EM field that drives the $v_1$ of produced quarks and anti-quarks to opposite directions. The splitting of $v_1$ slope with rapidity ($\Delta (dv_1/dy)$) between positively and negatively charged hadrons ($\pi$, $K$, $p$) is also studied with large statistics. A clear transition of $\Delta(dv_1/dy)$ from positive in central collisions to negative in peripheral collisions is observed for protons and kaons. With the effects of both transported quarks and the EM field considered, it is found that the significant negative values in peripheral events can only be explained by the presence of an EM field with the Faraday or Coulomb effect being dominant.

"Parallel Session T02: Chirality, vorticity and spin polarization",parallel,Measurements of hyperon polarization in heavy-ion collisions at \sqrt{sNN} = 3 - 200 GeV with the STAR detector,"Adams, Joseph",Ohio State University,USA,"In heavy-ion collisions, the observation of the global hyperon polarization, $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$, ranging from $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=7.7$~GeV to 5.02~TeV has revealed the existence of large vorticities perpendicular to the reaction plane due to system's orbital angular momentum. We present recent results on $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$, and differential measurements thereof, extended to the low energies of 3 and 7.2~GeV~[1]. A notable advantage of the STAR acceptance at low $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ is the ability to measure the dependence of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ on $y$ across the full range of hyperon production in $y$ which can test the predictions of numerous model calculations. Further studies of differential measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ are presented as well using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=19.6$ and $27$~GeV which allow for comparisons to the low-$\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ measurements presented here and to the high-energy measurements studied in Ref.~[2]. Studies of the vortical flow structure's dependence on system size are also possible using Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV which are presented here as well. Furthermore, while $\overline{P}_\mathrm{H}$ reveals information about the vorticity driven by angular momentum, a recent study~[3] measuring local polarization along the beam direction, $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$, revealed vorticity in the QGP arising from collective flow. The measurement stands in disagreement with a number of model calculations and, to shed light on the matter, measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$ can be conducted in smaller systems than Au+Au or relative to higher-order event-plane angles. These measurements of $\overline{P}_\mathrm{Z}$ in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$~GeV presented here will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of flow-driven vorticity.

To address these open questions we propose the study of particle production and collectivity for varying system sizes, presented in decreasing order (Au+Au $>$ Ru+Ru/Zr+Zr $>$ $^{3}$He+Au $>$ d+Au $>$ p+Au $>$ p+p $>$ $\gamma$+Au), available at RHIC using the STAR detector. 

We present the first measurements of charged hadron yields in isobar (Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr) collisions. We perform measurements of identified particle spectra at low transverse momenta ($p_\mathrm{T}$) as a function of rapidity and event centrality. We also perform the centrality dependent measurements of nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) at high $p_\mathrm{T}$. Combined with the existing results in smaller systems (p/d+Au), these results provide an additional handle in studying system size and collision geometry dependences of the medium modification to particle production.

We also revisit the measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) anisotropies in p+Au, d+Au and $^{3}$He+Au collisions at 200 GeV including a comprehensive evaluation of the non-flow effects using different subtraction methods.
In addition to the results obtained from the mid-rapidity ($|\eta|<$1), we also use the Event Plane Detectors that span over 2.1$<|\eta|<$5.1 to investigate the potential influence of longitudinal flow de-correlations in $v_n$ measurements using peripheral Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions. 

Our study of photonuclear ($\gamma$+Au) processes using ultra-peripheral Au+Au data can push the boundaries of small system scan at RHIC.

However, their production mechanisms are currently not well understood. Measurements of the yield and collective flow are sensitive to their production mechanisms and the dynamics of the produced medium. In particular, hypernuclei measurements may also bear implications on the hyperon-nucleon interaction, which is critical to understanding the nuclear equation of state in high baryon density medium including strangeness degrees of freedom.

Light nuclei, such as deuteron ($d$), triton ($t$), and helium ($^{3}\mathrm{He}$, $^{4}\mathrm{He}$), are loosely bound objects that are expected to be formed at the late stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The measurement of two-particle correlations for various light nuclei combinations provides a unique tool to obtain detailed information about the spatial and temporal evolution of the particle emitting source as well as the isospin dependence of strong interaction. This analysis can be further applied to investigate the production mechanism of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions, such as coalescence vs. thermal production. 
    
For the case of strange particles, such as kaons and hyperons, the correlation functions are sensitive to the early stage of the collision evolution and provide different information about particle-emitting sources compared to pions. Information on the final state interactions amongst the particles under study can also be extracted from the measurement. Further, one could investigate hyperon-nucleon interactions which is little known.

Therefore, they provide a novel tool to test the spatial and polarization dependent effects predicted by QED for vacuum birefringence and the Breit-Wheeler process.

The degree of relaxation between vorticity and parton spin polarization, and the degree of coherence of the hadron wavefunction at freeze-out.
We show, using a coalescence model, that local spin density and vorticity impact the hadron wavefunction in different ways, and this is much more straight-forward to disentangle for a vector meson than for a spin 1/2 baryon.

Poster Session 1 T02,poster,Canonical vs. Phenomenological Formulations of the Spin Hydrodynamics,"Daher, Asaad",Unknown,Unknown,"Recent observations of the spin polarization of weakly decaying Lambda hyperons have opened up a new direction to explore non-trivial vortical structures of strongly interacting matter produced in the heavy-ion experiments. A consistent framework of relativistic hydrodynamics with spin degrees of freedom (spin hydrodynamics) is under construction now to allow for future dynamic simulations of the spin polarization. This type of hydrodynamic description is based on the conservation of the total energy and linear momentum as well as the total angular momentum which includes both the orbital and spin parts. 


The phenomenological approach used to construct the framework of spin hydrodynamics commonly uses a simplified form of the spin tensor [1,2]. This form does not posses an expected symmetry, namely, it is not totally anti-symmetric (which is a direct consequence of Noether's Theorem applied to the Dirac Lagrangian). Consequently, in this approach the connection between the spin hydrodynamics and the underlying field-theoretic arguments is obscured. 


In our recent work [3] we demonstrate how one can connect the spin hydrodynamics constructed with a totally antisymmetric (canonical) spin tensor with the phenomenological approach used by other authors. We show that the two frameworks are not connected only by a pseudo-gauge transformation (what most people implicitly assume) but an additional subtraction of a specific divergence-free term to the canonical energy-momentum tensor should be done. 


Our results help  us to find and clarify connections between different formulations of spin hydrodynamics, which is important for the construction of a final, fully consistent formalism.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Asaad', 'last_name': 'Daher', 'fullName': 'Daher, Asaad', 'id': '6522387', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'd0634ae15d141e4a3ef277a320da00f3', 'db_id': 6522387, 'person_id': 6347126}"

Poster Session 1 T07_1,poster,Combinants and correlation functions  in nuclear collisions,"Rybczynski, Maciej",Jan Kochanowski University (PL),Poland,"Multiplicity distributions in e+e- and pp collisions analysed via combinants exhibit oscillatory behavior of the modified combinants.  The possible sources of these oscillations and their impact on our understanding of the multiparticle production mechanism were discussed [1-3]. The set of combinants, Cj provides a similar measure of fluctuations as the set of cumulant factorial moments, Kq, which are very sensitive to the details of the multiplicity distribution and were frequently used in phenomenological analyses of data. However, while cumulants are best suited to the study of the densely populated region of phase space, combinants are better suited for the study of sparsely populated regions because calculation of Cj requires only a finite number of probabilities P(N <j).
In this presentation we discuss how these method can be used in nuclear collisions. We demonstrate how correlation functions can be related to combinants and illustrate how just the information about the sign of these correlation function can be used in analyses of multiplicity distributions in nuclear collisions. It is argued that measuring couplings of the genuine multi-particle correlation functions could provide cleaner information on possible non-trivial dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session 3 T11_5,poster,Impact of the initial electromagnetic field on heavy quarks and leptons from Z0 decay and Z0 leptonic invariant mass,"Sun, Yifeng",INFN-LNS,Unknown,"Ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are expected to generate a huge electromagnetic (e.m.) field that is¬†envisaged to induce several effects on hot QCD matter including the possibility of local parity and local parity and charge conjugation symmetry violations. A direct signature of such e.m. fields and a first quantitative measurement of its strength and lifetime are still missing.
We will discuss why it is expected to generate a splitting of the directed flow of charged particles and anti-particles, which¬†allow to constraint the e.m. field and can be considered also as a possible probe of the formation of the quark-gluon plasma phase.¬†Moreover, we have found a general formula for all possible charge dependent flow observables that can be generated by the strong electromagnetic fields in non-central relativistic heavy ion collisions. The formula has a very simple form at pT¬†larger than several GeV/c, which can be treated as the signature of charged dependent flow observables induced by e.m. fields.¬†Furthermore, we found that the v1¬†splitting depends critically on the time evolution of the magnetic field.¬†Based on this study, we finally discuss why the measurement of leptons from Z0¬†decay and its correlation to the charmed mesons are better in probing e.m. fields and¬†thus opening a new way to constrain the EM field.
The second topic we want to discuss is the modification of the Z0¬†leptonic invariant mass in the presence of EM fields. We found that EM fields will decrease the Z0¬†leptonic invariant mass and increase the width of it by few hundred MeV if the large  of¬†D0¬†and anti-D0¬†measured by ALICE is all due to EM fields. Moreover, both the invariant mass and its width are found to approximately depend on the integral of magnetic field quadratically. This provides an independent way to constrain the EM field.

We show the results on the transport coefficients and the time evolution of charm quark making a comparison among the Langevin dynamics, the BM collisional integral within a Quasi-Particle Model(QPM) approximation with on-shell QGP medium and the BM collision integral extended to a dynamical quasi-particles model with off-shell bulk particles. We also study the propagation of both charm and bottom quarks in the QGP by means of a full on-shell Boltzmann transport approach within an hybrid coalescence plus fragmentation hadronization model. We show the D-mesons $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at RHIC and LHC energies also discussing the role of the initial state fluctuations on the development of high-order heavy-flavor flow harmonics ($v_n(p_T)$, $n=3,4$). The results presented include event-shape selected D-meson spectra and $v_n$, correlations between different D-meson flow harmonics at LHC energies in different range of centrality selections. The events in centrality class are divided according to magnitude of the second-order harmonic reduced flow vector $q_2$. In the same scheme we show predictions for $R_{AA}$, $v_2$ and $v_3$ of B-mesons and both electrons and muons from semileptonic B-meson decays at top LHC energies. Within this approach the extracted T-dependence of the space-diffusion coefficient $D_s$ of both charm and bottom quarks is in a agreement with lattice QCD data within the systematic uncertainties. Lately, we have extended QPM approach to partonic propagators that explicitly depend on three-momentum of particles, futhermore we discuss the impact of momentum-dependent partonic masses on the $D_s$ coefficient providing novel and powerful constraints for heavy-flavour transport coefficients.\\

Poster Session 3 T11_4,poster,Exploring the high baryon-density regime of the QCD phase diagram within a novel hybrid approach,"Sch√§fer, Anna",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS),Unknown,"A novel hybrid approach coupling the hadronic transport approach SMASH to the 3+1D viscous hydrodynamics code vHLLE is introduced. The SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid is suitable to describe heavy-ion collisions ranging from $\sqrt{s}_\mathrm{NN}$ = 4.3 GeV - 5.02 TeV and is publicly available on Github. This talk focuses on collisions towards the high baryon-density regime of the QCD phase diagram, where the first order phase transition and critical end point are expected. Experimentally, this region of the phase diagram is studied within the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, the recently conducted BESII program at RHIC and the future FAIR and NICA facilities. After a thorough validation, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid is applied to study particle production and collective flow over a large range of beam energies. It is demonstrated that hadron dN/dy and m$_\mathrm{T}$ spectra are in good agreement with experimental measurements. In particular, it is found that the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid is capable of properly capturing the baryon stopping dynamics in collisions at finite baryon densities. The transition from a Gaussian net baryon distribution to a double-hump structure as a function of rapidity can be reproduced. The agreement with experimental data for multiplicity, mean p$_\mathrm{T}$ excitation functions and flow is significantly improved as compared to a pure hadronic transport evolution.
This work constitutes a first step in systematically studying heavy-ion collisions at finite baryon densities. Next, the SMASH-vHLLE-hybrid can be applied with different equations of state -with and without first order phase transition- to study the implications for final state observables, particularly focusing on those sensitive to a phase transition.

and elliptic flow of heavy mesons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of generalized Langevin equations to the diffusion of heavy probes in the early stages.

Strange and multi-strange hadrons are suitable candidates to measure these flow coefficients due to their small hadronic interaction cross section and early freezeout from the medium. Earlier in beam energy scan phase-I (BES-I), STAR collaboration measured the rapidity-odd directed flow for $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $K^{\pm}$, $K_{S}^{0}$, and $\phi$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV. The $v_{1}$ slope ($dv/dy$) at mid-rapidity shows a minimum value for the net-proton and net-$\Lambda$ when the collision energy is around 10-20 GeV which may be related to a signature of the first-order phase transition in the QCD phase diagram. It has been observed that $v_{2}$ of $\phi$ mesons shows quite different trend at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 and 11.5 GeV compared to other charged hadrons. The NCQ scaling also fails at these low energies for $\phi$ mesons and other anti-baryons which may indicate different hadron formation mechanism at these low energies. Due to less statistics, it was difficult to make any quantitative conclusion. %High statistics measurements are required to confirm the $v_{2}$ trend of $\phi$ mesons as well as validity of the NCQ scaling at low energies.

Quite surprisingly the same is found in proton-proton collisions, in which the relative yields of charmed baryons do not agree with the expectations based on e+e- collisions and with the predictions of those QCD event generators in which the hadronization stage is tuned to reproduce this more elementary situation.
Medium modification of hadronization, via some mechanism of recombination with light thermal partons, has been known for long to be an essential ingredient to implement in transport calculations in order to describe experimental data of heavy-flavour production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This is true both for the momentum and angular distributions of the final charmed/beauty hadrons and for their relative yields.
In this talk I will present the main features of a novel hadronization scheme we developed and implemented in our POWLANG transport setup, showing also our first results for the heavy-flavour particle ratios and flow coefficients in nucleus-nucleus collisions, in satisfactory agreement with recent experimental data. The model is based on the formation of color-singlet clusters via recombination of a charm quark with a light thermal antiquark or diquark (assumed to be present in the medium around the critical temperature) from the same fluid cell. If the cluster is sufficiently light it undergoes a two-body decay, if its invariant mass is larger it is treated as a Lund string and accordingly fragmented. The model has some nice features: modelling hadronization as a 2->N process allows exact four-momentum conservation; involving particles from the same fluid-cell it contains by construction space-momentum correlations; recombination with diquarks allows one to describe charmed-baryon production; at large pT it naturally approaches standard vacuum-like fragmentation.
A consistent modelling of the proton-proton reference, with the assumption of the formation of a small short-lived QGP droplet, in medium heavy-quark transport and hadronization is currently under development and preliminary results will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Beraudo', 'fullName': 'Beraudo, Andrea', 'id': '6523523', 'affiliation': 'INFN, sezione di Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f1d93e73b9c9f38bb74d350c8072aeaf', 'db_id': 6523523, 'person_id': 6335535}"

Using the effective HTL gluon propagator and the LLL quark propagator we analytically derive the full results for the longitudinal and transverse momentum diffusion coefficients as well as the energy losses for charm and bottom quarks beyond the static limit.

The $\Lambda_c/D^0$ ratio observed in $AA$ collision at RHIC and LHC energies has a value of the order of the unity. 
Recent experimental measurements in $pp$ collisions at both $\sqrt{s}=5.02 \,\rm TeV$ $\sqrt{s}=13 \,\rm TeV$ have shown ratios for charm baryons $\Lambda_c$, $\Xi_c^0$ and $\Omega_c^0$ respect to $D^0$ meson larger than that measured and expected in $e^+e^-$, $ep$ collisions.
 We study the hadronization after the propagation of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The propagation is described by means of a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach where the non-perturbative interaction between heavy quarks and light quarks is described by means of a quasi-particle approach.
We present a coalescence plus fragmentation model for the hadronization and the results obtained in $AA$ collisions for $D^0$, $D_s$, $\Lambda_c$ spectra and the related baryon to meson ratios at RHIC and LHC.
We found a large $\Lambda_c$ production resulting in a baryon over meson ratio of order O(1). 
We propose the $v_2$ of charmed baryons as a possible way to have a deeper insight into the hadronization mechanism.
We have furthermore extended this approach to study the production of hadrons containing multiple charm quark, i.e. $\Xi_{cc}$, $\Omega_{cc}$ and $\Omega_{ccc}$, and bottom quarks.
We present, also, results for the charmed hadron production in $pp$ collisions at top LHC energies (5 TeV, 13 TeV) assuming the formation of an hot QCD matter at finite temperature for these systems.
We calculate the heavy baryon/meson ratio and the $p_T$ spectra of charmed hadrons with and without strangeness content: $D^{0}$, $D_{s}$, $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$, $\Sigma_{c}$ and the recently measured $\Xi_c$ baryon, finding an enhancement in comparison with the ratio observed for $e^+e^-$, $ep$ collisions; moreover with this approach we predict also a significant production of $\Omega_c$ respect to $D^0$ such that $\Omega_c/D^0 \sim 0.15$.

In this work, a new hydrodynamic approach to the transport of heavy quarks in the QGP is presented. We exploit the conservation of the number of heavy quark-antiquark pairs within the evolution of the QGP to construct causal second-order hydrodynamic equations of motion. The hydrodynamic transport coefficients associated with the heavy-quark diffusion current are then compared with the momentum-diffusion coefficients obtained in transport theory (Fokker-Planck equation). We provide new insights concerning the level of local thermalization of charm and beauty quarks inside the expanding QGP by investigating the relation between the two approaches. Our results show that a fluid dynamic description of diffusion is feasible for charm quarks. In particular, in Bjorken flow the hydrodynamization time of charm quarks is in general short compared to the typical expansion time of the QGP, justifying a fluid description of charm diffusion. Analogous considerations for beauty quarks are presented.

the heavy quark affects longitudinal drag and diffusion, stimulating additional
radiation. These emissions partially compensate the reduction in radiation from
the dead cone effect. In the lower virtuality part of the shower evolution, when
the mass is comparable to the transverse momentum of the parton, scattering
and radiation processes off heavy quarks are different than off light quarks. All
these factors result in a different shower development for heavy-flavor tagged

Theoretical models of bottomonium productions in high-energy nuclear collisions rely on the in-medium interactions between the bottom and antibottom quarks. The latter can be characterized by the temperature ($T$) dependent potential, with real ($V_R(T,r)$) and imaginary ($V_I(T,r)$) parts, as a function of the spatial separation ($r$). Recently, the masses and thermal widths of up to $3S$ and $2P$ bottomonium states in QGP were calculated using lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) [Phys.Lett.B 800, 135119 (2020)]. We find that the HTL complex potential is disfavored by the lattice result, which motives us to employ a model-independent parameterization --- the Deep Neural Network (DNN) --- to represent the Bottomonium potential, extract the potential allowed by the lattice data. Starting from these LQCD results and through a novel application of DNN, here, we obtain $V_R(T,r)$ and $V_I(T,r)$ in a model-independent fashion. The temperature dependence of $V_R(T,r)$ was found to be very mild between $T\approx0-330$~MeV. For $T=150-330$~MeV, $V_I(T,r)$ shows rapid increase with $T$ and $r$, which is much larger than the perturbation theory based expectations.

Measurements of quarkonia in p+p collisions serve as important references. However, the production mechanism of quarkonium states in p+p collisions is still not fully understood because it involves both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD processes. Measurements of $J/\psi$ production with jet activity (number of jets in an event) provide important insight into the production mechanism as Color Singlet Model (CSM) and Color Octet Model (COM) give different predictions on the number of jets produced in $J/\psi$ events. In addition, the production mechanism can also be studied by measuring inclusive quarkonium production cross section and differential production within jets.

In this presentation, the transverse momentum and rapidity spectra of $\Upsilon$ states, including $\Upsilon$(2S) and $\Upsilon$(3S) states separately, measured in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=500 \mathrm{GeV}$ will be shown. Furthermore, the first measurements of the $J/\psi$ production with jet activity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $J/\psi$ production in jets at $\sqrt{s}=500\:\mathrm{GeV}$ will be presented. All results will be compared to quarkonium production model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leszek', 'last_name': 'Kosarzewski', 'fullName': 'Kosarzewski, Leszek', 'id': '6586518', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University in Prague', 'emailHash': 'bb42ec9d1bb6201de4f1540b57e2f058', 'db_id': 6586518, 'person_id': 6514775}"

Daniel Battistini for the ALICE Collaboration

In proton-proton (pp) collisions, the production of HF hadrons is typically described as a convolution of the parton distribution functions of the colliding protons, the partonic cross section, and the Fragmentation Functions (FFs). The latter describes the hadronisation of the heavy quarks in the different hadron species, and, since this process is non-perturbative, it is usually parametrised from measurements in $e^+e^-$ collisions. However, recent studies by the ALICE Collaboration show that the ratio between the production of charm baryons with respect to mesons is significantly higher in hadronic collisions compared to $e^+e^-$ interactions, invalidating the assumption that the FFs are independent of the collision system.

This contribution presents an extension of the studies on HF-baryon production in hadronic collisions to the beauty sector, via the measurement of the transverse-momentum-differential production cross section of $\Lambda ^+_c$-baryon originating from beauty-hadron decays in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV.

Poster Session 3 T11_1,poster,Cold Nuclear Matter Effects on $J/\psi$  and D Meson Production at High Baryon Densities,"Vogt, Ramona",LLNL,Unknown,"Open heavy flavors and quarkonium have played important roles in the understanding of the QCD matter produced at high temperatures and low baryon densities.  However, they could also provide crucial information about QCD at the lowe center of mass energies employed to probe high baryon density matter at existing or planned facilities.

For example, a nonperturbative contribution to charm production, intrinsic charm, has long been speculated, with much contradictory empirical evidence.  LHCb recently reported evidence for intrinsic charm in $Z + {\rm jet}$ events at $\sqrt{s} = 13$~TeV [1].  While $J/\psi$ production by intrinsic charm would normally only manifest itself outside the range of the LHC detectors, even at forward rapidity, the high $Q^2$ of these events allowed for their detection.

On the other hand, at low center of mass energies, $J/\psi$ and $D$ meson production by intrinsic charm could manifest itself at midrapidity, as described for the SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab [2].  This talk will explore the rapidity and $p_T$ dependence of an intrinsic charm signature for laboratory beams of 40~GeV and higher, both in $p+p$ and $p+A$ interactions and place the results in context of previous experimental evidence [3].

Poster Session 3 T11_1,poster,Influence of string interactions on strangeness yields in dense systems in Pythia8/Angantyr,"Chakraborty, Smita",Unknown,Unknown,"In this talk, we present our ongoing work on the inclusion of string interactions, namely rope hadronization and string shoving in heavy ion (PbPb and XeXe) collisions, as an alternative to QGP. Both string shoving, which is the repulsion between two strings, and rope hadronization, where strings in close proximity form higher-order colour multiplets, have been earlier observed to explain QGP-like effects in p-p collisions such as final state collective flow and strangeness enhancement.
The main challenge involved in implementing such mechanisms in dense environments is that the majority of strings in dense systems lie in random spatial orientation, which makes calculating the force among all strings during an event a complex problem.
In our approach, we use a special Lorentz frame, where a pair of string pieces are in parallel planes with respect to each other. Hence, for a whole Pythia/Angantyr event, every possible string pair is boosted to this frame to calculate the shoving and rope effects.
This novel approach of string shoving and rope hadronization can produce the cumulative result of generating QGP-like effects in dense environments, for both small and large systems. In this talk, we present our new implementation - the Gleipnir framework - in Pythia8/Angantyr and results from strangeness yield analyses performed in high-multiplicity p-p and heavy-ion collisions with comparison to data for both minimum bias and jet triggered events.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Smita', 'last_name': 'Chakraborty', 'fullName': 'Chakraborty, Smita', 'id': '6523543', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '3b624487b807aeeba6ad13312116c6bb', 'db_id': 6523543, 'person_id': 6326239}"

Heavy quarks are considered excellent probes to study the properties of the state of matter where quarks and gluons are deconfined, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP) expected to be formed in nuclear collisions.
Prompt J/$\psi$ are produced directly or from the feed-down of higher-mass charmonium states, and are sensitive to suppression and recombination effects in the QGP and at hadronization. Non-prompt J/$\psi$ production originates from the weak decays of beauty hadrons and is directly related to that of beauty quarks. In nuclear collisions, such measurements are important to investigate the energy loss dependence on the quark mass in the hot nuclear medium as well as for providing additional constraints to extract heavy-quark diffusion coefficients from experimental data.

The latter are typically parametrised from measurements in ${\rm e^+e^-}$ collisions, assuming universality across different collision systems. Measurements of charm baryon and meson production in pp and p-Pb collisions, and measurements of their yield production as a function of multiplicity, help to investigate hadronization processes and to study how these processes are modified across systems, from pp to Pb-Pb and from low to high multiplicities.

Poster Session 3 T11_1,poster,Heavy quarkonia in hot and dense  strongly magnetized  quark matter,"Khan, Salman Ahamad","Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247 667, India",Unknown,"In this work, we address how the properties of a specific 
hadronic probe in the form of heavy quark-antiquark bound states 
can be affected in a thermal medium
of quarks and gluons with finite chemical potential ($\mu$) under 
the influence of a strong magnetic field, unlike the same 
in the absence of finite $\mu$ reported in the literature.
The aforesaid problem may be relevant to the matter 
produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The effect of strong magnetic field
on the properties of the heavy quarkonia in a baryon symmetric matter 
has recently been studied either by computing the potential perturbatively or by a 
generalized Gauss law.
However, the medium correction to the non-perturbative string term 
gets inducted by dimension-two gluon condensate in usual resummed 
HTL propagator.

We have started with the general covariant tensor 
structure of the gluon self-energy in above environment for a thermal QCD
medium with finite $\mu$ and have
obtained the real and imaginary parts of 
resummed gluon propagator by calculating the relevant
form factors. These real and imaginary parts of the resummed propagator 
 in the static limit facilitate the computation of
the complex potential between $Q$ and $\bar Q$ in coordinate 
space through inverse Fourier transform. We have included
a phenomenological non-perturbative term induced by the dimension two 
gluon condensate to the usual HTL resummed propagator to evaluate the medium modification to string part of the $Q\bar{Q}$ potential. 
We observe that in the presence of the baryon asymmetry, the real-part of 
 potential  becomes slightly more attractive.
The more attractive nature of the real part can be 
 understood in terms of the Debye mass which inherits the medium properties 
 and  decreases with the  chemical potential. The magnitude of the 
 imaginary-part gets reduced in the medium having finite chemical potential.
 We have solved  the radial part of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation numerically plugging the real-part of the potential to obtain the energy eigenvalues which are utilized to  calculate the binding energy of quarkonia. 
The decay width has been calculated considering the imaginary part of the potential as a perturbation in the small distance limit. 
Presence of the chemical potential in the medium   
leads to the enhancement of binding energies and the reduction 
of thermal widths of $Q \bar Q$ 
ground states, respectively. Finally, we compute the  dissociation temperatures of $J/\psi$ and  $\Upsilon$ states by
studying the relative competition between the binding energy and decay width.  
Dissociation temperatures  are found to have slightly larger values in the medium 
having non-zero baryon density. We have noticed that $J/\psi$ gets dissociated at 
$1.64~T_c$, $1.69~T_c$, and $1.75~T_c$, whereas $\Upsilon$ is 
dissociated at $1.95~T_c$, $1.97~T_c$ and $2.00 ~T_c$, for
 $\mu=0, 60$ and $ 100 $ MeV, respectively. In conclusion, the strongly
 magnetized hot quark matter having non-zero baryon density  prevents
early dissociation of quarkonia as compared to the baryonless matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Salman Ahamad', 'last_name': 'Khan', 'fullName': 'Khan, Salman Ahamad', 'id': '6543904', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee 247 667, India', 'emailHash': '00a839c5ce444cbc38cda24c166df4ac', 'db_id': 6543904, 'person_id': 6331263}"

Poster Session 2 T07_2,poster,Unfolding the effects of final-state interactions and quantum statistics in two-particle angular correlations,"Graczykowski, Lukasz Kamil",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Angular correlations of identified particles measured in ultrarelativistic proton-proton (pp) and heavy-ion collisions exhibit a number of features which depend on the collision system and particle type under consideration. Those features are produced by mechanisms, such as (mini)jets, elliptic flow, resonance decays, and conservation laws. In addition, of particular importance are those related to the quantum statistics (QS) and final-state interactions (FSIs). 

In our recent work [1] we show how to unfold the QS and FSI contributions in angular correlation functions by employing a Monte Carlo approach and using momentum correlations (femtoscopy), focusing on pp reactions. We validate the proposed method with PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo simulations of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV coupled to calculations of QS and FSI effects with the Lednick√Ω and Lyuboshitz formalism and provide predictions for the unfolded effects. In particular, we show how those effects modify the shape of the angular correlation function with emphasis on pions and protons. Most importantly, specific structures in the near-side region ($(\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)\approx(0,0)$) of the two-baryon angular correlation function, namely a small enhancement in the middle of a depletion for proton-proton pairs in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, observed by  ALICE [2], and a depletion for $\rm p\overline{p}$ pairs in Au-Au collisions at collision energies from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7$ GeV to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV, observed by STAR [3], originating from the strong interaction, are unveiled with the proposed method. The unfolding of the FSI and QS effects is not able to explain the wide anticorrelation effect at near-side observed by ALICE universally for all baryon-baryon and corresponding antibaryon-antibaryon pairs ($\rm pp\oplus\overline{p}\overline{p}$, $\rm p\Lambda\oplus\overline{p}\overline{\Lambda}$ and $\rm \Lambda\Lambda\oplus\overline{\Lambda}\overline{\Lambda}$).

The inverse unfolding procedure, from the angular space to the relative momentum space,  is also possible. Our preliminary studies suggest that it can allow for a data-driven estimation of non-femtoscopic background in femtoscopic correlations using measured two-particle angular correlations instead of relying on Monte Carlo models.

Poster Session 2 T07_2,poster,Impact of mini-jets in bulk observables within a concurrent evolution approach,"Pablos, Daniel",University of Bergen,Unknown,"Mini-jets, created by perturbative hard QCD collisions at moderate energies, can represent a significant portion of the total multiplicity of a heavy-ion collision event. Given the fact that their transverse momenta are initially larger than the typical saturation scale describing the bulk of the equilibrating QGP, they ought to be described through the physics of parton energy loss. Indeed, their typical stopping distances are larger than the usual hydrodynamization time, so they do not in general hydrodynamize at the same pace than the bulk of the collision. Therefore, in general mini-jets cannot be described solely by a unique pre-equilibrium stage that bridges the initial, over-occupied glasma state, with the hydrodynamical evolution.

In this work we make use of a new concurrent mini-jet+hydrodynamic framework in which the properties of the hydrodynamically evolving QGP are modified due to the injection of energy and momentum from the mini-jets. We study the system for different choices of the minimum transverse momentum associated to mini-jet production. In order to achieve a realistic description of charged particle multiplicity, the amount of entropy associated to the low-x initial state needs to be reduced. Moreover, the fact that the injected momentum from the randomly oriented mini-jets is not correlated with the spatial gradients of the system reduces overall flow, and the value of the QGP transport coefficients needs to be reduced accordingly in order to describe the measured flow coefficients in experiments. They are, in effect, an important new source of fluctuations, resulting in a spikier, notably modified hydrodynamical evolution when compared to the scenario in which the presence of mini-jets is ignored. We avow that their abundance makes it necessary to include their physics in holistic descriptions of heavy-ion collisions. We will discuss the potential impacts of this modified hydrodynamical evolution on a number of observables, and also propose ways in which the currently unknown relevant scale for mini-jet production can be constrained by data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Pablos', 'fullName': 'Pablos, Daniel', 'id': '6523263', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen', 'emailHash': 'c63d153f0448a8812b4f5c8669ba794b', 'db_id': 6523263, 'person_id': 6338499}"

The comprehensive data collected during a two-dimensional scan in beam momentum (13A-150A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La,Pb+Pb) allows for a systematic search for the critical point - the search for a non-monotonic dependence of various correlation and fluctuation observables on collision energy and size of colliding nuclei. An example of such observable is local fluctuations of particle densities in transverse momentum space, which can be probed with an intermittency analysis by measuring the scaling behavior of factorial moments of multiplicity distributions.

This contribution will present a new approach to search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter via intermittency analysis using cumulative variables and independent sub-sample for each data point.",
Poster Session 2 T07_2,poster,Signals from the critical point in Bjorken fluid dynamics,"Nahrgang, Marlene",Subatech,Unknown,"A non-monotonic net-proton kurtosis for very central collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV has been suggested and may be confirmed by recent BES-II program results advocating the existence of the QCD critical point. Fluctuations at the origin of this peculiar behavior are produced in the highly dynamical environment of ultra-relativistic collisions. Especially, the violent longitudinal expansion and the associated temperature cooling may have a non-trivial impact on how we interpret the experimental data.  The in- or out-of equilibrium nature of the fluctuations during this expansion is a crucial question in discriminating between critical contributions and purely dynamical features. 
Here, we inspect the diffusive dynamics of the critical net-baryon density fluctuations coupled to energy and momentum fluctuations. Equations are expressed in the Milne coordinates to include the longitudinal Bjorken-type expansion in 1+1D. Fluctuations are connected to critical point physics using a stochastic diffusion equation in which the potential is derived from a free-energy functional including non-linear coupling and fully parametrized by the second a fourth order susceptibilities. The latter come from the 3D Ising model correlation length in the scaling region and lattice QCD calculations at vanishing baryo-chemical potential. 
We demonstrate the great sensitivity of the second and fourth order cumulants of the net-baryon and energy density fluctuations to the expansion dynamics. Via particlization the net-proton number cumulants are obtained. Special emphasis is put on the dependence on the diffusion length and the freeze-out conditions. The phenomenological consequences of  these two parameters are discussed. We study the non-trivial rapidity dependence as a signal for the QCD critical point.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marlene', 'last_name': 'Nahrgang', 'fullName': 'Nahrgang, Marlene', 'id': '6540520', 'affiliation': 'Subatech', 'emailHash': '57ed4f71780738ff9a52d2bc82b8f825', 'db_id': 6540520, 'person_id': 6339224}"

However, diffusion in the medium may blur some of the expected signals. It is thus crucial to understand the diffusive dynamics of the conserved charge fluctuations to know to which degree measured fluctuations report bulk fluctuations during the evolution. 
Two major ingredients determine the dynamical evolution of the fluctuations, the natural coupling between the diffusive properties of the conserved charges and the longitudinal expansion of the medium. Their non-trivial interplay largely impacts the in- or out- of equilibrium nature of the fluctuations. 
We present the coupled diffusive dynamics of net-baryon, net-charge and net-strangeness fluctuations in a rapidly expanding medium. The model consists of a set of three coupled stochastic diffusion equations. The diffusion  matrix comes from microscopic calculations both in the hadron phase and in the QGP.

The primary signature of the critical point is a peak (divergence) in the kurtosis of the net-proton number distribution, $\kappa_4$. Most previous studies of kurtosis have focused on equilibrium physics, whereas it is well-known that out-of-equilibrium effects are vital in understanding the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). Out-of-equilibrium effects near the vicinity of the critical point can dramatically alter the trajectory through the QCD phase diagram from equilibrium. We find that the size and shape of the critical region play an important role in whether or not the critical point will be effectively seen in the dynamic evolution.

In larger systems, the long-range correlations are known to arise from the collective dynamics of the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The similarity between the $pp$ and heavy-ion measurements raises the possibility that a tiny droplet of the QGP is produced even in $pp$. However, models that attribute the correlation in $pp$ collisions to semi-hard processes can qualitatively reproduce the measurements. Thus performing the $pp$ measurements with distinguishing particles associated with semi-hard processes, such as low-$p_{\mathrm{T}}$ jets, can further elucidate the origin of the long-range correlations. This talk presents a new measurements of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with two different particle pair selections. In the first case, tracks associated with jets are excluded from the correlation analysis. This case results in a minor influence on the magnitude of the long-range correlation.

Explicit expressions for all diagonal and off-diagonal cumulants up to sixth order that relate them to the grand canonical susceptibilities are obtained. The derivation is presented for an arbitrary equation of state with an arbitrary number of different conserved charges. The global conservation effects cancel out in any ratio of two second order cumulants, in any ratio of two third order cumulants, as well as in a ratio of strongly intensive measures $\Sigma$ and $\Delta$ involving any two conserved charges, making all these quantities particularly suitable for theory-to-experiment comparisons in heavy-ion collisions. We also show that the same cancellation occurs in correlators of a conserved charge, like the electric charge, with any non-conserved quantity such as net proton or net kaon number. The main results of the SAM are illustrated in the framework of the hadron resonance gas model. We also elucidate how net-proton and net-$\Lambda$ fluctuations are affected by conservation of electric charge and strangeness in addition to baryon number.

Possible longitudinal dynamics such as initial twist of participant matter and jet induced non-flow correlations would lead to distinct different rapidity dependence of $F_2$ and $T_2$ measurements.

Poster Session 2 T07_1,poster,Space-time evolution of critical fluctuations in an expanding system,"Sakai, Azumi",Sophia University,Unknown,"The search for the QCD critical point is one of the main topics in high-energy nuclear collisions. There are active studies aiming to find signals of the QCD critical point and the first order phase transition, such as the BES programs at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collier (RHIC), and many future experiments such as FAIR, NICA, J-PARC-HI, and HIAF. For detecting the signals of the critical point in these experiments, we need a proper model describing the evolution of the dense QCD matter created in the nuclear collisions. To this end, it is very important to understand dynamical effects of the critical fluctuations on experimental observables.

Critical phenomena associated with the QCD critical point are characterized by the divergent fluctuations of the chiral condensate $\sigma = \langle\bar{q}q\rangle$ and the baryon number density $n_B$ [1,2]. In the idealized case where the system is close to equilibrium, the fluctuations of (non-conserved) chiral condensate $\sigma$ can be integrated out as a fast mode, and the critical dynamics is governed by fluctuations of the baryon number density and other hydrodynamic modes. However, it is quite non-trivial whether we can ignore the $\sigma$ mode as the fast mode in the high-energy nuclear collisions because the time-scale separation is unclear there; The $\sigma$ mode could affect the space-time evolution of the critical dynamics.

In our study, we construct a framework to describe the dynamics of the critical fluctuations including the relaxation time for baryon diffusion current and the coupling of the chiral condensate $\sigma$ to the baryon density $n_B$. We apply this to one-dimensionally expanding system with the QCD critical point and investigate the effect of the relaxation time and the mode coupling on the correlation of baryon density $n_B$ as a function of rapidity interval.

These properties imply no distortion of the information carried by $Œ≥$ from the point of their creation up to the detection in experiment. As a consequence it is plausible to investigate source features, which are not only based on the information available after thermal freeze-out, but also include previous stages of expansion.

The first of the two, the coalescence model, describes the (anti)deuteron‚Äôs creation as a result of final-state interactions among (possibly off-shell) nucleons after the chemical freeze-out. The second, the thermal model predicts the formation of the (anti)deuterons inside the fireball even before the chemical freeze-out where these particles would be in equilibrium with other hadrons. The presented study aims to improve the understanding of deuterons production by studying the pion-deuteron source magnitude employing the femtoscopy method to determine the latter. The pion-deuteron particle-emitting source size can be evaluated as a function of the pair transverse mass $m_{\rm T}$ and can be compared to the source obtained for pion-pion pairs. Differences in the  $m_{\rm T}$ scaling could help in discriminating between the coalescence and thermal scenario of (anti)deuteron‚Äôs creation.

We show that both, *e2* and *v2*, weakly depend on the fluctuations except for the collisions with centrality 0-2%. In contrast, *e3* and *v3* are mostly determined by the initial state fluctuations. Obtained results reproduce the nontrivial centrality dependence of the ratio of flow components, *v2/v3*, measured in LHC experiments.

They comprise one of the promising tools to investigate the existence and location of the QCD critical point, as fluctuations should diverge near it. However, evaluating these from event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations is a time-consuming task, since it requires very large statistics. As a consequence, systematic analyses of the behavior of cumulants as a function of beam energy, parametrizations of bulk and shear viscosities, values of the baryon diffusion coefficient, become prohibitive. Our method is based on separating the contributions to the final fluctuations into before and after the hydrodynamical evolution, and determining the latter analytically, which reduces the number of full hydro runs required ‚Äì along with the total runtime.

Because of these two mechanisms, describing soft and hard processes, the model calculations restored by the four-cumulant method reproduce the centrality dependence of differential elliptic flow in both soft and hard pT regions rather well without any additional tuning of model parameters. Without jet quenching in hot and dense medium the correlations in the model are very weak. We show that the experimentally observed correlations between elliptic flow at low and high transverse momenta in peripheral lead-lead collisions arise mainly because of correlations of particles in jets.

In this contribution, we present a study of two-particle correlations $\mathrm{V^{0}}$($\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}$, $\Lambda/\overline{\Lambda}$) and charged hadrons as trigger particles of transverse momentum $8 < p_\mathrm{T,trig} < 16$ $\mathrm {GeV}/c$, and associated charged particles of $1$ $\mathrm{GeV}/c< p_\mathrm{T,assoc} < p_\mathrm{T,trig}$ at mid-rapidity in pp and Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ $=5.02$ TeV recorded with the ALICE detector.
 After subtracting the contributions of the flow background, the per-trigger yields are calculated on the near and away-side. The ratio of the per-trigger yields in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions, $I_{\mathrm{AA}}$, is measured in the most central 0--10% collisions. A significant enhancement of $I_{\mathrm{AA}}$  for different particles species is observed at the lowest $p_\mathrm{T,assoc}$ on both  near and away-side, while strong suppression of $I_{\mathrm{AA}}$ for $p_\mathrm{T,assoc}$ $>3$ $\mathrm{GeV}/c$ on away-side is observed as expected from strong in-medium energy loss.

Therefore, it provides direct information on the multiplicity correlations and fluctuations from a single source.


This poster presents new results on forward-backward correlations studied  with the quantity $\Sigma$, measured by ALICE at the LHC in Xe--Xe reactions  at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.44$ TeV and in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$  and $5.02$ TeV. The data is shown as a function of the $\eta$ gap between forward and backward pseudorapidity intervals, the centrality of the collision, and the width of the centrality bin. The study is made with two independent centrality estimators. An opposite ordering of values of $\Sigma$ as a function of centrality class in Pb--Pb and Xe--Xe collisions is observed for the experimental data and MC HIJING simulations.

The YY interaction is important to understand the equation of state of neutron star interior as well as to search for exotic hadrons such as H-dibaryon. The H-dibaryon was proposed as a stable six-quark state resulting from combination of two $\Lambda$ hyperons. According to the lattice QCD calculation [1], H-dibaryon could be in a deeply bound state or in a shallow bound state, or two $\Lambda$ hyperons have weak unbound attractive interaction, depending on quark mass. On the other hand, the observation of double hypernuclei [2] suggests that they are not in a deeply bound state, although more experimental inputs are needed to clarify the nature of possible H-dibaryon state. For the case of two $\Xi$ (strangeness S = -4) interaction, whether or not there is a bound state of $\Xi$-$\Xi$ is being discussed.
 In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a large number of particles including (multi-) strangeness are produced, which allows us to study those interactions via femtoscopic measurements with better precision. The correlation function is affected by strong interaction, quantum statistics, and Coulomb interaction in low relative momentum of particle pairs of interest.

Local proton density fluctuations in transverse space represent an order parameter of the chiral phase transition and are expected to scale according to a universal power-law in the vicinity of the CP. They can be probed through an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments (SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. The first such analysis [1] revealed power-law behavior in NA49 Si+Si collisions at 158A GeV/$c$, the fitted power-law exponent being consistent with the theoretically expected critical value, within errors.

Proton intermittency analysis of experimental data poses unique challenges, in that it requires good proton identification and careful handling of statistical and systematic uncertainties, especially in the face of moderate event statistics and low per event proton multiplicity. In the present talk, we review the current status of NA61/SHINE intermittency analysis, focusing on the results of the analyzed collision systems (Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Pb+Pb), and explore the novel techniques developed and employed to account for non-critical background and estimate statistical and systematic uncertainties. In particular, we address the issue of obtaining reliable estimates and confidence intervals for the intermittency index (power-law exponent) $\phi_2$ from correlated data points, and discuss the possible treatments available. Finally, we present Monte Carlo simulation techniques used in assessing the statistical significance of intermittency results and weighing the alternative models.

The corresponding measurements can thus place stringent limits on the magnitude of the BB¬Ø annihilation and its inverse reaction. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the hadronic phase in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC via the recently developed subensemble sampler + UrQMD afterburner and show that the effect survives in net-proton fluctuations, which are directly accessible experimentally. The available experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration on net-proton fluctuations disfavors a notable suppression of (anti)baryon yields in BB¬Ø annihilations predicted by the present version of UrQMD if only global baryon conservation is incorporated. On the other hand, the annihilations improve the data description when local baryon conservation is imposed. The two effects can be disentangled by measuring $\kappa_2[B+B¬Ø]/‚ü®B+B¬Ø‚ü©$, which at the LHC is notably suppressed by annihilations but virtually unaffected by baryon number conservation.

Interestingly for spin half particles, the results for quantum fluctuation depend on the form of the energy-momentum tensor used in the calculations, which is a feature described as pseudo-gauge dependence. However, for sufficiently large subsystems the results obtained in different pseudo-gauges converge and agree with the canonical-ensemble formula known from statistical physics. Although different forms of the energy-momentum tensor of gas are a priori equivalent, our finding suggests that the concept of quantum fluctuations of energy in very small thermodynamic systems is pseudo-gauge dependent. On a practical side, our results can be used in the context of relativistic heavy-ion collisions to introduce limitations of the concepts such as classical energy density or fluid element. Also, the results of our calculations determine a scale of coarse-graining for which the choice of the pseudo-gauge becomes irrelevant. In a straightforward way, our formula for quantum fluctuation can be applied in other fields of physics, wherever one deals with the hot and relativistic matter.

Further using the formalism developed to obtain the fluctuation of energy we also estimated the quantum features of the baryon number fluctuations in subsystems of a hot and dense relativistic gas of fermions. Our results for the baryon number fluctuation also suggest that for small system size quantum mechanical effects can be significant.  Such a system size dependence of quantum statistical fluctuation can be helpful to shed new light on the experimental data, particularly for a small system probed in the heavy-ion collision experiments.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'ARPAN', 'last_name': 'DAS', 'fullName': 'DAS, ARPAN', 'id': '6523308', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences Krakow, Poland', 'emailHash': '8f23ce10ed9926f61601112aa03631e6', 'db_id': 6523308, 'person_id': 6239869}"

For a system with dynamical fluctuations due to characteristic critical behaviour near the phase transition, $F_{q}$ exhibits power-law growth with increasing bin number or decreasing bin size which indicates self-similar fluctuations.

Poster Session 1 T07_1,poster,New advancements in symmetry plane correlations and multiharmonic fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Mordasini, Cindy",University of Jyv√§skyl√§ (FI),Germany,"The study of collective phenomena in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is nowadays to a great extent built on the so-called flow amplitudes $v_n$ and symmetry planes $\Psi_n$. Both appear as two distinct degrees of freedom in the parametrization of the azimuthal distribution of the produced particles, which is used in the study of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Investigating the complex interplay of these quantities allows one to further constrain our current knowledge of this exotic state of matter. While analyses techniques for flow amplitudes $v_n$ have advanced over the past years, observables used for measuring symmetry planes $\Psi_n$ are often plagued by built-in biases. The most important of them arises from the neglect of the correlations between different flow amplitudes, which were shown by the ALICE Collaboration to exist even between three amplitudes. Recent developments for the measurement of symmetry plane correlations (SPC) take these correlations into account and provide a new and more precise analysis technique $-$ the so-called Gaussian Estimator (GE). In this talk, we highlight the new results for higher-order multiharmonic flow fluctuations obtained with ALICE in heavy-ion collisions. These results show the presence of complex correlations between multiple flow amplitudes of different order, and also emphasise their importance in the measurement of SPC. Taking this into account, the first experimental results of SPC measured with the newly developed GE using Pb-Pb collisions data are presented. All results are compared to theoretical predictions for the initial coordinate space provided by the T$_{\rm R}$ENTo model and for the momentum space obtained with the state-of-the-art model iEBE-VISHNU.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cindy', 'last_name': 'Mordasini', 'fullName': 'Mordasini, Cindy', 'id': '6558058', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyv√§skyl√§ (FI)', 'emailHash': '31376ec954c4c1f5ca4c3983ba7382d6', 'db_id': 6558058, 'person_id': 6333352}"

Hydrokinetic formalism is a complementary approach to solving the Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) for fluctuating hydrodynamics. Hydrokinetics is comparatively easier to solve than the SDEs, which need to deal with arbitrarily large gradients. This talk systematically compares the two approaches for the propagation and diffusion of conserved charge fluctuations in the 1D Bjorken hydrodynamic model. We solve the causal Catteneo noise in the SDE approach [1] and quantify the causality constraints on the evolution of the two-point correlation of charge fluctuations. Results are compared with those from Hydrokinetics in the white-noise limit as a function of wavelength. We further explore the consequence of colored noises on the two-point correlation of charge fluctuations. By subtracting the self-correlation term, we obtain a characteristic power-law decay of the two-point correlator as a function of the time, which agrees with the hydrokinetic approach.

When considering additional states exceeding those measured with high confidence by the Particle Data Group, attractive corrections to the overall pressure in the HRG model are imposed. On the other hand, we also apply excluded-volume corrections, which ensure there is no overlap of baryons by turning on repulsive (anti)baryon-(anti)baryon interactions. We see that these two extensions are complementary and focus on the agreement with first-principles lattice QCD results on fluctuations of conserved charges. We note that these results are interesting for heavy-ion-collision systems at both the LHC and RHIC. In particular, we find interesting ratios of susceptibilities that are sensitive to one correction and not the other. This allows us to constrain the excluded volume and particle spectrum effects separately. Additionally, we see that strangeness susceptibilities indicate a smaller excluded volume for hyperons than non-strange baryons.

For a precise measurement of the cumulants it is necessary to grasp the role of charge conservation in heavy-ion collision measurements. Within this work, we calculate the role of hadronic interactions and momentum cuts on cumulants of conserved charges up to fourth order in a system in equilibrium within a hadronic transport approach (SMASH). In our model the net-baryon, net-charge and net-strangeness is perfectly conserved on an event-by-event basis and the cumulants are calculated as a function of subvolume sizes and compared to analytic expectations. This reflects the experimental situation in which e.g. the net-baryon number is conserved in a heavy-ion collision and the results depend on the rapidity window. We find a modification of the kurtosis due to charge annihilation processes in systems with simplified degrees of freedom. Furthermore the result of the full SMASH hadron gas for the net-baryon and net-proton number fluctuations is presented for systems with zero and finite values of baryochemical potential. Additionally the problem of mapping between the net-proton and net-baryon fluctuations is addressed and we find that due to dynamical correlations the cumulants of the net-baryon number cannot be recovered from the net-protons. Finally the influence of deuteron cluster formation on the net-proton and net-baryon fluctuations in simplified system is shown. This analysis is important to better understand the relation between measurements of fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions and theoretical calculation which are often performed in a grand canonical ensemble.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jan', 'last_name': 'Hammelmann', 'fullName': 'Hammelmann, Jan', 'id': '6523278', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS)', 'emailHash': '9344b85b718d0fef477f988a3912c795', 'db_id': 6523278, 'person_id': 6324786}"

The main difficulty in studying low momentum jets in heavy ion collisions is the presence of a significant uncorrelated background of low momentum hadrons from soft processes. One way to deal with this background is to use jet-hadron correlations to fit and subtract the soft, flow-modulated background. This technique allows measurements of the near and away side yields.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,Chromoelectric correlators for quarkonia and heavy quarks: a comparison at weak and strong coupling,"Scheihing Hitschfeld, Bruno Sebastian",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Suppression of open heavy flavors and quarkonia in heavy-ion collisions is among the most informative probes of the quark-gluon plasma. Interpreting the full wealth of data obtained from the collision events requires a precise understanding of the evolution of heavy quarks and quarkonia as they propagate through the nearly thermal and strongly coupled plasma. In particular, a complete theoretical calculation of the dissociation and recombination rates of quarkonia has thus far been lacking.

It has recently been shown in [1] that such a calculation requires the evaluation of a particular gauge-invariant correlator of chromoelectric fields dressed with Wilson lines, which is very similar to, but different from the correlator used to define the well-known heavy quark diffusion coefficient [2]. Surprisingly, the difference between these two correlators turns out to be subtle: they only differ by a temperature-independent constant at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbation theory, as was shown in [3] by comparing to [4]. In this talk, we will explain the similarities and differences between the correlator for heavy quark diffusion and that for quarkonia dissociation/recombination. We will illuminate the differences from both the qualitative physical grounds and the formal expressions. We will explain why the finite-temperature parts agree at NLO. Going beyond the perturbative theory, we will show how an AdS/CFT calculation can unambiguously establish the different nature of these two correlators within N=4 SYM. Finally, we will discuss how our calculation in the strong coupling limit provides important guidance to understand quarkonium evolution at low temperature.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,Transient Relativistic Fluid Dynamics in a General Hydrodynamic Frame,"Speranza, Enrico",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"The formulation of a causal and stable theory of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics is an important field of current research, with direct applications to the modeling of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the theory of relativistic ideal fluids is well established, the incorporation of dissipation introduces qualitatively new challenges due to the need to maintain relativistic causality and stability. A paradigmatic example of how to ensure causality in the linearized regime and stability is the Mueller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) theory [1]. The key idea is that the dissipative contributions are promoted to new degrees of freedom, whose evolution is determined by additional relaxation-type equations coupled with the conservation laws. In a recent development, an alternative formulation of causal and stable first-order relativistic hydrodynamics was introduced by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha [2] and Kovtun [3] (BDNK) and proved to be causal in the nonlinear regime and stable. The basic observation of [2] was that the hydrodynamic variables do not have a unique definition out of equilibrium and one can formulate first-order hydrodynamics in a general hydrodynamic frame, which differs from Eckart and Landau‚Äôs standard choices, without employing additional fields beyond those already found in ideal hydrodynamics. In this work [4], we propose a new theory of second-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics in a general hydrodynamic frame. It differs from MIS by including additional degrees of freedom, and its first-order truncation reduces to BDNK. Causality and stability hold at the linearized level if suitable conditions on transport coefficients are met. Apart from its conceptual implications, this new theory has potential applications to the modeling of the physics of the quark-gluon plasma as well as viscous simulations of neutron star mergers. As an illustrative example we consider Bjorken flow solutions to our equations and identify variables which make an early-time attractor manifest.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,Promoting gluon saturation to higher precision with dijets at the EIC,"Salazar, Farid",UCLA,USA,"The search for gluon saturation is one of the major goals of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Significant progress has been made in advancing saturation physics to a precision science as we prepare for the EIC era. Focusing on inclusive dijet production in deeply inelastic electron-nucleus, we contribute to these efforts in two ways. First, we quantify the size of kinematic twist and genuine higher twist contributions included in the saturation framework and absent in the TMD framework [1,2]. Second, we perform the first complete next-to-leading order (NLO) computation of inclusive dijets within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) [3]. I will also comment on implications of our results to the physics of ultra-peripheral collisions at RHIC and the LHC.

However, there are still several puzzling phenomena begging for satisfactory explanations. Particularly, the measured spin-alignments of the vector boson is unexpectedly large compared to a class of model calculations. To investigate this problem systematically, we employ the linear response theory formulated in work [1,2] to derive the induced spin-alignment (i.e. spin density matrix) of the vector mesons, such as phi-mesons, by the hydrodynamic gradients [3]. We obtain expressions on spin density matrix that are qualitatively different from those based on the coalescence model. We discuss phenomenological implication of our results.

It is a universal QCD quantity encoding the light cone gauge partonic structure of a high energy projectile, and a necessary ingredient in cross section calculations for different scattering processes. This talk will report on the recent calculation of the light cone wave functions for a longitudinal [1] or transverse [2] virtual photon to split into quark-antiquark states, including for the first time quark masses at one loop accuracy. These wave functions can be used to calculate cross sections for several precision probes of perturbative gluon saturation at the Electron-Ion Collider. Using these wave functions we derive, for the first time, the total dipole picture DIS cross sections for longitudinal and transverse virtual photons with quark masses. The calculation has required solving a longstanding issue concerning quark mass renormalization in light cone perturbation theory. The quark masses are renormalized in the pole mass scheme, satisfying constraints from  the requirement of Lorentz invariance of the quark Dirac and Pauli form factors.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,How many particles do make a fluid? Searching for fluid dynamic behavior with expanding clouds of few and many cold atoms,"Heyen, Lars Helge",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"The observation of long-range azimuthal anisotropies in small collision systems triggers pressing questions concerning the applicability of fluid dynamics and whether ensembles of only a small number of particles may be effectively treated as fluids. We propose to use experiments on expanding clouds of cold atoms to answer the latter question. We consider strongly-interacting fermions confined in a two-dimensional trap with an elliptical deformation, and, upon release of the trap, we use the emergence of elliptic flow, $v_2$, as an indicator of collective behavior. Borrowing a well-known method from heavy-ion collisions, we quantify the collectivity of the system through the ratio $v_2/\varepsilon_2$, where $\varepsilon_2$ is the anisotropy of the trapping potential. By experimentally controlling both the value of $\varepsilon_2$ and the number of trapped atoms (down to a single particle), one can investigate what particle number is needed for the system to yield a $v_2/\varepsilon_2$ as large as in the fluid dynamic regime. Interestingly, in a quantum formulation, we find that a small number of particles can show elliptic flow even in the absence of interactions, and we discuss how this quantum effect disappears quickly with increasing particle number.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,Quantum simulation of string breaking in Schwinger model as open quantum system,"Yao, Xiaojun",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,USA,"Currently there exists no viable ``ab initio'' approach to simulate QCD dynamics at the LHC/RHIC that is universally applicable. This profoundly limits our understanding of the formation, real-time evolution and hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions. Quantum computing may provide a potential solution to efficiently simulate these real-time dynamics within the Hamiltonian formulation of QCD.

In this talk, we discuss a formulation to simulate hard probes of the QGP, such as heavy quarks or jets, on quantum computers through the formalism of open quantum systems [1]. As a start, we present quantum simulation of an open system described by a toy quantum field theory, by studying the non-equilibrium behavior and thermalization of the U(1) gauge theory in 1+1D, i.e., the Schwinger model [2]. We simulate string breaking of fermion pairs in the presence of a thermal environment, which provides a real-time picture of the microscopic dynamics of deconfinement and quarkonium dissociation. We report simulations both on classical simulators as well as quantum devices from IBM, using state-of-the-art error mitigation techniques. These formulations provide the groundwork to extend to QCD and simulate the dynamics of hard probes in the QGP, and we will discuss the prospects of doing so.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,Precise description of multi-parton correlators in the quark-gluon plasma,"Isaksen, Johannes Hamre",University of Bergen,Unknown,"The high quality experimental data on hard probes in heavy-ion collisions call for a more precise theoretical description of jet evolution in a quark-gluon plasma. To accomplish that we study jet fragmetation via $1\to 2$ final-state parton splittings in the medium. In earlier works [1,2] the authors have usually calculated these processes by invoking one or two approximations: the large-$N_c$ and the eikonal approximations. We want to develop methods to do the calculations without using these approximations, and to quantify the error that is introduced by employing them.

As partons go through the medium their color continuously rotates, an effect that is encapsulated in a Wilson line resumming multiple medium interactions along their trajectory. When calculating observables, one typically has to calculate medium averages of the traces of two or more Wilson lines, leading to correlators of 2 or more partons extended in time. For 2- or 3-point correlators, analytical solutions exist (at least for soft medium interactions described by a harmonic oscillator potential). However, 4-point correlators are usually dealt with in the literature by invoking the large-$N_c$ limit, but exact calculations have been lacking in many cases. In our work [3], we showed how correlators of multiple Wilson lines appear, and developed a method to calculate them numerically to all orders in $N_c$. This result is quite general, and can be used to calculate Wilson line correlators that appear in many areas of particle physics. 

In our previous paper, though,  we made use of the eikonal approximation, meaning that the partons are assumed to travel in straight lines through the medium. This is a good approximation for hard, balanced splittings. For soft and imbalanced splittings the produced partons can be kicked around by the medium, which is described mathematically by a path integral. We show how the full problem can be transformed into solving a set of coupled Schr√∂dinger equations describing a set of mutually interacting color representations, with the aforementioned Wilson line correlators acting as the potential term. These results are relevant for high-$p_T$ jet processes, multi-gluon emissions in the QGP [4] and initial stage physics [5] at the LHC.

Poster Session 3 T12_2,poster,The hydrodynamic expansion through regularized moments,"Tinti, Leonardo",Goethe University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics is surprisingly predictive, even in the presence of large gradients and large deviations from equilibrium. In some of its incarnations, the method of moments can be used to justify the hydrodynamic behavior of a relativistic gas. However, it can‚Äôt be directly generalized. If long range interactions are introduced through a medium-dependent mass or a semi-classical gauge field, some diverging integrals would appear at the higher orders after a naive, direct, application of the method [1]. Even if it is not necessary at the lowest orders, it has been shown that it is convenient to reorganize the expansion around resummed moments. In this way one avoids systematically, at all orders, any coupling with ill-defined moments [1].
If one uses the quantum precursor of the distribution function, that is the Wigner distribution, such ill-defined moments arise at the very first step, therefore a regularization scheme is needed from the very the lowest order (hydrodynamics). Even in a physical case that is arbitrarily close to the kinetic limit, some of the moments, which are otherwise well defined in kinetic theory, are divergent due to the off-shell nature of the Wigner distribution. However, in this case too, it is possible to introduce a set of regularized moments [2]. They are well defined at all orders, and they can be used to generalize the method of moments (and the hydrodynamic expansion) in the quantum case. In the kinetic limit they reproduce the ordinary expansion from the method of moments. More importantly, they can be used to estimate whether hydrodynamics is expected to work or to fail in the cases in which the naive generalization of the method is ill-defined and gives no answers. Finally, it can be checked in the exactly solvable (0+1)-dimensional expansion, that the approximate solutions from the regularized hydrodynamic expansion maintain the fast convergence to the exact solutions (already seen in relativistic kinetic theory) even for initial conditions which are very far from the kinetic limit [2].

While the effects are small at high collision energies compared with the standard Bjorken model of the initial state, they are large at low collision energies, where the nuclear passing time is not small compared to the parton formation time. The temperature $T(t)$ and chemical potentials $\mu(t)$ of the dense matter can be extracted from the densities [2]. Therefore, including the nuclear thickness is essential for the determination of the $T-\mu_B$ trajectory in the QCD phase diagram for relativistic nuclear collisions at low to moderate energies such as the RHIC-BES energies.

In this talk, I will discuss our semi-analytical method that includes the nuclear thickness effect and its results on densities $\epsilon(t)$, $n_B(t)$, $n_Q(t)$, and $n_S(t)$. Then, I will show the extracted $T(t)$, $\mu_B(t)$, $\mu_S(t)$, and $\mu_Q(t)$ for a quark-gluon plasma with either quantum statistics or Boltzmann statistics. Next, I will show our results on the $T-\mu_B$ trajectories, highlighting how the trajectories depend on the chosen statistics and the nuclear thickness in relation to the possible location of the critical end point (CEP). Finally, I will show how this semi-analytical  model can be useful to researchers who study high density physics and search for the CEP.

Despite a long history of experimental and theoretical studies, the nature of this short-lived resonance is far from being understood and there is no agreement about its quark structure. According to different models, it has been associated with a meson, considered as a tetraquark, or as a KK molecule. In this talk we address two complementary avenues to study the nature of the f$_0$(980) resonance. 

The first method exploits the excellent tracking and particle identification of the ALICE experiment to measure the differential spectra and integrated yield of the f$_0$(980) meson produced in pp and p-Pb collisions at an energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 5 TeV. The results are discussed in the comparison with models and the properties of other hadrons. The nuclear modification factor shows hints of final-state effects in p-Pb collisions and will be presented and discussed in this perspective. The second method involves femtoscopic correlations of non-identical charged kaons (K$^+$K$^-$), studied in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. For the analysis of the K$^+$K$^-$ correlation, a comparison of the measured data to the Lednick$\acute{\rm y}$-Luboshitz interaction model allows to extract for the first time the f$_0$(980) mass and coupling parameters.

Poster Session 3 T12_1,poster,Causal second order magnetohydrodynamics from kinetic theory using RTA approximation,"Panda, Ankit Kumar",NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH,Unknown,"The magnetic field seems to play a significant role in shaping and working the visible universe. It gives rise to a lot of non-trivial and anomalous behavior in the system in which they are present, extending from the effects seen in condensed matter physics in Dirac and Weyl semi-metals to large cosmological objects like in neutron stars or black holes. The strength of the magnetic field in natural systems can be as low as $10^{-5}$T for that of the Earth to as high as $10^{11}$ T in the Magnetars. But the strongest magnetic field on the Earth is manmade and is produced in high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC or LHC. The magnitude of the magnetic field produced here is 3 to 4 orders larger than that produced in Magnetars[1]. In a heavy-ion collision, a strongly coupled Quark-Gluon Plasma(QGP) is formed, and its space-time evolution can be described using viscous hydrodynamics formulation. The presence of a strong transient electromagnetic field in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions indicates that the dynamics of the QGP can be better understood using the RMHD (Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics) formulation. The RMHD framework describes the system of any relativistic charged fluid and its interaction with the electromagnetic field, and the governing laws for fluid and electromagnetic fields need to be solved in a self-consistent manner. There are a few underlying microscopic theories by which these studies can be done; the kinetic theory is one of them. In our current work[2,3], we use the relativistic Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation for the collision kernel. Here, we have formulated the second-order causal evolution equations for the viscous stresses, e.g., bulk, diffusion, and shear stresses, along with the calculation of relevant transport coefficients for both ideal and resistive MHD. We have also computed anisotropic components of the electrical conductivity. These formulations can serve as an input to numerical studies. Last but not least, we have given $\delta f$ (slight deviation from the equilibrium distribution function), which can be readily applied to the Cooper-Frye prescription for calculating particle spectra in phenomenological studies.

While the Bayesian statistical formalism handles this exists, the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) Framework [1] aims to use computational research to transform these theoretical relationships into practical tools and techniques for making reliable computational predictions of complex systems with well-quantified uncertainties. The latter means using Bayesian statistics to increase the modeling accuracy of theoretical predictions and help in experimental design.

In this poster, for the first time, we outline the emulation (Gaussian processes toolset) and calibration components of the BAND framework to estimate theoretical uncertainties. As an example, we focus on the application of Bayesian inference (in particular Bayesian parameter estimation) to quantify uncertainty for the elastic nucleon-deuteron (Nd) scattering calculations at nucleon laboratory energies up to 200 MeV performed within the Faddeev approach. To that end, we use the current chiral effective interactions comprising semilocal momentum-space regularized two- and three-nucleon forces up to the third chiral order developed by the Low Energy Nuclear Physics International Collaboration (LENPIC) [2]. The uncertainties arising from these effective potentials can be quantified within the BAND framework. We also show truncation errors, which give an important contribution to the uncertainty budget. In this case, we use a slightly modified version of the Bayesian approach [3] developed by the BUQEYE Collaboration [4].

Nevertheless, it has been shown that the inclusion of terms that are asymptotically of third order in gradients may be required to describe the dynamics of a fluid in the extreme conditions present at the early stages of these collisions [1]. For this purpose, third-order formulations of relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics were also developed [2]. Recently, a linear stability analysis was performed for such theories and it was demonstrated that they are intrinsically acausal and unstable [3]. In this contribution, we derive linearly causal and stable third-order fluid-dynamical equations from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. We show that we recover the theory proposed in Ref. [2] when certain relaxation times are taken to zero, but this limiting procedure is forbidden by causality and stability conditions. Finally, we compare the solutions of our novel theory with those of Boltzmann equation in 0+1 Bjorken flow and show that they are in good agreement.

In order to investigate, how such an effective description emerges from the underlying microscopic dynamics we calculate the linear response of energy and flow perturbations in the sound and shear channels from a first-principle calculation in kinetic theory. By using both QCD kinetic theory and Relaxation Time Approximation we investigate the similarities and differences of the excitations in different microscopic theories and compare them to first and second order hydrodynamics.

Poster Session 3 T12_1,poster,Search for dark photons in heavy-ion collisions,"Bratkovskaya, Elena","GSI, Darmstadt & Frankfurt Uni.",Germany,"The vector $U$-bosons, or so called 'dark photons', are one of the possible candidates for the dark matter (DM) mediators. They are supposed to interact with the standard matter via a 'vector portal' due to the $U(1)-U(1)^\prime$ symmetry group mixing which might make them visible in particle and heavy-ion experiments. While there is no confirmed observation of dark photons, the detailed analysis of different experimental data allows to estimate the upper limit for the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2$  depending on the mass $M_U$ of $U$-bosons which is also unknown. 

In Ref. [1] we have  introduced a procedure to define theoretical constraints on the upper limit of $\epsilon^2(M_U)$  from heavy-ion (as well as $p+p$ and $p+A$) dilepton data. Our analysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach which reproduces well the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions. Additionally to the different dilepton channels originating from interactions and decays of ordinary (Standard Model) matter particles (mesons and baryons), we incorporate in the microscopic transport approach - for the first time - the decay  of hypothetical $U$-bosons to dileptons, $U\to e^+e^-$, where the $U$-bosons themselves are produced by the Dalitz decay of pions $\pi^0\to \gamma U$, $\eta$-mesons $\eta \to \gamma U$ and Delta resonances $\Delta \to N U$. 

Using the fact that dark photons are not observed in dilepton experiments so far one can require that their contribution can not exceed some limit which would make them visible in experimental data. By varying the parameter $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ in the model calculations, one can obtain upper constraints on $\epsilon^2(M_U)$  based on pure theoretical results for dilepton spectra under the constraint that the 'surplus' of the DM contribution doesn't overshine the SM contributions (which is equivalent to the measured dilepton spectra) with any requested accuracy. We confront our results with the analysis from  the HADES Collaboration [2] at SIS18 energies where the dark photons are not observed as well as with the world data collection.

This analysis can help to estimate the requested  accuracy for future experimental searches of 'light' dark photons by dilepton experiments. We note that this procedure can be extended for the search of dark photons of any masses when the corresponding production and decay channels are implemented in the transport approach.

We investigate in this work [1] the leading quantum corrections to the TMB distribution of fast partons in large QCD media. We show in particular that the resummation to all orders of double logarithmic contributions from gluon radiation in the presence of a saturation boundary yields a universal distribution which exhibits anomalous scaling of super diffusive type in contrast with normal diffusion seen at tree level. Exploiting a formal analogy with traveling waves in reaction-diffusion processes and gluon saturation we derive exact pre-asymptotic analytic solutions for fixed [1] and running coupling [2]. 

This remarkable anomalous diffusion caused by nonlocal quantum corrections is reflected by the emergence of a heavy tail at large transverse momentum, akin to L√©vy random walks, which may have measurable effects in dijet production in HIC.

Poster Session 3 T12_1,poster,New paradigm in anisotropic flow analyses with correlation techniques,"Bilandzic, Ante",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"The measurements of anisotropic flow in heavy-ion collisions were crucial in establishing the perfect-liquid paradigm about quark--gluon plasma (QGP) properties.  Most of these results were obtained with two- and multi-particle correlation techniques, which are in an environment characterized by large multiplicities and large flow values a precision tool. However, in the flow measurements in small-collision systems, correlation techniques are not reliable.

To make further progress, we reconcile for the first time the strict mathematical formalism of multivariate cumulants with the usage of cumulants in anisotropic flow analyses. We demonstrate that properties of cumulants are preserved only for the stochastic observables on which the cumulant expansion has been performed directly,  and if there are no underlying symmetries due to which some terms in the cumulant expansion are identically zero. This reconciliation yields to the next generation of observables to be used in flow analyses which do satisfy all fundamental properties of cumulants: symmetric and asymmetric cumulants of flow amplitudes, cumulants of symmetry plane correlations, and event-by-event cumulants of azimuthal angles. Their measurements will provide new and independent constraints on the QGP properties, and in this contribution the first predictions from state-of-the-art theoretical models are presented [1].

We demonstrate how the new event-by-event cumulants of azimuthal angles can disentangle flow and nonflow contributions in the measured correlations. To achieve that goal, we present the first analytic solutions for the long-standing problem of combinatorial background in the measured correlations [2]. 

We conclude that the observed universality of flow measurements in pp, p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions can be attributed solely to the interplay between nonflow correlations and combinatorial background, which always exhibits universal scaling as a function of multiplicity.

Poster Session 3 T12_1,poster,Towards a causal and stable first-order theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics,"Speranza, Enrico",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"Over the past years, considerable effort has been made to study the novel phenomena displayed by chiral systems arising from the interplay between quantum anomalies and the electromagnetic and vortical fields in a hydrodynamic framework [1]. Such novel theory is often referred to as chiral hydrodynamics. It is possible to derive the equations of motion of chiral hydrodynamics from a kinetic theory formulation, the so-called chiral kinetic theory  [2]. While this approach has provided great insight into the physics of chiral matter, very little is known about the properties of the chiral hydrodynamic equations of motion and their solutions, especially in the nonlinear regime. Such knowledge is crucial when studying the consequences of the chiral anomaly in hydrodynamic simulations of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. In this work [3] we prove that ideal chiral hydrodynamics, as derived from chiral kinetic theory, is acausal and its initial-value problem is ill-posed. Therefore, such theory cannot be used to determine how the chiral anomaly affects the hydrodynamic evolution. We show that these fundamental issues can be cured by using different definitions (frames) for the hydrodynamic fields. Finally, a new causal and stable first-order theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics is presented.

In this talk, we present examples of applying this novel formalism to study the properties of QCD-like systems. In the first example, we study the dependence of the conductivity/resistivity on the external magnetic field in a chiral medium (the constituent of which includes chiral fermions). While it is widely believed that chiral magnetic effect (CME) would lead to a negative magneto-resistivity, we find that CME together with hydrodynamic fluctuations gives rise to a positive magneto-resistance [2]. Second, in the view that non-Gaussian fluctuations of baryon density are important for the QCD critical point search, we derive evolution equations for the critical non-Gaussian fluctuations of a conserved density and obtain closed-form solutions based on field theory techniques [3]. Those results can be readily implemented for simulations in realistic situations of heavy-ion collisions. In addition, we find that nonlinear interactions among noise fields, which are missing in traditional stochastic hydrodynamics, could potentially contribute to the quartic (fourth-order) fluctuations in the scaling regime in off-equilibrium situations.

In this study, we attempt to observe the effect of multiple parton collisions in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ =200GeV. We assume that within an event selection with similar $N_{\textrm{part}}$, events with higher particle multiplicity would have more multiple parton collisions. In these events we would expect a large $v_2$ because of the larger energy density. In order to obtain $N_\textrm{part}$, we utilize the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) which detects the energies of spectator-neutrons.

Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) offer a natural environment in which to observe the photon-initiated production of Beyond Standard Model (BSM) processes with QED couplings. One such process sensitive to BSM effects is light-by-light scattering. This process was directly observed for the first time in UPC events at the LHC by ATLAS. In this talk, the final ATLAS measurements of light-by-light scattering will be  presented. These measurements are performed using the full Run-2 dataset which results in  substantially reduced uncertainties compared to the previous measurements. They provide a precise and unique opportunity to investigate extensions of the Standard Model, such as presence of axion-like particles. Measurements of tau-pair production via two-photon scattering that investigate the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau lepton are also presented.

The predictions are derived using the solution to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation for proton and nuclear targets with the collinearly improved kernel and including the impact-parameter dependence. Two different approaches to the nuclear case are studied: a solution obtained using a newly proposed type of initial condition which represents the given nucleus and the solutions based on an initial condition representing a proton coupled to a Glauber-Gribov prescription to obtain dipole-nucleus amplitudes. We study the influence from the different energy evolutions of these two approaches in the following photo-nuclear processes: inclusive and diffractive DIS, coherent production of a J/psi meson in ultra-peripheral collisions at the LHC, and the deeply virtual Compton scattering. By comparison to the available data and to other CGC-inspired models, we demonstrate that the future measurements will be useful to discriminate among different approaches to saturation physics.

Poster Session 2 T14_2,poster,Assessing the ultra-central flow puzzle in the Bayesian era,"Veiga Giannini, Andre",Unknown,Unknown,"A longstanding problem in the field is the inability for any simulation model to describe experimental flow data in extremely central collisions --- in particular, models always predict either an elliptic flow that is too large or triangular flow that is too small (or both).  We reassess the status of this puzzle in light of recent progress in Bayesian parameter estimation,  in which a large model parameter space can be efficiently explored to determine what parameters are necessary for a good fit to experimental results, and how well state-of-the-art models are able to describe data.    We explore predictions for flow in ultra-central collisions from multiple recent Bayesian models [1,2] that were tuned to various observables in different collision systems at typical centralities.  We find that ultra-central data can now be described with better accuracy than in previous calculations.  However, the tension with experimental observation still exists, and gets worse as one goes to more central collisions.  Thus, the physics of ultra-central collisions is still not fully understood.  We speculate on ways that the puzzle could be solved in the future.

We introduce a baryon stopping parameter which controls the initial rapidity distribution of baryon charge after the nuclei interpenetration, and the amount of energy and momentum deposited from the incoming nucleons into the produced quark-gluon plasma. The energy-momentum and net baryon charge conservation impose correlations among the initial energy, baryon distributions, and longitudinal flow.

Finally, we will present a systematic study of $v_1(y)$ in Au+Au collisions at different centrality classes, various beam energies, and additional identified species (kaons and lambdas) to test our hybrid model.

This enhancement is found in comparison to standard calculations, which rely on the folding of equilibrium rates to a hydrodynamical evolution.

In contrast to femtoscopic measurements of bulk particles, this measurement is more sensitive to earlier times in the systems evolution.

In the ALICE experiment, photons can be reconstructed either by using the calorimeters or via conversions in the detector material. Conversions benefit from an excellent energy resolution and are able to provide direct photon measurements down to very low momentum.

(US),USA,"Direct photons are a useful probe to study the properties of QGP and the dynamic evolution of the collision system as they do not interact with the medium strongly. Low transverse momentum direct photons are believed to originate primarily from thermal radiation, however, calculations of thermal photon emission fall short in describing the measured direct photon yield and the anisotropy at the same time. The question is tied to the photon production mechanism in heavy ion collisions.

In this poster, more precise measurements of the direct photon momentum spectrum in the range of $0.8-10$ GeV/c from the high statistics data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2014 is presented. The effective temperature of the system formed in such heavy-ion collisions is studied. In addition, direct photon production as a function of collision system size is analyzed, wherein a power law scaling behavior is observed. The extracted fit parameter to the scaling will put more constraints on the current theoretical models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wenqing', 'last_name': 'Fan', 'fullName': 'Fan, Wenqing', 'id': '6540306', 'affiliation': 'Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Poster Session 2 T13,poster,Dilepton production at NLO and intermediate invariant mass observables,"Jackson, Greg","INT, University of Washington",USA,"Because photons and dileptons are unlikely to interact after production within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), they can probe the inner dynamics of this strongly interacting system. To leading order in the electromagnetic coupling and all orders in the strong coupling, the observable emission rates can be determined from the QCD vector channel spectral function. The resummed next-to-leading order (NLO) spectral function is intimately related to the Euclidean correlator, which can be estimated from continuum-extrapolated lattice data [1]. We report on two aspects of our theoretical investigation: *i*) we embed derived NLO dilepton rates (at $\mu_B = 0$) in viscous, relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions and focus our analysis on the invariant mass region $1 < M < 3$ GeV where QGP manifestations are expected to be prevalent, and *ii*) we generalize the perturbative calculation to non-zero baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$. In the first part, we show results for dilepton measurements at RHIC and LHC energies. In the second part, we report that the presence of $\mu_B$ not only modifies the quark distribution in the QGP, but also the thermal masses that control the necessary screening effects. While the latter has been examined for real photons [2], we present new results away from the light cone. This involves properly understanding how $\mu_B$ enters the strict NLO computation, the so-called LPM effect (at low invariant masses), and how to smoothly interpolate between the two regimes as originally advocated in Ref. [3]. These results enable predictions to be made for low-energy heavy ion experiments that will explore QGPs with net baryon content.

Poster Session 2 T13,poster,Photon-Jet correlations in central heavy-ion collisions with JETSCAPE,"Sirimanna, Chathuranga",Wayne State University,United States,"We present a comparison of observables related to photon-triggered jets for different collision energy systems, at LHC and RHIC energies, with the latest update of the JETSCAPE framework [1,2]. In heavy-ion collisions, multiple probes are used to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Photons can be produced at any stage of the heavy-ion collision. Since photons do not interact with the medium constituents, prompt photons that are produced early, directly in the hard sub-processes, can be used to differentially study the modification of the recoiling jet. In this work, we study photon-triggered jets through charged jet yields, momentum fraction correlations $(x_J)$, and angular $(\Delta \phi)$ correlations, using the JETSCAPE framework. We extend our previous work of $(x_J)$ and $(\Delta \phi)$ [3] with new high statistics runs, using the latest version of the multi-stage JETSCAPE framework. We use the corresponding isolation cut on the final state to identify the prompt-photons, to get a reasonable comparison with the experimental data. The same set of parameters tuned for single inclusive jet and leading hadron analysis, with a new virtuality dependent transport coefficient $\hat{q}$, are used in this calculation as well, with no refitting. For the first time, the study is done simultaneously for both RHIC and LHC energies. The comparison with experimental data for different collision systems and energies provides a wide-ranging, parameter-free, and independent verification of the multistage approach in heavy-ion collisions.

Thermal photons are soft and penetrating probes of the strongly-coupled nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Their spectrum and momentum anisotropies remember the QGP‚Äôs chemistry evolution and its dynamical expansion. Using medium profiles well-calibrated with hadronic data at LHC energies, we highlight that photon observables can additionally reveal the chemical equilibration process and signal the formation of QGP in small systems [1]. At RHIC BES energies, a study of direct photon production in Au+Au collisions at 19.6 - 62.4 GeV will quantify the role of finite baryon chemical potential in thermal photon emission. Photon spectrum and anisotropic flow coefficients show strong sensitivity to the early-time dynamical initialization. This survey confirms photons as a powerful tool to elucidate QGP dynamics over a wide range of collision energies and serve as a necessary complement to hadronic measurements.

Because the relaxation time of the hot QCD matter to the electromagnetic fields is comparable with the lifetime of external electromagnetic field, we question, for the first time, the use of the Ohm‚Äôs law directly to compute the Faraday current and further induced magnetic field. By calculations employing the parton transport model combined with the solution of Maxwell's equations, we focus on the generation of the induced electric current and examine the validity of Ohm's law. We find that the electric current builds from zero and then relaxes towards the value given by Ohm's law. The relaxation time is not so short that can be neglected. The real Faraday current is much lower than expected. And this significantly suppresses the induced magnetic field.

The model was uniquely based on the system's geometry and local energy and momentum conservation in the quark gluon plasma produced in the reaction.

We studied Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 17.3 GeV and 8.8 GeV, and obtained a surprisingly good agreement between our model and the experimental data (rapidity spectra) collected by the NA49 experiment at CERN SPS as a function of centrality. Furthermore, we applied this model to the nucleon+nucleon (N+N) collisions by taking into account the changes in the overall energy balance between the Pb+Pb and N+N system (baryon stopping, strangeness enhancement, and isospin content). The obtained results again display a very good agreement between the model prediction and experimental rapidity distributions in proton+proton collisions measured by the NA49 and NA61/SHINE Collaborations. This shows that our approach is applicable also for small systems in the CERN SPS energy range.

A discussion of future applications of this model to small and large systems at LHC energies will be included in this poster.

Contrary to the expectations, the preliminary results of the ALICE Collaboration indicate that, e.g., the proton-to-pion ratio does not exhibit the characteristic enhancement at intermediate $p_T$ in events with large \rt with respect to minimum-bias pp collisions. In this work, we investigate the origin of this effect using the Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 Monte Carlo event generators. The effect is a consequence of a selection bias attributed to wide-angle gluon emissions which creates jets that populate the transverse region. Therefore, we propose a modified version of $R_T$ in order to suppress its sensitivity to hard gluon Bremsstrahlung, and enhance the sensitivity to soft Multiparton Interactions (MPI). This approach could be useful in order to study the particle production in the jet-like region as a function of MPI.  The implementation of these ideas in data will provide more insight into the production mechanisms of hadrons in high-multiplicity pp collisions, and its connection with heavy-ion phenomena.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gyula', 'last_name': 'Bencedi', 'fullName': 'Bencedi, Gyula', 'id': '6540377', 'affiliation': 'Wigner Research Centre for Physics (Wigner RCP) (HU)', 'emailHash': 'bfbcb0947232ec4b8ef99df10a726799', 'db_id': 6540377, 'person_id': 6338321}"

With the new hadronization model, the recent ALICE measurements of $j_{\rm T}$ distributions can be quantitatively described, especially for low and intermediate $j_{\rm T}$ regions. We observe that high-energy jets have more large-$j_{\rm T}$ particles than low-energy jets, which are consistent with the experimental measurements. Importantly, the predicted ratio of $j_{\rm T}$ distributions between p $+$ Pb and p $+$ p shows a sizeable enhancement above unity of low-$j_{\rm T}$ particles and a suppression of intermediate-$j_{\rm T}$ particles, which indicates the possible effects from jet-medium interactions in small systems. This jet observable is suggested to probe the QGP medium effects in small systems in this talk. On the other hand, the $p_{\left|\right|}$ ratio of jet distribution is proposed as a complementary observable to probe jet-medium response in small systems.

We also implement jet fragmentation $\xi$ and $p_{\rm T, track}$ distributions and compare to CMS measurements. The similar enhancement of soft jet particles and suppression of hard jet particles appear in both new hadronization model and original AMPT hadronization model, which demonstrate that this enhancement (suppression) is model independent. We also systematically study the difference between two hadronization models, and find out that it is important for studying jet observables in small systems with a proper hadronization scheme.

Poster Session 1 T05_2,poster,An Asymmetric Exact Solution for Longitudinally Expanding Ideal Fluid,"SHI, Shuzhe",Stony Brook University,USA,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has been successful in describing the evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma, as well as understanding and predicting experimental measurements highlighting the collective behavior of the observed hadrons created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In parallel with the remarkable progress made in numerical fluid dynamics, the study of analytical solutions remains helpful in capturing intuitive pictures and important features.

In this work, we report a new exact and explicit ***analytical*** solution for relativistic ideal hydrodynamic equations. In this solution, the fluid expands in the longitudinal direction, and contains the plateau structure for finite rapidity range, and can be either ***symmetric*** or ***asymmetric*** (with respect to mid-rapidity). Both these features are controlled by two parameters in the solution, which allows flexibility in covering the longitudinal shape of p-A and A-A collisions. We further calculate the corresponding pseudorapidity distribution of hadron yields, and find good agreement with the experimental measurements in high-energy Pb-Pb, Au-Au, p-Pb, and d-Au collisions. We also stress the importance of exact solutions as a baseline for the assessment of non-equilibrium features, and for the validation of numerical simulations. Considering that this exact solution can be rapidity-asymmetric, this last point appears especially valuable.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shuzhe', 'last_name': 'SHI', 'fullName': 'SHI, Shuzhe', 'id': '6550774', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '43ee4fa1be40bb48a0ac0207a19d1f27', 'db_id': 6550774, 'person_id': 6336056}"
Poster Session 1 T05_2,poster,Sub-nucleon geometry and multiparticle cumulants including $c_{2}\{4 \}$ in $p+p$ collisions,"Zhao, Xinli",Unknown,Unknown,"Collective flow-like signals including the ridge structure observed in small collision systems at high energies that are similar to those in large collision systems have led to questions about the onset of  collectivity in nuclear collisions. Multiparticle cumulant methods are better in extracting the flow signals as they can suppress nonflow effects  that are especially significant in small systems. For example, a negative four-particle cumulant $c_{2}\{4\}$ is expected when the correlation comes from the collective flow. A previous study from a hydrodynamics-based hybrid model could not produce negative $c_{2}\{4\}$ for $p+p$ collisions at 13 TeV [1], regardless of the analysis method such as the standard, two-subevent and three-subevent cumulants.

In this study [2], we use the string melting version of a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model without or with the sub-nucleon geometry for the proton to study multiparticle cumulants in $p+p$  collisions at 13 TeV. We have found that both versions of the model can produce $c_{2}\{4\}<0$ for  high-multiplicity events. The relation between $c_{2}\{4 \}$ and the parton scattering cross section is  non-monotonic, where only a finite range of parton cross sections can lead to negative $c_{2} \{4  \}$ for high-multiplicity $p+p$ events.  In addition, the AMPT version with the proton sub-nucleon geometry describes the multiplicity  dependence of $c_{2} \{4  \}$ much better than the version without. This demonstrates the importance  of incorporating the sub-nucleon geometry and the potential of using multiparticle cumulants to probe the detailed sub-nucleon geometry in studies of small collision systems.

Recent preliminary measurements from STAR in p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV demonstrate inherent correlations between high-$Q^{2}$ parton scatterings and event activity (EA), measured using either detectors at backward (Au-going) rapidities or underlying event (UE) at mid-rapidity. The measurements at STAR disfavor jet quenching as an explanation for the suppression of jet yield observed in high-EA collisions. This leads to an opportunity to probe the early stages of the collisions and cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects. In this talk, we show correlations of backward-rapidity EA with mid-rapidity UE, as well as measurements of EA-dependent modifications to charged hadron spectra and jets.

The $p_{\rm T}$  spectra of these hadrons can be described well by a distribution using the Tsallis statistics. The Tsallis parameters $q$ and $T$ measure the degree of deviation of the system from an equilibrium state and the effective temperature at freeze-out conditions, respectively. The Tsallis formalism with the inclusion of flow velocity can describe the $p_{\rm T}$  spectra from low to high $p_{\rm T}$  ranges. This formalism overcomes the drawback of the limited pT range description through the blast-wave fits of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra.<br />
	In this work, a detailed study of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of the identified charged particles (pions, kaons, protons) as well as all charged particles in the heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) energies (from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV) and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =$ 2.76 TeV to 5.44 TeV) are performed using the non-extensive Tsallis statistics. The extracted Tsallis parameters are found to be dependent on the particle species, collision energy, centrality, and fitting ranges of the $p_{\rm T}$. With increases of the collision energies, $q$ increases in a systematic manner whereas $T$ has a decreasing trend. It is observed that the parameters $q, T$, changes with increasing $p_{\rm T}$ fitting ranges and at mid $p_{\rm T}$ region the parameter are found to be unchanged, which can describe the physics of the systems. The Tsallis parameters and the quality of fitting are found to follow a mass ordering. The contribution of the flow velocity of the particles are considered with the Tsallis statistics through Tsallis blast-wave (TBW) model, which is found to have a better description of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of different particle species.

Proton-Proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider showed surprising signatures of a strongly interacting, thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which was thought only to form in collisions of large nuclear systems. Another puzzle observed earlier in electron-position collisions is that production yields of various hadron species appear to follow a thermal-like distribution with a common temperature. We propose searches for thermal and collective properties of a single parton propagating in  (or ‚Äúcolliding into‚Äù) the vacuum using high multiplicity jets in high-energy elementary collisions, using a new frame with the jet direction defined as the beam z axis. In this single jet frame, a series of observables relevant to signatures of QGP are studied using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator in pp collisions at LHC energies. Experimental observation of collective and thermal effects in such single parton systems will offer a new view of non-perturbative QCD dynamics of multi-parton systems at the smallest scales. Absence of any collective effect may offer new insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the observed thermal behavior of particle production in high energy collisions. Opportunities for additional studies at future facilities, such as  the EIC or a proposed muon-ion collider, future circular collider (FCC) are also discussed..

One exciting such observable $\rho$($v^2_n$,[$p_T$]) gauges the correlation between the mean transverse momentum ($p_T$) of particles in an event and the various flow coefficients ($v_n$) in the same event. Recently it has been proposed that very low multiplicity events may be sensitive to initial-state glasma correlations rather than flow-related dynamics. We find utilizing the IP-JAZMA framework that the color domain explanation for the glasma results are incomplete. We then explore predictions from PYTHIA-ANGANTYR having only non-flow correlations and AMPT having both non-flow and flow-type correlations. We find that PYTHIA-ANGANTYR has non-flow contributions to $\rho$($v^2_n$,[$p_T$]) in $p$+O, $p$+Pb, O+O collisions that are positive at low multiplicity and comparable to the glasma correlations. It is striking that in PYTHIA-8 in $pp$ collisions there is actually a sign-change from positive to negative $\rho$($v^2_n$,[$p_T$]) as a function of multiplicity. The AMPT results match the experimental data general trends in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, except at low multiplicity where AMPT has the opposite sign. In $p$+Pb collisions, AMPT has the opposite sign from experimental data and we explore this within the context of parton geometry.

Using these coefficients for three sets of two-particle correlations, azimuthal anisotropy coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ are extracted for midrapidity charged hadrons as a function of transverse momentum. As discussed in arXiv:2107.07287 and in this talk, we use the available coefficients to explore various non-flow hypotheses as well as compare the results with theoretical model calculations. The non-flow methods fail basic closure tests with AMPT and PYTHIA/ANGANTYR, particularly when including correlations with particles in the low multiplicity light-projectile going direction. In data, the non-flow adjusted $v_2$ results are modestly lower in $p$+Au and the adjusted $v_3$ results are more significantly higher in $p$+Au and $d$+Au. However, the resulting higher values for the ratio $v_3/v_2$ in p+Au at RHIC compared to p+Pb at the LHC is additional evidence for a significant over-correction. Incorporating these additional checks, the conclusion that these flow coefficients are dominated by initial geometry coupled with final-state interactions (e.g.~hydrodynamic expansion of quark-gluon plasma) remains true, and explanations based on initial-state glasma are ruled out. The detailed balance between intrinsic and fluctuation-driven geometry and the exact role of weakly versus strongly-coupled pre-hydrodynamic evolution remains an open question for triangular flow, requiring further theoretical and experimental investigation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ron', 'last_name': 'Belmont', 'fullName': 'Belmont, Ron', 'id': '6540348', 'affiliation': 'University of North Carolina at Greensboro', 'emailHash': 'e82e9030e379088a56dd3469d4fcffab', 'db_id': 6540348, 'person_id': 6305766}"

This poster presents the measurement of charmonium yields in pp collisions at ‚àös = 13 TeV and p‚ÄîPb collisions at ‚àösNN = 8.16 TeV as a function of charged-particle multiplicity. J/—± and —±(2S) are reconstructed in their dimuon decays within rapidity window -4.0 < ylab < -2.5. Charmonia yields are normalised to their respective average values. The charged-particle multiplicity is measured at central rapidity and also normalised to its average value. The excited-to-ground state ratio is also shown. Results are compared with model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Theraa M A', 'last_name': 'Tork', 'fullName': 'Tork, Theraa M A', 'id': '6544811', 'affiliation': 'Universit√© Paris-Saclay (FR)', 'emailHash': '4446bb88776ea97e9669a992a3dec478', 'db_id': 6544811, 'person_id': 6326601}"
Poster Session 1 T05_1,poster,Multiplicity dependent study of $\Lambda(1520)$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV with ALICE,"Padhan, Sonali",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),Unknown,"Hadronic resonances are effective tools for studying the hadronic phase in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In fact, their lifetime is comparable to the hadronic phase and resonances are sensitive to the hadronic phase effects such as re-scattering and regeneration processes which might affect the resonance yields and shape of the transverse momentum spectra. $\Lambda(1520)$ has a lifetime of around 13 fm/$\it{c}$, which lies in between the lifetimes of $K^*$ and $\Phi$ resonance. The resonance to stable particle yield ratios can be used to study the properties of the hadronic phase. Recently, ALICE observed the suppression of the $\Lambda(1520)/\Lambda$ ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV as a function of centrality. It is therefore interesting to investigate the multiplicity dependent study of $\Lambda(1520)/\Lambda$ ratio for pp collisions, since this can serve as a baseline for heavy-ion collisions. 


In this contribution, we present new results on the measurement of the baryonic resonance $\Lambda(1520)$ as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02 and 13 TeV. The transverse momentum spectrum, the integrated yield $< dN/dy >$, the average ${\textit{p}_{\rm T}}$ $<{\textit{p}_{\rm T}}>$ and the $ \Lambda(1520)/\Lambda$ yield ratio will be presented as a function of charged-particle multiplicity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sonali', 'last_name': 'Padhan', 'fullName': 'Padhan, Sonali', 'id': '6544824', 'affiliation': 'IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN)', 'emailHash': '8179191ae190ffb2d63634e3e40b78af', 'db_id': 6544824, 'person_id': 6328573}"

In jet shower evolution, the virtuality and energy of each jet parton vary considerably. Thus, in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets can be used as dynamical probes to investigate the jet-medium interaction at various scales. JETSCAPE is a framework that enables simulations describing physics at varying scales involved in in-medium jet evolution. The JETSCAPE framework incorporates multiple models, each effective at an individual scale range, and switches between them at appropriate scales while mediating their communication.

As a new feature, the jet quenching strength q-hat with an explicit virtuality dependence depending on the resolution scale evolution of jets is now supported by JETSCAPE. In this talk, we demonstrate that this further extension is crucial for a simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets and leading hadrons. For more detailed discussion of the virtuality dependence in the jet-medium interaction, observables for jet substructures, heavy-flavor jets, and photon-triggered jets are also explored.

Parallel Session T14: Hadron production and collective dynamics,parallel,Fluctuations of conserved charges in strong magnetic fields,"Liu, Jun-Hong",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Strong magnetic fields are created at the early stage of non-central heavy-ion collisions. However, whether the magnetic fields survive in the late stage of heavy-ion collisions and experimental measurements of various observables are reminiscent of the initially-created magnetic fields still remain elusive. In this talk we show that fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, strangeness and electrical charge can be useful to probe the imprint of the magnetic field in heavy-ion collisions. This is based on the fact that 1) these fluctuations and correlations have been shown to be very useful in understanding the QCD phase structure in the vanishing magnetic fields and 2) our very recent lattice QCD studies on these quantities in magnetic fields.


We will show the first lattice QCD results of the second-order fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD in the presence of a background magnetic field. Lattice QCD simulations are performed on $32^3\times N_\tau$ lattices using the highly improved staggered fermions in a fixed scale approach with $N_\tau\in[8,96]$ [1,2]. We study these quantities from zero temperature up to $\sim$1.7 $T_{pc}$ with 15 values of the magnetic field strength $eB\in[0,60~m_\pi^2]$ with pion mass $m_\pi=$220 MeV [1]. We also extend the above lattice QCD studies to the realistic case with physical pion mass $m_\pi=135$ MeV, and focus on a smaller temperature interval around the pseudo-critical temperature ranging from 0.9 $T_{pc}$ to 1.1 $T_{pc}$. To mimic the magnetic field strength produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collision experiments we now have 6 different values of the magnetic field strength up to $\sim$10$m_\pi^2$ with $m_\pi=135$ MeV [3].


We discuss the temperature and $eB$ dependences of the second-order fluctuations of and correlations among net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness. We find that these second-order fluctuations and correlations are substantially affected by $eB$. They even develop peak structures at sufficiently large $eB$ which could be related to a possible critical end point in the $T-eB$ plane. We propose to investigate these quantities in experiments in different centrality classes and collision systems where $eB$ could be different.

Poster Session 1 T05_1,poster,Interplay between core and corona from small to large systems,"Kanakubo, Yuuka",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"Motivated by experimental results implying the possible QGP (quark-gluon plasma) formation in small colliding systems, we extend the hydro-based framework incorporating non-equilibrated components which play an essential role in small colliding systems. It has been widely accepted that relativistic hydrodynamics well describes the dynamics of the QGP at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ regimes in large colliding systems. Hence hydro-based frameworks are used to tease out properties of the QGP in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In contrast, particle productions in small colliding systems have been studied through QCD-motivated phenomenological models such as perturbative QCD (semi-)hard processes followed by string fragmentation. As keeping these pictures in each regime, the ``marriage"" of relativistic hydrodynamics and QCD-motivated phenomenological framework is indispensable to explore the dynamics over wide ranges of colliding systems.

We realize this as the dynamical core--corona initialization framework (DCCI) [1-3]. In DCCI, QGP fluids are generated from initial partons obtained from PYTHIA/PYTHIA Angantyr [4-5] which reflects the total energy-momentum of incoming nuclei. We phenomenologically describe the fluidization of the initial partons with the dynamical aspects of the core--corona picture. Partons with sufficient secondary scatterings tend to generate QGP fluids (core) as equilibrated matter. 
While partons with insufficient secondary scatterings tend to survive as non-equilibrated matter (corona). This framework is, so to speak, the hydrodynamic afterburner for PYTHIA. By treating both locally equilibrated QGP fluids and non-equilibrated matter, the DCCI, as a hydro-based Monte Carlo event generator, is capable of describing from low to high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, from backward to forward rapidity, and from small to large colliding systems. 

In this talk, we investigate the interplay between core and corona components in high-energy nuclear collisions using DCCI. We reveal that the particle production from the core becomes dominant above $\langle dN_{\mathrm{ch}}/d\eta \rangle \sim 18$ regardless of the system size and the collision energy. Remarkably, the corona components turn out to dilute $\langle p_T \rangle$ and $v_2\{2\}$ obtained from the core components even in Pb--Pb collisions in which the entire system is often assumed to be locally equilibrated. These results suggest the importance of both equilibrated and non-equilibrated contributions in both small and large colliding systems towards an accurate understanding of the QGP properties.

Poster Session 2 T03,poster,Baryon number fluctuations and search for the CEP of QCD,"Fu, Wei-jie",Dalian University of Technology,Unknown,"Fluctuations of conserved charges, in particular the baryon number fluctuations, are thought of as experimental observables which are sensitive to the QCD critical end point (CEP), where the singular part of thermodynamic functions plays a dominant role. Indeed, in the past several years significant fluctuation measurements have been performed in the Beam Energy Scan program at RHIC, and an amount of relevant data are available. However, how can the experimental data be used to extract the information of CEP, e.g., the existence or location of CEP in the QCD phase diagram? This question could be answered through the combination of efforts from both experiments and theories. 

In this talk, first of all, I would like to discuss recent progress in the theoretical studies of baryon number fluctuations in the functional approach [1]. We compute the baryon number fluctuations up to tenth order at finite temperature and density. We show that a non-monotonic energy dependence of baryon number fluctuations can arise in the non-critical crossover region of the phase diagram. Our results compare well with recent experimental measurements of the kurtosis and the sixth-order cumulant of the net-proton distribution from the STAR collaboration. Then, I would like to discuss the influence of different locations of CEP in the QCD phase diagram on the collision-energy dependence of the observed cumulants, which could help us to constrain the regime of CEP based on the experimental data [2], especially in the region of interest, muB~(450-650) MeV, where the location of CEP is predicted by recent first-principle functional QCD [3].

The analysis of the same particle yields in a transport simulation of the UrQMD model yields the same features, i.e. two distinct temperatures for the chemical freeze-out. While both solutions yield the same number of hadrons after resonance decays, the feeddown contribution is very different for both cases. This highlights that two systems with different chemical composition can yield the same multiplicities after resonance decays. The nature of these two minima is further investigated by studying the time-dependent particle yields and extracted thermodynamic properties of the UrQMD model. It is confirmed, that the evolution of the high temperature solution resembles cooling and expansion of a hot and dense fireball. The low temperature solution displays an unphysical evolution: heating and compression of matter with a decrease of entropy. These results imply that the thermal model analysis of systems produced in low energy nuclear collisions is ambiguous but can be interpreted by taking also the time evolution and resonance contributions into account.

Poster Session 2 T03,poster,Polarization effects at finite temperature and magnetic field,"Szymanski, Michal",University of Wroclaw,Unknown,"Understanding the impact of strong magnetic fields on QCD dynamics is important for an accurate description of non-central heavy-ion collisions and neutron stars. Lattice simulations found that a finite magnetic field affects the chiral dynamics of QCD in a non-trivial way. At low temperatures, the magnitude of chiral condensate increases with the magnetic field, the phenomenon known as the magnetic catalysis (MC). At finite temperature, the magnetic field leads to a faster melting of the condensate and thus the chiral transition temperature decreases with the magnetic field. This phenomenon is called the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC). Lattice simulations suggest that IMC may be related to a competition between different effects in the magnetized QCD medium. The role of various interactions can be explored with the aid of effective models which makes them important tools, complementary to LQCD. While most chiral models are able to capture MC, they predict the opposite trend from LQCD calculations on the magnetic field dependence of the chiral transition temperature. In this talk we discuss the screening of a four-quark interaction by the ring diagram and its back-reaction on the quark gap equation in an effective chiral quark model. In consequence, a medium-dependent coupling is derived. This naturally reduces the chiral transition temperature in a class of chiral models and generates the inverse magnetic catalysis at finite temperatures and magnetic fields. These results provide a coherent description of inverse magnetic catalysis anchored to a reliable field-theoretical basis. We also demonstrate the important role of confining forces, via the Polyakov loop, in a positive feedback mechanism which reinforces the inverse magnetic catalysis.

Poster Session 2 T03,poster,Exploring the dense QCD matter with spin hall effect,"Song, Huichao",Peking University,Unknown,"Spin Hall effect (SHE) is a generation of spin polarization for moving spin carriers in material under an external electric field. Recent theoretical analyses show that spin Hall current can be induced by the baryon chemical potential $\mu_{B}$ gradient[1], which plays role of the analogous electric field and becomes sizable at the beam scan energies of RHIC . 

We study and predict this SHE signature for the hot and dense QCD matter created at RHIC-BES, using 3+1-d viscous hydrodynamics with AMPT initial condition. We propose to use the second Fourier coefficients of the local spin polarization of net Lambda hyperon as a sensitive probe to SHE. The resulting SHE observables show a qualitative difference in both the sign and beam energy dependence in calculations with and without SHE. Experimental observation of these distinct qualitative features would constitute strong evidence for SHE in the QCD matter under extreme density[2]. 

We also investigate the sensitivity of SHE signature to the initial Baryon stopping, QCD EoS at finite density and Baryon diffusive constant, and discuss the prospect of employing SHE to extract the properties of QCD matter at RHIC-BES energies[2].

Poster Session 2 T03,poster,Exploring bulk QGP properties through high-pt theory and data,"Zigic, Dusan",Institute of Physics Belgrade,Unknown,"High-pt theory and data are traditionally used to explore high-pt parton interactions with QGP, while bulk QGP properties are commonly explored through low-pt data. However, rare high-pt light and heavy flavor can also be a powerful tool for inferring bulk QGP properties, as they are sensitive to global QGP parameters. A prerequisite for such QGP tomography is a proper description of high-pt parton-medium interactions, which we here achieve through our finite-temperature dynamical energy loss formalism, recently implemented within the DREENA numerical framework.
 
We here advocate a novel QGP tomography approach, where bulk QGP properties are jointly constrained by low and high-pt data. The approach can include arbitrary temperature profiles from bulk QGP simulations, which are implemented in the dynamical energy loss framework, and subsequently compared with high-pt data. We will show how this method can be used to i) constrain the early evolution of QGP, ii) study the temperature dependence of eta/s, iii) explore if QGP in small systems is consistent with high-pt data. This research demonstrates inherent interconnections between low and high-pt QGP physics, strongly supporting the utility of such a synergistic approach to QGP tomography.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dusan', 'last_name': 'Zigic', 'fullName': 'Zigic, Dusan', 'id': '6552108', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics Belgrade', 'emailHash': '2b09c285d440328ce6359c7fb6415168', 'db_id': 6552108, 'person_id': 6339709}"

To deepen our understanding of QCD, it is crucial to estimate these transport properties (for instance, specific shear and bulk viscosity) in the light of experimental data as accurately as possible. In this talk, we present our latest study in inferring the transport properties of QGP by an improved Bayesian analysis using the CERN Large Hadron Collider Pb-Pb data at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}=2.76$ and 5.02 TeV. To improve the uncertainties, we include new observables sensitive to specific shear and bulk viscosity, reflecting mostly nonlinear hydrodynamic responses. We show that the uncertainty of the transport coefficients is significantly reduced by including the latest flow harmonic measurements. The analysis also reveals that higher-order harmonic flows and their correlations have a higher sensitivity to the transport properties than the other observables. This observation shows the necessity of accurate measurements of these observables in the future.

Poster Session 1 T02 / T03,poster,Transport properties of the QGP in the dynamical quasi-particle model with a CEP,"Soloveva, Olga",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"We explore the transport properties of the QGP matter in the high $\mu_B$ region, where a CEP is incorporated. To this aim we extend the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) - constructed for the description of non-perturbative QCD phenomena of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - to large baryon chemical potentials, $\mu_B$,  including  a critical end-point and a 1st order phase transition.
 The DQPM is based on covariant propagators for  quarks/antiquarks and gluons that have a finite width in their spectral functions (imaginary parts of the propagators). In DQPM the determination of complex selfenergies for the partonic degrees-of-freedom at zero and finite $\mu_B$ has been performed by adjusting the entropy density to the lattice QCD (lQCD) data. The temperature-dependent effective coupling (squared) $g^2(T/T_c)$, as well as the effective masses and widths or the partons are based in this adjustment. 
The novel extended dynamical quasi-particle model, named ""DQPM-CP"", makes it possible to describe thermodynamical and transport properties of quarks and gluons in a wide range of temperature, $T$, and baryon chemical potential, $\mu_B$, and reproduces the equation-of-state (EoS) of lattice QCD calculations in the crossover region of finite $T, \mu_B$. 
We apply a scaling ansatz for the strong coupling constant near the critical endpoint CEP, located at ($T^{CEP}$, $\mu^{CEP}_B) = (0.100, 0.960)$ GeV. We show the equation-of-state as well as the speed of sound for $T>T_c$ and for a wide range of $\mu_B$, which can be of interest for hydrodynamical simulations. Moreover, one of the advantages of the quasi-particle models is a simple implementation in transport models.
Furthermore, we consider two settings for the strange quark chemical potentials (I) $\mu_q=\mu_u=\mu_s=\mu_B/3$ and (II) $\mu_s=0,\mu_u=\mu_d=\mu_B/3$. The isentropic trajectories of the QGP matter are compared for these two cases. 
Despite that the phase diagram of the DQPM-CP is close to the PNJL calculations the transport coefficients of both approaches differ. This elucidates that the knowledge of the phase diagram alone is not sufficient to describe the dynamical evolution of strongly interacting matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Olga', 'last_name': 'Soloveva', 'fullName': 'Soloveva, Olga', 'id': '6540227', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt', 'emailHash': '42aa88c16a9e881161eb169cec5bde78', 'db_id': 6540227, 'person_id': 6334254}"

These equations of state, based on the original formulation developed in [1], include the constraint of strangeness neutrality, which is phenomenologically relevant for heavy-ion collisions [2]. We then use our parametrization to study the quartic cumulant of the baryon number $\chi_4^B$, which can be accessed experimentally via net-proton fluctuation kurtosis measurements. It was originally predicted, through universality arguments based on the leading singular contribution, that $\chi_4^B$ should show a specific nonmonotonic behavior due to the critical point. In particular, when following the freeze-out curve on the phase diagram by decreasing beam energy, the kurtosis is expected to dip, and then peak, when the beam energy scan passes close to the critical point. We find that, while the peak remains a solid feature, the presence of the critical point does not necessarily cause a dip in $\chi_4^B$ on the freeze-out line below the transition temperature [3].

The procedure converts out-of-equilibrium critical fluctuations described by extended hydrodynamics, known as Hydro+, into cumulants of hadron multiplicities that can be subsequently measured. We introduce a critical sigma field whose fluctuations cause correlations between observed hadrons due to the couplings of the sigma field to the hadrons. We match the QGP fluctuations obtained via solving the Hydro+ equations describing the evolution of critical fluctuations before freeze-out to the correlations of the sigma field. In turn, these are imprinted onto fluctuations in the multiplicities of hadrons, most importantly protons, after freeze-out via a generalization of the familiar half-a-century-old Cooper-Frye freeze-out prescription which we introduce. This framework allows us to study the effects of critical slowing down and the consequent deviation of the observable predictions from equilibrium expectations quantitatively. We can also quantify the suppression of cumulants due to the conservation of baryon number. We demonstrate the prescription in practice by freezing out the Hydro+ simulation in a simplified azimuthally symmetric and boost invariant background discussed previously.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maneesha ', 'last_name': 'Pradeep', 'fullName': 'Pradeep, Maneesha ', 'id': '6522443', 'affiliation': 'UIC', 'emailHash': '7de76f7de3e6ef56d0e194134cec8d3a', 'db_id': 6522443, 'person_id': 6336065}"

The SDM helps in selecting the events corresponding to different charge separations ($f_{DbCS}$). The charge separation distributions for each collision centrality is divided into 10 percentile bins to select potential CME-like events corresponding to the maximum charge separation (e.g. top 10$\%$) in a given collision centrality. Results will be discussed for two- and three-particle correlators with respect to each bin of $f_{DbCS}$ for each collision centrality for isobaric and Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV. The background contribution due to statistical fluctuations is obtained by shuffling the charges of particles in a given collision centrality. The correlated background amongst the produced particles which got removed due to shuffling is determined by restoring the shuffled charges.

We study distinct combinations of how the initial magnetic field and initial axial charge behave with changing initial energy as proposed in the previous literature. Most scenarios we consider lead to an increasing CME current, integrated over time, when increasing the initial energy. This would make it more likely to observe the CME at higher collision energies. However, in the scenario that the axial charge and magnetic field are fixed while the initial energy is decreased, the holographic plasma shows an increasing time-integrated CME current.

Poster Session 2 T02,poster,Probing early-time longitudinal dynamics with the $\Lambda$ hyperon's spin polarization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Ryu, Sangwook",Wayne State University,Unknown,"We present a systematic study of the hyperon global polarization's sensitivity to the collision systems' initial longitudinal flow velocity, by extending our previous work [1] to event-by-event 3+1D hydrodynamic simulations. By explicitly imposing local energy-momentum conservation when mapping the initial collision geometry to macroscopic hydrodynamic fields, the evolution of systems' orbital angular momentum (OAM) and fluid vorticity are studied. We find that a simultaneous description of the $\Lambda$ hyperons' global polarization and the slope of pion's directed flow can strongly constrain the size of longitudinal flow at the beginning of hydrodynamic evolution. We constrain the initial longitudinal flow size and the fraction of orbital angular momentum in the produced QGP fluid as a function of collision energy with the STAR measurements in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program. We examine the effects of the new thermal shear gradients on the hyperon's polarization. The gradients of $\mu_B / T$ can change the ordering between $\Lambda$'s and anti-$\Lambda$'s polarization. Finally, we investigate a variety of collision systems, including isobar, Cu+Au, Au+Au, and U+U, at the top RHIC energies. It enables us to study the system-size dependence of novel correlations among hyperons polarization and charge hadrons' averaged transverse momentum and anisotropic flow coefficients. These correlations are one of the key observables to verify the OAM-vorticity-polarization paradigm in heavy-ion collisions.

This observable $\mathcal{R}^{\hat{J}}$ shows a strong sensitivity to the fluid's shear viscosity. We verify our results with event-by-event hydrodynamic backgrounds. Furthermore, we expand our (3+1)D calculations by systematically studying the $\mathcal{R}^{\hat{J}}$'s dependence on the temporal-spatial size and magnitude of the deposited energy-momentum current. Finally, we quantify how the angular distribution of $\mathcal{R}^{\hat{J}}$ is correlated with the background flow field and can serve as a tomographic probe for the flow gradient field.

Poster Session 2 T02,poster,Two- and three-particle nonflow effects on the CME measurements in Au+Au and isobar collisions at RHIC,"Zhao, Jie",Purdue University,USA,"QCD vacuum fluctuations can lead to chirality anomaly and parity violation in metastable local domains. This would result in a charge separation along the strong magnetic field produced in off-center relativistic heavy-ion collisons, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). A widely used observable to search for the CME is the charge-dependent three-point correlator, $\Delta\gamma\equiv\langle \cos(\phi_{\alpha}+\phi_{\beta}-2\Psi_{\text{RP}})\rangle$, measured by the azimuthal angles of two particles relative to the reaction plane ($\Psi_{\text{RP}}$) or a third particle. The observable is, however, contaminated by a major elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) induced background. Recent measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 200 \text{ GeV}$ with respect to the spectator  and participant planes, where the flow-induced background is eliminated, indicate a postive CME signal ($f_{\text{CME}}$) with a $\sim 2 \sigma$ significance [1]. The newly released isobar results by STAR, properly normalized by the observed multiplicity difference, are systematically above the naive baseline expectation of unity [2].

Nonflow contaminations in $v_{2}$ and three-particle correlations, however, can still affect the $f_{\text{CME}}$ measurements in Au+Au collisions and the isobar baseline to deviate from unity. In this talk, we estimate the effects of nonflow correlations on $f_{\text{CME}}$ [3] by using a multiphase transport (AMPT) and heavy ion jet interaction generator (HIJING) together with available experimental data on nonflow. It is found that the nonflow correlations can introduce a small (even possibly negative) contribution to $f_{\text{CME}}$, insufficient to explain the positive measurements by STAR. We further investigate the effects of nonflow correlations on the background baseline of the isobar data, and discuss the implication of our results to the CME search in isobar collisions.

Poster Session 2 T02,poster,Dynamical evolution of magnetic fields in the pre-equilbrium quark-gluon plasmas,"Yan, Li",Fudan University,Unknown,"High-energy heavy-ion collisions generate an extremely strong magnetic field which plays a key role in a number of novel quantum phenomena in quark-gluon plasma (QGP), such as the chiral magnetic effect (CME). However, due to the complexity in theoretical modelings of the coupled electromagnetic fields and the QGP system, especially in the pre-equilibrium stages, the lifetime of the magnetic field in the QGP medium remains undetermined.

In this talk, we present a kinetic framework to study the dynamical decay of the magnetic field in the early stages of a weakly coupled QGP by solving the coupled Boltzmann and Maxwell equations. We find a universal separation of scales between the energy scale in the QGP medium and the strength of the magnetic field, irrespective of detailed interactions among quarks and gluons. The separation of scales allows for effective couplings between EM fields and the splittings among quarks and anti-quarks, which gives rise to the out-of-equilibrium induction effect. At late times, a magnetohydrodynamic description of the coupled system emerges. With respect to realistic collisions at RHIC and the LHC, we find that the residual strength of the magnetic field in the QGP satisfies a hierarchy relation: $m_q^2\ll |eB| \ll T^2$, when the system starts to evolve hydrodynamically. We also notice that the relative dominance from the electrical field and magnetic field can be reversed between RHIC and the LHC energies.

However, non-CMW mechanisms such as local charge conservation (LCC) intertwined with collective flow can also lead to a similar dependence of $v_2$ on $A_{\rm ch}$. The measurement with triangular flow ($v_3$) thus serves as a reference as it is not expected to be affected by the CMW. 

In this talk, we present new ALICE measurements of $v_2$ and $v_3$ of inclusive and identified hadrons as functions of $A_{\rm ch}$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV.

In addition, the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) technique is adopted for the first time to quantitatively distinguish the CMW signal and the LCC background.

Poster Session 1 T02,poster,Measurement of Direct Photon Cross Section and Double Helicity Asymmetry at $\sqrt{s}$ = 510 GeV in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ Collisions at PHENIX,"Ji, Zhongling",UCLA,USA,"The proton spin decomposition provides key information about the structure of the nucleons. Since the late 1980s, experiments showed that the quark spin contributes only $\sim$30\% to the proton spin, with the remaining part coming from the gluon spin as well as the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum. While the quark spin contribution was better constrained by polarized deep inelastic scattering, the gluon spin contribution remains less known. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is the only collider capable of producing two longitudinal polarized proton ($\vec{p}+\vec{p}$) beams. Direct photon, jet, and charged pion production in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$ collisions can probe the gluon spin at leading order. Compared with hadron production, direct photon production is the most ""clean"" channel, since there is little fragmentation involved. However, the relatively small direct photon cross section compared to the hadron production makes it a challenging observable. To achieve this ""golden channel"" measurement, we utilize the RHIC 2013 run, which provides the largest integrated luminosity (155 pb$^{-1}$) in $\vec{p}+\vec{p}$, along with the PHENIX Electromagnetic Calorimeter, which has fine granularity to separate the two $\pi^0$ decay photons up to $\pi^0$ transverse momentum $p_T$ of 12 GeV/c. A shower profile analysis extends the $\gamma/\pi^0$ discrimination to beyond 20 GeV/c. This poster will present the direct photon cross section and double helicity asymmetry for the direct photon $p_T$ of 6--30 GeV/c and 6--20 GeV/c, respectively. When included in future global analyses, our results will provide an independent constraint on the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhongling', 'last_name': 'Ji', 'fullName': 'Ji, Zhongling', 'id': '6540570', 'affiliation': 'UCLA', 'emailHash': '5aa8eff3264cab83055ccd6a554efa63', 'db_id': 6540570, 'person_id': 6329660}"
Poster Session 1 T02,poster,Understanding $\phi$ meson production through polarisation study in pp collisions  with ALICE at the LHC,"Khuntia, Arvind",IFJ PAN,Unknown,"The study of the production of $\phi$ meson has always been of great interest both in elementary and heavy-ion collisions. As observed by ALICE, strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity pp collisions is one of the potential manifestations of QGP formation. Recent results at LHC suggest that $\phi$ behaves like a particle with net strangeness between 1 and 2 in small systems. These observations unfold new directions for theoretical and experimental studies of $\phi$ meson production in small systems.  Polarization measurements of vector mesons are crucial for understanding the particle production mechanisms in high-energy collisions. In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the presence of a large initial angular momentum can polarise the vector mesons. This might be either due to spin-orbital-angular-momentum interaction or by hadronization from polarized quarks. The $\phi$ meson polarisation in pp collisions could be used as a reference while interpreting the results from heavy-ion collisions. The huge data sample collected during the Run 2 of the LHC measurements gives access to look for the multiplicity dependence of this measurement.  This poster will present the perspectives for new results on the multiplicity dependence of $\phi$ meson polarisation in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in the helicity reference frame.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arvind', 'last_name': 'Khuntia', 'fullName': 'Khuntia, Arvind', 'id': '6544834', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'c335c291a78ee7431900f0a84a17ffaf', 'db_id': 6544834, 'person_id': 6326542}"
Poster Session 1 T02,poster,Relativistic spin-magnetohydrodynamics,"Jaiswal, Amaresh",National Institute of Science Education and Research,Unknown,"Recent relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments have found evidence for the generation of strong magnetic field and global angular momentum. The numerical simulation of evolution of the QCD medium is based on either magnetohydrodynamics or spin-hydrodynamics for calculation of observables pertaining to magnetic field or global angular momentum, respectively. However, these two effects are not entirely separable due to the possible spin alignment of medium constituents in the presence of magnetic field, similar to the Einstein-de Haas effect. Therefore a unified framework of ‚Äúspin-magnetohydrodynamics‚Äù needs to be developed for precise calculation of experimental observables. Here we present the first formulation of this unified framework in relativistic context.

Starting from the classical description of spin, a kinetic theory of massive spin-1/2 particles in the presence of a magnetic field is obtained in the small polarization limit. We use a relaxation time approximation for the collision kernel in the relativistic Boltzmann equation and obtain the correction to phase-space distribution function. Building on the kinetic description, we then formulate a non-resistive, relativistic dissipative spin-magnetohydrodynamics for a fluid, whose constituent particles are considered to be spin-polarizable but non-magnetizable. We find multiple novel transport coefficients and show that all dissipative currents i.e. particle diffusion, shear stress tensor, bulk viscous pressure and non-equilibrium spin-tensor contain coupling between spin and magnetic field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Amaresh', 'last_name': 'Jaiswal', 'fullName': 'Jaiswal, Amaresh', 'id': '6522430', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science Education and Research', 'emailHash': 'ff4ba3d49ddc22d0ba979d7a82570c4a', 'db_id': 6522430, 'person_id': 6328733}"
Poster Session 1 T02,poster,"Study of non-flow baseline for the CME signal via two-particle ($\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\phi$) correlations in isobar collisions at STAR","Feng, Yicheng",Purdue University,USA,"Recently, STAR reported the isobar (${^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}+{^{96}_{44}\text{Ru}}$, ${^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}+{^{96}_{40}\text{Zr}}$) results for chiral magnetic effect (CME) search [1]. The Ru+Ru to Zr+Zr ratio of the CME-sensitive observable $\Delta\gamma$, normalized by elliptic anisotropy ($v_{2}$), is close to the inverse multiplicity ($N$) ratio. In other words, the ratio of the $N\Delta\gamma/v_{2}$ observable is close to the naive background baseline of unity. However, non-flow correlations are expected to cause the baseline to deviate from unity. To further understand the isobar results, we study non-flow effects using the same isobar data by two-particle correlations as functions of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle differences ($\Delta\eta$, $\Delta\phi$) of the pairs. We extract the charge-dependent correlations by the difference between the opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) charge pairs, properly normalized such that the correlations vanish at $|\Delta\eta|\rightarrow \infty$. These charge-dependent correlations come primarily from resonance decays, intra-jet (near-side) correlations, and Coulomb effects. We study the charge-independent correlations by examining the small and large $|\Delta\eta|$ behaviors of the SS correlations. The intra-jet (near-side) can be well isolated at small $|\Delta\eta|$ and $|\Delta\phi|$. We investigate the inter-jet (away-side) correlations by exploiting Pythia and HIJING simulations, together with the knowledge of near-side correlations obtained from the data. By comparing the two isobar systems, many systematic uncertainties can be minimized. By studying how non-flows differ between the two isobar systems, we can gain insights into the baseline of the CME.

However, certain key parameters need to have significantly different values for pp and central AA collisions for the model to well describe the yield and transverse momentum spectrum of the bulk matter.

In this work[1], we extensively study the system size dependence of nuclear collisions with a multiphase transport model. We scale two key initial condition parameters, the Lund string fragmentation parameter bL and the minijet transverse momentum cutoff p0, with local nuclear thickness functions from the two colliding nuclei. This allows the model to use the parameter values for pp collisions with the local nuclear scaling to describe the system size and centrality dependences of nuclear collisions self-consistently. In addition to providing good descriptions of pp collisions from 23.6 GeV to 13 TeV and reasonable descriptions of the centrality dependence of charged particle yields for Au+Au collisions from 7.7A to 200A GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies, the improved model can now for the first time well describe the centrality dependence of the mean transverse momentum of charged particles. It works similarly well for smaller systems including pPb, Cu+Cu and Xe+Xe collisions.

Within the generalized high-twist approach to multiple parton scattering, the dijet cross section of eA at the leading order in perturbative QCD and large Bjorken momentum fraction xB can be expressed as a convolution of the multiple parton scattering amplitudes, quark and gluon TMD parton distribution function (PDF). We find that the calculated total dijet correlation for these mini-jets, is sensitive to the transverse momentum broadening in the quark TMD PDF at large x and saturation in the gluon TMD PDF at small x inside the nucleus. The contribution to dijet cross section from double scattering are power- suppressed and only become sizable at small transverse momentum. The correlation from double scattering is also found to increase with the dijet rapidity gap and have a quadratic nuclear-size dependence because of the Landau-Pomeranchuk- Migdal (LPM) interference in gluon emission induced by multiple scattering. Experimental measurements of such unique features in the dijet correlation can shed light on the LPM interference in strong interaction and gluon saturation in large nuclei.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuan-Yuan', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Yuan-Yuan', 'id': '6522228', 'affiliation': 'CUHK-SZ', 'emailHash': '9cb533acc48e90b7ce2ce46e13621e8f', 'db_id': 6522228, 'person_id': 6336129}"

Trento-3D builds upon the well-established T${}_\mathrm{R}$ENTo model [1], which samples nuclear configuration with subnucleonic structure and determines nucleon participation at the instant of collision.  In Trento-3D, the total energy deposition is then divided among a central fireball near midrapidity and two fragmentation regions motivated by the limiting fragmentation hypothesis [2].  This extension, with a moderate number of parameters, allows for the faithful simulation of rapidity-dependent observables for a wide variety of collision systems over the gamut of ultrarelativistic energies.

In this presentation, we briefly describe the Trento-3D model and present first results of an ongoing, extensive calibration, demonstrating the capabilities of the model to describe various observables--such as yields, eccentricities, and derived quantities--as functions of rapidity.  We explore the use of a (1+1)D linearized hydrodynamics model and the Cooper-Frye particlization procedure for conversion from 3D initial conditions to final-state, rapidity-dependent observables at significantly reduced computational cost.  We validate these results vis-√†-vis the MUSIC (3+1)D hydrodynamic code and offer predictions on future results and capabilities.

In far-from-equilibrium QCD, the distribution functions of quarks and gluons have been found to have self-similar evolution in terms of a scaling function and scaling exponents [1,2,3]. In this work [4] we use the collision kernel for small-angle QCD scatterings [5,6] as our working example to investigate the connections between self-similar evolution and the dominance of an effective ground state from very early times in the kinetic theory. We find that the adiabatic evolution of the ground state adequately describes the dynamics of the full system for a wide range of initial conditions and naturally explains the emergence of scaling for small-angle scattering. Furthermore, we show that the evolution of the time-dependent scaling exponents follows a renormalization group equation as a function of time and discuss the novelties of its fixed points. As a demonstration of the relevance of these results, we compute the ‚Äúanomalous dimensions‚Äù of the scaling exponents and show that the correction to the BMSS fixed point matches the numerical EKT results of [3].

Poster Session 2 T01,poster,Progress towards full NLO accuracy and massive quarks in dipole picture fits to HERA data,"H√§nninen, Henri",University of Jyv√§skyl√§,Unknown,"Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory (EFT) at leading order describes well the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) inclusive cross section data at small-x as measured by the HERA experiments [1-3]. Recently the inclusive DIS impact factors have been calculated in Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) accuracy in CGC EFT [4-6], and the soft gluon divergence present at NLO has been factorized successfully [7].

In this talk we discuss our recent work [8] on the first comparisons of the NLO DIS cross sections to HERA data. Fitting the HERA reduced cross section data determines a parametrization for the non-perturbative initial condition to the BK evolution. Since the available NLO DIS inclusive cross sections are calculated in the massless quark limit, we construct and fit a dataset of light-quark-only cross sections using an independent parametrization of HERA total and heavy quark data. We find an excellent description of the HERA data. As the NLO BK is computationally challenging [9], we compare a number of beyond-LO prescriptions that approximate the full NLO BK, including the recent evolution parametrized in target momentum fraction [10]. These beyond-LO evolution equations include important higher order contributions by resumming corrections enhanced by large transverse logarithms. The determined initial condition is a necessary input for all NLO calculations in the GCC framework.

To assess the impact of the full NLO BK equation on the fits, we study how well the fit parametrizations describe HERA data when NLO BK evolution is used. We find that the NLO BK is approximated quite well by the enhanced BK equations.

The NLO DIS cross sections for massive quarks are becoming available, the longitudinal case already having been published [11], and the transverse case will soon follow. These massive quark results will have immeadiate improvement on the fit analysis as they enable us to take into account the substantial charm and bottom contributions present in the HERA data. This talk will also discuss recent progress on including massive quarks in the fit.

Poster Session 2 T01,poster,Towards a kinetic theory event generator for (heavy) ion collisions,"T√∂rnkvist, Robin",Lund University,Unknown,"Recently observed signs of collectivity in small systems has highlighted the need for a better understanding of equilibration in small and large collisions systems. In search of this, the QCD effective kinetic theory formulated by Arnold, Moore and Yaffe (AMY) [1] has emerged as a promising candidate. In order to bridge the gap between theory and experiments we develop a parton cascade that implements the AMY kinetic theory, i.e. solves the Boltzmann equation with the full AMY kernels (elastic scattering and splitting/merging processes) by explicitly simulating the evolution of a parton ensemble. It is constructed in a fully Lorentz invariant way by using a method pioneered in [2], which also underlies the parton cascade PCPC [3]. A complication arises from quantities like the screening mass, that enter the AMY kernels and are defined as integrals over the phase space densities. We develop a method for extracting these locally from the parton ensemble without the need for further information. We first study the thermal equilibrium and compare our results to other numerical solutions of the AMY theory. Given the complexity of the AMY kernels and the additional challenges of translating them into a Lorentz invariant parton cascade, this is a non-trivial step. The thermal equilibrium case will form the basis for a full event generator for collisions of light and heavy ions.

We discuss a new conceptual approach to understand the pre-equilibrium bulk evolution of a system in terms of a reduced set of slow modes. For concreteness we consider a kinetic theory describing a general expanding system with transverse flow and momentum space anisotropy. We find that these slow modes at early times give rise to far-from-equilibrium attractor behavior of moments of the distribution function. However, the slow modes are qualitatively distinct from hydrodynamic modes at early times, and only some of them evolve into hydrodynamic modes in the hydrodynamic limit. This framework suggests a general criterion for the presence of a simplified description even when gradients are large, if they are small compared to the energy gap between slow modes. This criterion can be satisfied in small systems, meaning that slow modes could be relevant for understanding flow-like correlations in small systems. We additionally find an attractor for the momentum space anisotropy that indicates the memory of initial anisotropy due to the presence of slow modes.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Li', 'last_name': 'Yan', 'fullName': 'Yan, Li', 'id': '6522193', 'affiliation': 'Fudan University', 'emailHash': '7b59d38bffd860a474361080f42771e7', 'db_id': 6522193, 'person_id': 6335792}"

Especially, the early-time hydrodynamic attractor allows for early-time initialization of hydrodynamic modelings, which strongly supports the applications of fluid dynamics to small colliding systems.

The hydrodynamic attractor has been well-established in conformal fluids, where initial fluctuations around the attractor evolution follow a power-law decay at early times. Nonetheless, in this talk, by solving 2nd order non-conformal fluid dynamics for out-of-equilibrium systems, we find that early-time attractor behavior is absent in non-conformal fluids. The absence of early-time attractor behavior can be proven to be generic in non-conformal fluids, as a consequence of the instability exhibited in the evolution of initial fluctuations, with a power-law growth. Although the mixing between the shear and the bulk modes can be tuned stable, to fully restore the early-time hydrodynamic attractor, and thus to be conceptually consistent with experimental observations, constraints on the second-order transport coefficient $\delta_{\Pi\Pi}$ can be deduced.

Their seeds, highly energetic partons that are created via hard scatterings during the collision, are affected by all different stages of the medium, including the pre-equilibrium precursor state of the quark-gluon plasma, which is known as the glasma. We will report on our numerical real-time lattice simulations of partons traversing the boost-invariant, nonperturbative glasma, which is generated at the early stages of heavy-ion collisions and calculate the effect for RHIC and LHC energies [1]. We observe that partons quickly accumulate transverse momentum up to the saturation momentum during the glasma stage. Moreover, we notice an anisotropy in transverse momentum broadening with larger broadening in the rapidity than the azimuthal direction. We compare our lattice simulations to a semi-analytic weak-field approximation [2], where we also find such an anisotropy and are able to link it to correlations among the color-electric and color-magnetic flux tubes in the initial state of the glasma.

Poster Session 2 T01,poster,Probing gluon saturation via hard inelastic diffraction at the Electron-Ion Collider,"Iancu, Edmond",Universit√© Paris-Saclay (FR),France,"We demonstrate that hard dijet production via inelastic diffraction is a promising channel for probing gluon saturation at the Electron-Ion Collider.  Diffraction refers to a process in which there is a large rapidity gap between the produced jets and the nuclear target, while inelastic means that the two hard jets - a quark-antiquark pair generated by the decay of the virtual photon - are accompanied by a softer gluon jet, emitted by the quark or the antiquark.The recoil due to this gluon emission is responsible for transverse momentum imbalance between the 2 hard jets. This diffractive process can be described as the elastic scattering between an effective gluon-gluon dipole and the nucleus. The dominant contribution comes from the black disk limit, where the scattering is as strong as possible. Hence the dijet imbalance  is of the order of the nuclear saturation momentum $Q_s$ evaluated at the rapidity gap. Measuring the imbalance of the dijet distribution for various rapidity gaps, one can study gluon saturation in the nuclear target. Integrating out the dijet imbalance, we obtain a collinear factorization where the initial condition for the DGLAP evolution is set by gluon saturation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Edmond', 'last_name': 'Iancu', 'fullName': 'Iancu, Edmond', 'id': '6522220', 'affiliation': 'Universit√© Paris-Saclay (FR)', 'emailHash': '9c0503437fddc7afed17f456c9771b5c', 'db_id': 6522220, 'person_id': 6338956}"

Poster Session 2 T01,poster,Probing the nuclear deformation effects in Au+Au and U+U collisions from STAR experiment,"Jia, Jiangyong",Stony Brook University (US),USA,"Nuclear deformation is an ubiqutous phenomenon for most atomic nuclei, reflecting collective motion induced by interaction between valance nucleons and shell structure. In most cases, the deformation has a quadrupole shape that is charactorized by overall strength $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$ (prolate $\gamma=0$, obolate $\gamma=\pi/3$ and triaxial otherwise). Collisions of deformed nuclei lead to large shape and size fluctuations in the initial state geometry, which after collective expansion, lead to enhanced fluctuation of elliptic flow $v_2$ and event-by-event mean transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$. Therefore, detailed study of the $v_2$, and $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ and correlations beween them can constrain the deformation parameters $(\beta_2,\gamma)$. A comparion of $(\beta_2,\gamma)$ with those measured from nuclear structure experiment could then be used to constrain the hydrodynamic responses of heavy-ion collisions. In this poster, we present results of $v_2$, $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ fluctuations and $v_2^2-[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ correlation for harmonics $n=2,3,4$ in modestly-deformed $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at 200 GeV and highly-deformed $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U collisions at 193 GeV. Significant differences for mean, variance $c_2$ and skewness $c_3$ of $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ fluctuations, are observed between the two systems as a function of centrality. The $v_2^2-[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ results remain positive over the full centrality in Au+Au collisions, while they change sign in 0-5\% central U+U collisions. The ratio of $v_2$ and $c_2$ between U+U and Au+Au in ultra-central collisions (UCC) are used to constrain the value of $\beta_2$, which leads to an estimate of $\beta_{2Au}\sim0.18$. On the other hand, the value of $\gamma$ can be constrained from the ratios of $v_2^2-[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ and $c_3$ between U+U and Au+Au. The enhancement of $c_3$ and the suppression of $v_2^2-[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ in UCC confirm that Uranum is prolate deformed with $\gamma\sim0$.

Poster Session 2 T04_2,poster,Resummation in the presence of energy loss: jet observables and substructure,"Tywoniuk, Konrad",University of Bergen (NO),Unknown,"Experimental data on a wide range of jet observables measured in heavy-ion collisions provide strong constraints on the underlying medium dynamics and are addressed by state-of-the-art Monte Carlo models. However, so far there has been little theoretical guidance on the systematics of medium modifications on such diverse quantities as the inclusive jet spectrum, the intra-jet fragmentation functions and (groomed) substructure observables. We put forward a versatile and systematically improvable resummation framework for calculating jet observables that accounts for radiative and elastic energy loss [1,2,3]. This relies only on the separation of jet scales and medium scales that lead to the factorization of hard, early vacuum emissions and soft, medium-induced branchings [1,4]. As three concrete examples, we discuss the a) inclusive jet spectrum for different radii [2], b) the distribution of microjets/hadrons inside large jets, and c) the jet mass in heavy-ion collisions. Tuning the medium parameters to the nuclear modification factor of inclusive jets simultaneously provides a baseline modification of the fragmentation function as well as the shift and distortion of the jet mass peak. This program grants, on one hand, a powerful framework to consistently study modifications of jets across a wide range of observables (with a grip on their resilience to non-perturbative effects) and, on the other hand, furnishes access to the value of the coupling between individual jet color charges with the underlying medium.

A charge correlation ratio observable $r_{c}$, generalized from the balance function [1] which distinguishes between same-sign and opposite-sign charged pairs,  is introduced. This observable $r_c$ is studied as a function of different kinematic variables in different colliding particle species using different Monte Carlo event generators. We demonstrate the feasibility of such measurements at the Electron Ion Collider in the context of hadronization studies [2]. This will provide new tests of hadronization models and hopefully lead to improved quantitative understanding of nonperturbative QCD dynamics. Also, with robust understanding of hadronization using $r_c$, we examine its medium modification which will shed light on the jet quenching mechanisms in hadronization and in-medium jet evolution.

We illustrate this explicitly in a simplified Monte Carlo study in which it is possible to identify the same jet before and after quenching. We find that selecting a sample of jets based on their quenched $p_T$ yields a sample of jets whose fractional energy loss is substantially smaller than would have been the case if it were possible to select a sample of jets based upon their $p_T$ before quenching. This has substantial impacts on jet structure and substructure observables, and dramatically reduces the observable consequences of medium response in a sample of jets selected based upon their quenched $p_T$, since the jets that are selected are those that lost little energy and hence created little medium response. We then show that the same qualitative effect can be seen in Z+jet events, and that selecting jets in such events based on either the jet $p_T$ or the boson $p_T$ provides an experimentally-accessible way to quantify the role of selection biases in jet observables. Selecting such jets based on the Z boson $p_T$ removes the bias towards jets that lost little energy, making the observable impact of medium response apparent.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Quinn', 'last_name': 'Brodsky', 'fullName': 'Brodsky, Quinn', 'id': '6522690', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '591c016c5992cead3d7133748f7ccd5e', 'db_id': 6522690, 'person_id': 6339532}"

So far, traditional underlying event mitigation algorithms introduced for heavy-ion often impose limitations in their applicability. The jet typically has to be clustered in the presence of the underlying event. Observables like the energy have to be corrected for the underlying event offset afterward. Furthermore, while machine learning methods can have improved performance for underlying event mitigation, no such approach has been proposed that can be trained without seeing jets from clean hard scatterings ‚Äî trained *in-situ* on experimental ion (e.g., PbPb) data only, independent of any Monte Carlo or detector modeling. Overcoming this constraint is particularly crucial for heavy-ion jet measurements, as any reliance on Monte Carlo inserts a theory uncertainty in modeling heavy-ion jets. For the first time, an algorithm is presented that removes all these limitations: (a) the algorithm preserves the complete event information, (b) it retains only positive transverse momentum particles without the need for negative or counterbalancing particles, (c) it uses machine learning to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, and (d) it can be trained *in-situ* using only ion data. Specifically, it overcomes the lack of ground truth clean events using self-supervised machine learning. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated using jet kinematics, substructure, and axes observables, and compared to existing underlying event mitigation methods.

So far, proton-nucleus (p+A) and deuteron-nucleus (d+A) collisions have been used to study the emergence of the smallest QGP droplets, producing the puzzling results that the non-zero elliptic flow of hadrons at intermediate transverse momenta is not correlated to the suppression of their spectra. An oxygen-oxygen (O+O) run at the LHC will provide a unique opportunity to investigate in detail the onset of jet quenching, differentiate between models of energy loss, and flesh out the differences between light parton and heavy quark dynamics over small length scales.  We present the first calculation of heavy meson suppression and elliptic flow at moderate and high $p_T$ in O+O reactions from medium-induced scaling violations in QCD and compare to the corresponding light hadron observables. The theoretical approach that we employ goes beyond traditional energy loss phenomenology and bridges the gap between high energy and nuclear physics.

Poster Session 2 T04_2,poster,Jets and leading hadrons at high virtuality,"Cao, Shanshan",Shandong University,Unknown,"Jet modification is a multi-stage (multi-scale) process: an initial high virtuality stage gives way to a lower virtuality transport stage for high energy partons, and a strongly coupled phase for lower energy parts of the shower. The transition from the high virtuality medium-modified DGLAP stage takes place when the virtuality reaches the medium induced scale ùëûÃÇ ùúè, where ùúè is the lifetime of a given parton. A recent outstanding dispute has arisen on the role of energy loss in the high virtuality phase, and its contribution to jet observables [1,2]. In this presentation, we demonstrate that in a realistic, dynamically evolving medium, the effect of the higher virtuality stage on leading hadron suppression is comparable or dominant to the lower virtuality stages. This is due to the fact that, for most jets, ùëûÃÇ  scales with entropy density, and thus falls faster than the virtuality of the leading partons. As a result, the combined lifetime of partons with virtuality larger than the medium induced scale is sufficiently long that these partons scatter with the plasma multiple times before reaching the medium scale.

To systematically address this, we derive the complete next-to-leading twist single gluon emission contribution. Going beyond previous work, we include higher-twist contributions from both the modulus of the amplitude and the phase in interference terms. We also include all momentum fraction (ùë¶) suppressed contributions from quark scattering prior to emission. This calculation [3] allows us to successfully address the issues raised in the work by Aurenche et al. [4,5]. Based on this formalism, a Monte-Carlo event generator (MATTER+LBT+hydrodynamics within the JETSCAPE v0 framework) is further developed for simulating parton showers through the QGP. We demonstrate that while the medium-modified DGLAP process dominates jet observables at high ùëùùëá, such as the leading hadrons, the subsequent near-on-shell transport process dominates at low ùëùùëá. Only by combining these two stages can we naturally obtain a simultaneously good description of the nuclear modification factors of hadrons and jets [6].

Poster Session 2 T04_2,poster,Unified picture of jet fragmentation from early to late times,"Takacs, Adam",University of Bergen,Unknown,"We revisit the picture of jets propagating in the quark-gluon plasma. In addition to vacuum radiation, related to the high initial virtuality of a jet, jet particles scatter on the medium constituents resulting in induced emissions. Analytical approaches to resumming these interactions have traditionally dealt separately with multiple, soft [1,2], or rare, hard scatterings [3,4]. A full resummation has so far only been available using numerical methods [5,6,7]. Our goal is to achieve full analytical control of the relevant scales and map out the dominant physical processes in the full phase space. To this aim, we extend existing resummation schemes for the medium-induced spectrum [4,8,9] to the Bethe-Heitler regime, to cover the whole phase space from early to late times, and from hard splittings to emission below the thermal scale. Based on the separation of scales, a space-time picture naturally emerges: at early times, jets start to build from both vacuum and rare, hard scattering induced emissions. At a later stage, determined by a resolution criterion, these emissions initiate a turbulent cascade [10] that rapidly degrades their energy down to, and including the Bethe-Heitler regime. We quantify the impact of such an improved picture, compared to the current state of the art factorization that includes only soft scatterings [11], by both analytical and numerical methods for the jet fragmentation function. Our work serves to improve our understanding of jet quenching from small to large systems and for future upgrades of Monte Carlo generators.

Analyses regarding jets may recover information about the medium and its partonic energy-loss mechanism. This work applies the Monte Carlo event generators JEWEL and PYTHIA for the simulation of observables comparable to current experimental research, focusing on the impact of a realistic description of the medium, provided by the state-of-the-art (2+1)D v-USPhydro code and $\rm T_RENTo$ initial conditions, in the azimuthal distribution and energy modification of jets.

We present the jet nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_{n=2,3,4}$ for multiple models, centralities and jet radii $R$. The $R_{AA}$ simulated presents good agreement with  experimental data for central collisions only. The evolution of the results in terms of centrality and $R$ indicates a possibility of better understanding of medium response in the JEWEL framework.

Measurements of inclusive jet suppression ($R_{AA}$) in heavy-ion collisions are presented for the first time as a function of the jet substructure using both nominal ($R=0.4$) and large-radius ($R=1.0$) jets in Pb+Pb and 
$pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. The jet substructure is characterized using the Soft-Drop grooming procedure in order to identify subjets corresponding to the hardest parton 
splitting in the jet. The dynamics of jet quenching is measured and presented as a function of the transverse momentum scale ($\sqrt{d_{12}}$) and the angle of the hardest splitting in the jet. 
Novel reconstruction methods are utilized to combine and optimize information from the tracker and calorimeter and build jet constituents for the first time in heavy-ion collisions. These new

In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets become more populated by soft partons through the induced radiation and scatterings in the medium. Consequently, the energies of some soft jet partons reach the typical energy of the medium constituents, and they thermalize in the medium. The thermalized component of the jet propagates hydrodynamically and emits hadrons correlated with the jet core. Those hadrons carry crucial information about the jet thermalization process and are measured as a part of clustered jets. 

In this talk, we systematically study the medium response by performing simulations with two distinctive prescriptions: propagation of recoils in partonic scatterings based on a weakly-coupled description and its combination with hydrodynamical medium response assuming the partial thermalization of jets [1]. Furthermore, by studying the angular structure of jets with different flow configurations of the medium, we demonstrate that the background medium flow and the analysis for the large-angle region $r>1$ are essential to extract the details of the in-medium jet thermalization.

Poster Session 2 T04_1,poster,Dynamically groomed jet radius in heavy-ion collisions,"Caucal, Paul",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Jet substructure is a powerful tool to probe the perturbative regime of jet evolution in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. Over the past few years, a wide variety of substructure observables have been proposed in order to understand specific aspects of jet dynamics in a quark-gluon plasma (QGP).

In this talk, based on [1], we will explore the ability of such an observable, called Dynamical Grooming [2], to pin down the properties of the QGP. In particular, we will present the computation via analytic resummation techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations, of the opening angle $\theta_g$ of the hardest splitting in the jet as defined by Dynamical Grooming. This calculation, grounded in perturbative QCD, accounts for the factorization in time between vacuum-like and medium-induced processes in the double logarithmic approximation.
Our main result is that the dominating scale in the $\theta_g$-distribution is the decoherence angle $\theta_c$ which characterizes the resolution power of the medium to propagating color probes, which makes this observable particularly interesting to measure $\theta_c$ experimentally. To that aim, we will highlight a suitable combination of the Dynamical Grooming condition and the jet radius that leads to a pQCD dominated observable with a very small sensitivity to medium response.

We formulate the problem using binary classification and focus on leveraging machine learning in ways that inform theoretical calculations of jet modification: (i) we quantify the information content in terms of Infrared Collinear (IRC)-safety and in terms of hard vs. soft emissions, (ii) we identify optimally discriminating observables that are analytically tractable, and (iii) we assess the information loss due to the heavy-ion underlying event and background subtraction algorithms. We illustrate our methodology using Monte Carlo event generators, where we find that important information about jet quenching is contained not only in hard splittings but also in soft emissions and IRC-unsafe physics inside the jet. This information appears to be significantly reduced by the presence of the underlying event. We discuss the implications of this for the prospect of using jet quenching to extract properties of the QGP. Since the training labels are exactly known, this methodology can be used directly on experimental data without reliance on modeling. We outline a proposal for how such an experimental analysis can be carried out, and how it can guide future measurements.

Such deflection will depend on the energy of the jet constitutes and the velocity of the flow. The soft particles suffering stronger deflection will drift towards the direction of the flowing medium, away from the center of the jet cone where the hard particles are located, leading to an angular intra-jet asymmetry of particle distribution coupled with flow inside the jet. In this work, we first calculate the angular distribution of particles with different pT inside the jet and compare it with the experimental data to obtain the average effect of the jet-flow coupling. We further explore the intra-jet asymmetry in longitudinal and transverse directions and study their dependence on jet path length and fluid viscosity. Together with gamma-jet asymmetry, we can use the transverse intra-jet asymmetry to identify the initial production position of the gamma-jet. We further compare the difference between dijet and gamma-jet to investigate the effect of the diffusion wake induced by the back-side jet. With the implementation of a mirror-subtraction method, we observe a clear rapidity ordering of particles with different pT, which shows a clear jet-flow coupling in the longitudinal direction.

Poster Session 2 T04_1,poster,Scaling properties of jets in high-energy proton-proton collisions,"Vertesi, Robert",Wigner Research Centre for Physics (Wigner RCP) (HU),Unknown,"Measurements of jet profiles in high-energy collisions are sensitive probes of QCD parton splitting and showering. Precise understanding of the jet structures are essential for setting the baseline not only for nuclear modification of jets in heavy-ion collisions, but also for possible semi-soft cold QCD effects such as multi-parton interactions (MPI) that may modify jets in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions. We analyzed the jet radial profiles in simulations, and defined a multiplicity-dependent characteristic jet size that is universal in a broad range of model classes regardless of parton distributions and the presence or absence of MPI and color-reconnection [1]. 
In this contribution we demonstrate that the radial jet profiles in proton-proton collisions exhibit scaling properties with charged-hadron event multiplicity in the full experimentally accessible transverse-momentum range. Based on this we propose that the scaling behavior stems from fundamental statistical properties of jet fragmentation [2]. We also study the multiplicity distributions of events with hard jets and show that the charged-hadron multiplicity distributions scale with jet momentum. This suggests that the Koba--Nielsen--Olesen (KNO) scaling holds within a jet. The in-jet scaling is fulfilled without MPI, but breaks down in case of its presence without color reconnection. Our findings imply that KNO scaling is violated by parton shower or MPI in higher-energy collisions [3]. Besides these results, newest findings on the flavor-dependence of scaling properties will also be presented.

of a quark gluon plasma (QGP), since the highly energetic jet particles interact with the medium particles, however do not thermalize.
Jet particles in the medium undergo both processes of scatterings off medium particles as well as emission processes induced by the medium.
Medium induced radiation processes are created over time scales long enough that simultaneously multiple scattering processes off medium particle can 
occur, which gives rise to interference effects. The resulting spectra were first described by Baier, Dokshitzer, Mueller, Peign√©, Schiff and 
independently Zakharov (BDMPS-Z). A resulting evolution equation for the fragmentation functions of gluons in jets was found by Blaizot, 
Dominguez, Iancu, and Mehtar-Tani (BDIM). We extend this approach to a system of evolution equations for the in-medium evolution of both kinds of 
jet partons, quarks and gluons, via coherent medium induced radiations as well as scatterings off medium particles[1]. 
The system of equations is solved numerically by a Monte-Carlo algorithm that also allows to obtain results for individual jets that propagate in the 
medium[2]. Thus, we are able to study the in-medium angular jet-broadening of quark and gluon jets, where we find that the latter are less collimated 
than the former.

As several jet quenching studies have shown, this medium response phenomenon plays a crucial role in our understanding of many jet structure and substructure observables. Nevertheless, a detailed account of the phenomenological consequences of those wakes is still lacking, partly because of the computational complexity of current techniques used to describe their properties. In this work we present a computationally efficient description of the event-by-event, jet-by-jet, determination of the properties of the hadrons coming from QGP wakes. By making use of a single set of universal solutions obtained within linearized hydrodynamics on top of a Bjorken flow, and performing the adequate set of scalings, translations, rotations and boosts, we are able to match the results obtained (with much greater computational cost) using 3+1D hydrodynamics. The transparency and simplicity of our approach allows us to identify the key variables affecting the shape of the measurable hadron distributions, such as the evolution time of the wakes between its formation and freeze-out and the local QGP flow velocity, both its magnitude and its direction relative to that of the wake, at the location on the freeze-out surface where the wake freezes out.

They then propagate through the evolving medium probing QCD matter at different energy scales and different phases of the fireball evolution. During this propagation heavy quarks and high-$p_T$ partons lose a substantial fraction of their initial energy. While machanisms of the energy losses are quite well understood in equilibrated QGP, the influence of pre-equilibrium phases on transport of hard probes has been only fragmentarily explored.

In the talk, I will demonstrate that the glasma can indeed play an important role  in transport of hard probes. I will discuss the transverse momentum broadening coefficient $\hat q$ and collisional energy loss $dE/dx$ of hard probes moving through the glasma. First, I will present the methodology that is used to compute the transport coefficients: the Fokker-Planck equation, whose collision terms determine $\hat q$ and $dE/dx$, and the proper time expansion that describes the temporal evolution of the glasma. The correlators of chromodynamic fields that determine the Fokker-Planck collision terms are computed to fifth order. The transport coefficients are shown to be strongly dependent on time and orientation of the probe's velocity. They are large, $\hat q$ is of the order of a few ${\rm GeV^2/fm}$ and $dE/dx \sim 1~{\rm GeV/fm}$, in the domain of validity of the proper time expansion and their values depend on the probe's velocity ${\bf v}$ and the parameters: coupling constant $g$, saturation momentum $Q_s$ (UV scale), and IR regulator $m$, fixed by the confinement scale. I will show how $\hat q$ depends on all these quantities. Different regularization procedures will be also analysed and shown to lead to similar results for $\hat q$.

For jet partons this leads to momentum broadening which is not isotropic in the parton's transverse plane. In this talk we discuss such anisotropic momentum broadening of jets in detail and evaluate how it changes the radiation of hard gluons, and gives rise to a net polarization of jets. We first present a microscopic calculation of momentum broadening of a jet parton. This calculation assumes an anisotropic distribution of quarks and gluons in the medium and is done in the hard thermal loops formalism with careful treatment of plasma instabilities [1]. A main result is increased magnetic screening at lower transverse momenta which reduces momentum broadening substantially [2]. In the second half of this talk, we calculate in detail the rate for a jet parton to radiate a gluon when undergoing anisotropic momentum broadening. Using the harmonic oscillator approximation, we show that the radiated gluon is polarized and that after successive branching this leads to net polarization of jets in heavy-ion collisions. We present a similar analysis for the polarization of photons. Finally, we discuss briefly how the anisotropy of the quark-gluon plasma could be measured directly from jet and photon polarization.

Poster Session 1 T04_2,poster,ÔªøQuark-flavour dependence of jet quenching in hot QCD matter,"Bluhm, Marcus","SUBATECH, Nantes",Unknown,"The jet transverse momentum diffusion coefficient $\hat{q}$ is an important transport coefficient governing the radiative energy loss of a parton propagating the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in Heavy-Ion Collisions. Based on perturbative arguments [1], which were recently extended to next-to-leading order [2], the dimensionless ratio $\hat{q}/T^3$ was shown to be connected with the dimensionless specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$. This connection requires two assumptions: (a) that the medium is describable in terms of quasiparticle excitations, and (b) that the mean-free path of the parton is related to the average transport cross section of a quasiparticle in the medium implying that the interaction with the medium constituents is of the same form and strength as the interaction among the quasiparticles themselves. 

Based on this idea, results of a microscopic calculation of $\hat{q}$ are presented by applying a quasiparticle model that was shown to provide a successful, effective description for the strongly coupled QGP [3]. This approach allows the determination of $\hat{q}$ in dependence of the identity of the traversing highly energetic parton and the composition of the hot strongly interacting matter. The behaviour of the jet quenching parameter as a function of temperature and parton momentum is discussed also in comparison with a recent Bayesian parameter estimation by the JETSCAPE Collaboration [4].

The QGP causes energy loss of high momentum particles which is observed as suppression of high momentum hadron production in A+A collisions relative to p+p collisions. The study presented in this poster uses PHENIX data to evaluate the energy loss of partons in the QGP in the various collision systems provided by RHIC. 
We measure the fractional momentum loss with two quantities, Sloss and S‚Äôloss. Sloss is obtained by comparing the inclusive $p_\textrm{T}$ spectra in the A+A and p+p collisions. In contrast, S‚Äôloss is obtained by comparing in-plane and out-of-plane spectra using the azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$. These quantities are extracted from PHENIX data in Au+Au, Cu+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV for $\pi^0$s, and the Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV for charged hadrons.

The formation and evolution of leading jets can be described by jet functions that satisfy non-linear DGLAP-type evolution equations. We present a parton shower algorithm that allows for the systematic calculation of leading-jet cross sections where logarithms of the jet radius and threshold logarithms are resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy. By calculating the mean of the leading jet distribution, we are able to quantify the average out-of-jet radiation, the so-called jet energy loss. When an additional reference scale is measured, we are able to determine the energy loss of leading jets at the cross section level which is identical to parton energy loss at leading-logarithmic accuracy. We present comparisons to the first direct measurements of vacuum and medium-induced energy loss at LEP and the LHC in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.

However, it is known that neither of these regimes corresponds to any currently available experimental set-up, and thus bridging the gap between these limits under a single framework is a crucial step towards a complete description of jet quenching. In this talk we discuss a novel strategy, dubbed the Improved Opacity Expansion (IOE), which provides a self consistent way of interpolating between the single hard and multiple soft regimes for dense media populated by a few hard scattering centers.

Poster Session 1 T04_2,poster,Constraints on jet quenching from a multi-stage energy-loss approach,"Majumder, Abhijit",Wayne State University,United States,"The evolution of leading partons and jets through deconfined QCD matter is a multi-scale phenomenon and remains as one of the challenging problems in heavy-ion physics. To address this, we use the JETSCAPE framework [1] in which the production of the hard parton is factorized from the evolution of the produced QGP. To incorporate various scales involved in the jet-medium interaction during the different epochs of the parton shower, a multi-stage energy loss model is constructed [2]. We propose a new functional form of the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ that weakens as the parton‚Äôs virtuality becomes larger and reduces to the traditional hard-thermal-loop (HTL) $\hat{q}$ at smaller virtuality [3]. In this talk, we demonstrate that a multi-stage jet quenching model with modified HTL $\hat{q}$ and recoil-hole based medium response are crucial for a simultaneous description of the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets and leading hadrons at RHIC and LHC collision energies.
 
The study carried out also highlights one of the major successes of the JETSCAPE framework [1,2] in providing a tool to set up an effective parton evolution using a multi-stage energy-loss scheme. In this approach, the space-time information of the QGP is embedded in the parton shower during the high virtuality phase modeled using the MATTER event generator, followed by the low virtuality phase modeled by the LBT event generator. The switching between the jet energy loss stages is carried out on parton-by-parton basis based on the off-shellness or energy of the parton. The jet-medium response is incorporated through a weakly-coupled transport description with recoil particles excited from the QCD medium. The recoil-hole formalism shows sensitivity to the distribution of energy-momentum of particles inside the jet and hence puts further constraints on the jet quenching mechanism. The study presented demonstrates that the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ indeed has a resolution scale dependence in addition to the conventional temperature and energy dependence encoded in hard-thermal-loop formula.

In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jet partons interact with the quark-gluon plasma medium while changing their energy and virtuality via their shower evolution. Measured jets are reconstructed from the final state particles in the shower and thus carry information about the interactions with the medium at the various scales of the jet partons. The multi-stage framework for the jet evolution of JETSCPE is designed to cover a broader range of the scale in the in-medium parton shower evolution by stitching multiple models together; Each model becomes active depending on the virtuality or energy of a parton.

Recently, we found that the explicit virtuality dependence in the jet quenching strength qhat [2] at the early high-virtuality phase is essential for the simultaneous description of the experimental data for the reconstructed jet suppression and single-particle suppression. In this study, we perform numerical simulations with a model incorporating the virtuality-dependent formulation with MATTER+LBT setup within the JETSCAPE framework. We systematically study the observables characterizing internal structures of jets to explore the details of the strength of the interaction with the medium at each scale. In particular, we examine the splitting function, which displays the effect of the medium interaction with a parton with large virtuality at the very early stage, and the jet fragmentation function, which clearly shows the medium effect on partons throughout a wide range of scales.

These observables are shown to be experimentally robust to the heavy ion underlying event. With multiple jet classes based on their shower topology in central Au+Au collisions, we compare and contrast their energy loss via jet quenching observables such as dijet momentum asymmetry and recoil jet yield.

However, this signal, if integrated over a large range of rapidity, can be overwhelmed by an enhancement of soft hadrons from multiple parton interaction (MPI) at the LHC energy, which is uniform in azimuthal angle. A recent 2D jet tomography can be applied to the event selection to enhance the path length of jet propagation and hence the signal of jet-induced diffusion wake. In this work, it is found that diffusion wake has a unique structure in the longitudinal direction and can be measured even without the assistance of 2D jet tomography at the LHC energy. We use an azimuthal cut to isolate hadrons affected by the diffusion wake and reduce contribution from the jet side. We find an unambiguous signal of diffusion wake.

In this model, occasional hard interactions and frequent softer interactions are systematically factorized. The larger number of soft interactions makes possible an effective stochastic description of the parton-plasma interactions in terms of a small number of transport coefficients [2]. These soft transport coefficients can capture non-perturbative effects, agnostic to the strongly- or weakly-coupled nature of the underlying deconfined plasma. 

We constrain the temperature dependence of these soft transport coefficients by performing a Bayesian model-to-data comparison with jet measurements from RHIC and LHC, allowing us to better understand the non-perturbative effects suffered by soft interactions in heavy ion collisions. We also study the dependence of the calibration results on the separation of the scale between soft and hard parton-plasma interactions in order to investigate the robustness of the approach. We discuss differences between this work's soft transport coefficients and the soft-hard ones extracted in other approaches, highlighting the strength of our factorized approach.

Jet anisotropy flow in this study is investigated within the Linear Boltzmann Transport model, in which the dynamical evolution of the QGP is simulated within the CLVisc hydrodynamic model with fully fluctuating event-by-event initial conditions. We quantify the colliding energy, centrality, jet transverse momentum dependence of jet anisotropy flow coefficients $v^\mathrm{jet}_2$ and $v^\mathrm{jet}_{3}$, with emphasis on their event-by-event correlations with the flow coefficients of the soft bulk hadrons. We find that the correlation between jet and bulk anisotropy is approximately linear and that the effect of the bulk $v_n$ fluctuation on the event-averaged jet $v^\mathrm{jet}_n$ is negligible.

The DQPM describes the non-perturbative QCD nature of the sQGP at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ based on a propagator representation in terms of massive off-shell partons (quarks and gluons) which properties (characterized by complex self-energies, i.e. masses and widths) are adjusted to reproduce the lQCD EoS for the QGP in thermodynamic equilibrium. We present the results for the jet transport coefficients such as $\hat q$, the transverse momentum transfer per unit length, the drag coefficient $A$ as well as the energy loss per unit length $\Delta E =dE/dx$, in the QGP  and investigate its dependence on QGP properties such as medium temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ as well as on the jet properties such as leading jet parton momentum, mass, flavor, and the strong coupling constant. In this first study only elastic scattering processes of leading jet parton with the sQGP partons are explored discarding  presently the radiative processes (such as gluon Bremsstrahlung) which are expected to be suppressed for the emission of massive gluons. We present a comparison of our results for the elastic energy loss in the sQGP medium with other theoretical approaches such as lattice QCD and the LO-HTL as well as with estimates of $\hat q$ by the JET and JETSCAPE collaborations based on a comparison of hydrodynamical calculations with the experimental heavy-ion data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ilia', 'last_name': 'Grishmanovskii', 'fullName': 'Grishmanovskii, Ilia', 'id': '6549865', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '7288705e5e26c4e4901193b2fe40e1ff', 'db_id': 6549865, 'person_id': 6333726}"

A relativistic mean field model is used to describe the nuclear matter at low densities while Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model is used to describe the quark matter at high densities. A Gibbs construct is used to describe the quark-hadron phase transition at large densities and at zero temperature.  Within the model, as the density is increased, a mixed phase appears at about $2.5$ times the nuclear matter saturation density $(\rho_0)$ and ends at about $5~\rho_0$ beyond which pure quark matter phase appear. It turns out that a stable hybrid star of maximum mass, $M=2.27 ~ M_{\odot}$ with radius $R=14$ km, can exist with a quark matter core in a mixed phase only. As the density decreases from the center to the surface, there is a sharp increase of the velocity of sound at the point where the quark-hadron phase transition occurs. This leads to the possibility of low frequency non-radial oscillations, the $g$ modes, in hybrid stars in contrast to canonical neutron stars which do not have such quark matter core. The higher $f$ modes frequencies of neutron stars get enhanced in the presence of quark matter core in hybrid stars. The magnitude of $g$ mode frequencies decrease with increase the repulsive interaction in quark matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deepak', 'last_name': 'Kumar', 'fullName': 'Kumar, Deepak', 'id': '6541076', 'affiliation': 'Physical Research Laboratory', 'emailHash': 'd9637a7e897942f44059d69288b2b909', 'db_id': 6541076, 'person_id': 6322639}"

Poster Session 3 T10,poster,The rigidity of matter at its limits: understanding the peak in the speed of sound,"Noronha, Jorge",University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,USA,"In the core of neutron stars, extreme gravitational fields probe the stiffness of matter at very large densities. Recent neutron-star observations indicate that ultradense matter must be stiffer than previously thought, with the speed of sound potentially rising well above its asymptotic conformal limit of $1/\sqrt{3}$ [1]. Nonetheless, the implications of this large speed-of-sound peak for the phenomenology of cold and dense QCD are far from being understood. In this work, we address the general physics requirements that must be fulfilled for the speed of sound of cold and dense QCD to have a peak surpassing the conformal limit, and propose a generic mechanism to explain this feature [2]. We build a model realization of this mechanism and explore its possible connection to the formation of diquarks, as well as the transition to quark or quarkyonic matter. Our results suggest that diquark interactions might play a pivotal role in the equation of state of highly compressed matter.

However, our knowledge about dense matter explored in the cores of neutron stars remains limited. Fortunately, dense matter is not only probed in astrophysical observations, but also in terrestrial heavy-ion collision experiments. In this work, we use Bayesian inference to combine data from astrophysical multimessenger observations of neutron stars and from heavy-ion collisions of gold nuclei at relativistic energies with microscopic nuclear theory calculations to improve our understanding of dense matter. We find that the inclusion of heavy-ion collision data indicates an increase in the pressure in dense matter relative to previous analyses, shifting neutron-star radii towards larger values, consistent with recent NICER observations. Our findings show that constraints from heavy-ion collision experiments show a remarkable consistency with multi-messenger observations and provide complementary information on nuclear matter at intermediate densities.

The high baryonic density and isospin asymmetry that characterize this system hinder first principle calculations of the EOS,  its particle composition and in-medium particle interactions. Therefore, at the moment there is no consensus on the presence of quark matter in neutron star cores, or on the nuclear pairing model to describe neutron triplet superfluidity and proton superconductivity in the system. However, using cooling data from transiently-accreting neutron stars, one has obtained the first unambiguous signature of the presence of fast neutrino-cooling processes in the core of a star for the MXB 1659-29 source. Neutrino emissivity is directly related to neutron star‚Äôs core composition; thus this data can set important constraints on the EOS. 

In this talk, we present the results of a study of a set of realistic relativistic mean field (RMF) EOS reproducing MXB 1659-29 luminosity and making predictions for its mass and nuclear pairing models. We also investigate whether quark matter can be present in this source and for which densities, for each EOS. Finally, we calculate the core heat capacities for all scenarios and check whether long-term measurements of temperature variation combined with inferred luminosity for a star can set them apart and potentially provide information on the star‚Äôs core composition.

We do this by solving a pair of first-order coupled differential equations equivalent to the original Sturm-Liouville problem to obtain the fundamental-mode frequencies characterizing stable stars.

In this case, the ground state is described by the BCS pairing between quarks with opposite chirality. Very recently, Li and Haldane argue that the Cooper pair inherits a non-trivial topological structure from the underlying single-particle Berry monopole for superconducting Wely semi-metal. In this work, we generalize Li-Haldane argument to the single flavor color super-conductor and uncover novel topological properties of this phase, which have been overlooked for decades. Depending on the color-spin structure, we find that either the gap function acquires topological nodal structure, as is the case for planar phase, or the gapless quasi-particle excitations carry non-zero Berry monopole. We present the evidence that the latter possibility, which Li-Haldane do not discuss, is energetically favored and is realized in the so-called color-spin locking phase, the ground state. We discuss the relevance of our findings to quark-hadron continuity, anomaly matching, and topological phase transition in Baryon-rich matter.

In this work we apply the hadronic transport approach SMASH to calculate flow coefficients that are known to be very sensitive to the EoS which enters the calculation through nuclear potentials. We present calculations for different equations of state and compare methods of taking the formation of light nuclei into account. At beam energies of $E_{\rm lab} = 1.23A\,\mathrm{GeV}$ a large fraction of nucleons is bound in clusters, therefore they are crucial to gain an understanding. Without momentum-dependent potentials the hard equation of state is preferred  in the comparison to HADES data on $v_1(p_T,y)$ and $v_2(p_T,y)$ and for low transverse momenta the dependence on the clustering method is found to be strong.

This is shown in [1,2,3], where the SP is used to interpret the novel multi-messenger neutron star observations in the context of hybrid stars with a deconfined quark matter core. The result is an estimate on the statistics of a measurement that could be considered as indisputable evidence for the hybrid nature of high mass stars, as well as a demonstration of a reversal in the common paradigm of hybrid star compactness. The study produced massive hybrid stars of decreasing compactness in agreement with the latest NICER measurement of pulsar PSR J0740+6620.

from mass and radius measurements of the high mass pulsar PSR J0740+6620 and bounds 
on the compactness from the tidal deformability measurement for the binary neutron star

As a solution to this dilemma, we present the dissociation of the sexaquark by a deconfinement

multi-messenger astronomy. 
The sexaquark mass parameter favored by the present analysis has recently been used

The detector contains two electromagnets - a large solenoid which generates a magnetic field for the barrel tracking detectors of strength 0.5 Tesla, and a dipole magnet for the Muon Arm Spectrometer which generates a magnetic field of strength 0.7 Tesla. During the calibration of the detector the magnetic field characteristics were measured by the scientific team. The measurement points were then fitted using Chebyshev polynomials to create a field model. This accurate model is applied extensively in the particle trajectory reconstruction. To store the particle data efficiently, only the first detected position of the particle, its type, and the momentum vector is preserved in storage. The particle trajectory, if needed, can be recreated by simulating its propagation in the detector's magnetic field. In the case of track visualisation software however a simpilfied, uniform 0.5 Tesla magnetic field has been used for this purpose so far. For this reason the visualised tracks are not an accurate representation of what was originally detected, especially in the case of particles that interact mostly with the magnetic field generated by the (completly omited in the simplified model) dipole magnet, such as muons.
In our previous publication we have studied how the accurate model could be implemented as a shader program for execution on a GPU, allowing its use in interactive magnetic field visualisations.

In addition to its electromagnetic calorimeter (EMCal), the sPHENIX calorimeter system includes two hadronic calorimeters (HCals) ‚Äì the inner HCal (iHCal) and outer HCal (oHCal).
The oHCal (iHCal) are composed of alternating layers of scintillating tiles and steel (aluminum) plates. As hadrons traverse the HCals, the plates cause them to shower and deposit energy in the tiles which is then directed to silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The signal from the SiPMs is then aggregated into towers. 
Jets will typically deposit energy in all calorimeters; however, this energy must be properly calibrated to get the truth energy, i.e., the energy void of detector effects. 
Since the response in the calorimeter varies from tower-to-tower, the calibration must include a tower-by-tower calibration as well as an overall calibration.
This poster will present the calibration plans for the HCals which includes a study comparing cosmic ray data collected by the assembled HCal sectors to the energy deposited by cosmic muons in the GEANT4 simulation of sPHENIX hadronic calorimeter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ejiro Naomi', 'last_name': 'Umaka', 'fullName': 'Umaka, Ejiro Naomi', 'id': '6540026', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State University (US)', 'emailHash': 'cd8a255ed9ce02ed4ba0f5a29a5f4377', 'db_id': 6540026, 'person_id': 6339660}"

It will focus on measuring jets as well as open and hidden heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions to study the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma. To achieve its physics program sPHENIX needs a robust and efficient calibration of its constituting detectors. In particular, the distortions of the electrons drift in the sPHENIX TPC (the main tracking device of the experiment) due to magnetic field and space charge effects, must be accurately measured and corrected. The TPC Outer Tracker (TPOT) is a new detector subsystem that will be installed on the outside of the TPC and will greatly facilitate measuring the electron drift distortions in the TPC, in addition to the other existing solutions in sPHENIX. In particular it will allow to make the maximum use of tracks to reconstruct beam-induced space charge distortions and monitor the electron drift velocity. The subsystem consists of 16 Micromegas detectors grouped two-by-two to provide an additional space point on the outside of the TPC in a limited fraction of its acceptance.

As a part of this upgrade, a new silicon pixel tracking detector named Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) with an excellent positional resolution is installed in the forward rapidity region. By combining this new detector with the existing ALICE forward muon detectors, the accuracy in determining a muon production point and a momentum vector, which have been a limitation so far, will be dramatically improved. In order to optimize this performance, it is necessary to correctly combine and match the tracks reconstructed by the new detectors with those reconstructed by the existing detectors. However, since thousands of charged particles are produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the number of possible combinations of tracks is enormous. Especially in the low (transverse) momentum region, it is challenging to combine the tracks correctly because of the effect of multiple scattering in the hadron absorber placed between the two detector sets. Since the physics occurring in the low transverse momentum region is one of the fundamental subjects of interest in the ALICE experiment, we need to improve the efficiency and purity in connecting the tracks in the low transverse momentum region.
 In this study, we will tackle this challenging task by using machine learning with simulations and we will present the solution for track matching even if there is large amount of material between trackers.
 We have confirmed that the performance of our method achieves a significantly better track matching (or performance) than methods without machine learning, which was initially proposed in the ALICE experiment and mimicked the Kalman filter.

Low's theorem relates the production cross section of a process with and without additional soft photon emission by a simple formula without dependence on the details of the process. However, this simple and fundamental prediction was found to strongly underestimate measured soft photon production in hadronic processes for previous experiments.

With this contribution we discuss the prospects of measuring and investigating this effect with the future ALICE 3 experiment using the proposed Forward Conversion Tracker (FCT). This detector can measure photons from collisions at LHC energies down to very low photon momenta. The resulting measured photons can then be related to the information about the hadronic event measured with ALICE 3.

This applies especially to event mixing, which is a crucial component of correlation frameworks. Mixing is a technique of selecting distinct collisions grouped by, e.g., multiplicity and z-vertex and iterating over the tracks (V0s, cascades, ‚Ä¶) belonging to these collisions. The resulting tuples of tracks are then used for calculating multiparticle correlations.

Previously, mixing was done in buffers, which directly represented bins of the properties under consideration. However, this approach is slow and requires additional linear memory, unattainable with typical data sizes expected for Run 3. Therefore, a new algorithm was developed with a lazy generation of combinations of data elements. It needs only a small constant memory for storing one combination at a time. The implementation is as generic as possible. It allows for tuples of any size, from any analysis table, and for any number of grouping properties. Moreover, many calculations are performed already during compile time thanks to C++17/20 meta-programming. The mixing algorithm can also be applied beyond particle physics, e.g., to generate pairs of sport competitors from different countries belonging to the same international federation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maja', 'last_name': 'Kabus', 'fullName': 'Kabus, Maja', 'id': '6544870', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': '82b8931c12df7b11bdafb304c4c32209', 'db_id': 6544870, 'person_id': 6337366}"

We study this production employing the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular-Dynamics (PHQMD) approach [1], a microscopic n-body transport model based on the QMD propagation of the baryonic degrees of freedom with density dependent 2-body potential interactions. All other ingredients of PHQMD, including the collision integral and the treatment of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase, are adopted from the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) approach. In PHQMD the cluster formation occurs dynamically, caused by the interactions. The clusters are recognized by the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. 
We present the PHQMD results for cluster and hypernuclei formation  in comparison with the available experimental data at AGS, SPS, RHIC-BES and RHIC fixed target energies. We also provide predictions on cluster production for the upcoming FAIR and NICA experiments.PHQMD allows to study the time evolution of formed clusters and the origin of their production, which helps to understand how such weakly bound objects are formed and survive in the rather dense and hot environment created in heavy-ion collisions.

We present the elementary photon-photon cross section as a function of diphoton mass $M_{\gamma \gamma}$ arising from lepton and quark loop diagrams, and the visible cross section obtained with the gamma-gamma decay branching fractions of the resonances $\eta$, $\eta'(958)$, $\eta_C(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}(1P)$.

We consider the dominating background of the two-photon final
state which arises from gamma decays of photoproduced $\pi^0$-pairs. Such $\pi^0$-pairs contribute to the background when only two of the four decay photons are within the experimental acceptance, while the other two photons escape undetected.

The photon-photon fusion leads to the lepton creation in the broad configuration space around ''collision'' point. Those created close to heavy nuclei may undergo strong interaction with them.
The impact parameter space distributions of electrons and positrons are calculated within the b-space EPA model and Wigner-function approach. The evolution due to the electromagnetic final state interaction (FSI) of $(e^+,e^-)$ with nuclei is studied, and the distortion of rapidity and transverse momentum distributions are shown. Part of the analysis is independent of the production model (initial condition).

We show first exploratory results for the reaction Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 17.3~GeV (SPS) and 200~GeV (RHIC) energies. We provide results for selected creation points and when integrating over their position as dictated by the $b$-space EPA model.

In this presentation, we will focus on prospects for measurements of the light-by-light scattering at low invariant masses below $M_{\rm inv}<5$ GeV/$c^2$ and $\tau$ pair production in UPCs sensitive to the $\tau$ anomalous magnetic moment. Both processes are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model, in particular, light-by-light scattering measurements can be used to set new upper limits in axion-like particles searches. Perspectives of vector meson photoproduction measurements which allow for gluon distribution function constraints will be also presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adam', 'last_name': 'Matyja', 'fullName': 'Matyja, Adam', 'id': '6544830', 'affiliation': 'Polish Academy of Sciences (PL)', 'emailHash': '8da7e3943b89d4fc8b0c37e45dba38f8', 'db_id': 6544830, 'person_id': 6330620}"

The excess can be explained by photon-photon interactions induced by the extremely strong electromagnetic field produced by the fast-moving heavy ions. These photon-photon interactions could provide a novel probe to the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) since the very-low-$p_{T}$ dileptons are produced at the early stage of the collisions. Furthermore, the linearly polarized photons will lead to angular modulations of produced dileptons, which is related to vacuum birefringence. Theoretical calculations predict that the angular modulation of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs is different from $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs due to the different masses. Therefore, measurements of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ pairs provide new insight to these phenomena in heavy-ion collisions.
In 2014 and 2016, the STAR experiment recorded large samples of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV.

Poster Session 1 T06 / T07,poster,Effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations in ultra-central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC,"Kuroki, Kenshi",Sophia University,Unknown,"In ultra-central heavy-ion collisions, the effects of event-by-event fluctuations on anisotropic flow are relatively more pronounced due to less geometrical anisotropy of initial transverse profiles. The magnitudes of elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ were reported to be almost the same value in ultra-central collisions [1]. Dynamical models based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamics describe anisotropic flow in non-central collisions well, however, failed to reproduce these $v_2$ and $v_3$ data in ultra-central collisions simultaneously [2,3]. Since the hydrodynamic description is supposed to be better in larger systems, the failure of the viscous hydrodynamic models in ultra-central collisions implies the existence of overlooked phenomena. This problem is known as ""ultra-central puzzle"" and has not been resolved yet.

In this talk, we investigate the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on anisotropic flow in ultra-central collisions. We employ an integrated dynamical model [4] with relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics [5,6] to describe the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energy and compare the results among ideal, viscous, and fluctuating hydrodynamics. In this framework, hydrodynamic fluctuations are introduced through the fluctuation-dissipation relation [5]. Since the anisotropic flow is driven mainly by fluctuations in ultra-central collisions, hydrodynamic fluctuations are expected to play an important role in understanding anisotropic flow.

First, we employ smooth and azimuthally symmetric initial conditions at impact parameter $b=0$ fm from the optical Glauber model to investigate the effects of genuine hydrodynamic fluctuations on anisotropic flow coefficients. We show that $v_2$ and $v_3$ caused by hydrodynamic fluctuations alone are almost the same value which is, however, almost half of the experimental flow coefficients. Second, we introduce a weight function of impact parameters to simulate ultra-central collisions efficiently and compare the results from Monte-Carlo Glauber initial conditions with hydrodynamic fluctuations to experimental data. Even with hydrodynamic fluctuations, we cannot reproduce $v_2$ and $v_3$ quantitatively at the same time. Nevertheless, we find the $v_2/v_3$ ratio becomes closer to the experimental data due to hydrodynamic fluctuations.

We construct a novel equation of state (EoS) describing QCD matter at finite temperature $T$ and baryon $B$, electric $Q$ and strangeness $S$ chemical potentials by utilizing the alternate expansion scheme from recent lattice QCD results [1]. This procedure allows to reliably estimate the baryon and strangeness densities at larger values of the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ compared to the usual Taylor expansion in terms of susceptibilities. We use the latter only to incorporate the $\mu_Q$ and $\mu_S$ dependence into thermodynamic quantities, which is sufficient for studying the matter as produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Our simple parametrization provides reliable results for all temperatures since it interpolates between the confined phase at low $T$ described by the Hadron-Resonance Gas (HRG) model, lattice QCD results around and above the transition temperature $T_c(\mu_B)$, and $\mathcal{O}(g^5)$ perturbative QCD results in the high-$T$ regime.

Poster Session 2 T14_2,poster,Directed flow of $\Lambda$ from heavy-ion collisions and hyperon puzzle of neutron stars,"Ohnishi, Akira",Kyoto University,Unknown,"The hyperon puzzle is one of the biggest problems in neutron star physics. Using two-body interactions based on hypernuclear data, $\Lambda$ appears in neutron star matter at $(2-4)\rho_0$. This would soften the equation of state and make it difficult to explain the existence of $2 M_\odot$ neutron stars. Therefore, $\Lambda$ should feel a strong repulsive potential in dense nuclear matter. Phenomenologically, it is possible to introduce repulsion at high density by introducing $\Lambda NN$ 3-body repulsion. It is also known that repulsion appears at high density in model calculations based on chiral EFT [1], but there is no experimental data to support this repulsion.

Now, let us focus on the directed flow of $\Lambda$, which is considered to be sensitive to the potential at high densities. It was shown that the proton directed flow in the beam energy of $2\, \mathrm{GeV} < \sqrt{s_{NN}} < 20\, \mathrm{GeV}$ can be explained by the hadron transport model [2]. The repulsive EOS contributes positively to the slope in the early stage (compression stage), while the tilted ellipsoid contributes negatively in the late stage (expansion stage). Sum of these contributions causes the $dv_1/dy$ sign change at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\simeq 10\, \mathrm{GeV}$ [3]. This mechanism predicts that the $\Lambda$ directed flow slope becomes negative at lower beam energies since $\Lambda$ does not exist before the collision, but the data [4] show the balance energy of $\Lambda$ is similar to that of proton. Then the positive contribution needs to be larger and the repulsion should be stronger for $\Lambda$.

In this work, we study the directed flow of $\Lambda$ by using the transport model (JAM2-RQMDv) [2] and estimate the potential of $\Lambda$ at high densities. We use the Fermi momentum expansion of the potential given in [5], and constrain the slope ($L_\Lambda$) and the curvature ($K_\Lambda$) parameters of the $\Lambda$ potential.

This poster presents the current progress of an analysis on $v_3$ for $\pi$, $K$, $p$, $d$, and $t$ at the fixed target energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$ GeV and $7.2$ GeV from phase-II of the Beam Energy Scan at STAR. The results include a correlation between $v_3$ and the first-order event plane and a clear rapidity-odd $v_3$ for $p$. This is the first in a series of collision energies at STAR below and above the QGP phase transition where triangular flow for identified particles will be studied.

In the former case, general arguments applied to a phase-space distribution obeying the Boltzmann equation in the limit of few rescatterings lead to a power-law increase of $v_n$ as a function of time. We confirm this behavior in numerical transport calculations with a fixed initial profile, and further study how the exponent of the power law changes when the average number of rescatterings per particle increases, yielding a different result in the hydrodynamic limit.

By using IP-Glasma initial conditions with varied parameters, we produce a result with a consistent and realistic microscopic physics model for the early stages of heavy ion collisions, allowing us to rigorously address the significant uncertainty from initial conditions. We further introduce a systematically-improvable method for exploring the parameter space of the model for the first time in a nuclear physics study, allowing for a more efficient training of the surrogate model emulator. We obtain improved constraints on the temperature dependence of the QGP viscosities by studying simultaneous use of multiparticle correlation observables, which couple initial state geometry and hydrodynamic evolution.

Poster Session 2 T14_2,poster,Left-right splitting of elliptic flow due to directed flow in heavy ion collisions,"Lin, Zi-Wei",East Carolina University,Unknown,"Recently the splitting of elliptic flow $v_2$ at finite rapidities has
been proposed to be the result of global vorticity in non-central
relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. Here we confirm the existence
of the $v_2$ splitting. However, we show that this left-right $v_2$ 
splitting (on opposite sides of the impact parameter axis) is mostly
due to the non-zero directed flow $v_1$ at finite rapidities, with the
splitting given by $v_2(p_x>0)-v_2(p_x<0)\sim 8v_1/3\pi$
[2]. It is thus expected to depend sensitively on the transverse
momentum, rapidity range, particle species, and colliding energy. We
then use a multi-phase transport model, which automatically includes
the vorticity field and flow fluctuations, to demonstrate these features.

We also find that the $v_2$ splitting contains a contribution from a
new type of triangular flow, which at finite rapidities correlates to
the reaction plane. In addition, the $v_2$ splitting measurement 
does not necessarily need to measure the 1st-order event plane
$\Psi_1$; it only needs to know whether the 2nd-order event plane angle
$\Psi_2$ or $\pi+\Psi_2$ corresponds to the $p_x>0$ side. So the
left-right $v_2$ splitting contains similar but somewhat different
information compared to the conventional separate $v_1$ and $v_2$
measurements; and it could be easier to do. Therefore, this observable
should benefit the studies of the three-dimensional geometry and
evolution of the dense matter created in heavy ion collisions.

Due to their short lifetime, resonances experience the competing effects of regeneration and rescattering of the decay products in the hadronic medium. Studying how the experimentally measured yields are affected by these effects can extend the current understanding of the properties of the hadronic phase and the mechanism that determines the shape of particle transverse momentum spectra.

New preliminary results are presented on the production of the $\Lambda$(1520) resonance measured in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{NN}$ =  5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC.

Poster Session 2 T14_2,poster,Scaling approach to nuclear structure in high-energy heavy-ion collisions,"Zhang, Chunjian",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics,Unknown,"In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the energy density profile of the produced quark-gluon plasma and its space-time dynamics are sensitive to the shape and radial profiles of the nuclei, described by the collective nuclear structure parameters including quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$, octupole deformation $\beta_3$, radius $R_0$ and surface diffuseness $a$ [1-3]. Using a transport model simulation as a proxy for hydrodynamics, we find a general scaling relation between these parameters and a large class of experimental observables such as elliptic flow $v_2$, triangular flow $v_3$ and particle multiplicity distribution $p(N_\mathrm{ch})$ In particular, we show that the ratio of these observables between two isobar collision systems depends only on the differences of these parameters. Using this scaling relation, we show how the nuclear structure parameters of $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr conspire to produce the non-monotonic centrality dependence of ratios of $v_2$, $v_3$ and $p(N_\mathrm{ch})$ between $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions, in agreement with measurements by the STAR Collaboration. We investigate how these scaling relations depend on the transport properties such as $\eta/s$ and found they are insensitive to these final-state effects. Furthermore, we extend this study to include the systems with similar mass number, and rather robust corrections to these scaling relations are found. This scaling approach towards heavy-ion observables demonstrates that isobar collisions is a precision tool to probe the shape and radial structures, including the neutron skin, of the atomic nuclei across energy scales.

Correlators that are sensitive to both initial-state effects and final-state viscous attenuation can give invaluable constraints for temperature ($T$) and chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$) dependence of $\eta/s$. The $\rho(v^{n}_{2},\langle p_{T} \rangle)$ correlator, that gives the strength of the correlation between an event‚Äôs mean-transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ and its $v_2$ magnitude, shows more sensitivity to the initial state than to final stat effects [1--2].

The efficiency of conversion from initial spatial anisotropy ($\epsilon_n$) to final momentum anisotropy ($v_n$) is quantified by the linear correlation between $\epsilon_n$ and $v_n$.  We have studied the transverse momentum, collision centrality and beam energy dependence of the correlation for charged particles using a hydrodynamical model framework [1]. The $p_T$ dependent correlation shows a strong dependence on the mass and $p_T$ of the emitted particles.

Poster Session 2 T14_1,poster,Longitudinal flow decorrelation by hydrodynamic fluctuations and event-shape engineering in Xe+Xe collisions,"Murase, Koichi",Kyoto University,Unknown,"In this talk, we analyze the factorization ratio $r_n(\eta_p^a,\eta_p^b)$ in Xe+Xe and Pb+Pb collisions [1] using event-shape engineering within the integrated dynamical model [2,3] constructed of the Monte-Carlo Glauber model for the initialization, `rfh` for 3+1D relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with hydrodynamic fluctuations [2], and `JAM` for hadronic cascades [4]. We also address recent topics of the fluctuating hydrodynamic about the correction of the fluctuation-dissipation relation [5] and the renormalization of the equation of state.

To precisely determine the properties of the matter created in heavy-ion collisions---such as the viscosity and diffusion coefficients, and the finite-$\mu_B$ equation of state---, it is important to constrain the model uncertainties that affect the collective dynamics such as the initialization models and the hydrodynamic fluctuations. The comprehensive description of collective flows and their correlations, including the factorization ratios, mixed correlations, and symmetric and asymmetric cumulants, is the key to constraining the model parameters.

We here focus on the longitudinal factorization ratio $r_n(\eta_p^a,\eta_p^b)$ [6] which is a useful tool to understand and constrain the longitudinal fluctuations generated by initialization models and hydrodynamic fluctuations.  We have shown that both the hydrodynamic fluctuations and the initial longitudinal fluctuations are needed to explain the centrality dependence of $r_2(\eta_p^a, \eta_p^b)$ in our previous study [7]. To discern the effect of the hydrodynamic fluctuations more clearly from that of the other fluctuations, it is a great opportunity to investigate the longitudinal decorrelation observed in the Xe+Xe collisions [1], where the deformation of the colliding nuclei plays a non-trivial role. We first analyze the eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ and initial decorrelations $r_n^\varepsilon(\eta_s^a,\eta_s^b)$ calculated from initial entropy densities for Xe+Xe collisions with/without deformation and for Pb+Pb collisions. We find the effect of the deformation on the decorrelations $r_n^\varepsilon$ in the central collisions and further analyze them by classifying the events by $\varepsilon_n$. We then perform the event-by-event simulations with and without hydrodynamic fluctuations and calculate $r_n(\eta_p^a,\eta_p^b)$. We discuss the effects of the hydrodynamic fluctuations by classifying the events by the magnitude of flow vectors $q_n$.

Poster Session 2 T14_1,poster,Hydrodynamic description of heavy ion collisions using the EKRT model with dynamical decoupling,"Hirvonen, Henry",University of Jyv√§skyl√§,Unknown,"In the EKRT model for ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, we compute the initial fluctuating QCD-matter energy densities from NLO pQCD and saturation, and describe the subsequent space-time evolution of the system with dissipative fluid dynamics, event by event [1,2,3]. This model agrees remarkably well with the low-$p_T$ flow observables measured in Pb+Pb and Xe+Xe collisions at the LHC, and Au+Au collisions at RHIC, in the centrality range 0-50 %. To extend this validity range further, and to perform a simultaneous comparison of the centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, $p_T$ spectra and various flow correlators against the latest LHC and RHIC data, we have now improved the fluid-dynamics part of the model significantly [4]. An essential new feature is the dynamical freeze-out that accounts both for a local Knudsen-number based criterion, and for a global criterion set by the overall size of the system. Importantly, our model is based purely on hydrodynamics also in the hadronic phase, so that a continuous parametrization of the temperature dependence of transport coefficients is possible. Adding a non-zero bulk viscosity and taking the chemical freeze-out at $T = 155$ MeV, we obtain a good simultaneous description of the average $p_T$ and the proton multiplicity, and at the same time we show that the setup clearly improves the agreement with the $v_n\{2\}$ LHC measurements in peripheral collisions while maintaining the earlier good agreement with other flow correlations. We also show that bulk viscosity together with the dynamical freeze-out clearly improves the quantitative description of the recently measured $p_T, v_n$ correlations.

The space-time evolution of the electromagnetic field in electrically conducting nuclear matter is completely different from that of vacuum; the lifetime of it becomes much longer than that in the vacuum.  Also, the electrical conductivity of the QCD matter plays an important role for space and time dependencies of an electromagnetic field [1]. 

Several studies of the non-resistive QCD matter have been performed in a relativistic ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework [2]. Usually, initial electric fields produced by collision spectators are neglected because they grow $-\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$ instantaneously due to the infinite electrical conductivity. 
However, for realistic analyses of the consequences of the existence of an electromagnetic field in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, electrical conductivity is important. In particular, in anisotropic collision systems such as Cu + Au collisions($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~[\rm{GeV}]$), the effect of electrical conductivity can be clearly found [3]. A numerical framework with the electrical conductivity of QCD matter is indispensable, for the investigation of the effect of electromagnetic fields on the final hadron distributions and flows in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. 

We present a first study of the effect of the electromagnetic fields on physical observables, utilizing a newly developed relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamics (R2MHD) simulation code. We check our code, using several test problems; 1D shock tube test and 2D Resistive Rotor test. In addition, our numerical results of magnetized Bjorken flow and Rotor test in Milne coordinates with high electrical conductivity are consistent with the ideal relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics [4]. 
We show numerical results of Au +Au ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~[\rm{GeV}]$) and Cu + Au ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~[\rm{GeV}]$) at RHIC. We focus on the rapidity odd profile of directed flow $v_1$, charge-dependent splitting of elliptic flow $v_2$ and so on.

However, rapidity distributions came out narrower than measured experimentally, which suggests a deviation from the spherical symmetry.

To investigate the phase diagram of QCD matter, the Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider (RHIC) started the first phase of the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) program in 2010. Under the BES-I program, Au+Au collision data were taken at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 62.4 GeV in collider mode. In 2017, a high statistics dataset from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 54.4 GeV was recorded by the STAR experiment to fill the energy gap between 39 and 62.4 GeV. The success of the BES-I program justified the second phase of Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) with higher statistics and detector upgrades. The first collider energy from BES-II was 27 GeV, which was recorded in 2018. The spectra of identified hadrons are essential to study bulk properties, such as integrated yield (dN/dy), average transverse momenta ($\langle p_{T} \rangle$), particle ratios, and freeze-out parameters of the medium produced. The difference in mean transverse mass ($\langle m_{T} \rangle$) and rest mass ($m_{0}$), i.e., $\langle m_{T} \rangle$ - $m_{0}$, as a function of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ can shed light on the formation of a mixed phase of a QGP and hadrons during the evolution of the heavy-ion system.


In this talk, we will present the spectra of identified hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p and $\bar{p}$) at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27 and 54.4 GeV. The midrapidity yields of identified hadrons show the expected signatures of large baryon stopping region at lower energies and the dominance of the pair production mechanism at higher energies. The constant value of $\langle m_{T} \rangle$ - $m_{0}$ around RHIC BES energies could be interpreted as the formation of a mixed phase. The centrality dependence of dN/dy, $\langle p_{T} \rangle$, particle ratios, chemical freeze-out, and kinetic freeze-out parameters will also be presented, and their physics implications will be discussed. The rapidity dependence of the identified hadron spectra will also be presented from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 27 GeV to understand the rapidity dependence of freeze-out properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew', 'last_name': 'Harasty', 'fullName': 'Harasty, Matthew', 'id': '6698278', 'affiliation': 'University of California, Davis', 'emailHash': '732f438454053ad18f421cf130767efc', 'db_id': 6698278, 'person_id': 6621990}"
Poster Session 2 T14_1,poster,A Systematic Study of In-Medium Hadronization of Jet Showers with JETSCAPE and Hybrid Hadronization,"Sengupta, Arjun",Texas A & M University,USA,"‚ÄúHybrid Hadronization‚Äù is a Monte Carlo package that hadronizes systems of partons. It smoothly combines quark recombination, applicable when distances between partons in phase space are small, and string fragmentation appropriate for dilute parton systems, following the picture outlined by Han et al. [PRC 93, 045207 (2016)]. Hybrid Hadronization can be applied to a variety of systems from $e^++e^-$ to A+A collisions. It takes systems of partons and their color flow information, for example from a Monte Carlo parton shower generator, as input. In addition, if for A+A collisions a thermal background medium is provided, the package allows to sample thermal partons that contribute to hadronization. Hybrid Hadronization is available for use as a standalone code and is part of JETSCAPE since the 2.0 release. In this presentation we review the physics concepts underlying Hybrid Hadronization. We then quantify the effects that an ambient medium has on the hadronization process of jet showers. We focus in particular on the dependence of medium effects on the flow and size of the medium. Jet showers are simulated in JETSCAPE either in vacuum or in an ambient medium. We systematically vary parameters like jet energy, jet flavor, medium size, medium flow velocity, medium flow direction, and orientation of the hadronization hypersurface. Among other observables we compute hadron fragmentation functions, ratios of identified hadrons, properties of clustered jets, and jet shapes. We see clear signatures of the medium interacting with jets during hadronization. Our results clarify the effect we expect from in-medium hadronization of jets on observables like fragmentation functions, hadron chemistry, jet shape, or acoplanarity. They could be useful to further constrain our understanding of the interaction of jet showers in the parton phase extracted from experimental data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arjun', 'last_name': 'Sengupta', 'fullName': 'Sengupta, Arjun', 'id': '6539101', 'affiliation': 'Texas A & M University', 'emailHash': '1279fc862653fd6dbecdbcc50197eb70', 'db_id': 6539101, 'person_id': 6471297}"

[1], we present an improved three-dimensional dynamical initialization model for heavy-ion collisions, implementing local energy-momentum conservation and baryon charge fluctuations at string junctions [2]. These improvements lead to an excellent description of the charged hadron and net proton rapidity distributions in Au+Au collisions from 7.7 to 200 GeV [3]. Based on these results, we quantify the amount of baryon stopping at the initial impact and baryon transport during the hydrodynamic evolution and hadronic scattering phases. The effects of strangeness neutrality and the finite overlap time at low collision energies on hadronic flow observables are quantified. We further expand the model description to asymmetric p+Al and (p, d, 3He, Cu)+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy and p+Pb and PbPb collisions at LHC energies. The particle rapidity distributions in asymmetric collision systems can provide additional constraints on modeling the early-time longitudinal dynamics. Enabled by this 3D framework, we quantify the rapidity (de)correlation of anisotropic flow in large and small systems.

Due to their short lifetimes, resonances are useful tools to understand the mechanism of particle production and properties of the hadronic phase created after the collision. The yield of resonances might be modified with respect to expectations due to effects such as rescattering and regeneration. Moreover, the study of resonance production in p--Pb collisions fills the gap between pp and heavy-ion (Pb--Pb, Xe--Xe) collisions and helps us understand initial state effects due to cold nuclear matter. In asymmetric collisions (p--Pb), the particle yield will differ in the p and Pb-going direction. The rapidity asymmetry ($Y_{\rm{asym}}$) and nuclear modification factor will help in understanding the nuclear modification effects, like shadowing, the Cronin enhancement, multiple scattering, and energy loss. 
  We will report on the production of K*$^{0}$ and $\phi$ resonances in  p--Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The measurements are performed in five rapidity windows in the interval -1.2 $< y <$ 0.3 .

Poster Session 1 T14_2,poster,Precision hydrodynamic predictions for particle production in isobar collisions at RHIC,"Kirchner, Andreas",Duke University,Unknown,"The STAR collaboration has recently released measurements of soft particle production in Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions [1]. Due to the isobar running mode and the huge statistics of collected events, such measurements are essentially devoid of experimental error, and permit us to perform precision tests of hydrodynamic models of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
In this contribution, we discuss hydrodynamic results for particle production in isobar collisions where we achieve the same precision reached in the experimental data. Our approach relies on a background-fluctuation splitting of the equations of hydrodynamics. In a given centrality class, and assuming boost invariance, we decompose the QGP as an event-averaged and azimuthally-isotropic background plus an event-by-event fluctation, $\text{QGP}(r,\phi)=\langle \text{QGP} \rangle (r) + \delta\text{QGP}(r,\phi)$. Linearizing the equations of hydrodynamics with respect to the fluctuation, we show that final particle spectra are determined by the isotropic background, with the fluctuation contributing only at next-to-next-to-leading order. Computing the evolution of $\langle \text{QGP} \rangle (r)$ requires solving 1+1D hydrodynamic equations, which can be done quickly for a large number of collision events.
We perform, thus, precision calculations of hadron production in isobar collisions by means of FluiduM [2], a solver for the 1+1D evolution of the QGP which implements 2nd order Israel-Stewart relativistic hydrodynamics as well as QGP particlization and resonance decays. We show predictions for particle spectra, yields and average transverse momenta of identified hadrons [3]. Looking at ratios of quantities between Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr systems, we find that they are insensitive to viscosities and other medium parameters. They are instead driven by initial-state effects, mainly originating from the larger neutron skin of 96Zr.

In order to run the experiment to its full potential, novel methods for event characterisation and subsequent data analysis are necessary. In this talk, we show that PointNet based DL models are an ideal candidate for such tasks on experimental data with minimal pre-processing. We demonstrate that PointNet based models can perform, event-by-event impact parameter reconstruction at CBM experiment using directly the hits/ tracks of particles from the detector planes [1, 2]. The models have their mean error varying from -0.33 to 0.22 fm  for impact parameters 2-14 fm and outperform conventional methods based on a single observable such as track multiplicity. We also show that PointNet models can accurately identify the nature of QCD transition at the CBM experiment [3]. The DL models distinguish a first order phase transition from a crossover transition using the reconstructed tracks of charged particles with an accuracy of up to 99.8%. The models are also shown to outperform methods relying on conventional mean observables.

Balance functions for all combinations of identified charged-hadron ($\pi$, K, p) pairs are calculated in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV as a function of collision centrality. The balancing in azimuthal angle and rapidity is expected to provide information about quark diffusion and delayed hadronization, respectively. For the latter, a possible two-stage quark-production scenario $-$ early production of strange quarks and late production of light quarks $-$ is discussed. In addition, balance function integrals of (un)identified hadron pairs as a function of collision centralities, which provide the information about different pairing probabilities, are calculated for the first time. To investigate further the strangeness enhancement with multiplicity in small systems, recent measurements of how the production of doubly-strange $\Xi$ baryons is balanced with mesons (strange kaons and non-strange pions) and baryons ($\Xi$, $\Lambda$, and p) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are shown. The balance is studied by triggering on $\Xi$ baryons and subtracting the same quantum number from the opposite quantum number per-trigger yields. In particular, the multiplicity dependence is studied in order to identify if the same strangeness-production mechanism is at work in low- and high-multiplicity pp collisions. The results are compared to predictions from Monte Carlo models with various tunes of PYTHIA8 (Lund string-based approach) and EPOS LHC (based on core-corona approach).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sumit', 'last_name': 'Basu', 'fullName': 'Basu, Sumit', 'id': '6558132', 'affiliation': 'Lund University (SE)', 'emailHash': 'c6cd45f2d37bfc14f741d8cb9ffa540d', 'db_id': 6558132, 'person_id': 6335891}"

Recently, the ALICE Collaboration studied strangeness production in pp interactions, unveiling unexpected features in the strange hadron to pion yield ratios. These observations have been obtained by a statistical analysis of the number of strange particles in a given set of inelastic pp events. In this sense, formation rates account for the Probability Density Function (PDF) underlying the production mechanism on an average. More insightful information on the production of strange particles and, more in general, on hadronization would come from the knowledge of the full PDF.

An exotic hadron consisting of six quarks is called a dibaryon, and a dibaryon containing strange quarks (multi-strangedibaryon) has not yet been discovered. An exotic hadron consisting of four quarks and an antiquark is called a pentaquark, and the recent discovery of the hidden charm pentaquarks P$_{c}(4312)^{+}$ , P$_{c}(4440)^{+}$, and P$_{c}(4457)^{+}$ by LHCb has reopened the question of whether pentaquarks exist in the strange sector.

The recent lattice QCD calculations by HAL QCD showed the attractive potentials between $\Lambda\Lambda$, N${\Xi}$, and N${\Omega}$. The strangeness enhancement, measured by ALICE as a function of increasing charged particle multiplicity even in pp collisions, further adds to the likelihood of observing strange pentaquark and dibaryon states. A consequence of these attractive potentials and strangeness enhancement is that the H-dibaryon can be a resonance state of $\Lambda\Lambda$, or N${\Xi}$, and N${\Omega}$ may appear as a quasi-bound state, strongly decaying at the collision point. Also, following analogous decay channels for the five quark P$_{c}^{+}$ states into the strange sector, a P$_{s}$ decaying strongly with daughters $\phi$p, $\Lambda K$, $\Lambda K^*$, and $\Sigma^{‚àó}K$ may appear as a bound state.

Poster Session 2 T05 / T13,poster,Ratio of photon anisotropic flow,"Dasgupta, Pingal",Unknown,Unknown,"The anisotropic flow of direct photons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions is  known to be dominated by the thermal radiations. The non-thermal contributions dilute the photon anisotropic flow by adding  extra weight factor in the $v_n$ calculation. The discrepancy between experimental photon anisotropic flow data and results from theoretical model calculations is not well understood even after significant developments in the model calculations as well as in the experimental analysis methods.

We show that the ratio of photon $v_n$ can be a potential observable in this regard by minimizing the non-thermal contributions and the ratio along with the individual flow parameters could be valuable to constrain the initial state as well as to understand the photon anisotropic flow from heavy ion collisions better [1].

The photon $v_2/v_3$  is found to be larger for peripheral collisions than for central collisions and the $p_T$ dependent behavior of the ratio is found to be different from the individual flow parameters. The ratio is found to be sensitive to the initial conditions of the model calculation at different $p_T$ regions compared to the individual anisotropic flow parameters.

The $v_1/v_2$ ( and $v_1/v_3$ ) shows a completely different $p_T$ dependent nature compared to $v_2/v_3$ of photons. An experimental determination of photon $v_1/v_n$ is expected to confirm the range of thermal contribution. In addition, the $v_1/v_n$  is found to be less sensitive to the initial formation time compared to  $v_2/v_3$. However, $v_1/v_n$ is expected to be much more sensitive to the final freeze-out temperature as photon $v_1$ does not depend strongly on the value of $T_f$ .

Dielectron production is a powerful tool to investigate the properties of the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they carry information about the temperature of the medium and its space-time evolution without any distortion due to final-state interactions. Dielectron measurements in pp collisions serves as reference for heavy-ion studies since no medium effect is expected. As of now, results of such measurements at the LHC and the RHIC are compatible with expected hadron decays and no significant sign of medium modification has been reported. However in recent studies, collective behavior of hadrons has been seen in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions at the LHC and the RHIC similarly to previous observations in heavy-ion collisions. If a medium is created in such small colliding systems, it should give rise to an additional contribution of electromagnetic radiation in the direct photon spectrum. For each real direct photon production mechanism, an associated process producing a virtual photon which converts to a low mass dilepton exists as well. These processes, referred to as internal conversions, allow for the measurement of virtual direct photons with better signal to background ratio compared to real direct photon measurement at low transverse momentum, which is where the thermal radiation signal sits.
In this poster, the measurement of virtual photon production in minimum-bias and high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV will be presented.

The results of calculation are compared with recent STAR, ALICE and ATLAS experimental data. Very good agreement with the data is achieved without free parameters and without including additional mechanisms such as a possible rescattering of leptons in the quark-gluon plasma.

We will also refer to our earlier paper [2] where we discussed competition with thermal radiation. We verify that the combination of photon fusion, thermal radiation and final-state hadron decays gives a fair description of the low-$P_T$ invariant-mass as well as $P_T$ spectra as recently measured by the STAR collaboration in  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV Au+Au collisions for different centrality classes.

Poster Session 2 T13,poster,Scaling properties of direct photons in heavy ion collisions,"Khachatryan, Vladimir","Duke University, Stony Brook University",USA,"A recent analysis from the PHENIX collaboration on direct photon production yield in heavy ion collisions has shown a universal, within experimental uncertainties, multiplicity scaling, in which the photon $p_T$-spectra for transverse momenta up to 2 GeV/c are scaled with charged-hadron pseudorapidity density at midrapidity raised to the power $\alpha=1.25$. This low-$p_T$ scaling suggests that the main photon sources contributing to it, could be similar across beam energies. On the other hand, particle production in large and small system collisions, including direct photons, exhibits geometrical scaling in a similar $p_T$ range. The geometric scaling follows from gluon saturation and collision geometry. In particular, the direct photon spectra obtained for large and small system collisions at different centrality classes and various beam energies depend on a specific combination of number of participants, beam energy, and saturation scale - rather than on all these three variables separately. In our presentation, we show that the multiplicity and geometric scaling laws for direct photons are interconnected and discuss physical conditions needed to relate one to another.

The theoretical interest in the behavior of in-medium spectral functions lies in the expected restoration of chiral symmetry at high energy densities, which may be accessed experimentally by studying dilepton mass spectra in heavy-ion collisions. Within SMASH, the phase space of all particles is available at all times, as well as information on interactions, allowing for a direct assessment of particle lifetimes and the mass distributions. Our reconstruction of the spectral function consists in using the total width ‚Äî considering both decays and collisions ‚Äî as input for a Breit-Wigner ansatz. The broadening of the spectral function in a thermalized system is shown to be consistent with model calculations [1\], and the dependence of total width on local hadron density is provided. This broadening develops dynamically, since SMASH relies only on vacuum properties of resonances as an input. On the other hand, we present the effective $\rho$-meson spectral function for the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion collisions, finding a clear correlation of broadening to system size. Furthermore, we discuss the difference in the results between the thermal system and full collision dynamics, which may point to out-of-equilibrium effects. The results shown in this work are of interest to distinguish dynamical broadening from additional genuine medium-modified spectral functions.

We extend our previous results [1] on the effects of pre-hydrodynamical models on final state observables to small systems. We show that the artificial bulk pressure generated at the switch to hydrodynamics by the assumption of scaling invariance during the pre-hydrodynamical evolution is enhanced for smaller systems sizes. We also show that its magnitude is dependent on the duration of the pre-hydrodynamical phase, growing with longer evolution times. These results further reinforce the need for non-conformal pre-hydrodynamical models, particularly in light of concerns about the validity of hydrodynamics at early times and the resulting need for accurate pre-hydrodynamic evolution, and the growing interest in small systems. Finally, we investigate whether a free-streaming pre-hydrodynamical evolution with a velocity smaller than $c$ [2], thus effectively breaking the assumption of scale invariance, can alleviate the effects of this artefact when performing the extraction of transport coefficients and initial state parameters from hybrid simulations.

using the Electron Ion Collider.  We examine the interplay between the effect
of the soft gluon emissions, or Sudakov effects, and gluon saturation effects
with the help of the azimuthal correlations between the total transverse
momentum of the dijet system and the scattered electron.  Kinematic cuts are
imposed such that the dijet system is produced in the forward direction of the
laboratory frame, which sets an upper bound on the probed longitudinal
fractions of the hadron momentum carried by scattered gluons.  Further cuts are
chosen such that they allow us to use the factorization formalism that directly
involves the unpolarized Weizs√§cker-Williams gluon distribution.  We find that
this observable is very sensitive to the soft gluon emission and moderately
sensitive to the gluon saturation.  The former sensitivity is, however, greatly
reduced in the nuclear modification ratio when comparing proton and heavy ions

Poster Session 1 T01,poster,System-size dependence of particle production at mid and forward rapidity with ALICE,"Alkin, Anton",CERN,Switzerland,"The rapidity dependence of particle production contains information on the partonic structure of the projectile and target and is, in particular at LHC energies, sensitive to non-linear QCD evolution in the initial state. At LHC, collision final states have been mainly studied in the central kinematic region, however, there is a rich opportunity for measurements in the forward direction, which probe the nucleon structure at small Bjorken-x values. Moreover, investigating the system-size dependence of the particle production at the same collision energy is particularly important for directly studying nuclear effects. 
In the first part of the talk, the final Run 1 and 2 particle-production results at forward rapidities will be presented for pp, p-Pb, and Pb-Pb collision systems, where ALICE has unique coverage. When combined, the Forward Multiplicity and the Silicon Pixel Detectors can measure charged particles over a wide range of $-3.4<\eta<5.0$. The Photon Multiplicity Detector has complementary coverage for neutral-particle production over the kinematic range $2.3<\eta<3.9$. 
In the second part of the presentation, we will introduce the upgraded Run 3 ALICE configuration. The new Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors-based Inner Tracking System allows full tracking and vertexing for $|\eta|<2.5$. When combined with the new Muon Forward Tracker, the tracking can be extended to cover $-3.6<\eta<2.5$.

Poster Session 1 T01,poster,Coalescence Sum rule for Elliptic Flow from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan,"Huang, HuanZhong",UCLA,USA,"Transverse-momentum ($p_T$) dependence of elliptic flow ($v_2$) for identified particles at the top RHIC energy has well established a number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling [1], supportive of the coalescence sum rule that determines $v_2$ of mesons and baryons as the sum of contributions from their constituent quarks. The NCQ scaling implicitly assumes that the produced drops of partonic matter are thermally equilibrated, and constituent quarks at hadronization do not remember their past history. This assumption is found to be violated with the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) data [2]. In this talk, we will focus on  the $p_T$-integrated $v_2$ data instead of $v_2(p_T)$, and    quantitatively explain the results on $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7$ GeV to 62.4 GeV by differentiating quarks produced in the collision and those transported from the initial-state nuclei. After verification of the coalescence sum rule, we extract $v_2$ for both produced ($u/d/{\bar u}/{\bar d}$, $s$, and ${\bar s}$, separately) and for transported ($u/d$) quarks. The latter is found to be larger than the former, and accounts for the observed $v_2$ difference between particles and antiparticles. We also relate the $v_2$ measurements of multi-strange hadrons to the different formation times of $\phi$, $\Omega^\pm$ and $\Xi^+$. At the RHIC BES regime, although the coalescence sum rule seems to be valid and the partonic degrees of freedom are important, the produced nuclear matter may not reach a full thermal equilibrium. We will discuss the beam energy dependence of the baryon transport and its impact on thermal equilibration.

Poster Session 1 T01,poster,Dependence of hydrodynamic attractors on the definition of the equilibrium state,"Denicol, Gabriel",Universidade Federal Fluminense,Unknown,"Fluid-dynamical theories are always constructed in terms of an expansion around a given, yet arbitrary, local equilibrium state. This is implemented by the choice of the so-called matching conditions which define the temperature, chemical potential, and velocity of a viscous fluid. Matching conditions are an essential feature of nonequilibrium systems and their consequences to the emergence of hydrodynamic behavior have not been explored. In particular, the interplay between matching conditions and fluid-dynamical attractors [1] are far from understood. 

We investigate for the first time how fluid-dynamical attractors in Bjorken flow are affected by choices of matching conditions, considering several formulations of fluid dynamics and kinetic theory. We show that the effect considerably worsens the agreement between solutions of first-order [2] and second-order fluid dynamics [3] and kinetic theory. These results directly affect the modeling of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions where a fluid dynamical approximation is thought to be valid even at early times when the system is far from equilibrium.

Poster Session 1 T01,poster,Far from equilibrium hydrodynamic attractor for an azimuthally symmetric system,"Dash, Ashutosh",Frankfurt University,Unknown,"Hydrodynamics is an effective theory for the description of long-wavelength phenomena of fluids, that can be expressed as a small gradient expansion of fluid velocities relative to a thermal background. Thus, hydrodynamics is expected to fail for systems which are far-from-equilibrium. The medium produced in pp collisions at LHC and RHIC energies is an example of such a system. However, recent experimental results of high energy pp collision have shown evidence of collectivity similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. The unprecedented success of hydrodynamics to describe collectivity in heavy-ion collisions, as well as small systems, can be attributed to the fact that there exists a stable universal attractor which makes the dynamical equations to quickly converge and enter a hydrodynamic regime, at a time scale much smaller than the typical isotropization time scales. In the present work, we go beyond the previous
works which considered 1+1d longitudinal boost invariant systems, by considering a system undergoing Gubser flow which has a simultaneous transverse and longitudinal expansion. 

To investigate the dynamics of such a system, the Boltzmann equation is solved in the relaxation time approximation using a hierarchy of angular moments of the distribution function. The dynamics of transition is described by the presence of fixed points which describes the evolution of the system in various stages. We found that unlike 1+1d Bjorken flow which has late-time thermalization (hydrodynamization), Gubser flow is intrinsically a 3+1d expanding system with dynamics such that the system goes from early time free-streaming regime to intermediate thermalization (hydrodynamization) and back to free-streaming in the late time regime. The attractor solution is found for various orders of moments as an interpolation between these fixed points.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ashutosh', 'last_name': 'Dash', 'fullName': 'Dash, Ashutosh', 'id': '6540179', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt University', 'emailHash': 'df8058536a16291d8f8ccdb615aad1ef', 'db_id': 6540179, 'person_id': 6300812}"
Poster Session 1 T01,poster,Exclusive heavy vector meson production at next-to-leading order in deep inelastic scattering,"Penttala, Jani",University of Jyv√§skyl√§ (FI),Unknown,"Exclusive vector meson production is a powerful process to probe the small Bjorken-$x$ structure of protons and nuclei, as such processes are especially sensitive to gluonic structure and also provide access to the spatial distribution of small-$x$ gluons in nuclei. A powerful theoretical framework to study vector meson production at high energy, and to describe the initial condition of heavy-ion collisions, is the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. So far, most calculations in the CGC framework have been done at the leading order. Recent theoretical developments on the NLO heavy vector meson wave function [1] and the NLO virtual photon light-front wave function with massive quarks [2,3] have made it possible to go beyond the leading order, allowing us to include the next-to-leading corrections in $\alpha_s$ and calculate exclusive heavy vector meson production at NLO in the dipole picture for the first time.

In this talk, we will present results from our recent work on longitudinal [4] and transverse [5] NLO vector meson production in the nonrelativistic limit. We demonstrate the cancellation of UV and IR divergences in the NLO calculation, which includes taking into account both the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation describing the rapidity evolution of the dipole amplitude and the renormalization of the leading-order vector meson wave function. The next-to-leading order corrections are found to be sizable; however, their numerical effect on vector meson production is compensated by the dipole amplitude, fitted to HERA inclusive cross section data at NLO [6]. Finally, exclusive $J/\psi$ production is calculated numerically and compared to the existing data. We find that both the NLO corrections and the first relativistic corrections, calculated in Ref. [7], are numerically important and result in a good agreement with the data. We demonstrate that it is possible to simultaneously compute consistently both inclusive and exclusive cross sections at NLO accuracy in the CGC framework.

We examine this issue based on the assumption that a universal attractor dominates the dynamics already at the earliest stages, which offers a way to connect the initial state with the start of the hydrodynamic expansion in an approximate but conceptually transparent fashion. We demonstrate that the centrality dependence of the measured particle multiplicities can be used to quantitatively constrain the pressure anisotropy and find that it strongly depends on the model of the initial energy deposition. As an illustration, we compare three initial state models and show that they predict rather different early-time values of the pressure anisotropy. This strongly suggests that assuming free streaming prior to hydrodynamization is not necessarily compatible with a generic initial state model and that features of the pre-hydrodynamic flow need to be matched with the model of the initial state.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jakub', 'last_name': 'Jankowski', 'fullName': 'Jankowski, Jakub', 'id': '6522279', 'affiliation': 'University of Wroclaw', 'emailHash': 'f8344466a75096e2021d05d5a873aa24', 'db_id': 6522279, 'person_id': 6286258}"

In this talk, we will compare prompt photon to $\pi^0$ production measured by PHENIX in $d$+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV to demonstrate that the apparent centrality dependence is not related to a nuclear modification of hard scattering processes, but likely due to deviations from the proportionality of event activity and centrality in the underlying standard Glauber model calculations. Furthermore, we will use prompt photon production in $d$+Au relative to $p+p$ collisions to empirically determine the effective number of binary collisions $N_{coll}$ of a given event sample. We find that for all event selections, except for those with the highest event activity, $R_{xA}$ of $\pi^0$ is consistent with unity.

Furthermore, the system size dependence of the yield, expressed through the power $\alpha$, remains independent of $p_T$ over the entire observed range from 1 to 6~GeV/c.

This enhancement is most pronounced at relatively large angles away from the opposing jet axis. More recent analyses have further investigated and quantified this phenomena by studying the yield modification as a function of the azimuthal angle ($I_{AA}$ vs $\Delta\phi$). The larger data sets collected by PHENIX in 2014 and 2016 enhance the statistical precision and enable more differential measurements, which provide insight to how the jets substructure is modified by the QGP and crucial constraints on models of partonic energy loss and medium response.

the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV, with the largest yields at
mid-rapidity. The enhanced production of charmonium states from combinations of independently produced charm quarks could contribute to the observation that, in Au+Au collisions at RHIC, J/$\psi$ yields are smaller at forward rapidity than at mid-rapidity relative to observations in $p+p$ collisions at the same energy. A signature of such charmonium coalescence could be the presence of J/$\psi$ flow. The PHENIX experiment collected a large sample of J/$\psi\rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ decays at the pseudorapidity region of 1.2$<\eta<$2.2 in Au+Au collisions during the 2014 and 2016 runs. These data will allow the most precise measurement so far of J/$\psi$ flow component $v_2$ in a region where the number of charm quark pairs is smaller than at mid-rapidity.

A comparison between yields observed in $p$+$p$ and $p$+Au at the same multiplicity could help explain how the multiparton interactions (in $p$+$p$) can affect the measurement of multinucleon interactions (in $p$+Au), as well as the measured nuclear modification factors, after evaluating the competing effects such as charmonium breakup in co-moving particles.

Parallel Session T08: Strongly coupled systems,parallel,Charm and Bottom quark energy loss and flow measurements in Au+Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment,"Hachiya, Takashi",RIKEN,Unknown,"The energy loss of quarks when travelling a QGP medium is expected to depend on their mass. Heavy quarks causes a dead cone region along the direction of the quark where no energy is lost by gluon bremsstrahlung. This effect can be measured by comparing the nuclear modification factors of hadrons made of light and heavy quarks. The heavy quark coupling with the thermalized QGP is also an important aspect in probing the thermodynamics of QGP. The coupling is studied by the measurement of the flow harmonics ($v_2$) and its dependency on the transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$ of the probe and on the collision centrality. 
The PHENIX experiment contains a set of vertex detectors which enable the measurement of the distance of the closest approach (DCA) of identified electrons and muons. By utilizing their DCAs, identification of charm and bottom semi-leptonic decays was realized in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. The $p_{\rm T}$ and collision centrality dependence of the nuclear modification and $v_2$ for charm and bottom hadrons were thus measured at mid-rapidity region ($|\eta|<$0.35) using the large dataset from the RHIC Year-2014 run. The $p+p$ yield used as a reference was obtained via semi-leptonic decay of heavy quarks and non-prompt J/$\psi$ yield ($B\rightarrow J/\psi+X$). The final results from this work will be presented and discussed in the view of the heavy quark energy loss, its coupling to and diffusion in QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takashi', 'last_name': 'Hachiya', 'fullName': 'Hachiya, Takashi', 'id': '6577051', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN', 'emailHash': 'f893d36849d3988a5cf874997bf21b91', 'db_id': 6577051, 'person_id': 6505670}"

We present two new infrared and collinear safe observables: the angle between different definitions of the jet axis, $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$, as well as jet energy flow measurements using jets reconstructed with different resolution parameters R. Both the jet energy flow and $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$ measurements can help us gauge the comparative strength of competing energy loss mechanisms in a heavy ion environment.

The spatial gradient of $\hat{q}$ perpendicular to the propagation direction can lead to a drift and asymmetry in parton transverse momentum distribution. Such an asymmetry depends on both the spatial position along the transverse gradient of the dense matter and path length of a propagating parton as shown by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann transport in the simplified form of a drift-diffusion equation. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, this asymmetry with respect to a plane defined by the beam and trigger particle (photon, hadron, or jet) with a given orientation relative to the event plane is shown to be closely related to the transverse position of the initial jet production in full event-by-event simulations within the linear Boltzmann transport model. Such a gradient tomography can be used to localize the initial jet production position for a more detailed study of jet quenching and properties of the quark-gluon plasma along a given propagation path in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yayun', 'last_name': 'He', 'fullName': 'He, Yayun', 'id': '6575186', 'affiliation': 'South China Normal University', 'emailHash': 'ae769eca7ad34e47f4222f46e2f46c64', 'db_id': 6575186, 'person_id': 6333181}"

Top quark pair ($\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) production is measured in events with two opposite-sign high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ isolated leptons ($\ell^\pm\ell^\mp =\,\mathrm{e}^{+} \mathrm{e}^{-},\,\mu^{+} \mu^{-},\,\mathrm{and}\,\mathrm{e}^{\pm} \mu^{\mp}$). We test the sensitivity to the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ signal process by requiring or not the additional presence of b-tagged jets, and hence demonstrate the feasibility to identify top quark decay products irrespective of interacting with the medium (bottom quarks) or not (leptonically decaying W bosons). To that end, the inclusive cross section ($\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$) is derived from likelihood fits to a multivariate discriminator, which includes different leptonic kinematic variables with and without the b-tagged jet multiplicity information. The observed (expected) significance of the $\mathrm{t\bar{t}}$ signal against the background-only hypothesis is 4.0 (5.8) and 3.8 (4.8) standard deviations, respectively, for the fits with and without the b-jet multiplicity input. After event reconstruction and background subtraction, the extracted cross sections are $\sigma_\mathrm{t\bar{t}} = 2.03 ^{+0.71}_{-0.64}$ and $2.54 ^{+0.84}_{-0.74}\,\mu\mathrm{b}$, respectively, which are lower than, but still compatible with, the expectations from scaled proton-proton data as well as from perturbative quantum chromodynamics predictions.

However, jet quenching in small systems has not yet been observed, and quantifying or setting limits on the magnitude of jet quenching in small systems is a key element in understanding the limits of QGP formation. In this talk we present a search for jet quenching effects in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\ \mathrm{TeV}$ based on two jet observables: inclusive jet production, and the semi-inclusive yield of jets recoiling from a high-$p_{\rm T}$ hadron. Both measurements are carried out differentially in event multiplicity, which varies the size of the collision system. Jets are reconstructed from charged particles using the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm, with $R$ between 0.3 and 0.7. The $R$-dependent inclusive jet cross section is compared to pQCD calculations. To search for jet quenching effects, the shape of the inclusive jet yield in different multiplicity intervals is compared to the one obtained in minimum-bias (MB) events. The jet yield increases as a function of charged-particle multiplicity, which is similar to the one observed from soft sectors. In the semi-inclusive analysis, recoil jet acoplanarity is measured for events selected on high multiplicity (HM) and compared to the MB population. A striking modification of the acoplanarity distribution, which is nominally characteristic of jet quenching, is observed in the measured HM population. Its origin is elucidated by comparison to model calculations, with implications for the larger LHC small-systems program.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Filip', 'last_name': 'Krizek', 'fullName': 'Krizek, Filip', 'id': '6564548', 'affiliation': 'Czech Academy of Sciences (CZ)', 'emailHash': '59779b305edf821ebf6c15602f913239', 'db_id': 6564548, 'person_id': 6323406}"

The structure of the nuclei can be studied at large x and as a function of the mass number, thanks to the versatility of the target. Moreover, the FT experiment with heavy ion beams at ALICE allows us to make precise studies of quarkonium states, heavy-quark energy loss, transport properties of QGP in new energy and rapidity domains - complementary to the existing LHCb FT setup. The detailed physics motivation, projected performance and possible implementation of a fixed target programme at the LHC can be found in [1,2].

The success of this proposal depends on the integration of the FT setup with the main collider program of ALICE. One of the main concerns is whether the central barrel detectors, namely the TPC can track and reconstruct the fixed target events with sufficient efficiency and resolution. This study uses the ALICE Run 3 software framework (O$^{2}$) to estimate the tracking performance of the TPC for FT events with a solid target placed a few meters upstream to the nominal interaction point of the ALICE detector. In this poster we present the inclusive charged particle tracking efficiency and transverse momentum resolution for inclined tracks (-2 $\leq\eta\leq$ -1) from the simulated FT collisions. Two different target positions have been considered for this study.

In bakelite RPC, the electrode plates are coated with linseed oil to get rid of the surface roughness of the electrodes, reduce the UV sensitivity and to save the electrode surface from hydrofluoric acid (HF) vapor attack. In conventional bakelite RPC, the linseed oil coating is done after making the gas gap keeping no scope for visual inspection for presence of any uncured linseed oil droplet. In this work, a new technique is introduced to coat the linseed oil in bakelite RPC before making the gas gap. After the linseed oil coating, the plates are cured for several days and then the gas gap is made. The advantage of this procedure is that after linseed oil coating it can be checked visually whether the curing is properly done, or any uncured droplet of linseed oil is present in the gas gap.

Standard NIM electronics is used to test the prototype. When operated with 100% Tetrafluoroethane (C$_{2}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$) gas in the avalanche mode an efficiency $\sim$90% is achieved using cosmic rays.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'arindam', 'last_name': 'sen', 'fullName': 'sen, arindam', 'id': '6540580', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'a2e0de99c97a3ff261ecded001dc209b', 'db_id': 6540580, 'person_id': 6320650}"

For Run 3, starting in 2022, interaction rates of 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions require a major upgrade of the TPC readout system. The Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs) were replaced by stacks of four Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils, allowing continuous data acquisition. Due to intrinsic properties of the GEMs, a significant amount of ions produced during the electron amplification drifts into the active volume of the TPC, leading to space-charge distortions of the nominal drift field. Various effects, such as variations in the number of collisions for a given time interval, cause fluctuations of the space-charge distortions on very short time scales. These fluctuations have to be corrected to preserve the intrinsic tracking precision of the TPC of 100 $\mu$m. A dedicated calibration procedure has been developed for the correction of the space-charge distortions. The measured integrated digital currents (IDCs) on the pads, which are used as an estimate for the space-charge density, are processed and taken as an input for a data-driven machine learning approach.

It is proposed to include a Forward Conversion Tracker (FCT) in ALICE 3, the next-generation heavy-ion collision experiment proposed for Run 5 and 6 at the LHC, to measure ultra-soft photons at forward rapidities. The dominant background in this measurement, decay photons and external Bremsstrahlung from detector-material interaction, has been investigated and compared to the signal expectation derived from Low's theorem. This is achieved by simulations including the implementation of the proposed ALICE 3 detector geometry, with the beam pipe, barrel tracking layers, and forward disks of the experiment, in a GEANT4 setup. Pp collisions at 13 TeV are simulated with PYTHIA and the produced particles are propagated through the detector system. Aiming at a significant soft-photon measurement, several background-suppression capabilities have been explored: Major improvements were achieved by the rejection of events with an electron or positron in the $\eta$ - range of the FCT and by reducing the material budget in optimising the shape of the beam pipe.

It will provide unprecedented tracking and vertexing capabilities down to a few tens of MeV/$c$ in pp, pA and AA collisions and will have a large rapidity coverage $|\eta|<4$. Such detector performances allow to study precisely the dielectron production over a broad range of pair $p_{\text{T}}$ and mass. Dilepton production at very low $p_{\text{T}}$ and mass is particularly sensitive to the electric conductivity of the medium via thermal dielectrons in heavy-ion (AA) collisions. At higher dielectron invariant masses (m$_{ee}$), dielectrons from $\rho$ meson decays carry information about chiral-symmetry restoration, e.g. via the chiral mixing between $\rho$ and $a_1$ mesons. Moreover, the m$_{ee}$ spectrum of thermal dielectrons from the QGP directly provides a mean to estimate the early temperature of the medium in the 1.1 $<$ m$_{ee} <$ 2.7 GeV/$c^{2}$ region, whereas elliptic flow measurement as a function of m$_{ee}$ and pair transverse momentum allow a study of the dynamic in the medium as a function of time.   \newline

A possible way to track and identify electrons will be presented. Furthermore, it will be explained how the combinatoric background can be reduced with a so-called prefilter technique.

The expected data processing and storage rate will reach ~3 TB/s. To meet this challenge, ALICE underwent a major upgrade of its detectors and systems. One of the four new detectors is the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT). FIT consists of three subdetectors: FT0, FV0 and FDD. FT0 will generate online triggers, allow multiplicity and vertex determination, background monitoring and luminosity measurements. FT0 will also allow event plane, centrality determination, and provide the precise collision time for the time-of-flight-based particle identification in the offline mode. FT0 is composed of two Cherenkov arrays, installed on both sides of the interaction point, at -0.8 m (-3.4 < ùúÇ < -2.3) and +3 m (3.8 < ùúÇ < 5.0). One of the FT0 arrays is attached to the FV0. FV0 is a segmented, ~1.5 m in diameter plastic scintillator disc, covering the pseudorapidity range of 2.2 < ùúÇ < 5.1. FV0, together with FT0, will serve as the main forward multiplicity detector with a major role in the event plane and centrality determination.

From the LHC Run 3, a new silicon pixel detector, the Muon Forward Tracker (MFT), is installed in front of the muon spectrometer in order to improve the muon tracking in the forward rapidity region. The MFT is made of 5 double-sided disks, concentric with the beam pipe, on which almost 1000 CMOS pixel chips are installed. In addition, a new data computing system called O2 (Online-Offline) is introduced in ALICE to allow synchronous data acquisition and reconstruction from continuous readout, together with asynchronous treatment of the data. The control of the ALICE detector, including MFT, is based on the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system integrated into O2. The finite state machine, a hierarchical logical model, is employed for a comprehensive operation to control the MFT. In addition, the interlock system automatically responds to the abnormal state of the detector to ensure a safe operation. 

In October 2021, pilot pp collisions were performed in the LHC after the Long Shutdown 2 period. It was the first data acquisition of pp collisions by MFT, and it lasted for five days with a total run time of 28 hours. The detector operation and data processing were tested through the pilot run. Raw data were read out continuously with the frequency of 200 kHz during pilot collisions, and data processing with O2 was commissioned. The data masking based on the noisy pixels and the time duration without physics signals was performed. Processed data were sampled to check the calibration and reconstruction behave as expected. From the hit information, charged-particle tracks were reconstructed, and it succeeded in showing the tracks on the event display. Some data analysis based on the acquired data is already ongoing.

Probing the critical phenomena and locating the CEP are the key goals of the beam energy scan (BES) experiments. When approaching the CEP, the long-range correlation is established, and hence leads to a large fluctuation of the conserved charges. In this presentation, we show, based on the coalescence model and the Landau-Ginzberg theory, that the light nuclei yields and their ratios are enhanced as a consequence of the long-range correlation, which make them ideal probes of criticality [1]. The behavior of the hard probes in the vicinity of the CEP is studied as well [2].  These observables provide us new perspectives for seeking the CEP in the heavy-ion collisions.

The observed non-monotonic behavior with the colliding energies[1,2] was declared to be related to the critical point of the QCD phase diagram[3,4]. In this talk, we focus on investigating the light nuclei production with and without critical fluctuations within the framework of the coalescence model.

In the first part, we derive the yield of light nuclei in terms of various orders of cumulants for the density distribution function by the implementation of the characteristic function of the phase space density without considering the critical fluctuations.  We found that the leading terms of the phase-space cumulants in the yield of light nuclei share a similar form and could be canceled out in light nuclei ratio, whereas the higher-order ones (non-Gaussian shaped density profile) remain and play an important role in the interpretation of the behavior of light nuclei yield ratio. 

In the second part, we introduce the static critical correlation contribution to the phase space density and derive the light nuclei production in terms of phase space cumulant. Because the leading terms of the phase-space cumulants in the yield of light nuclei share the similar form, we can construct a new light nuclei yield ratio, which is directly proportional to the critical contribution and can be measured in future experiments.

Poster Session 3 T15 / T16,poster,Towards solving the puzzle of high temperature light (anti)-nuclei production in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Neidig, TIm",Goethe University Frankfurt ,Unknown,"The creation of loosely bound objects in heavy ion collisions, e.g.~light clusters, near the phase transition temperature ($T_{\rm ch} \approx 155 MeV$) has been a puzzling observation that seems to be at odds with Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggesting that deuterons and other clusters are formed only below a temperature $T\approx 0.1-1 MeV$. We solve this puzzle by showing that the light cluster abundancies in heavy ion reactions stay approximately constant from chemical freeze-out to kinetic freeze-out. To this aim we develop an extensive network of coupled reaction rate equations including stable hadrons and hadronic resonances to describe the temporal evolution
of the abundancies of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in the late hadronic 
environment of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision.
It is demonstrated that the chemical equilibration of the light 
nuclei occurs on a very short timescale as a consequence of the strong 
production and dissociation processes. 
However, because of the partial chemical equilibrium of the stable hadrons, including the nucleon feeding from $\Delta$ resonances, the abundancies of the light nuclei stay nearly constant during the evolution and cooling of the hadronic phase. This solves the longstanding contradiction between the thermal fits and the late stage coalescence (and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis) and explains why the observed light cluster yields are compatible with both a high chemical production temperature and a late state emission as modelled by coalescence. We also note in passing that the abundancies of the light clusters in the present approach are in excellent agreement with those measured by ALICE at LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'TIm', 'last_name': 'Neidig', 'fullName': 'Neidig, TIm', 'id': '6541405', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt ', 'emailHash': '1aff81f1a36e3423a1ce1a9cf591f81b', 'db_id': 6541405, 'person_id': 6338636}"

Such multiplicity scaling observables can used to extract light nuclei sizes and the effective volume of the firball formed in relativistic heavy-ion collision

Then, I will talk about the collective flow of deuterons and helium-3 at LHC and their sensitivities to the phase-space distributions of protons and nucleons at kinetic freeze-out. Our nucleon coalescence model calculations provide the solid baseline predictions for the yields of light nuclei in the search for the possible QCD critical points at beam energy scan. Coalescence model calculations, together with the proper phase-space distributions of nucleons, validate the picture that light nuclei might be produced through the coalescence of protons and neutrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.

Poster Session 3 T16,poster,Proton-deuteron and deuteron-deuteron correlation functions and origin of light nuclei from relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"S≈Ço≈Ñ, Patrycja",National Centre for Nuclear Research,UK,"Production of light nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is well described by the thermal model, where light nuclei are in equilibrium with all other hadron species present in a fireball, and by the coalescence model, where light nuclei are formed due to final state interactions after the fireball decays. A method is proposed to falsify one of the models. We suggest to measure a hadron-deuteron or deuteron-deuteron correlation function which carries information about the source of the deuterons and allows one to determine whether a deuteron is directly emitted from the fireball or if it is formed afterwards. The $p\!-\!D$ and $D\!-\!D$ correlation functions are computed to illustrate the statement. For $p\!-\!D$ correlation function the source radius of deuterons formed due to final-state interactions is bigger by the factor of $\sqrt{4/3}$ than that of directly emitted deuterons and for $D\!-\!D$ the factor is $\sqrt{2}$. To check how sizable is the effect we compute the $p\!-\!D$ and $D\!-\!D$ correlation functions taking into account Bose-Einstein statistics of deuterons in case of the $D\!-\!D$ correlation function, $s$-wave scattering due to strong interaction and Coulomb repulsion. The correlation functions are shown to be sensitive to the source radius for sources which are sufficiently small with RMS radii smaller than 3.5 fm. Otherwise the correlation functions are dominated by the Coulomb repulsion and weakly depend on the source radius.

One of the parameters of the model is the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, which determines the fraction of antimatter and matter present in the gas. The hypothesis that at the LHC $\mu_{B}=0$, i.e. antimatter and matter are perfectly balanced, was tested by a study published in *Nature* in 2018, where it was found that $\mu_B=0.7\pm3.8\ \mathrm{MeV}$. The goal of this work is to improve the precision on $\mu_B$ by measuring the antimatter-over-matter ratios of protons, $^3\mathrm{He}$ and hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda\mathrm{H}$) reconstructed by ALICE in the LHC Run 2 data. In the SHM the antimatter-over-matter ratios are connected to $\mu_B$ as:

$\bar{h}/h\propto \exp\left[-2\left(B+S/3\right)\mu_{B}/T\right]$,

where $B$ is the baryon number and $S$ the strangeness number of the considered particle species $h$. The analysed species are the most sensitive to the value of $\mu_B$, as they are characterised by large $B$. The techniques used for the measurements of the analysed particles include standard analyses for the proton and helium, which are directly tracked by the ALICE detectors, while the $^3_\Lambda\mathrm{H}$ analysis is based on a Boosted Decision Tree selection applied to the candidates, which are reconstructed via the two-body charged-$\pi$ mesonic decay of the hypertriton. ¬†The obtained $\mu_B$ represents the most precise measurement ever.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mario', 'last_name': 'Ciacco', 'fullName': 'Ciacco, Mario', 'id': '6544828', 'affiliation': 'Politecnico and INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '77a75d727c4c1f5990ecfbe04958641f', 'db_id': 6544828, 'person_id': 6330511}"

The study of (multi-strange) hypernuclei production mechanism in high baryon density region of QCD phase diagram, determination of their lifetimes, decay branching ratios and binding energy will provide information on the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions, which are essential ingredients for the understanding of the nuclear matter equation-of-state at high densities, and, hence, of the structure of neutron stars.

The CBM detector is designed to measure such rare diagnostic probes with unprecedented precision and statistics. Independent of the production mechanism, theoretical models predict that single and double hypernuclei, and heavy multi-strange short-lived objects are produced in heavy-ion collisions with the maximum yield at FAIR energies.

Poster Session 3 T16,poster,Multi-particle collisions in the hadronic stage: Influence of annihilation and catalysis reactions on proton and deuteron yields,"Staudenmaier, Jan",Goethe University Frankfurt,Unknown,"Multi-particle reactions in the late stages of heavy-ion collisions are demonstrated to be significant for the final deuteron [1] and proton [2] abundances at intermediate to high beam energies. They are realized by employing a stochastic collision criterion in the hadronic transport approach SMASH.

This work sheds light on the puzzle that both final-state coalescence from nucleons and thermal approaches are able to reproduce the deuteron yield. Employing a microscopic treatment [3] of the deuteron production via direct 3<->2 pion and nucleon catalysis reactions reduces substantially the time required for deuterons to reach partial chemical equilibrium with nucleons. Subsequently, the final yield is practically independent from the number of deuterons on the Cooper-Frye hyper-surface. The results are also able to explain the apparent survival of the light nuclei bound by just few MeV at temperatures of more than hundred MeV - the ""snowballs in hell"" paradox. The deuteron production is studied in AuAu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7$ GeV as measured by STAR and NA49.

Furthermore, the effect of proton-antiproton annihilation on the (anti-)proton yield is investigated in the late collision stages for a wide energy range of  $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 17.3\, \rm{GeV} - 5.02\, \rm{TeV}$ in AuAu/PbPb collisions. The 5-body back-reaction is included for the first time in a full microscopic description in order to fulfill detailed balance for annihilations. This is achieved by accounting for the regeneration of (anti-)protons via $5\pi\rightarrow p\bar{p}$. The results show that a back-reaction happens for a fraction of 15-20% of all annihilations. Taking the back-reaction into account results in a regeneration of  half of the (anti-)proton yield that is lost due to annihilations at mid-rapidity. The decrease of the proton midrapidity yield reduces the tension of thermal model predictions (""proton anomaly"") with the experimental data from LHC and could influence the ongoing efforts to constrain the QCD transport coefficients with Bayesian techniques.

Suppression can also take place in hadron-nucleus collisions due to cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects where the presence of QGP is not expected. The hadron-nucleus collisions are therefore important as they help to disentangle the effects of the QGP from those due to CNM. Charmonium production in hA collisions at fixed-target energies is sensitive to the effects of nPDF and the partonic energy loss in nuclear matter. It is conveniently complemented by the well-known Drell-Yan process.

The double differential ($x_{\rm F}$, $p_{\rm T}$) cross-sections of J/$\psi$ production and Drell-Yan process have been measured by the COMPASS collaboration in hA collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 18.9$ GeV. A negative pion beam with a momentum of 190 GeV/c was impinging on ammonia, aluminum, and tungsten targets. The preliminary results for the ratios of heavy to light targets for both charmonia production and Drell-Yan show suppression towards high $x_{\rm F}$. A dependence with $p_{\rm T}$  is also investigated, which might indicate the presence of energy loss effects. COMPASS findings on the nuclear effects of the J/$\psi$ production and Drell-Yan process will be presented.

In particular, central p+A collisions may naturally produce an initial state in which the longitudinal flow pattern depends on the transverse radial coordinate.  The generic response of any fluid to such an initial condition is the generation of expanding vortical toroids--smoke rings.

In addition to the widely studied thermal vorticity effect, we identify an undiscovered contribution from the fluid shear [2]. We obtain the explicit expression for shear-induced polarization (SIP) from quantum kinetic equation and linear response theory. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we find SIP effect competes with the thermal vorticity effect and shows right sign (trend) to the azimuthal dependent local spin polarization $P_y(\phi)$ and $P_z(\phi)$. Especially, in the scenario that Lambda inherits and memorizes the spin polarization of strange quark, SIP wins the competition and the obtained local $P_y(\phi)$ and $P_z(\phi)$ qualitatively agree with the data measured at top RHIC energy [2].

Furthermore, we extend the calculation to event-by-event simulations for various collision systems at RHIC and LHC. We calculate the 2nd order Fourier coefficient of $P_z$, which qualitatively agrees with the ALICE measurements in 5.02 A TeV Pb+Pb collisions [3, 4]. We also predict the 3rd order Fourier coefficients, which provide more details for spin polarization and can be measured in the RHIC isobar run with high statics [4].

Illinois at Urbana Champaign (US),USA,"It has been shown that high-energy partons lose energy when traversing the hot, dense medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. However, the mechanism of the energy loss, including its dependence on the path-length of the shower in the medium and sensitivity to the jet substructure, is not fully understood. This talk presents a new measurement of single jet yields as a function of the azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. Because partons produced at different angles with respect to the event plane traverse, on average, different path lengths of the medium, this measurement gives insight into the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. The azimuthal angle dependence of the yields is characterized by the parameter $v_n^{jet}$, which quantifies the magnitude of the modulation of the azimuthal angle distribution with respect to the $n^{th}$ order event plane. While ATLAS has previously reported the $v_2^{jet}$ in Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV, this is the first ATLAS measurement of higher-order $v_n^{jet}$. The $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ are measured for jets with $p_T = 71-398$ GeV as a function of $p_T$ and collision centrality. A nonzero value of $v_2$ is observed in all but the most central collisions. A smaller nonzero value of $v_3$ is measured, suggesting that fluctuations in the initial state play a small but distinct role in jet energy loss.

Parallel Session T08: Strongly coupled systems,parallel,New experimental frontiers in the study of many-body nuclear interactions with ALICE,"Del Grande, Raffaele",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"Exploring the strong interaction among hadrons, the ALICE Collaboration has for the first time extended the experimental measurements from two- to three-body interactions. These measurements provide unique information on many aspects of strongly-coupled systems, like the genuine three-body interaction, the formation of light nuclei and the search for exotic bound states. Among those, many-body interactions, also including hyperons, are an important ingredient in the calculation of the equation of state of neutron stars. 

The results presented in this talk are obtained using high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. The first measured three-body correlations include p-p-p and p-p-$\Lambda$. Their genuine three-body interactions are obtained by subtracting the known two-body effects from the measured correlation functions for the triplets. In both systems, a non-zero three-particle cumulant is observed, providing a hint to the existence of a genuine three-body effect. Another class of many-body interaction studies is identified in the correlations of hadrons with light nuclei.

One of the dominant uncertainties present in such a study originates from poorly constrained initial conditions. In this talk, we present the final results of anisotropic flow measurements with high-order cumulants for inclusive and identified hadrons over the transverse momentum range of 0.2 < $p_{\rm T}$ < 20 GeV/c in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The measurements are also performed for the inclusive charged hadrons with a large coverage in pseudorapidity of 3.5 < $\eta$ < 5.0. With the combinations of two- and multiparticle cumulants, the relative flow fluctuations are studied in both transverse and pseudorapidity directions, providing unique insights into initial eccentricity fluctuations. In addition, the investigation on the $p_{\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations, originating in the event-by-event fluctuations of the initial geometry, is performed in Pb-Pb collisions. For the first time, we separate the potential contributions from flow angle and flow magnitude fluctuations via two newly proposed flow observables and report the first discovery of both effects with a confidence of more than 5$\sigma$. Finally, the latest results of correlations between mean transverse momentum and anisotropic flow coefficient, $\rho(v^2_n, [p_{\rm T}])$, which are expected to provide direct access to the correlations between initial size and shape of the created hot QCD matter, will be shown for Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. Together with the comparisons to the various hydrodynamic model calculations, we will highlight that the models based on the T$_{\rm R}$ENTo initial state model and tuned using the Bayesian analyses fail to describe measured values of the $\rho(v^2_n, [p_{\rm T}])$.

Jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions is expected to depend on the mass of the fragmenting parton as well as its QCD color charge.
For light quarks and gluons, energy loss via gluon bremsstrahlung, which is sensitive to the QCD color factor, is expected to dominate. In the case of heavy-quark-initiated jets, the radiative energy loss is expected to be suppressed by the dead cone effect and collisional energy loss may play a more important role.
In this talk, we report two new measurements by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. First, we present a measurement of photon-tagged jets which exploits the known difference in the fraction of quark-/gluon-initiated jets with and without the photon tag. Second, we present a measurement of $b$-tagged jets, identified through the semileptonic decays of $B$-hadrons into muons.

In this talk, we present a novel derivation of second-order relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics from the Boltzmann equation for multicomponent reactive mixtures with $N_{\text{spec}}$ particle species and with $N_q$ conserved charges. In the single-fluid approximation there are $4+N_q$ conservation laws for multiple conserved quantum charges and for the total energy-momentum.

$\sigma$-mean field (the order parameter of the phase transition) and
the quark- and meson phase-space distribution function from a
$\Phi$-derivable approximation, which is then numerically solved using
an accurate quadrature algorithm to evaluate the collision terms. This
numerical scheme is used to evaluate the grand-canonical baryon-number

buildup of higher-order fluctuations of the net-baryon number like the
curtosis at low momenta when the system is evolving close to the
critical point or the first-order phase-transition line. This is mainly
caused by the slowly evolving $\sigma$-mean field, i.e., the order
parameter of the phase transition. This is partially counterballanced by
the further dissipative evolution due to collisions of the quarks,
mesons, and the mean field, leading to a considerable weakening of the
final fluctuations, depending on the expansion rate of the fireball.

High energy partons (e.g. those in jet showers) traversing the QGP, capable of triggering these high-momentum exchanges with the medium constituents, have the potential to reveal the presence of such quasi-particles. 

In this work we present an implementation of this physics within the hybrid strong/weak coupling model in which, prior to this work, only the non-perturbative aspects of parton energy loss had been accounted for. Interaction with the quasi-particles results in elastic Moliere scatterings, leading to deflection of the direction of the jet parton that induced the process as well as the excitation of partons from the thermal medium that recoil after being kicked. Throughout the in-medium evolution, the system of jet partons and recoils, which might further re-scatter, inject energy and momentum into the QGP, producing wakes. We analyze a variety of setups, such as boson-jet systems, c-cbar systems, as well as dijet systems, at different jet transverse momenta and reconstruction radius, R. We will discuss the effect of Moliere scatterings on acoplanarity distributions, as well as on some of the most widely used groomed and ungroomed jet substructure observables. 

Given the large impact of the wakes generated by the hydrodynamic response of the medium on jet observables, as well as the presence of selection biases, finding unique signatures of the presence of the elastic scatterings is a challenging task. We will present some strategies that may be followed with a view toward enhancing and isolating the effect under consideration.

Recent results in proton-proton collisions have suggested that J/$\psi$ mesons are produced with much more jet activity than model predictions, which indicate that the amount of isolated J/$\psi$ mesons with respect to the total production cross section plays an important role in interactions between charmonia and the QGP medium. In this presentation, we present the second-order and third-order Fourier coefficients, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for prompt and nonprompt J/$\psi$, and prompt $\psi(2S)$ mesons, with reporting the $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for prompt $\psi(2S)$ mesons for the first time in heavy ion collisions. The results are discussed with theoretical calculations and discussed in terms of suppression and recombination effects. Also, we show the final results of the measurement of J/$\psi$-jets in pp and PbPb collisions.

The second order Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of Z bosons are measured to be compatible with zero, showing that Z bosons do not experience significant final-state interactions. Yields of Z bosons are compared to Glauber model predictions and are found to deviate from these expectations in peripheral collisions, indicating the presence of initial collision geometry and centrality selection effects. The precision of the measurement allows, for the first time, for a data-driven determination of the nucleon-nucleon integrated luminosity as a function of lead-lead centrality, thereby eliminating the need for its estimation based on a Glauber model. The results of the Drell-Yan process are also reported in pPb collisions at center-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV. The differential cross sections are presented in a wide dimuon mass range down to 15 GeV/$c^{2}$.

The effect of a predicted non-constant  $\eta/s(\mu_B)$ is largely unexplored in hydrodynamic simulations. Previous studies focus only on a temperature dependence[1-3] or even only a constant effective shear viscosity[4]. This work addresses this issue by studying qualitatively the effect of a generalized $\eta/s(T,\mu_B)$ in the novel hybrid approach SMASH-vHLLE, composed of the hadronic transport approach SMASH[5] and the (3+1)d viscous hydrodynamic code vHLLE[6]. In order to reduce the bias of the result on the equation of state used in the hydrodynamic part of the model, $\eta/s$ is parameterized directly in the energy density and baryon number density.  The parameterization takes into account the constraints of matching to the transport coefficients in the hadronic phase[7], as well as of recent Bayesian analysis results. This work compares the impact of the density dependence for different system sizes and energies and constrains the behaviour of $\eta/s(T,\mu_B)$ by ruling out regions of the parameter space. This is achieved by comparing the observables with experimental results in the RHIC - BES region $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 4.3 - 17.3 GeV, as the effect of this generalisation is especially relevant for intermediate collision energies, for which the system is in equilibrium for a relevant amount of time, but the net baryochemical potential does not vanish.

However, even the state-of-the-art phenomenological models which can correctly explain spectra and anisotropic flows of charged hadrons underpredict yield and elliptic flow of photons [1]. It is known as ‚Äúphoton puzzle‚Äù. 

Here, we propose photon emission at hadronization as a possible resolution to the photon puzzle [2].
First, we calculate yields and collective flows of thermal photons at RHIC and the LHC, using a relativistic viscous hydrodynamical model which is combined with a hadron-based event generator, UrQMD [3]. Initial conditions are given by TRENTO. Our calculated  yields and elliptic flows of thermal photons are smaller than  those of experimental data at RHIC  and the LHC, which is consistent with the previous study [1]. 

Then, we discuss the effect of radiative hadronization on thermal photons from fluid. We find that radiative hadronization enhances both direct photon yields and elliptic flows as the same time and reproduces experimental data at RHIC and the LHC. The ratio of yield of pions produced through the radiative hadronization to that from the original recombination model at RHIC is 20 %. It means that the radiative recombination does not break the nature of quark number scaling in elliptic flow which is expected from the original recombination model [4]. On the other hand, in spite of the small contribution in hadron production, the radiative recombination process increases both the yield and collective flows of direct photon. The ratio at the LHC is 5 % which is smaller than that at RHIC. We show the detailed analyses on photon production during space-time evolution of fluid and at hadronization in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

Over the past two decades, our understanding of the QGP has evolved significantly, from measurements of nuclear modification functions of jets due to energy loss in medium to the realization of the applicability of hydrodynamics in matching the soft particle spectra. Direct photons exclude those from hadronic decays, and have proven themselves as versatile probes of the QGP. They are emitted at all stages of the evolution and can be soft but penetrating probes of the medium due to their electromagnetic nature and lack of final state interactions [1]. An important channel of photon production in jet-medium interactions is the conversion process, where a high energy quark or anti-quark is converted to a photon via a soft exchange with the medium [2]. In this talk, we present a new and modern calculation of direct photons created by the interaction of hard partons with the viscous relativistic fluid-dynamical medium. We calculate the conversion photon contribution to the total photon spectrum as well as to the photon $v_2$. We find that in the mini-jet domain of transverse momenta ($4 ‚àí 10$ GeV), jet- medium photons can contribute as much as 20% of the total photon yield with a significant portion coming from the conversion mechanism. We also explore the  potential of conversion photons as a probe of different energy loss approaches. We perform this comparison using the conversion photon spectrum from the evolving parton distributions computed with the AMY-McGill[3] and CUJET[4,5] parton energy loss formalisms.

Parallel Session T13: Electroweak probes,parallel,Thermal radiation and direct photon production in Pb-Pb and pp collisions with dielectrons in ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Goethe University Frankfurt (DE),Germany,"Electromagnetic probes such as photons and dielectrons are a unique tool to study the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. They are produced by a variety of processes during all stages of the collision with negligible final-state interactions. At low dielectron invariant mass ($m_{\rm ee}$), thermal radiation from the hot hadron gas contributes to the dielectron spectrum via decays of $\rho$ mesons, whose spectral function is sensitive to chiral-symmetry restoration. At larger $m_{\rm ee}$, thermal radiation from the QGP carries information about the early temperature of the medium. It is nevertheless dominated by a large background of correlated heavy-flavour hadron decays affected by energy loss and flow in the medium. Alternatively, the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T,ee}$) of virtual direct photons, including thermal photons at low $p_{\rm T,ee}$, can be extracted from the dielectron data together with inclusive photon measurements. In proton--proton (pp) collisions, such measurement serves as a fundamental test for perturbative QCD calculations and as a baseline for the studies in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, pp collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities have been found to exhibit interesting phenomena showing surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions. Low-mass dielectrons could provide additional information regarding the underlying physics processes in such collisions.

In this talk, the latest ALICE results on dielectron studies in Pb-Pb and pp collisions at the center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV and 13 TeV will be presented using the large data sample collected during the LHC Run 2. The results will be compared to the expected dielectron yield from known hadronic sources and predictions for thermal radiation from the medium.

They have provided unique insights into the parton energy loss and the degree of thermalization in the hot medium, but an inadequate knowledge of the hadronization processes has hampered the interpretation of experimental results. In heavy-ion collisions, charm hadron production can occur via coalescence, where charm quarks combine with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. The relative coalescence contribution is expected to be more significant for hadrons with a larger number of constituent quarks, so the modification of the baryon-to-meson ratio in heavy-ion collisions will reflect the effect of coalescence, and the effect is stronger for particles with more than three constituent quarks. Therefore, measurements of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and X(3872) production can provide important input to the understanding of coalescence. The high luminosity datasets collected by the CMS detector have been used to measure $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ and X(3872) production via $\Lambda_{c}^{+} \to p^{+} K^{-} \pi^{+}$ and $\mathrm{X}(3872) \to \mathrm{J}/\psi \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$.

Recent measurements of charm-baryon production at midrapidity in small systems show a baryon-to-meson ratio significantly higher than that in $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions, suggesting that the fragmentation of charm is not universal across different collision systems. Thus, measurements of charm-baryon production are crucial to study the charm quark hadronization in a partonic rich environment like the one produced in pp collisions at the LHC energies.

Muons from both charm and bottom hadrons are found to have significant non-zero, second- and third-order azimuthal anisotropies in Pb+Pb collisions, with larger anisotropies for muons from charm hadrons than for muons from bottom hadrons. We highlight that a precise measurement of $v_3$ for bottom is presented.
Muons from both sources are also observed to be strongly suppressed with respect to the $pp$ baseline, in a way that depends on the mass of the parent hadron at low to moderate muon $p_\mathrm{T}$.
These studies can help to determine whether collisional or radiative processes dominate the energy loss of HF quarks as they traverse the QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions. In particular, the simultaneous measurement of multiple observables for both charm

Measurements of charm-hadron production in nucleus-nucleus collisions are therefore useful to study the properties of the in-medium charm-quark energy loss via the comparison with theoretical models. Moreover, the comparison of different colliding systems provides insights in the dependency on the collision geometry. 
Models describing the heavy-flavour transport and energy loss in an hydrodynamically expanding QGP require also a precise modelling of the in-medium hadronisation of heavy quarks, which is investigated via the measurement of prompt $\mathrm{D_s^+}$ mesons and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^{+}$ baryons.

We study the connection of such hybrid EoS with the mass-radius relation of cold compact stars, including the intriguing possibility of additional families, as a consequence of the presence of an early and strong phase transition. Special emphasis is devoted to the simultaneous fulfillment of the new NICER mass and radius constraint from PSR J0740+6620 and the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817 which require the EoS to be soft at about twice saturation density and then to stiffen.

We present the first NLO study of this process in heavy-ion collisions [1], building our numerical code on the NLO calculation of Ref. [2]. Approximating the generalized parton distributions involved in this process with collinear PDFs, we quantify the NLO contributions in the cross section, show that the real part of the amplitude must not be neglected, study the nuclear quark-PDF contributions, and chart the uncertainties due to the scale choice and PDFs. We compare our calculations with ALICE, CMS and LHCb J/Psi data in Pb+Pb UPCs, exclusive J/Psi photoproduction data from HERA, and LHCb data in p+p. We show that for the y-differential cross sections the scale dependence is significant but a scale choice can be found which reproduces the UPC data both at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV collision energies. In particular, we show that the NLO gluon contribution partly cancels against the LO one in the amplitude, making the process clearly more sensitive to the nuclear quark PDFs than thought before.

We have demonstrated previously that even small energy loss effect can be observed in nuclear modification factor thanks to high precision pQCD baseline calculations in inclusive oxygen-oxygen collisions. However currently there is no pp reference measurement planned at OO collision energy (6.37TeV). Therefore in our recent work we analyzed  the reliability of several techniques for computing jet and hadron spectra at different collision energies. We computed the ratio of spectra between different pp collision energies in perturbative QCD, which can be used to construct a reference spectrum. Alternatively, it can be interpolated from measured spectra at nearby energies. We estimate the precision of both strategies for the spectra ratio relevant to the oxygen run. Finally we propose taking the ratio of OO and pp spectra at different collision energies, which cleanly separates the experimental measurement and theoretical computation.

New experimental data on Z-hadron correlation in Pb+Pb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider show, however, an enhancement of soft hadrons in the direction of both the Z and the jet.  Using a coupled linear Boltzmann transport and hydro model, we demonstrate that medium modification of partons from the initial multiple parton interaction (MPI) gives rise to a soft hadron enhancement that is uniform in azimuthal angle that can overwhelm the signal of the diffusion wake.  To make the effect of diffusion wake visible in the near-side Z-hadron correlation, we use a mixed-event procedure to subtract the contribution from MPI.

I study in detail the contributions from initial state radiation to different jet substructure observables in p+p and A+A collisions, and show how they can compromise the interpretation of these observables in heavy ion collisions in terms of medium effects. This is done with an extended version of JEWEL, in which partons emitted from the initial state parton shower interact in the background medium in the same way as final state partons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Korinna', 'last_name': 'Zapp', 'fullName': 'Zapp, Korinna', 'id': '6508411', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '6fe7565adeafb919cb2211d64959c2c0', 'db_id': 6508411, 'person_id': 6337828}"

The large uncorrelated background in central Au+Au collisions is corrected using a mixed event technique.  This enables a jet measurement extending to low $p_{\text{T}}$ and large $R_{\text{jet}}$ with well-controlled systematic uncertainties, which are of particular importance in searching for jet scattering effects.

"Parallel Session T10: Baryon rich matter, neutron stars, and gravitational waves",parallel,Gravitational Waves Probing Quark Matter Crossover,"Fukushima, Kenji",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"**Crossover Scenario**
If there were a first-order phase transition, some signatures could be expected, but the most challenging is an experimental confirmation of realistic crossover scenario.  It is already known from the NS observations / pQCD calculations that a crossover transition to quark matter is likely to occur around 3-5 times normal nuclear density, where a slope parameter on the energy-pressure plane exhibits a significant change.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the relevant density is too high even in cores of heavy NSs.

**Gravitational Waves Signal**
We will discuss prospects of gravitational waves to distinguish the EoSs with/without not a first-order but a crossover transition to quark matter.  To this end, we will emphasize the importance of multiple observations as follows.

[*Inspiral Stage*]
So far, we still have to wait for the post-merger signals, and it is crucial to make analysis to clarify what we can infer from the inspiral stage (before binary NSs merge).  We show the gravitational waves obtained from the numerical relativity to constrain the tidal deformation parameter from which we can make extrapolation of EOS to high density in a scenario with/without crossover.

[*Post-merger Stage*]
We then demonstrate the effect of crossover in the post-merger stage (after binary  NSs start merging).  We will report a prominent difference between two scenarios with/without crossover.  The life time from the merger till the collapse into a blackhole significantly depends on the softened EOS in the dense region of 4-5 times normal nuclear density.  We also quantify theoretical uncertainties from the finite-temperature extension that is parameterized by the thermal index.  We point out that it is of tremendous importance to take account of the density dependence of the thermal index.

**Conclusion**
We can make use of already available gravitational wave signal in the inspiral stage to constrain the EOS of cold and dense matter before crossover.  Since the uncertainty in this density region is sufficiently reduced (and the finite-temperature uncertainty is absent!), we can apply it to the post-merger analysis up to an hypothetical (but very likely) crossover density, which enables us to probe the crossover from the life time after the merger, which has been quantified by our simulations of the numerical relativity with the most realistic EOS.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenji', 'last_name': 'Fukushima', 'fullName': 'Fukushima, Kenji', 'id': '6508740', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '74a302a970a5cdf95b4b50c8441fdb67', 'db_id': 6508740, 'person_id': 6302757}"

The global spin alignment of vector mesons, quantified by the $00^{th}$ element of spin density matrix ($\rho_{00}$), can offer information on the spin-orbital interactions of the QCD medium. Surprisingly large signal of vector meson $\rho_{00}$ compared to hyperon spin polarization poses challenges to the conventional theoretical understanding of polarization in HIC. Preliminary observations from Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) of large deviations of $\rho_{00}$ from 1/3 for $\phi$ mesons can only be explained by introducing the vector meson strong force fields.

In this talk, we will present transverse momentum and collision centrality dependence of  $\phi$, $K^{*0}$, $\overline{K^{*0}}$, $K^{*+}$, and $K^{*-}$ vector mesons using recent high statistics Beam Energy Scan (BES-II) data of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 - 27 GeV, and isobar collisions (Zr+Zr and Ru+Ru) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

When considering heavy-ion collisions, quarkonium polarization could also be used to investigate the characteristics of the hot and dense medium (quark-gluon plasma) created at LHC energies. In ALICE, this observable was extracted for the first time in Pb-Pb collisions and a significant difference with respect to a corresponding pp measurement  of LHCb was found. This discrepancy could be related to the modification of the J/$\psi$ feed down fractions, due to the suppression of the excited states in the QGP, but also to the contribution of the regenerated J/$\psi$ in the low $p_{\rm{T}}$ region. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that quarkonium states could be polarized by the strong magnetic field, generated in the early phase of the evolution of the system, and by the large angular momentum of the medium in non-central heavy-ion collisions. This kind of information can be assessed by defining an ad hoc reference frame where the quantization axis is orthogonal to the event plane of the collision.
In this contribution, the new result of J/$\psi$ polarization with respect to the event-plane in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential measurement is performed at forward rapidity (2.5 $<$ y $<$ 4) and the results will be shown for different centrality classes.

Parallel Session T16: Light nuclei production,parallel,Properties and production of hypernuclei in relativistic ion reactions,"Botvina, Alexander",Univ. Frankfurt,Unknown,"The study of hypernuclei and their production mechanisms open new opportunities for nuclear/particle physics and astrophysics. The hyperons influence many nuclear properties in finite nuclei and in neutron stars (infinite nuclear matter). We review the main processes leading to the production of hypernuclei in nuclear reactions including relativistic ion collisions. Such deep-inelastic high-energy interactions do lead to fragmentation and multifragmentation of nuclear matter, and hyper-fragments can be abundantly produced [1,2]. The binding energies of hyperons influence the hypernuclei formation [3,4] and this gives a chance to evaluate experimentally the hyperon effects in nuclear matter. The promising process for such a hypernuclear research is a disintegration of  large excited hyper-nuclear residues produced in peripheral relativistic  nucleus-nucleus collisions. In central collisions, there is another mechanism  responsible for combining hyperons and other baryons into light clusters [5]:   The primary nuclear clusters can be formed at the subnuclear densities from  the dynamically produced baryons. These clusters are excited and their  subsequent decay is able to explain all phenomena of the fragment production  observed in central heavy-ion collisions. Our approach is able to describe  the FOPI experimental data, in particular, nuclei yields, nuclei kinetic energies, and the modification of the nuclear isotope yields with increasing the beam energy. Previously, it was not reachable with other models. Also our mechanism can lead to the correlations of the produced nuclear species and to unstable hypernuclear states. We use the transport, coalescence and statistical models to describe the whole process, and demonstrate the important regularities of the hypernuclei formation and the advantages of such reactions over the traditional hypernuclear methods: A broad distribution of predicted hypernuclei in masses and isospin allows for investigating properties of exotic hypernuclei. We point at the abundant production of multi-strange nuclei that will give an access to multi-hyperon systems and strange nuclear matter. The realistic estimates of hypernuclei yields in various collisions are presented.

Parallel Session T06: Lattice QCD and heavy-ion collisions,parallel,Computing jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in lattice QCD,"Kumar, Amit",Wayne State University,United States,"The jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ is the leading coefficient that characterizes the transverse broadening of the hard parton traversing QGP. The transverse kicks received from the medium changes the off-shellness of the hard parton, which leads to enhancement in the gluon emissions. Since the transverse broadening is the dominant mechanism responsible for the suppression of the high-transverse momentum charged-hadrons and jets, understanding the temperature and parton‚Äôs momenta dependence of $\hat{q}$ are crucial. 
In this talk, we present for the first time a lattice QCD calculation of $\hat{q}$ in pure gluonic plasma and  $n_{f}=3$ QCD plasma. In this formalism[1,2,3], we considered a light-like hard quark undergoing a single scattering with the plasma. $\hat{q}$ is factorized and expressed in terms of matrix elements for transverse broadening and field-strength field-strength correlator. The presence of the hard scale allows one to carry out Taylor expansion of the correlator after the analytic continuation to deep-Euclidean region. The leading twist operator in the operator-product expansion is computed on both quenched and unquenched lattices for a wide range of temperatures, ranging from 200MeV < T < 1GeV. The lattice extracted $\hat{q}$ from our formalism is compared with the existing (non) perturbative calculations and phenomenology-based extractions of $\hat{q}$. The computed $\hat{q}$ shows a temperature dependence similar to the entropy density and shows considerable agreement with phenomenology-based extractions carried out by the JET and JETSCAPE collaboration.

Our method can be seen as a combination of the Taylor expansion and analytic continuation approaches. Its novelty lies in using rational (Pad√©) approximants for studying Lee Yang edge singularities, which provide valuable insights to the occur- rence of critical phenomena in the thermodynamic limit. Several numerical experiments have been performed to test and demonstrate its accuracy and stability.
We present a calculations of the densities of conserved charges as well as chiral condensates as a function of imaginary baryon number chemical potential, obtained with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) at temporal lattice extent of $N_\tau=4,6,8$. We construct various rational function approximations of the lattice data and discuss how the closest singularities in the complex plane can be determined from them. We confirm stability of our results under conformal mappings. We discuss the universal scaling behavior of the Lee-Yang edge singularity and its role as a brunch-cut singularity in the order parameter. We apply the scaling in the vicinity of the Roberge-Weiss and chiral phase transitions. We find a temperature scaling that is in accordance with the expected power law behavior and determine some previously unknown non-universal constants. Finally we discuss the possibility to detect also the QCD critical end-point, if it exists, by this new method.

While technically our model can be regarded as a generalization of the Dual Parton Model by Capella and Tran Thanh Van, it is fundamentally based on the number of exchanged color octets (gluons) and significantly extends the Fock space of states available for the participating protons and nucleons. 

In proton-proton collisions we provide an *exact* description of the final state proton and neutron spectrum. What is remarkable is that unlike the original DPM, GEM successfully describes the proton ""diffractive peak"" at high rapidity. 

In proton-nucleus reactions we propose a statistical scheme for the process of soft color octet (gluon) exchange, based on the assumption that probabilities to form an effective diquark are equal for all allowed pairs of quarks. The latter effective diquark can form either from two valence, one valence and one sea, or from two sea quarks. Consequently we calculate the probabilities for different color configurations involving diquarks of valence-valence, valence-sea and sea-sea type. These probabilities appear to depend on the number of exchanged gluons, which results in increasing baryon stopping as a function of the number $N$ of proton-nucleon collisions in the nucleus. As such, the baryon nuclear stopping power appears to be governed by the emergence of new color configurations as a function of $N$ rather than by the energy loss of the original valence diquark.

The advantage of our approach lies in its high predictive power which makes it verifiable by the new, precise data on proton and neutron production from the CERN SPS. The latter verification, a set of predictions for the $N$-dependence of the baryon stopping process, and a discussion of implications for proton-oxygen collisions planned at the LHC, will be included in the talk.

By combining analytical insights in the few interactions limit with numerical simulations at higher opacity, we are able to describe the development of transverse flow from very small to very large opacities, realised in small and large collision systems. Surpisingly, we find that deviations between kinetic theory and hydrodynamics persist even in the limit of very large interaction rates, which can be attributed to the presence of the early pre-equilibrium phase. We discuss implications for the phenomenological description of heavy-ion collisions and the applicability of viscous hydrodynamics to describe small and large collision systems.

This fundamental information is a crucial input for models describing the initial state of heavy ion collisions. In particular the event-by-event fluctuating proton geometry should have a strong effect on the flow and multiplicity distribution in high multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions [1], assuming that a strongly interacting medium is formed in these events. Understanding the subnucleon structure to a high degree of precision is thus a prerequisite of determining whether quark gluon plasma is created in small system collisions. 

In order to extract the proton shape fluctuations (see [2]) from HERA exclusive vector meson production data in a statistically rigorous manner, we apply Bayesian inference[3]. This approach enables us to extract likelihood distributions for the non-perturbative parameters describing the proton fluctuating profile, including their correlations. The resulting posterior distributions allow for a systematic propagation of uncertainties when simulating for example high-multiplicity proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions. 

We determine how accurately the HERA data can constrain the proton fluctuating shape, and illustrate how high multiplicity proton-proton collisions can provide complementary input to exclusive scattering data.

This makes it impossible to consistently model relativistic gases using energy dependent relaxation times or more general choices of the local equilibrium state. We propose a new relaxation time approximation which fixes these fundamental flaws [2]. In this contribution, this new formulation is used to consistently calculate the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients using QCD-inspired energy-dependent relaxation times [3] and phenomenological thermal masses obtained from fits to lattice QCD thermodynamics [4].

The ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù mechanism is the well-studied phenomenological description of its approaching to thermal equilibrium, but has been restricted to leading order coupling within kinetic theory calculation. In our recent work, we provide a next-to-leading-order (NLO) weak-coupling description of the thermalization process of far-from-equilibrium non-abelian plasmas. Starting from either over- or under-occupied initial conditions, we follow their time evolution towards thermal equilibrium by numerically solving the QCD effective kinetic equation at NLO accuracy for isotropic non-abelian plasmas . It turns out that the NLO corrections remain well under control for a wide range of couplings and that the overall effect of NLO corrections is to reduce the time needed to reach thermal equilibrium in the systems considered.

To accomplish  this purpose, a comprehensive upgrade of the detector and associated systems was devised and planned to be carried out in two phases. The Phase-I upgrade program foresees new features for the muon detector, for the electromagnetic calorimeter  trigger  system and for all trigger and data acquisition chain. These upgrades are expected to be fully functional in 2021 and will enable ATLAS to carry on its physics program at a two fold increased luminosity. For the heavy-ions program, a new Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) with improved radiation hardness will be installed. Upon reaching an integrated luminosity of 350 fb-1,  the LHC will undergo a new upgrade, becoming the High-Luminosity LHC (Hl_LHC). The HL-LHC will reach an instantaneous ultimate luminosity of 7.5x1034 cm-2s-1,  which will enable the experiments to accumulate  4 ab-1 of integrated luminosity in about 10 years of operation. The challenges the ATLAS  experiment will face during the HL-LHC  stage are paramount, as it will have to cope with more than 200 simultaneous collisions per bunch crossing with many subsystems exposed to very high radiation levels.  To preserve its performance, the ATLAS detector will require  a major upgrade program, known as Phase-II upgrade program. During the  Phase-II upgrade, a completely new all-silicon tracker with extended rapidity coverage will replace the current inner tracker detector; the calorimeters and muon systems will have their trigger and data acquisition systems fully redesigned, allowing the implementation of a free-running  readout system. Finally, a new subsystem called High Granularity Timing Detector will aid the track-vertex association in the forward region by incorporating timing information to the reconstructed tracks.

Dileptons as penetrating probes are messengers of this dense medium and can reveal the thermal properties and the lifetime of the medium but also give insight into meson properties at high densities.

The upgraded RICH detector offers excellent electron identification and suppression of conversion-pairs resulting in a signal-to-background ratio larger than 1 for $M_{e^+e^-}>500 MeV/c^2$. The high statistics data sample in combination with a strongly increased electron detection effciency and background suppression allow for a differential analysis in terms of centrality or electron-pair-momentum with a signal up to the phi meson mass region. For higher pair-momenta a signal of the omega meson is clearly seen while vanishing for lower pair-momenta. The temperature extracted from the intermediate mass region compares well with the HADES measurement in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.42 \, GeV$.

While recent studies have obtained non-perturbative contributions to the collisional broadening kernel $C(b_{\bot})$ using lattice simulation of the dimensionally reduced long-distance effective theory of QCD, Electrostatic QCD (EQCD) [1], so far all phenomenological calculations of jet quenching rely on perturbative determinations of the collisional broadening kernel. By matching the short-distance behavior of the lattice extracted EQCD broadening kernel [2], we determine the fully matched QCD broadening kernel non-perturbatively. We present results for the collisional broadening kernel in impact-parameter ($C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{b}_\perp)$) and momentum space ($C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{q}_\perp)$) and employ them to determine the rates of medium induced radiation in infinite and finite size QCD plasmas [3]. By contrasting our results with leading and next-to-leading order perturbative determinations as well as various approximations of the splitting rates employed in the literature, we investigate the effect of the non-peturbative determination of  $C_{\rm QCD}(\bf{q}_\perp)$ on medium-induced radiation rates.

We demonstrate that inclusion of even a small mass scale in units of the system‚Äôs local temperature drastically alters the well-known attractor behavior of the shear Reynolds number as observed in a weakly-coupled gas with exactly massless excitations. For generic nonzero particle mass, neither shear nor bulk viscous pressure relaxes to a far-from-equilibrium attractor; universal hydrodynamic behavior is manifest only at small values of the inverse Reynolds numbers. In kinetic theory, we find that the scaled longitudinal pressure exhibits fast decay to an early-time attractor, driven by the rapid longitudinal expansion of the medium [1]. Second-order dissipative hydrodynamics, based on a gradient expansion around local thermal equilibrium, fails to accurately describe the attractor. These results will be discussed in the light of fixed lines and fixed points of non-conformal kinetic theory and hydrodynamics.

We use a Colour Glass Condensate approach, and perform an expansion in $\tau$. We show that the expansion to order $\tau^6$ can be trusted to about $\tau=0.05$ fm/c. We calculate the transverse and longitudinal pressures and show that for $\tau \lt 0.05$ fm/c they move towards their equilibrium values of one third of the energy density. We study the spatial eccentricity of the plasma, and the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal momentum distribution. Our results for the Fourier coefficients are larger than  expected, which contradicts the usual assumption that anisotropy is mostly generated during the hydrodynamic evolution of the plasma. We  find a significant correlation between the elliptic flow coefficient and the eccentricity, which indicates that the spatial inhomogeneity introduced by the initial geometry is effectively transmitted to the azimuthal distribution of the gluon momentum field, even at very early times. This result is interesting because correlations of this kind are  characteristic of the onset of hydrodynamic behaviour. We also calculate the angular momentum of the glasma and obtain results that are many orders of magnitude smaller than the initial angular momentum of two ions colliding with non-zero impact parameter. This indicates that most of the angular momentum carried by the valence quarks is not transmitted to the glasma.

Theoretical calculations predict that radiative energy loss, which is the dominant mode of energy loss for gluons and light quarks in the QGP, is suppressed for heavy quarks (such as charm and bottom) at low transverse momenta ($p_{\text{T}}$). A measurement of the $D^0 (c\bar{u})$ meson radial profile in jets from the CMS experiment at the LHC hints at its modification at low $D^0$ $p_{\text{T}}$ in heavy-ion collisions, which is qualitatively different from that of the inclusive hadrons. The excellent secondary vertex resolution provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker in the STAR experiment at RHIC enables reconstruction of $D^0$ mesons at low $p_{\text{T}}$ with high significance, making STAR ideal for similar measurements.

We generalize a previously constructed partonic $T$-matrix approach to finite chemical potential to calculate various susceptibilities, in particular for configurations containing a heavy charm quark. At vanishing chemical potential and moderate temperatures, this approach predicts large collisional widths of partons generated by dynamically formed hadronic resonance states which lead to transport parameters characteristic for a strongly coupled system. The quark chemical potential dependence is implemented into the propagators and the in-medium color potential, where two newly introduced parameters for the thermal and screening masses are fixed through a fit to the baryon number susceptibility, $\chi^B_2$. With this setup, we calculate heavy-light susceptibilities without further tuning; the results qualitatively agree with the lattice-QCD (lQCD) data for both $\chi^{uc}_{11}$ and $\chi^{uc}_{22}$. This implies that the lQCD results are compatible with a significant content of broad $D$-meson and charm-light diquark bound states in a moderately hot QGP.

This poses strong limitations not only to the search of molecular states composed of charm and non-charm hadrons, but also to the study of the rescattering of charm mesons following their formation in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In such collisions a colour-deconfined medium, called quark-gluon plasma (QGP), is formed. The system experiences a hydrodynamic expansion cooling down up to the chemical freeze-out, which is followed by a hadronic phase. The knowledge of the scattering parameters of charm hadrons with non-charm hadrons would be a crucial ingredient for models based on charm-quark transport in a hydrodynamically expanding QGP to describe the typical observables of heavy-ion collisions. 

In this talk we will report on the first estimation of the scattering parameters governing the strong interaction of the D-proton channel measured by the ALICE Collaboration in high-multiplicity pp collision at $\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV at the LHC. The strong interaction is studied by means of correlation in momentum space and the analysis is extended to D-kaon and D-pion combinations.

This talk presents new, comprehensive and precision measurements of $v_n-[p_\mathrm{T}]$ correlation in $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe and $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb collisions for harmonics $n = 2$, 3, and 4.  The results are obtained via the standard and subevents cumulant methods to assess the role of non-flow and flow decorrelations in these observables, and they are found to be small in the mid-central and central collisions in these systems.  All PCC coefficients, $\rho_2$, $\rho_3$ and $\rho_4$ show rich and non-monotonic dependence on centrality, $p_\mathrm{T}$ and $\eta$, reflecting the fact that different ingredients of the initial state impact different regions of the phase space. For example, it was found the result depends on the centrality estimator used in the analysis, indicating a strong influence of volume fluctuations. On the other hand, the ratio of $\rho_2$ between the two systems is less sensitive to the centrality estimator, and in the ultra-central region, the value of the ratio suggests that $^{129}$Xe has large quadrupole deformation but with a significant triaxial. All current models fail to describe many of the observed trends in the data, pointing to the unprecedented constraining power enabled by this precision measurement.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Somadutta', 'last_name': 'Bhatta', 'fullName': 'Bhatta, Somadutta', 'id': '6580490', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University (US)', 'emailHash': '3f48a935c036f20fc74d145d39711304', 'db_id': 6580490, 'person_id': 6334522}"

In particular, the flow vectors at two different transverse momenta fluctuate with respect to each other. One way to probe this flow fluctuation is to study the decorrelation between the flow at two different momentum bins. However, the flow vector decorrelation 
    can occur as a combined effect of flow magnitude fluctuation and flow angle (flow direction) fluctuation. Thus, these flow fluctuations can be mapped using the flow factorization breaking coefficient. Moreover, the  factorization breaking coefficient for  second moments of flow vectors can be constructed. This additional observables allow to measure separately  the flow magnitude and the flow angle decorrelation. Following the preliminary data from ALICE, we study the correlation between the harmonic flow squared, where one of the flow is fixed at a transverse momenta and the other is averaged over the momentum range (global flow). As a result of the factorization, the independent measurement of the flow vector correlation and flow magnitude correlation can lead to the possible extraction of flow angle correlation. Our model results are compared to the data. We also study the momentum dependent correlation between mixed flow harmonics and present possible predictions, which

Parallel Session T07: Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Charmed hadron interactions and correlation functions,"Ohnishi, Akira",Kyoto University,Unknown,"Charmed hadron interactions are very important in current exotic hadron physics. For example, charmed pentaquark state ($P_c$) appears around the $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^{(*)}$ thresholds, and then $P_c$'s are suggested to be hadron molecules caused by the attraction between $\Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^{(*)}$. While it is difficult to perform charmed hadron scattering, recent femtoscopic studies allows us to get information on charmed hadron interactions. Since the correlation function $C(q)$ is given as the convolution of the source function and the wave function squared, $C(q)$ tells us how much the wave function is enhanced or suppressed from the free case provided that the source function is known. 

In this presentation, we discuss the charmed hadron interactions and correlation functions [1]. Specifically, we consider $pD^{\pm}$, $DD^{*}$ and $D\bar{D}^{*}$ pairs, which are related to the (singly) charmed pentaquark state, $T_{cc}$, and $X(3872)$, respectively. As the first step, we use one-range Gaussian potentials whose strength are determined to reproduce the scattering lengths in theoretical models ($DN$ and $\bar{D}N$) or the binding energies ($DD^*$ and $D\bar{D}^*$). The calculated correlation functions show significant dependence on the interactions and the source size. Thus measurement of these correlation functions will judge theoretical models and the molecule picture of exotic hadrons.

Parallel Session T07: Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Longitudinal Decorrelation Measurements from $pp$ to A+A with the ATLAS detector,"Seidlitz, Blair Daniel",University of Colorado Boulder (US),USA,"This talk presents a new measurement of longitudinal decorrelation in $pp$ collisions with ATLAS.  It is expected that the deposited energy in the transverse ($x,y$) plane varies, depending on the longitudinal ($z$) slice examined, which is correlated with the rapidity of the produced particles.   Thus, particles from different rapidity slices will have flow vectors that differ in magnitude and orientation due to the longitudinal variation, longitudinal decorrelation, which grows with increasing particle rapidity separation.   For flow harmonic $n$, such longitudinal decorrelations have been characterized, for large systems, in terms of $r_{n}$, the ratio of large-rapidity-gap to small-rapidity-gap correlations. This analysis performs the first measurements of $r_n$ in $pp$ collisions at 5~TeV and 13~TeV. The analysis is carried out via a two-particle correlation method, utilizing charged tracks of varying $\eta$ within $|\eta| < 2.5$ and topo-clusters of $4.0<|\eta_\text{ref}|<4.9$. Because non-flow effects are more significant in $pp$ collisions, non-flow template subtraction procedures are applied. Final results are quoted for $r_{2}$ and its slope $F_{2}$, over a range of multiplicities. Similar non-flow subtraction techniques are applied to the full multiplicity range of Xe+Xe collision data and the results are compared to the two $pp$ energies at appropriate multiplicities.

The experimental data of the STAR and ALICE Collaborations are consistent at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \geq 20$ GeV with simultaneous effects of global baryon number conservation and repulsive interactions in baryon sector, the magnitude of the latter being in line with the behavior of baryon number susceptibilities observed in lattice QCD. The STAR and HADES data at lower collision energies show indications for notable multi-particle correlations, which can indicate sizable attractive interactions among baryons due to the QCD critical point in baryon-rich region as well as the influence of volume fluctuations.

We compare the asymptotics from the opacity expansion to a recent twist-4 derivation of $\langle p_\perp^2\rangle$ and find a qualitative disagreement: the twist-4 derivation predicts a jet broadening while the opacity expansion method predicts a narrowing.

for the existence of the so-called critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase diagram. Lattice QCD
calculations at smaller than physical quark masses, combined with our model based understanding of 
the QCD phase diagram, suggest that this critical point, if it exists, needs to be searched for at
temperatures below $T\sim 140~$MeV. Following the rather small decrease of the QCD pseudo-critical 
temperature with increasing baryon chemical potentials ($\mu_B$), it is expected that such low 
temperatures will only be reached for $\mu_B\ge 400~$MeV. These large values of $\mu_B$ and low 
temperatures are reached at freeze-out in heavy ion collisions only for beam energies less than 10 GeV.

In this low temperature, high density regime studies of QCD thermodynamics with straightforward 
Taylor expansions are likely to fail. We extend our Taylor series expansion down to temperatures of
125~MeV and use the high statistics results for conserved charge cumulants up to 8th order, obtained 
by the HotQCD collaboration, to resum Taylor expansions of the logarithm of the QCD partition function.
We will construct resumed results for cumulants of conserved charge fluctuations at low temperature and 
high density and show that the diagonal Pade-approximants for 8th order Taylor series in all three conserved 
charge chemical potentials can have real poles, signaling the occurrence of a phase transition, only at 
temperatures below 140 MeV. This gives further support for a CEP at low temperatures. 
 
We will use these Taylor expansions and their Pade resummations for a determination of freeze-out conditions 
through QCD calculations of the mean, variance as well as the ratio of mean and variance of conserved charge 
fluctuations. We compare these calculations with experimental determinations of freeze-out parameters obtained
