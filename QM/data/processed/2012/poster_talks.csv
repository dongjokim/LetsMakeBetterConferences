Poster Session Reception,poster,A Technique for Charm and Beauty Separation via DCA Unfolding,"McCumber, Michael",University of Colorado,USA,"The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider recently took data in p+p and Au+Au collisions with a new silicon vertex detector (VTX). This upgrade detector is capable of measuring the off-vertex decay of heavy flavor decay electrons via distance of closest approach (DCA). The resulting measured DCA distributions will be a convolution of the parent meson momenta, decay lifetimes, and yields, combined with detector irresolution and backgrounds. We will describe an algorithm to unfold the full set of DCA distributions as a function of p_{T}, thereby allowing improved extraction of the charm and beauty yields. The progress for applying this technique to the heavy ion collision VTX data set will also be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'McCumber', 'fullName': 'McCumber, Michael', 'id': '315160', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado', 'emailHash': 'c18108762206aebb96e95603616ba470', 'db_id': 315160, 'person_id': 343253}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,"Fourth order corrections to the MV model, multiplicity distributions and KNO scaling","Petreska, Elena",Graduate Center/Baruch College CUNY,Unknown,"A scaling law for the multiplicity distribution in high-energy hadronic collisions has been proposed by Koba, Nielsen, and Olesen (KNO). Experiments at the LHC observed that multiplicities in the central region of proton-proton collisions follow a negative binomial distribution and that they do exhibit KNO scaling. The negative binomial distribution has been theoretically reproduced in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism with a Gaussian (McLerran-Venugopalan) action. We derive corrections to the MV model up to fourth order in the density of color charges (rho^4) and investigate their implication on the multiplicity distribution and on KNO scaling. We find that KNO scaling constrains the deviation of the small-x effective action from a Gaussian.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Elena', 'last_name': 'Petreska', 'fullName': 'Petreska, Elena', 'id': '315441', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Center/Baruch College CUNY', 'emailHash': '4c35039954787d18bd923d0544e04744', 'db_id': 315441, 'person_id': 343901}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,"Critical fluctuations of the higher moments of order parameter and energy from 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models","Wu, Yuanfang","Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, Wuhan, China",Unknown,"Higher moments of net-baryon are suggested to be sensitive probe of QCD critical end point [1] in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Their critical fluctuations are highly interesting and instructive for the exploration of QCD phase diagram from both theoretical and experimental sides. 
     According to the universality of critical behavior, the QCD critical end point, and the chiral phase transition in two-flavor QCD are argued to be the same universality class of 3 dimensional Ising model [2], and O(2), or O(4) model[3], respectively. The generic structures of net-baryon fluctuations at QCD critical end point and chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential can be discussed by the order-parameter fluctuations in Ising model and the energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) model [4,5]. So in the present work, the higher moments of order parameter and energy from 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models near the critical temperature at finite size are systematically studied, and compared with those obtained from effective models, and Lattice QCD calculations.   
     It is found that the generic structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models are similar. So do energy fluctuations. On the other hand, the singular structures of order parameter fluctuations appear at lower moments, e.g., the oscillation structures of 4th moment of order parameter, which may reflect the generic structure of 4th order moment of baryon number in the vicinity of critical end point, are similar to the 3rd moments of energy, which corresponding to the 6th moment of net-baryon number at chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential. This means that even higher moments, such as 6th moments of net-baryon number, are necessary in probing the chiral phase transition temperature, the same as what suggested in ref. [5].
     The generic singular structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising and energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) models are qualitatively consistent with corresponding estimations of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [6], Linear Sigma model [7], Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [8], Polyakov Quark Meson models [9], and current lattice QCD calculations [10].

Poster Session Reception,poster,Directed flow at midrapidity at the LHC,"Retinskaya, Ekaterina",IPhT Saclay,Unknown,"We present the first extraction of the recently-proposed rapidity-even directed flow observable v1, obtained from an analysis of published two-particle correlation data from the ALICE Collaboration. An accounting of the correlation due to the conservation of transverse momentum restores the factorization seen in all other Fourier harmonics and thus indicates that the remaining correlation gives a reliable measurement of directed flow. We also present results from the first viscous hydrodynamic calculation of directed flow, and show that it is less sensitive to viscosity than higher harmonics. This allows for a direct extraction of the dipole asymmetry of the initial state, providing a strict constraint on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the early-time system.

The flow characteristics are intimately related to the equation of state of the thermally equilibrated matter created in these collisions through the speed of sound. Using either the Bjorken or Landau hydrodynamics or a combination thereof it is possible to relate the
particle yields to the speed of sound. Here we study the flow properties using the equation of state from an effective model and discuss the possible distinctive signatures at low densities and high temperature relevant for LHC and at high densities and low temperatures relevant for FAIR.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Measurement of omega->3pi in pp collision at 7TeV with ALICE,"Yano, Satoshi",Hiroshima University (JP),Japan,"The $\omega$ meson is a promising probe to investigate the properties of the QGP. It is well known that the yield of high-p_t particles is suppressed in nucleus-nucleus collisions relative to that in pp collisions.
The effect is attributed to the energy loss of the energetic parent partons traversing the created medium.
Since $\pi^0$ and $\omega$ mesons have the same quark content (u and d), the comparison of the suppression between $\pi^$ and $\omega$ can provide 
information whether the energy loss occurs at the parton level or not.

The ALICE detector covers a wide central region (|\eta|<0.9) to reconstruct charged particles and has two electro-magnetic calorimeters with good energy resolution. The $\omega$ meson is reconstructed in the $\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$ channel in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV over a wide p_t range  This is faciliated by a high-photon energy trigger.

Thermal photons have a negligible cross-section with the medium and so pass through unmodified, thus measuring their properties gives access to the entire time evolution of the fireball.  Thermal photons are expected to be observable at low momentum. They compete in yield with photons from hadron decays and, at high momentum (above roughly 4 GeV), direct photons that result from initial hard scatterings of partons in the colliding nuclei.  PHENIX has measured the yield of direct photons in Au+Au collisions, as well as the baseline measurements in p+p and d+Au.  Recently PHENIX has also measured elliptic flow of direct photons.

Most of studies have been performed with ideal hydrodynamics, but it is necessary to

 In particular, we focus on the dynamics along the collision axis and investigate how

Poster Session Reception,poster,Collective Flow of Charged Hadrons in Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC PHENIX,"Reynolds, Damian",S,United States,"The collective flow of charged hadrons emitted in heavy ion collisions can be characterized using the Fourier coefficient $v_2$ (elliptic flow), as well as with the higher order coefficients, $v_3$, $v_4$, etc, which result primarily from fluctuations in the initial conditions of the colliding nuclei.The latter is of paramount importance since it can provide insight on the hydrodynamic behavior of the medium, as well as constraints for reliable extraction of transport coefficients. For example, $v_3$ has been critical in discriminating between different models and the application of viscocity. In recent measurements, PHENIX has extracted $v_{2,3,4}$ coefficients for charged hadrons via two independent methods.
The first correlates the azimuthal distribution of particles at mid-rapidity in the central arm of PHENIX with event planes determined by the detectors widely spaced in pseudorapidity to avoid non-flow effects. 
The second method is a two particle correlation between a charge weighted azimuthal angle in the Beam Beam Counters and the azimuthal angle of a track in the central arms of the PHENIX detector. Again, the pseudorapidity gap is present to avoid non-flow effects. This method has the added benefit of not requiring that the reaction plane angle be determined. 
These coefficients, measured as a function of the number of particpating nucleons, centrality, and $p_T$ for charged hadrons, will be presented and compared to earlier measurements for Au+Au collisions at the same energy so as to see the effect of system size.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Damian', 'last_name': 'Reynolds', 'fullName': 'Reynolds, Damian', 'id': '314488', 'affiliation': 'S', 'emailHash': 'ed91141f9d4f9ac4f048ddd1c98f2a8e', 'db_id': 314488, 'person_id': 343278}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,New method for measuring longitudinal fluctuations and  directed flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions,"Eyyubova, Gyulnara",University of Oslo (NO),Unknown,"Recently significant effort is made to study azimuthal flow asymmetries in ultra-relativistic heavy ion reactions. At finite impact parameters the directed flow and the elliptic flow were dominant observables for many years.

In head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. In addition in head-on collisions the third harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, v_3, exceeds the second one, v_2, and becomes the dominant harmonic component in accordance with large fluctuations. The fact that high harmonics, measured up to v_8, survive the fluid dynamical expansion indicates that the QGP fluid is almost perfect, and does not absorb high-harmonics.

Fluctuations must also appear in the longitudinal direction, especially in peripheral reactions where the projectile and target spectators may not be exactly the same size. As a first step of our study, we estimate the Event-by-Event (EbE) c.m. rapidity fluctuations using a method based on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC)s. In peripheral reactions one can check if significant correlation between the EbE c.m. rapidities measured in the TPC and via the ZDCs do exist. This then leads to the possibility to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations.

The first v_1 measurements at LHC [2] were also arising dominantly from random fluctuations as both the even and odd rapidity combinations gave the same result. As a second step, with the aim to determine the global asymmetry component of the directed flow v_1, we propose that the participant system Event-by-Event shifted from the Lab. c.m. frame to the measurable participant c.m. rapidity EbE, thus removing or minimizing the effect of random longitudinal fluctuations. Then following the global asymmetry the ""odd"" component of the directed flow can be separated and identified using this method.

This new method [3] enables us to separate fluctuating and the global symmetry components in the flow, which is important for the odd harmonics, especially for v_1 and v_3. Thus one can study experimentally the rotation effect [4] and the possible occurrence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability [5] in the globally symmetric component of the collective flow.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Single electrons from heavy flavor decays in 200 GeV Cu+Cu collisions at PHENIX,"Apadula, Nicole",Iowa State University,Unknown,"Since heavy flavor quarks are produced early in the collision, they experience the full evolution of the medium and are thus a good probe of medium effects.  Electrons from open heavy flavor have previously been measured for p+p, Au+Au and d+Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by PHENIX.  In the most central Au+Au the yield is suppressed relative to a Ncoll scaled p+p which suggests that the heavy quarks lose a significant portion of their initial energy in the medium.  A similar analysis done in the d+Au collisions suggests that there are cold nuclear matter effects that are masked by the hot, dense medium produced in the Au+Au collisions.  New results from Cu+Cu collisions provide an important look at the Ncoll region between the d+Au and Au+Au systems.  The Cu+Cu results will be shown for different centralities along with a comparison to the d+Au and Au+Au results.  The nuclear modification factor, RAA, will also be shown as a function of Ncoll, giving a more complete picture as the cold nuclear matter effects in d+Au collisions are taken over by the effects of the hot medium in the Au+Au system.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nicole', 'last_name': 'Apadula', 'fullName': 'Apadula, Nicole', 'id': '314560', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '93d6efb205123ca0c3288dbfcf555268', 'db_id': 314560, 'person_id': 343334}"

The direct photon yield is sensitive to different production mechanisms, which dominate the expected direct photon spectra at different transverse momenta. Their production is also influenced by modifications of the initial state in heavy nuclei. Such modifications can be studied in d+Au collisions, and their understanding is crucial for interpreting heavy-ion data.

PHENIX has measured the spectra of direct photons in different collision systems and at different energies, over a broad range of transverse momentum. Photons were measured with different methods, using different subsystems, to extend the range of transverse momentum and to minimize the size of systematic uncertainties.  In p+p collisions, PHENIX has also measured isolated direct photons, as well as the fraction of direct photons from jet fragmentation.

This is often referred to as the ridge, and was found to extend to delta eta 9 units at the LHC. Using preliminary STAR data [3], we discuss methods to decompose 2D di-hadron correlations in Au+Au 200 GeV collisions on the nearside. Our analysis is performed as a function of centrality and pT. We propose a model that encompasses azimuthal flow up to 4 orders (v1, v2, v3, and v4). The remainder of the correlation function is modeled via an asymmetric 2d Gaussian, which we refer to as non-flow. We find our model describes the data very well. The extracted flow parameters are compared to model predictions [4,5]. We investigate possible scalings for the Gaussian remainder, and compare it's properties to a similar structure observed in p+p 200 GeV collisions. These findings will help us shed on the production mechanism of the remainder. Finally, we will provide an estimate of the ratio of non-flow to flow as a function of centrality and pT, which will aid a variety of other flow studies at these energies.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Direct photon capabilities of the proposed MPC-EX detector at PHENIX,"Campbell, Sarah",I,Unknown,"The proposed MPC-EX detector is a Si-W preshower extension to PHENIX's existing Muon Piston Calorimeter (MPC).   The MPC-EX consists of eight layers of alternating W absorber and Si mini-pad sensors.  Located at large rapidities, 3.1 < |$\eta$| < 3.8, the MPC-EX and MPC access low-x partons in the Au nucleus in d+Au collisions.  With the addition of the MPC-EX, the neutral pion reconstruction range extends to energies > 80 GeV, a factor of four improvement over current capabilities.  Not only will the MPC-EX strengthen PHENIX's existing forward $\pi^0$ and jet measurements, it also provides the necessary $\pi^0$ rejection to make a direct photon measurement feasible.  With this $\pi^0$ rejection, direct photon yields at high $p_{T}$, $p_{T}$ > 3 GeV, can be statistically extracted using a double ratio method.  The direct photon $R_{dAu}$ measured with the MPC-EX will quantify the level of gluon shadowing or saturation in the Au nucleus at low-x, x ~ 10^-3, with a projected systematic error band a factor of four smaller than EPS09’s current allowable range.  Direct photons at forward rapidities are optimally sensitive to the gluon distribution because, unlike pions, direct photons are only produced by processes that are directly sensitive to the gluon distribution at leading order.  A measurement of the forward direct photon $R_{dA}$ will cleanly access and greatly expand our understanding of the gluon nuclear parton distribution functions and provide important information about the initial state in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sarah', 'last_name': 'Campbell', 'fullName': 'Campbell, Sarah', 'id': '314274', 'affiliation': 'I', 'emailHash': '9f2b38a6a844c823e59cb40d6fb770ac', 'db_id': 314274, 'person_id': 343110}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distributions of photons at forward rapidity in STAR at RHIC energies,"Solanki, Dronika",University of rajasthan,Unknown,"The main goal of the STAR experiment at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is to study the properties of the QCD matter at extremely high energy density and parton density, created in the heavy ion collisions. Photons are produced at all stages of the colliding system and through decay of produced particles like neutral pions. The multiplicity measurement of photons on an event-by-event basis is an important measurement complementing the charged particle measurement in a heavy ion collision. Inclusive photon production at forward rapidity shows an energy-independent longitudinal scaling as observed at √sNN = 62.4 and 200 GeV [1,2]. Photons measurements at lower energies will be helpful in further testing the energy dependence of the longitudinal scaling.   
         The Photon Multiplicity Detector in the STAR experiment measures inclusive photons in the pseudo-rapidity region −3.7 < η < −2.3. We will present the multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distributions of photons in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 39 and 19.6 GeV for different event centralities.  These measurements will be compared with published results at √sNN = 200 and 62.4 GeV and with models.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Harmonious Harmonics? After the common origin of correlations and flow.,"Moschelli, George",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"We show that initial state fluctuations in concert with later-stage hydrodynamic flow describes a range of observables including both even and odd flow harmonics, the ridge, and multiplicity, momentum and flow fluctuations [1]. This is the first comparison between multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations and flow fluctuations in the same framework. The simultaneous investigation of these observables allows us to study the interplay of correlations induced by collision geometry and common points of production. We employ a framework of initial state Glasma flux tubes followed by later stage hydrodynamic flow modeled in a blast wave. Our approach has the advantage that we can test our calculations over a broad range of collision systems and energies and provide useful benchmarks for more rigorous event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. Our survey over these observables reveals a common energy and centrality dependence that we attribute to the production mechanism. Glasma calculations are consistent with this dependence [2,3].

At low $p_T$ soft processes dominate whereas hard processes dominate at higher $p_T$.  Experimental data has shown drastic change from d+Au to Au+Au collision in $p_T$ spectra, collective phenomena, and baryon/meson ratio at intermediate $p_T$.  This indicates that the relative mixture of particles produced by hard and soft processes differ between Au+Au and d+Au at a given, relatively low $p_T$ (< 2.0GeV).  It is therefore expected that the dihadron correlations will differ between d+Au and Au+Au with relatively low trigger particle $p_T$.  In this talk we present the near-side jet-like correlations in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV by STAR.  The jet-like results are obtained by the difference of small and large \Delta\eta correlations. We report the findings as a function of trigger and associated particle $p_T$, collision centrality, and Event Plane trigger orientation.  We find the $/sqrt{S_{NN}}=200$GeV d+Au and Au+Au near-side correlations to be identical even at trigger $p_T$ as low as 1.5 GeV/c.  The AMPT and HIJING models do not describe the data.

Hadrons are created at the freeze-out of this fluid, thus their distributions reveal information about the final state. To access the time evolution and the initial state, one needs either additional information about the Equation of State (EoS) of this matter, or one needs to analyze penetrating probes, such as direct photon observables. [1] In this talk we review recent hydrodynamic solutions, and show new exact, analytic solutions of hydrodynamics with arbitrary temperature dependent EoS. We investigate special cases of this class of solutions, in particular, we present exact hydrodynamical solutions with the Equation of State determined from lattice QCD calculations. [2] We calculate direct photon spectra, elliptic flow and HBT radii and compare them to recent direct photon measurements performed by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC [3]. The first family of rotating solutions of relativistic and non-relativistic hydrodynamics are also shown [4]. The effect of the total angular momentum of the system on the elliptic flow and HBT radii is also reviewed. It is an important result that elliptic flow may be generated by the rotation of the system.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Can baryon stopping explain the breakdown of constituent quark scaling and proposed signals of chiral magnetic waves at RHIC?,"Campbell, John",T,Unknown,"Azimuthal emission spectra of various hadron species in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \approx $ 200 GeV exhibit a curious hierarchy at intermediate $p_t$ ($\approx 2-3$ GeV). Rather than being ordered by mass, the spectra seem to be ordered by whether the species is a baryon or meson. It is seen that when the elliptic flow $v_2$ and transverse momentum $p_T$ are both scaled by the number of quarks in each hadron, the spectra fall in line with each other [1]. This number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling suggests a system where the relevant degrees of freedom are colored partons as opposed to hadrons: the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Thus, a break down of this scaling as beam energy is reduced could be indicative of the QGP threshold. However, at lower energies, there is also an increase in the number of entrance-channel partons transported to mid-rapidity due to baryon stopping, which can also violate NCQ scaling, even above the QGP threshold [2]. We describe a specific pattern for the break down of the scaling that includes the observed difference in elliptic flow for positive and negative pions. \\
We also contrast baryon stopping with the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [3]--an alternative model for $\pi_{+} / \pi_{-}$ flow difference--and discuss results from tests that can distinguish between them.

anisotropies and the flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. Further we
explore how the techniques in CMBR analysis could be utilized in studying the flow anisotropies in
RHICE. 

 We argue that the initial state fluctuations of the matter formed  in heavy ion collisions have
similar properties as the fluctuations in the early universe generated by the inflaton field, and by 
studying the flow coeffecients ( a plot of v_n vs. n) we can obtain valuable information about  the 
nature and evolution of these fluctuations. We also study the effect of magnetic field on flow. 
In the presence of magnetic field plasma develops three acoustic modes. It is known in literature that
this distorts the CMB acoustic peaks. We show that flow coefficients in relativistic heavy ion collisions 
can be significantly affected by these effects where a a strong magnetic field is known to be 
present in the initial stages (of non-central collisions) and is expected to survive due to strong 
induced fields in the conducting plasma. This raises the possibility whether a larger value of $\eta/s$ 
can be accommodated by RHIC data. We also show that flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
 can be analyzed using a certain technique of shape analysis of excursion sets recently proposed by us for 
CMBR fluctuations to investigate anisotropic expansion history of the universe. The technique analyzes shapes 
(sizes) of patches above (below) certain threshold value for transverse energy/particle number fluctuations 
(the excursion sets) as a function of the azimuthal angle and rapidity. This provides an alternative way to 
identify the event plane in an event.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'P S', 'last_name': 'Saumia', 'fullName': 'Saumia, P S', 'id': '314310', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics', 'emailHash': '5545044fa3b84b05d3d29aa614ec89a1', 'db_id': 314310, 'person_id': 343144}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Baryon number probability distribution in the presence of the chiral phase transition,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We discuss the influence of the chiral phase transition on the properties
of the probability distribution of conserved charges based on effective chiral
models and on the Landau theory of phase transition [1].

Statistical fluctuations of the net baryon number have been regarded as a
diagnostic tool of the chiral phase transition in QCD and in heavy ion collisions.
Normally, they are discussed by calculating cumulants of the net baryon
number in the grand canonical ensemble. Lattice QCD and effective model calculations
have revealed their critical behaviors in the vicinity of the chiral phase
transition.

The purpose of this work is to characterize the critical behavior in terms
of the baryon number probability distribution which is a measurable observable 
in heavy ion collisions.

We show the influence of the chiral crossover transition on the net baryon
number probability distribution within the Polyakov loop extended quark-meson model, 
in a non-perturbative approach, based on the functional renormalization group method [1].

We construct an analytically solvable model which respects relevant
symmetries, based on the Landau theory, and discuss properties of the
baryon number probability distribution in the presence of the phase transition.
We emphasize the relationship of the probability distribution to the analytic
structure of the grand canonical partition function in a complex chemical
potential [2-4].
We show, through both numerical and analytic considerations,
that the singular structure, which gives the divergent cumulants,
leads to an interesting anomalous oscillatory behavior in the probability
distribution.

Our theoretical studies are relevant in heavy ion phenomenology to
possibly identify the QCD phase transition and its order
by measuring probability distributions of conserved charges.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Heavy quark energy loss in p+p collisions at the LHC,"Vogel, Sascha",Frankfurt Institute for Advances Studies,Unknown,"One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high energy nuclear collisions is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  

In this investigation we study the energy loss for heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton proton collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy might lead to multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC and thus might lead to a deconfined phase. This gives rise to a non-negligible suppression of heavy quark yields in elementary collisions. We study the dependence of this phenomenon on various quantities, such as the deconfinement energy density and the multiplicity reached in proton proton collisions and discuss this measurement as a probe to pin down parameters of the deconfinement phase transition.

The medium descriptions we compare are widely used in the field of heavy ion physics, ranging from elliptic fireball models to hydrodynamics.

To extract the information, the imaginary chemical potential is taken into account.
At $\theta = \pi/2$ where $\theta$ is the imaginary chemical potential divided by the temperature, there is the exact nontrivial center symmetry which is the $Z_2$ symmetry and this symmetry can be spontaneously broken.
This behavior is quite different form the three-color QCD because the nontrivial center symmetry is always broken by the quark degree of freedom
in the three-color QCD.
This means that we can investigate the nontrivial correlation between the chiral and deconfinement transitions in the two-color system clearly than that in the three-color system.
Such nontrivial correlation is very important to construct the effective model of QCD and thus we can expect that several important model constraints are obtained from the two-color QCD analysis.
In this study, we mainly pay attention to the behavior of the Roberge-Weiss (RW) endpoint which appears at $\theta=\pi/2$ in the tho-color system.
We show that the RW endpoint is second-order if the nontrivial correlation is weak, but it turn into first-order when the nontrivial correlation is sufficiently strong.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kouji', 'last_name': 'Kashiwa', 'fullName': 'Kashiwa, Kouji', 'id': '314348', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN BNL Research Center', 'emailHash': '027a68c06677b38a9d9c2fd19016509e', 'db_id': 314348, 'person_id': 343180}"

The anisotropy is typically characterized by $v_2$, the second harmonic coefficient of the Fourier series expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane. The observed $v_2$ is believed to be sensitive to different particle production mechanisms. At low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm t}$) $v_2$ encodes the information of the expansion driven by the initial pressure gradients. At high $p_{\rm t}$ it may be caused by path-length dependent parton energy loss. At intermediate $p_{\rm t}$ it may be related to the mechanism of quark coalescence.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The importance of e+A collisions at an Electron-Ion Collider,"Lamont, Matthew",BNL,USA,"Over the last decade, there has been a plethora of new and exciting results in heavy-ion collisions emanating from the CERN and Brookhaven Laboratories.  These results have led to a sea change of the view on how the evolution of a high energy heavy-ion collision proceeds.  What has become apparent is that in order to validate claims of perfect fluidity, for example, the initial conditions at small-x need to be well understood.  Whilst d+A and p+A collisions provide a handle on some of these effects, for precision measurements and precise knowledge of the kinematics, e+A collisions become essential.

A proposal has been developed at Brookhaven National Lab to add an electron accelerator to the current RHIC complex, providing for electron beams ranging from 5 GeV to 30 GeV. Complementing the programme on polarised e+p scattering, a broad programme on e+A physics is envisioned which will range from investigating saturation physics at low-x to hadronization at high-x.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Microcanonical Tsallis statistics in jet fragmentation at LHC and LEP,"Uermoessy, Karoly",Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),China,"For the description of hadronic spectra in high-energy nuclear reactions, it is essential to understand the process of hadronisation. However, hadron creation is still an unsettled matter from the theoretical point of view.

In the talk, I show that hadron distributions inside jets (fragmentation functions) created in s^1/2 = 7 TeV (LHC) proton-proton [1] and also in high-energy electron-positron [2] collisions can be described by a statistical jet-fragmentation model. This model combines microcanonical statistics and super-statistics induced by multiplicity fluctuations. The resulting scale dependence of the parameters of the model turns out to be similar to what was observed in electron-positron annihilations in Ref. [2].

Poster Session Reception,poster,Thermal Photon emission with partial chemical equilibrium equation of state,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectra and their anisotropy are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1]. Previous computations of photon emission spectra have been mostly carried out in a fully thermalized medium evolving dynamically under the influence of an equation of state with a first order phase transition. Today, a realistic state-of-the-art equation of state based on lattice QCD results and partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) in the hadronic phase is available for relativistic hydrodynamic simulations [2]. The non-zero chemical potentials will enhance thermal photon production rates in the hadronic phase by their corresponding non-equilibrium fugacity factor ~ e^{mu/T}. However, the breaking of chemical equilibrium below the quark hadron phase transition also changes the relation between temperature and energy density, which results in faster cooling evolution during the hadronic phase. This reduces the space-time volume for photon emission from the hadronic phase. In this work, we study PCE effects on the yields and the azimuthal anisotropies of produced thermal photons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, using a realistically evolving hydrodynamic medium. We study in detail the interplay between the chemical potential enhancement in the thermal photon emission rates and faster cooling evolution of the medium. We compare our calculations with data from RHIC, and make  predictions for measurements at the LHC.

For a bare quark, we model that boundary conditions on the spacetime metric can plausibly couple the value of current quark mass to the charge, via external pressure (e.g., as supplied by a background field) at sub-fm length scales.  This mechanism acquires some (up to ~ 40%) current quark mass “from” the charge.  To construct an approximate metric, we model a bare quark as a spherically symmetric static perfect fluid with charge, using a recent exact Maxwell-Einstein metric for the interior, out to a radius r at which the boundary condition is to match to the Reissner-Nordström metric (for spacetime external to a charged mass).  At r, the model produces internal pressure, which should be matched to external pressure.  For reported values of quark charges q and bare masses mq, this construction produces sub-fm radii.  Although the metric at this radius differs only perturbatively from a flat spacetime, the matching condition is more significant and couples the current quark mass to the charge.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Thomas', 'last_name': 'Kiess', 'fullName': 'Kiess, Thomas', 'id': '314440', 'affiliation': 'self', 'emailHash': '94918e72335c4bb1db2804e32bbe42e7', 'db_id': 314440, 'person_id': 343247}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,LPM effect as the origin of the jet fragmentation scaling in heavy ion collisions.,"Loshaj, Frasher",S,United States,"We address a recent puzzling result from the LHC: the jet fragmentation functions measured  in $PbPb$ and $pp$ collisions appear very similar in spite of a large medium-induced energy loss (we will call this ``jet fragmentation scaling"", JFS).  To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the propagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we adopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the  $(1+1)$ quasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of the coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of ``mesons"" with a finite mass and the screening of ``quark"" charge  that are crucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that this approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$ annihilation 
at $z\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion measurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we find that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\lambda$ of the jet is short, $\lambda \leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity inferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at short mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low momenta $p \sim m$, where $m \simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.  Meanwhile the induced jet energy loss at short mean free path is much larger than naively expected in string models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Frasher', 'last_name': 'Loshaj', 'fullName': 'Loshaj, Frasher', 'id': '314442', 'affiliation': 'S', 'emailHash': '80754bded9ed851eb2625d6cb2f44a6c', 'db_id': 314442, 'person_id': 343248}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Two-baryon correlations in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC,"Salzwedel, Jai",Ohio State University (US),USA,"In heavy-ion collisions produced at the LHC a significant number of baryons is emitted in each collision. Two-particle correlations of those baryons carry important information about the emitting source and the interaction between them. 

At low relative momentum femtoscopic correlations arise, which are sensitive to the homogeneity lengths of the system. Hydrodynamic models predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse mass of the pair. Such a decrease is universally reported for pions, also at the LHC. Baryons, having a much larger mass, allow to significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The results from baryon femtoscopy would put a strong constraint on such predictions. Non-identical baryon pairs are also sensitive to emission
asymmetries.

Femtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to the strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon pair types. The most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction which has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of the H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon potentials, which have significant contributions from annihilation channels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle spectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of the small proton yield at the LHC.

We show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types (both baryon-baryon and baryon-antibaryon) composed of protons and lambdas. Femtoscopic analysis is carried out for proton  pairs, taking into account residual correlations and annihilation
channel for the proton-antiproton system.

This is easily understood in the CGC framework: the produced partons are initially back-to-back in the transverse plane, but the interaction with the nucleus causes a momentum transfer of the order of the saturation scale. In forward dihadron production the small-x structure of the nucleus is probed, implying a large saturation scale.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Relativistic Fluctuating Hydrodynamics and its Application to Heavy Ion Collisions,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks
and gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are
performed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries was that elliptic flow v_2
was comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,
that a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was
established. Recently, the higher harmonics v_n (n > 2) are
systematically observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of theoretical
and experimental interests. Initial state fluctuations turned out to be
important to explain these higher harmonics.

In addition to initial state fluctuations, thermal fluctuation during
the space-time evolution of the QGP also plays an important role in
event-by-event simulations. We first formulate the relativistic
fluctuating hydrodynamics in the context of the second order causal
theory. Finite relaxation time for dissipative current is required to
make hydrodynamic equation consistent with causality. Instead of
introducing the relaxation term itself, one can define a kernel function
(or a retarded Green function) such that constitutive equation becomes
convolution of the kernel function including relaxation as well as
dissipation and the corresponding thermodynamic force. One can also
introduce a noise field as thermal fluctuation of the dissipative
current like in the Langevin equation. Thus the constitutive equation
becomes no longer a deterministic equation, but a stochastic equation.
The power spectrum of the noise fields is intimately related to the
kernel function via the fluctuation-dissipation relation and,
consequently, noise becomes colored noise rather than white one due to
the finite relaxation time. We then implement the colored noise together
with viscous kernels in numerical simulations of relativistic
hydrodynamics and perform simulations on an event-by-event basis to see
effects of thermal fluctuation on the dynamics of heavy ion collisions.
This framework is beyond the conventional second order dissipative
hydrodynamics and, thus, will become important in the upcoming era of
the precision QGP physics by means of high-energy heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Koichi', 'last_name': 'Murase', 'fullName': 'Murase, Koichi', 'id': '314516', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '819c6d195f763e7be9eb6cba1672536e', 'db_id': 314516, 'person_id': 343300}"

The momentum fluctuations present a complimentary information about the collective expansion of the fireball to the widely discussed harmonic flow coefficients. The scaled transverse momentum fluctuations are not changed significantly when modifying the viscosity or the freeze-out temperature.

Heavy vector mesons (for example J/psi, Psi', Upsilon) produced in electromagnetic interactions provide direct information on the parton distribution functions in the nucleus at very low values of Bjorken-x. These events are characterized by a very low hadron multiplicity. The wide pseudorapidity coverage of the CMS detectors is used to separate such events from very peripheral nuclear interactions.

The precise measurement of transverse momentum distributions of quarkonia at different centralities, collision systems, and energies will serve as a thermometer of QGP. A large-area and cost-effective Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) at mid-rapidity for the STAR was proposed. The MTD will be constructed with LMRPC instead of small pad read-out MRPC.

In 1977 Jaffe[1] predicted a six quark state, $H_{0}$-dibaryon, with hypercharge (Y) = 0 and Strangeness (S) = -2 to be stable against strong decay, but not to weak decay. It has been proposed that the $H_{0}$ would appear as a bump in the $\Lambda-\Lambda$ invariant mass spectra if the $H_{0}$ is a resonance state, or it would lead to a depletion of the $\Lambda-\Lambda$ correlation near the threshold if the $H_{0}$ is weakly bound, which can be used to probe whether there is a stable $H_{0}$ or resonance. Considerable experimental efforts have been devoted to search for $H_{0}$. However there is no conclusive experimental evidence for a bound $H_{0}$. In addition to $H_{0}$, many other dihyperon states have been predicted thoeretically. However, very few measurements are available due to low multiplicity of hyperon production in early nuclear collisions. 

Recently STAR has collected unprecedented high statistics data for Au+Au collision at RHIC, which provides a unique opportunity to look for the exotic particles and hyperon-hyperon correlations.

The physics goal with the calorimeter is to understand the dynamics and properties of strongly interacting matter created by relativistic heavy-ion collisions and the initial state of the collisions such as high density color field realized at small Bjorken-x.

The W+Si sampling calorimeter is a highly segmented silicon-tungsten

One consists of three or four longitudinal sampling electromagnetic segments, where one segment is composed of 5-7 layers of tungsten (~3.5mm thickness) and 1cm x 1cm Si-pad readout.

The first segment contains 2-4 longitudinal layers of high resolution Si-micro-pad (1mm x 1mm) or Si-pixel (100um x 100um) detectors for the position measurements and two gamma separation.
The other is composed of full layers of W+Si pixel with extreme fine granularity. For the Si pixel, MIMOSA chip, which has been developed as one of the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), is utilized for the calorimeter purpose.

However, the equation of state (EOS) is still not clear and many theoretical studies try to elucidate the EOS in the high density and/or temperature.  The crust region of the stars consist of nucleus and nuclear matter. Therefore the inner region of the stars should have hadron-quark mixed phase. Nowadays it is pointed out that the inner structures would affect macroscopic phenomena of the star[1]. However, the inner structures are strongly depend on EOS of the matter. We show that the hadron-quark mixed phase should be restricted to a narrower region because of the finite-size effects and a quark matter region should appear in the central region[2]. The narrow region of the mixed phase seems to explain physical phenomena of neutron stars such as the strong magnetic field and glitch phenomena, and it would give a new cooling curve for the neutron star.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Model-independent separation of flow and nonflow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Kikola, Daniel",Purdue University,USA,"Anisotropic flow, which arises from correlations to the common collision geometry, is sensitive to the early stage of the expansion of the medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Azimuthal anisotropy is measured by final state particle correlations and is thus contaminated by correlations unrelated to the common geometry (nonflow).  The contamination of nonflow hampers further advancement in our study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, in at least two areas: it prevents a more precise determination of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s of the QGP medium from flow measurements, and it limits the power of jet-like correlations in probing partonic energy loss mechanisms where flow presents a background to be subtracted. Recently it has been shown that the measured two-particle correlation Fourier coefficients approximately factorize, and it was argued that this indicates the dominance of flow. In this talk we show by PYTHA simulations of p+p collisions that factorization approximately holds also for jet-like correlations and therefore is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for flow [1]. We suggest that nonflow factorization can in turn be used to disentangle flow and nonflow as a function of particle transverse momentum by performing a two-component factorization fit to Fourier coefficients [1]. However, such disentanglement is model dependent, so are all other experimental nonflow studies thus far. To revamp this, we present in this talk a novel, model-independent method to decompose \Delta\eta-dependent and independent correlations using two- and four-partice cumulants between \eta bins, exploiting the symmetry of flow about midrapidity in symmetric heavy-ion collisions [2]. The \Delta\eta-independent correlations are dominated by anisotropic flow while the \Delta\eta-dependent correlations can be identified as nonflow.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Initial conditions for fluid dynamics from a parton cascade model,"Bouras, Ioannis",University of Frankfurt a.M.,Unknown,"The initial conditions play a fundamental role in the fluid-dynamical modeling of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Many observables that are important in determining the properties of the QGP, such 
as elliptic flow (v2) and triangular flow (v3), appear to be generated mainly from the initial geometry of the energy density profile. Since the initial conditions remain undetermined, it introduces a large uncertainty in the extraction of the 
properties of the QGP. 

Typically it is assumed that the matter thermalizes and fluid dynamics can be applied after time of the order of $1$ fm/c after the initial nuclear collision. However, the matter itself can be created much earlier, and it undergoes pre-equilibrium evolution 
before fluid dynamics can be applied. In this work, we estimate the impact of the pre-equilibrium evolution of the QGP on the initial conditions for fluid dynamics using a parton cascade model. 

For the initial conditions for the pre-equilibrium evolution we use a realistic 6--dimensional parametrization of the initial single-particle distribution function $f(x, p)$ that reflect, e.g. the observed rapidity and multiplicity distributions at RHIC and LHC.
Then, we solve the time evolution of this distribution using the relativistic Boltzmann equation, up to times of the order of 1 fm/c, for various values of partonic cross sections. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is solved using the 
BAMPS algorithm Ref. [1].

The main advantage of our approach is that we are able to compute, not only the energy density distribution at $t=1$ fm, but also the velocity and shear-stress tensor profiles, which, so far, are mostly unknown.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Turbulent instability in low viscosity quark-gluon plasma,"Csernai, Laszlo Pal",University of Bergen\ Ferdowsi U. of Mashhad,Unknown,"Flow asymmetries are in focus of present heavy ion studies. In head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. This poses a challenge to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations. Here we study flow asymmetries arising from global asymmetries in peripheral collisions.

The dynamical development of collective flow of prefect QGP fluid is studied in a (3+1)D fluid dynamical model for peripheral heavy-ion collisions, with globally symmetric, initial conditions, which take into account the shear flow caused by the forward motion of the matter on the projectile side and the backward motion on the target side.  While at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76A$\,TeV semi-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions the earlier predicted rotation effect [2] is visible in the calculations, at more peripheral collisions, with high resolution and low numerical viscosity the initial development of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is observed [3], which alters the flow pattern considerably. On the initial dividing plane a wave develops, and the dividing plane develops into a turning nonlinear wave. The wave develops only in peripheral reactions with very low numerical viscosity. The KHI wave is visible in the reaction plane if we mark the motion of the fluid which was initially on the dividing plane. The direction of the wave is such that it enhances the rotation effect and increases the asymmetry of the global collective $v_1(y)$. The possibility of turbulence in the transverse plane developing from initial fluctuations was also pointed out recently [4].

Although, the predicted rotation effect is not easily detectable due to longitudinal initial state fluctuations, the KHI enhances the flow asymmetry and changes its pattern in peripheral collisions.  The present developments suggest that the global collective $v_1$ flow can be disentangled from random fluctuations. This is necessary to measure the global collective flow in peripheral collisions.

The KHI is very sensitive to the magnitude of the viscosity.  Thus if this research is successful the analysis of global collective $v_1$ flow as a function of beam energy and impact parameter may provide a precision measurement of viscosity and its variation.

Poster Session Reception,poster,QGP shear viscosity from combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow,"Qiu, Zhi",Ohio State University,USA,"The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions is well described by viscous hydrodynamic simulations. A key QGP transport coefficient, its specific shear viscosity eta/s, can be extracted by comparing such simulations with experimental data. Previous extractions gave (eta/s)_QGP ~ (1-2.5)/(4\pi) where the ~100% uncertainty arises mainly from ambiguities in the initial fireball shape and density profile. To obtain (eta/s)_QGP with better precision, the ambiguities in the initial conditions must be addressed.

Published extractions of the specific shear viscosity have relied on elliptic flow measurements and the fact that eta/s suppresses elliptic flow. It was recently realized that higher order harmonic flows are suppressed even more strongly with increasing eta/s, and that the recently measured triangular flow allows to simultaneously constrain eta/s and the initial conditions: viable initial conditions should describe the elliptic and triangular flows v2 and v3 simultaneously with the same eta/s. We have performed such a simultaneous analysis of v2 and v3 [1]. We show that the normalized elliptic and triangular flow coefficients v2/ecc2 and v3/ecc3 (where ecc_n are the n-th order eccentricities of the initial state) can be obtained with 10-15% accuracy using single-shot hydrodynamical simulations where the initial conditions are averaged before hydrodynamical evolution, instead of the more realistic but costly event-by-event hydrodynamical approach where averaging is done only after separate evolution of each fluctuating initial condition.

For elliptic flow we find that, within 10-15%, v2/ecc2 = v2{2}/ecc2{2} = v2{4}/ecc2{4} where the expression on the left is obtained from single-shot hydrodynamics while the cumulant expressions on the right are extracted from event-by-event hydrodynamics. For triangular flow we find, at the same level of precision, that v3/ecc3=v3{2}/ecc3{2} \neq v3{4}/ecc3{4}. The ALICE data for charged hadron elliptic and triangular flow from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [2] are shown to obey these approximate (in-)equalities. Our hydrodynamic analysis [1] shows that the ALICE v2 and v3 data [2] can be explained simultaneously, at all collision centralities, if (eta/s)_QGP \approx 1/(4\pi). This requires MC-Glauber initial conditions which have smaller ecc2 than CGC-motivated MC-KLN initial conditions. For MC-KLN initial conditions the v2 data require larger (eta/s)_QGP ~ (2-2.5)/(4\pi) which, however, then underpredicts the measured triangular flow by 35-40%. We conclude that the large v3 measured at the LHC requires either almost minimal QGP shear viscosity (eta/s)_QGP \approx 1/(4\pi), or a presently unknown mechanism for increasing the triangularity fluctuations in the initial state by ~50%.

The di-jet energy imbalance is assessed via the difference of total momenta in the same- minus away-side peaks, and the measured imbalance is over-predicted by path-length dependent models, while showing possible evidence of softening of jet fragmentation. We find no qualitative change in the same-side peak of 2+1 correlation.

Removing the back-to-back partner maximizing the asymmetry, the 2+1 reduces to the ordinary dihadron correlation, where significant modification is indeed observed on the away-side but the near-side remains similar between the d+Au and Au+Au events, indicating surface bias. We further lower the trigger p_T to as low as 1.5 GeV/c, where hydrodynamic production of particles are thought to dominate and jet-like correlations are expected to diminish. However, we find the identical near-side correlation between d+Au and Au+Au persists.

Poster Session Reception,poster,"Heavy Flavour Electron azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ from 2- and 4-particle correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200, 62 and 39 GeV at STAR","Kikola, Daniel",Purdue University,USA,"Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are produced early in the collisions and therefore are important probes of the hot and dense matter created in the reactions at RHIC energies. Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy flavour mesons (so called non-photonic electrons, NPE) are the most feasible tool so far for studying heavy quarks in-medium interactions. NPE azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, is of particular interest because it provides additional means to discriminate between models which describe heavy quark
in-medium interactions. 

In this presentation we will report the $v_2$ measurements using  2- and 4-particle correlations, $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$, at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200, 62 and 39 GeV at STAR. Non-photonic electrons in this study are identified using three main STAR subsystems: Time Projection Chamber, Time of Flight Detector and Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter. $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$ have different sensitivity to the flow fluctuations and so called nonflow (correlations not related to the reaction plane) - there is a positive contribution of fluctuation and nonflow to the $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ while, in the case of $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$, nonflow is negligible and the effect of fluctuations is negative. Therefore $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and  $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$ provide an upper and lower limit on the average azimuthal anisotropy of non-photonic electrons. Moreover, bottom/charm production ratio at lower energies is expected to be reduced compared to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV, therefore low $p_T$ NPE azimuthal anisotropy at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 62 and 39 GeV would reflect charm $v_2$ better than at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Kikola', 'fullName': 'Kikola, Daniel', 'id': '314664', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'a8c56649f1f172a78f95103962c986e1', 'db_id': 314664, 'person_id': 343358}"

Therefore, the measurement of heavy quark yields from heavy ion collisions leads to greater understanding of parton behavior inside QGP.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The Emergent QCD Plasma from RHIC to LHC,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University & RIKEN BNL Research Center,USA,"One of the main discoveries at RHIC is the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), based particularly on the observed ""perfect fluid"" and strong jet quenching. One of the most interesting physics to see at LHC is whether and how such sQGP properties will change. Based on the deep and generic electric-magnetic duality, we've suggested that the QCD plasma contains the quarks and gluons (color-electric D.o.F) as well as the EMERGENT monopoles (color-magnetic D.o.F.) with the latter becoming dominant at strong gauge coupling as in the near-Tc QCD plasma . An important prediction of this ""magnetic scenario"" is a RAPID turn-off of the magnetic dominanace when increasing temperature  beyond the near-Tc regime of 1-1.5Tc, accompanied by rapid decrease (due to non-perturbative running) of QCD coupling in this regime. 

This scenario, therefore, implies the QCD plasma to be less perfect a fluid and more transparent a medium at LHC, despite only modest increase in tempearture. We will discuss such expected change of the emergent QCD plasma from RHIC to LHC energies. Furthermore, we will examine the changes in the two most important medium properties: 1) evidences for a less perfect fluid from our molecular dynamics simulations as well as from other groups' hydrodynamic modelling of flow data at LHC; 2) evidences for a more transparent medium as predicted from our analysis of geometric data for jet quenching and from other groups' modelling for LHC Raa data and extraction of jet quenching parameter at LHC.

The flavor-dependent twisted boundary condition (TBC) is imposed on Nc degenerate flavor quarks in the SU(Nc) gauge theory. The QCD-like theory is useful to understand the mechanism of color confinement. Dynamics of the QCD-like theory is studied by imposing the TBC on the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The Z_{Nc} symmetry is preserved below some temperature Tc, but spontaneously broken above Tc. The color confinement below Tc preserves the flavor symmetry. Above Tc, the flavor symmetry is broken, but the breaking is suppressed by the entanglement between the Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate. Particularly at low temperature, dynamics of the TBC model is similar to that of the PNJL model with the standard fermion boundary condition, indicating that the Z_{Nc} symmetry is a good approximate concept in the latter model even if the current quark mass is small. The present prediction can be tested in future by lattice QCD, since the QCD-like theory has no sign problem.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yuji', 'last_name': 'Sakai', 'fullName': 'Sakai, Yuji', 'id': '314669', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN', 'emailHash': '9f5a32cce22f644592c721e3117234f4', 'db_id': 314669, 'person_id': 343416}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Elastic scattering: The undersides of quarkonia propagation and collectivity in the QGP,"Berrehrah, Hamza",Subatech,Unknown,"One of the most advocated probes of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) properties is the $J/\psi$ suppression. However, the comparison between experimental data and theoretical scenarios is still rather inconclusive, as several mechanisms might participate to explain the observed suppression (sequential suppression, dynamical or statistical recombination, formation time,...), not to mention the cold nuclear matter effects. In recent experimental studies at PHENIX and STAR, the $v_2$ of the $J/\Psi$'s has been measured. In conjunction with $R_{AA}$, this observable should improve our understanding of quarkonia production in the QGP and puts higher constrains on models aiming at describing the $J/\psi$ suppression. However, most of them neglect the possible diffusion of $Q\bar{Q}$ correlations (""pre $J/\psi$'s"") in the QGP although it is 
generically an essential ingredient for the understanding of the $v_2$ of all particles.

 Motivated by SPS results of $v_2^{J/\psi}$ and recent RHIC and LHC results suggesting a strong thermalization of charm quarks in the medium, our approach is focused not only on the suppression phenomenon but also on the physical evolution of those correlations, including an original treatment of their diffusion in the QGP due to their Compton scattering with gluons and the implications of such a diffusion on $J/\psi$ energy loss and collectivity, studied in a hydrodynamic transport model. The general tendency of our results indeed shows that elastic processes may have a non-negligible influence on the quarkonia propagation in the QGP.
   
   In our contribution, we will discuss the theoretical framework we have developed to evaluate the elastic cross section of $J/\psi$'s (and more generally $\Q\bar{Q}$ correlations) by combining analytical calculations based on pQCD and results from lQCD. We will then address the quarkonia propagation under the influence of such collisions, treated in a Fokker-Planck approach, and will present results deduced from our transport code MC@SHQ. Those results will be compared to recent STAR and PHENIX experiments at RHIC and predictions of $v_2^{J/\psi}$ for LHC will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hamza', 'last_name': 'Berrehrah', 'fullName': 'Berrehrah, Hamza', 'id': '314673', 'affiliation': 'Subatech', 'emailHash': '6d1235bfaf1b3a9714f67eb156caa3bf', 'db_id': 314673, 'person_id': 343417}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Parton energy loss and modified beam quark distribution functions in Drell–Yan process in p +A collisions,"Xing, Hongxi","Institute of Particle Physics, Central China Normal University",Unknown,"Within the framework of generalized collinear factorization in perturbative QCD (pQCD), we study the effect of initial multiple parton scattering and induced parton energy loss in Drell–Yan (DY) process in proton–nucleus collisions. We express the contribution from multiple parton scattering and induced radiative energy loss to the DY dilepton spectra in terms of nuclear modified effective beam (anti)quark distribution functions. The modification depends on the quark transport parameter in nuclear medium. This is similar to the final-state multiple parton scattering in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off large nuclei and leads to the suppression of the Drell–Yan cross section in p + A relative to p + p collisions. The modifications to (anti)quark distribution functions from (anti)quark-antiquark double scattering are shown to be determined by the (anti)quark distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark distribution functions inside the beam hardon. We also calculate DY spectra in p + A collisions and find the nuclear suppression due to beam parton energy loss negligible at the Fermilab energy Elab = 800 GeV in the kinematic region as covered by the E866 experiment. Most of the observed nuclear suppression of DY spectra in E866 experiment can be described well by parton shadowing in target nuclei as given by the EPS08 parameterization. The effect of beam parton energy loss, however, becomes significant for DY lepton pairs with large beam parton momentum fraction or small target parton momentum fraction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hongxi', 'last_name': 'Xing', 'fullName': 'Xing, Hongxi', 'id': '314679', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Particle Physics, Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '205b87e3f72effb3a38bbf7b5bb23107', 'db_id': 314679, 'person_id': 343418}"

Using different scenarios for the interaction between projectile and matter, and different transport properties of the matter, we study the formation and structure of Mach cones. Especially, a dependence of the Mach cone angle on the details and rate of the energy deposition from projectile to the matter is investigated. Furthermore, the two-particle correlations extracted 
from the numerical calculations are compared to an analytical approximation. We find that the propagation of a high energetic particle through the matter does not lead to the appearance of a double peak structure as observed in the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. The reason is the strongly forward-peaked energy and momentum deposition in the head shock region. In addition, by adjusting the cross section we investigate the

Poster Session Reception,poster,Upsilon suppression in PbPb collisions at LHC energies,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"We suggest that the combined effect of screening, gluon-induced dissociation, Landau damping, and reduced feed-down explains most of the suppression of Y states that has been observed by CMS [1] in PbPb relative to pp collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV at the CERN LHC. The suppression is thus a clear, albeit indirect, indication for the presence of a qgp.

In particular, we calculate the suppression of both the Y(1S) ground state in the quark-gluon plasma in minimum-bias PbPb collisions, and of the Y(2S + 3S) states relative to the ground state. In a major extension of our schematic phenomenological approach presented in [2], we now explicitly consider the time dependence with transverse and longitudinal expansion, and the effect of Landau damping [3] on the widths of the states, in addition to gluodissociation.

The effect of Landau damping of the Y(nS) and Chi_b(nP) states is computed from a complex potential, and is found to be of the same order of magnitude as the gluon-induced dissociation [2] for the 1S state at the temperatures that are relevant at LHC.
The gluodissociation is treated explicitly for all five states considered here (1S, 2S, 3S, 1P and 2P), including the influence of the confining string contribution on the dissociation rates.

As compared to pp collisions at the same energy, the feed-down cascade leading to the Y(1S) ground state is drastically modified due to the substantial suppression of the excited states through screening, damping and gluodissociation. The 1S ground state remains very stable with respect to screening, its suppression is essentially due to damping, gluodissociation and reduced feed-down.

Our results are presented for different Y formation times and qgp lifetimes. For reasonable plasma temperatures at Y formation time, we obtain good agreement with the CMS data for the Y(1S) suppression factor, but less suppression than is needed
for the measured [1] ratio Y(2S + 3S)/ Y(1S) - which requires, however, better statistics.
Should the result persist in the 2011 data, it is likely that additional suppression mechanisms are at work.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Quark-gluon plasma shear viscosity at RHIC and the LHC: results from the hybrid model VISHNU,"Song, Huichao",The Ohio State University,USA,"Viscous hydrodynamic calculations have shown that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) shear viscosity can be extracted from elliptic and triangular flow data [1]. However, strong non-equilibrium effects, both in the chemical composition and the kinetic evolution, during the hadronic stage influence the development and distribution of flow anisotropy and must be correctly accounted for when extracting the QGP viscosity. For an improved description of the hadronic evolution, we developed the hybrid model VISHNU which couples viscous hydrodynamic expansion of a QGP fluid to a microscopic description of hadronic rescattering and chemical and thermal freeze-out using the UrQMD cascade [2]. In this talk, we will summarize a number of key results obtained with VISHNU:

a) We present a robust method for extracting the QGP viscosity from the collision centrality dependence of the eccentricity-scaled charged hadron elliptic flow [3].

b) We extract the  QGP shear viscosity at RHIC energies from elliptic flow data, giving quantitative estimates for and initial pre-equilibrium flow and from model ambiguities of the initial fireball eccentricity. We discuss the prospects for reducing the main uncertainties from initial conditions through a combined analysis of elliptic, triangular and higher-order harmonic flow coefficients using event-by-event VISHNU simulations.

c) We show that, with the QGP viscosity extracted in [3], VISHNU yields an excellent description of all soft-hadron data from Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy [4].

d) Extrapolating to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and comparing with recent experimental results from the ALICE Collaboration, we show that the LHC data are again well described by VISHNU, with
approximately the same constant QGP viscosity as at RHIC energies [5], including the proton elliptic flow in the most central collisions which cannot be correctly reproduced in a purely hydrodynamic approach [6].

e) Using an improved implementation of baryon-antibaryon annihilation in UrQMD, VISHNU is shown to resolve the ``proton puzzle"" at the LHC [7].

This surprising result has challenged the view of gluon radiation dominating over elastic 2-to-2 processes as a cause of parton energy loss in a quark-gluon plasma. To study the effectiveness of elastic collisions as the suppression mechanism in detail, we have developed a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation describing the non-eikonal propagation of high-energy gluons and light quarks interacting with the quarks and gluons from the expanding QCD medium. The partonic collision rates are computed in leading-order perturbative QCD, while four different scenarios are used to model the QCD medium: 1) a simple static model for case studies of energy loss probability distributions; 2) (1+1)-dimensional hydro with initial conditions from the EKRT model for modeling the central heavy ion collisions; 3) (2+1)-dimensional hydro with a smooth sWN profile obtained from the optical Glauber model for non-central collisions; and 4) event-by-event hydro with an eBC profile from the Monte Carlo Glauber model for a detailed study of the initial state density fluctuation effects.

describe the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) 
created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The validity of the fluid-dynamical approach is experimentally confirmed by the fact that
initial-state anisotropies are directly converted into nonvanishing
(event-averaged) Fourier coefficients $\langle v_n \rangle$ of the 
decomposition of the single-inclusive momentum distribution of hadrons
with respect to the azimuthal angle. From the magnitude of the $\langle v_n \rangle$ one can obtain information about the size of dissipative corrections and thus infer the value of the viscous coefficients of the QGP.

It has been realized that, for a proper comparison to experimental data
and a reliable extraction of viscosity, fluid-dynamical calculations have to be performed on an event-by-event basis. Therefore, fluid dynamics should not only be able to predict the correct event-averaged $\langle v_n\rangle$, but also their distributions. In this paper, we investigate the event-by-event distribution of the initial-state eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$, and show how they correlate with the event-by-event distribution of the Fourier coefficients $v_n$. In order to generate the initial state, we use the Monte-Carlo Glauber model of Ref.\ [1]. For the fluid-dynamical evolution, we use the model of Refs.\ [2]. The final hadron spectra are calculated with the Cooper-Frye freeze-out procedure.

We demonstrate that the event-by-event distributions of the $v_n$,
and not only their average values, are promising observables to 
gain information about the initial state of the fluid-dynamical evolution and the transport properties of the hot and dense, strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Relics of Quark Hadron Phase Transition in the Microsecond Universe with a “little inflation”,"Sinha, Bikash","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, India",Unknown,"The conventional scenario to date of the quark hadron phase transition in the microsecond old universe is essentially guided by lattice calculation leading to a cross over from quarks to hadrons.

    However, it is entirely possible that Affleck – Dine mechanism of baryogenesis leading to a large baryon asymmetry is more natural than in other models along the route baryogenesis via leptogenesis. In this model [1]  the universe is assumed to begin with a large baryon chemical potential through an Affleck – Dine mechanism and then undergoes a “little (or tepid) inflation” after crossing the QCD first-order phase transition line, while remaining in a deconfined and a chirally symmetric phase. We exploit first order phase transition [2] and examine critically what could be the relics. Candidates such as “Strange Quark Nuggets” (SQN), even Dark energy and floating “orphan” quarks are going to be discussed.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The universality of eta/s,"Sinha, Bikash","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, India",Unknown,"ALICE, ATLAS and CMS detectors at LHC and previously PHENIX and STAR detectors at RHIC have provided
compelling evidence for higher order flow components apart from the elliptic flow v2. It is by now well established that
both RHIC and LHC have produced a ”perfect fluid” of Quark Gluon Plasma with eta/s close to zero, as predicted by
AdS/CFT limit. One expects that higher order harmonics and in particular triangular flow v3 will constrain eta/s more
precisely. Although, the particle density per participant pair at 2.76 TEV (LHC) is a factor of 2.15 higher than at
RHIC, eta/s remain almost the same going from RHIC to LHC. It is known that [1] eta/s / 1/g4 and 1/g2  [ln(T/T )]2,
thus /s becomes and increasing function of the temperature. However, a simple [2] estimate indicates, that the initial
temperature for eta/s 0.08 changes from 360 MeV for RHIC to 530 MeV for LHC. Given the logarithmic dependence
of /s on the temperature, it is almost natural that /s at LHC (2.76 TeV) does not changes perceptibly going from
RHIC to LHC [3]. Our prediction is that even for the highest energy of LHC, eta/s will not change perceptably.
The second great puzzle is the universality of /s  1/4, applicable across a large number of phenomena, dra-
matically different from each other. Ultracold quantum degenerate strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, Graphene,
even Giant resonances in finite nuclei exhibit the same behavior of /s  1/4. It is remarkable that both the coldest
and hottest matter on earth are rather similar. This universaility is a direct consequence of strong coupling due to
many body interaction leading to observable correlation. This observation will be presented.

Thus the primary charm quark momentum distribution will be modified, as well as the final state hadron distributions and the baryon-to-meson ratios in different momentum windows.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Is the event plane dependent modification to jet-like correlations due to analysis biases or jet-medium interactions?,"Konzer, Joshua",Unknown,Unknown,"The STAR results [1] from dihadron correlations as a function of the high-pt trigger azimuth relative to the event plane (phi_s) show a significant change from in-plane (phi_s~0) to out-of-plane direction (phi_s~90 degree). The near-side correlation is composed of two components: the jet-like correlation and the ridge; The former is found to be invariant over phi_s while the ridge is primarily observed in-plane. On the other hand, the away-side ""double hump"" is present only out-of-plane. It has been found that the recently characterized triangular flow does not change the qualitative conclusions [1]. However, the question remains, whether the observed phi_s dependent modification is due to analysis biases in flow background subtraction or jet-medium interactions.

In this talk we analyze high-pt triggered dihadron correlations relative to the event plane in the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) parton cascade model. The AMPT model, with its string melting, has been previously shown to reproduce some of the global phenomena seen in heavy-ion collisions, specifically flow [2]. We first obtain the near-side jet-like correlations from the difference of large and small delta-eta azimuthal correlations and find AMPT does not reproduce the STAR data. We then analyze the large delta-eta azimuthal correlation by subtraction of v2, v3, and v4 harmonic flows. The vn harmonic flows are obtained from two- and four-particle cumulant method and compared to the true average<vn>   calculated using the initial geometry harmonic planes in AMPT. We assess the non-flow contributions in vn by the newly developed decomposition method [3], and address possible biases in our AMPT correlation analysis. We discuss their implications to the STAR data by comparing the vn subtracted event plane dependent dihadron correlations in AMPT to the STAR results. We discuss the remaining effects of jet-medium interactions in AMPT.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Suppression of D-mesons production at relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Begum, Umme Jamil","Debraj Roy College, Golaghat, Assam, India",Unknown,"Charm quarks/antiquarks produced in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions, would traverse the quark gluon plasma, colliding with quarks and gluons and radiating gluons before appearing as D-mesons. Thus the final spectra of D-mesons would contain information of the medium modification suffered by the charm quarks/antiquarks. We have made a detailed study for the nuclear modification factor of production of D-mesons from the initial fusion of partons in a nuclear collision at RHIC and LHC energies. 
As a first step, we made a comparative study of some of the energy loss formalisms of charm quarks/antiquarks available in the literature with the same initial conditions [1]. 
We consider both the radiative and collision energy loss along with longitudinal expansion of the plasma for the prediction of nuclear modification factor. As at RHIC and LHC energies, parton densities reach very high values leading to effective nuclear shadowing, we use the modified structure functions due to shadowing effect given by EKS98 group, in 1998 [2]. Peterson fragmentation function [3] is used for fragmentation of Charm quarks/antiquarks into D-mesons.
 We have seen that our result can satisfactorily explain the ALICE experimental data for nuclear modification of D-mesons at Pb+Pb collision @ 2.76 ATeV. The result with a recent radiative energy loss calculation [4] has an increasing trend at high transverse momentum and explains the nuclear modification for transverse momentum up to 15 GeV very well. The inclusion of collisional energy loss of charm quarks/antiquarks further suppresses the muclear modification factor of D-mesons.

Poster Session Reception,poster,How does longitudinal drag change the radiative energy loss rate?,"Qin, Guang-You",Duke University/Wayne State University,USA,"Jets propagating through dense matter are modified due to the scattering between the patrons of the jet with the constituents of the medium. Such scattering leads to an exchange of momenta between the medium and the jet, and has components that are both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of jet propagation. These scatterings introduce both drag and diffusion, and also change the rate of parton splitting leading to radiative energy loss. In all current calculations of jet modification, only the effect of transverse scattering (quantified by $\hat{q}$) on stimulated emission has been considered. The effect of longitudinal exchange, leading to a drag and diffusion of the produced patrons, is included separately. We compute, for the first time, the gluon emission rate from a hard quark in the presence of both transverse and longitudinal exchange. Depending on the size of the longitudinal drag and diffusion coefficients, longitudinal scattering is shown to influence the radiative energy loss of a hard quark in a dense medium in a non-intuitive way.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Quantum Description of Impurities - Heavy Quarks and Quarkonia,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Nagoya University,United States,"Single heavy quark system has been considered as a hard probe for dynamical information of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), namely drag force, while heavy quarkonium has been thought to probe static information, such as heavy quark potential. However, this intuitive picture is not correct, in particular for the latter. Recent theoretical developments have shown that dynamical feature is also important in the physics of heavy quarkonia through complex heavy quark potential [1]. This complex potential can be understood as stochastic process in the medium [2]. However, as pointed out in [2], complete description must also explain the irreversible process, which results in drag force in the classical limit. In other words, a unified description of heavy quark systems is required.
In this presentation, I will develop such a quantum description for heavy quark systems in QGP on the basis of closed-time formalism in non-equilibrium field theory. In this description, I will explain how we can obtain the stochastic process and the drag force from the first principle and derive the master equation for quantum evolution of the heavy quark systems.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Theory and phenomenology of quarkyonic percolation of finite density QCD matter,"Torrieri, Giorgio","JW Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt",Unknown,"We generalize the percolating transition discovered in [1] to the full phase diagram, exploring the onset of ""quarkyonic percolation"" for SU(N) Yang-Mills matter when baryon density, temperature and number of colors are varied.
We show that percolation's dependence on number of colors is  different from deconfinement, suggesting that the two phases are generally distinct, with the percolating phase being similar to the quarkyonic phase conjectured in [2].  
We find that, in our world (3 colors, 2-3 flavors) a percolating but confined phase can arise at 2-3 times nuclear density and moderate temperature.    The new phase is confined and contains baryons, yet quark-hole states can propagate to arbitrary distances due to the onset of percolation of tunneling transitions across baryons.
We conclude by sketching an effective theory of percolating matter, and suggesting experimental signatures of it in lower energy heavy ion collisions (FAIR,NICA and the RHIC low energy scan) as well as within neutron stars and supernovae.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The Micro-Vertex-Detector of the CBM-Experiment,"Tischler, Tobias","Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt",Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) is one of the core experiments of the future FAIR facility at Darmstadt/Germany. The experiment will explore the phase diagram of hadronic matter in the regime of highest baryon densities. Nuclear fireballs created in heavy ion collisions of 8-45 AGeV beam energy will be studied with numerous probes, among them open charm.
Reconstructing those rare probes requires a vacuum compatible micro vertex detector (MVD) with unprecedented properties. Its sensor technology has to feature a spatial resolution of <5μm, a radiation tolerance of >10e13 n/cm² and a time resolution of few 10 μs. The detector station must combine an active cooling of the sensors
(~1W/cm²) with a material budget below few 0.1% radiation length.
To match those requirements, we rely on the CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors provided by the IPHC Strasbourg. The highly granular and 50 μm thin sensors will be mounted on a cooling support made from CVD diamond. This support drives the dissipated power to a heat sink outside the detector acceptance. The readout of the
sensors will be done by means of ultra-thin flex print cables.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Inhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram and cooling of hybrid stars,"Tatsumi, Toshitaka","Department of Physics, Kyoto University",Unknown,"Recently there has been much discussed the appearance of inhomogeneous chiral phases in the vicinity of the chiral restoration [1,2]. The critical end point should be the Lifshitz point, which properties have not been explored so much.Here we discuss an implication of inhomogeneous phase on cooling of hybrid stars.
We consider the dual-chiral-density-wave (DCDW) specified by the spatially modulated quark condensates with amplitude \Delta and wave number q [1], and study the beta decay of quarks. Since the DCDW state can be represented as a chirally rotated state, the quark weak-current is accordingly transformed to have an additional phase factor which modifies the energy-momentum conservation at the vertex. The direct evaluation of the neutrino luminosity shows that it is proportional to \Delta^2q^2T^6, which exhibits a similar form to the pion cooling [3]. Since the DCDW phase develops only in the limited density region, this novel mechanism may give an interesting scenario that lower mass stars should be cooler than heavy-mass ones, which has been also proposed to explain the recent data of Cas A in the context of color superconductivity [4].

Poster Session Reception,poster,Morphology of High-Multiplicity Events in Heavy Ion Collisions,"Gaardhoje, Jens Jorgen",Niels Bohr Institute,Unknown,"We discuss opportunities that may arise from subjecting high-multiplicity events in relativistic heavy ion collisions to an analysis similar to the one used in cosmology for the study of fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). To this end, we discuss examples of how pertinent features of heavy ion collisions including global characteristics, signatures of collective flow and event-wise fluctuations are visually represented in a Mollweide projection commonly used in CMB analysis, and how they are statistically analyzed in an expansion over spherical harmonic functions. If applied to the characterization of purely azimuthal dependent phenomena such as collective flow, the expansion coefficients of spherical harmonics are seen to contain redundancies compared to the set of harmonic flow coefficients commonly used in heavy ion collisions. Our exploratory study indicates, however, that these redundancies may offer novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of those event-wise fluctuations that remain after subtraction of the dominant collective flow signatures. By construction, the proposed approach allows also for the characterization of more complex collective phenomena like higher-order flow and other sources of fluctuations, and it may be extended to the characterization of phenomena of non-collective origin such as jets.

at long times the equations of motion should contain a second-order

that the asymptotic solution of this theory valid at times much larger

The challenge is to keep high efficiencies (above 90%) and good time resolutions (less than 80ps) at particle fluxes up to 20kHz/cm2, which is not accessible to conventional float-glass MRPCs. For this purpose, a type of low-resistivity doped glass with bulk resistivity on the order of 1010 Ωcm was produced at Tsinghua University. Several high-rate prototypes based on this material have been developed and tested in beam.
In the current conceptual design, the whole CBM-TOF wall is arranged in four “rate regions”. In the inner region of the wall (region 1), pad readout MRPCs based on low-resistive glass can be efficiently used to cope with the high particle fluxes and granularities (above 20 kHz/cm2), while strip-readout MRPCs represent a natural choice for the outer region where the system occupancy is orders of magnitude lower. Recently, our effort is to realistically adapt the MRPC geometry to suit the conceptual design of the TOF wall. Two kinds of real-size MRPC modules made of low-resistivity doped glass were developed, and beam tested were performed both with protons at the Electron Linac with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) facility at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). 
We summarize here the results from the latest beam test of the two real-size modules at ELBE facility at HZDR.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Systematic study of the dipolar flow associated with initial density fluctuations in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC within a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model,"Radhakrishnan, Sooraj Krishnan",State University of New York (US),USA,"The anisotropy associated with the initial dipole asymmetry in heavy ion collisions is studied via the first harmonic coefficient $v_{1,1}$ of the two-particle azimuthal angle correlations, within AMPT and HIJING model (AMPT is essentially HIJING + parton/hadron transport). For a broad selection of centrality, transverse momenta and pseudorapidity ($\eta$), a fitting method is used to decompose $v_{1,1}$ into a rapidity-even component, characterized by the Fourier coefficient $v_1$, and a global momentum conservation component. We found that the $v_{1,1}$ data from HIJING can be entirely described by the momentum conservation component, while description of the data from AMPT requires both components. This proves that the rapidity-even $v_1$ is indeed a collective phenomena transferred from initial dipole asymmetry by the strong final state interaction. The extracted $v_1$ values are negative for pT < 0.7-0.9 GeV, reach a maximum at 2-3 GeV, and decreases at higher pT. The $v_1$ values vary weakly with $\eta$ and centrality, but increase with collision energy, strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$) and parton cross-section ($\sigma$). We compare our results with ATLAS $v_1$ data extracted from same two-component fit [1]. This comparison allows us to constrain $\alpha_s$ and $\sigma$, and consequently the values of shear viscosity. We analyze the values of the extracted global momentum conservation component and compare with those calculated based on Borghini et.al. [2]; the comparison suggests that the effective size of the system that conserve momentum is about 1/3 of the total multiplicity of the event, also consistent with the ATLAS data. We then extract $v_1$ using the modified event plane method proposed by Luzum et.al. [3] and compared with those obtained from two-particle correlation. The differences between the two methods, and consequently the caveat for applying this event plane method to experimental analysis, are discussed. Finally, we extend our simulation to identified particles (proton, kaon and meson). This extension allows us to predict/test the constituent quark scaling which was only done before for higher-order harmonic flow. These studies represent a significant extension of our results presented in a recent publication [4].

Poster Session Reception,poster,Hot quarkonium spectral functions from QCD sum rules and the maximum entropy method,"Gubler, Philipp",RIKEN,Unknown,"Quarkonia spectral functions at finite temperature are studied

QCD sum rules incorporate finite temperature effects in form 
of changing values of the various gluonic condensates that appear

energy density and pressure at finite temperature, which we extract

Poster Session Reception,poster,Charge azimuthal correlations at RHIC and LHC energies,"Ma, Guo-Liang","Shanghai INstitute of Applied Physics (SINAP), CAS",Unknown,"With a multi-phase transport model including initial charge separation and string melting, the charge azimuthal correlations for Au+Au collisions at center of mass energies 200, 39, 11.5, 7.7 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV are investigated. Initial charge separations of about 10 % for 200 GeV, 5 % for 39 GeV, 0 % for 11.5 GeV appear to be necessary. This is consistent with decreasing Chiral Magnetic Effect as the incident energy decreases at RHIC. A reduced partonic interaction cross section is also needed for 11.5 GeV, indicating possible significant contributions from the hadronic stage. For Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV, 10% initial charge separation can produce similar behaviors as those at the top RHIC energy. We will also discuss how the same-charge correlation of <cos(1-2)> changes sign from negative at RHIC to positive at the LHC.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Charge dependent azimuthal correlations of K-Pi pairs at STAR,"Riley, Charles",Yale University,USA,"Three-particle correlations have been used to probe for local parity violation (LPV) in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed during Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC [1]. Further expanding on this analysis, we present our results on looking at these correlations through pairing kaons and pions produced during the collision events (while fixing the third particle to be another pion). The idea behind looking at kaon-pion (K-Pi) correlations is that the two-body correlations between these distinct particles are weaker than those between pions with themselves. It may be that the tendency of two pions to be emitted at small angles to one another can be an important ingredient in a strong interaction background [2]. Hence, looking at K-Pi correlations may reduce potential effects from such backgrounds and possibly other parity-even effects that may contribute to the three-particle correlator.

We present charge dependent azimuthal correlations between pions and kaons identified by using the Time-Of-Flight detector as a function of centrality, $\delta\eta$ and $\deltap_{T}$ between pairs in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Modifications depending on elliptic flow are also applied to the correlators as an additional measure to possibly reduce P-even background effects on the three-particle correlators.

Poster Session Reception,poster,High-pT direct photons in nuclear collisions: from RHIC to LHC,"Cepila, Jan",Czech Technical University (CZ),CZ,"We discuss a production of direct photons at large transverse momenta p_T in nuclear collisions at different energies and rapidities corresponding to RHIC and LHC experiments. Direct photons are very convenient tool for investigation of nuclear effects since 
they are not expected to be accompanied by any final state interaction, either energy loss or absorption. Therefore, besides the Cronin enhancement at medium-high p_T and small isotopic corrections at larger p_T, one should not expect any nuclear effects. However, data from the PHENIX experiment at mid-rapidities demonstrate a significant large-p_T suppression in central d+Au and Au+Au collisions that cannot be induced by coherent phenomena (gluon shadowing, Color Glass Condensate). We demonstrate that such an unexpected result is a subject to the energy conservation constraints (ECC) in initial state multiple parton interactions. The corresponding suppression factor falls steeply with p_T and leads to rather strong decrease with p_T of the nuclear modification factor violating so QCD factorization. In the RHIC kinematic region at forward rapidities we include also coherent phenomena as an additional source of nuclear suppression. In the LHC energy range ECC effects are irrelevant at mid-rapidities, but they are going to be important with increasing rapidity. We study for the first time a relative contribution of both sources of nuclear suppression at different rapidities performing predictions that could be verified in the future by experiments at RHIC and LHC. We analyze also a contribution of gluon shadowing as a leading twist shadowing correction modifying nuclear effects especially at small p_T.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jan', 'last_name': 'Cepila', 'fullName': 'Cepila, Jan', 'id': '314951', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University (CZ)', 'emailHash': '5d711c25063f3a6521f530f704b1a421', 'db_id': 314951, 'person_id': 343149}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Direct Photon and Lepton Pair Production from Viscous quark-gluon plasma,"Sinha, Bikash",V,Unknown,"We have studied the effect of shear viscosity effects on direct photons as well as lepton pair production from Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The production rate for both these two thermodynamic signals gets modified due to: (i) changed space-time evolution of the viscous fluid and (ii) non-equilibrium correction to the equilibrium distribution function. The non-equilibrium correction grows with viscosity as well as transverse momentum. Viscous effects on photon production are strong [1]. The space-time evolution of QGP was obtained by solving Israel-Stewart’s second order hydrodynamics for $\sqrt_{NN}$=200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Effect of viscosity is to stiffen the dilepton spectra and reduce the elliptic flow [2]. Although, the rate of applicability is limited in the pT range due to non-equilibrium effects, the thermometric signals can limit the initial temperature and viscosity, the ratios of dileptons to photons it is expected, can be a fairly good measure of viscosity without the uncertainty of initial conditions. Shear viscosity per entropy, it seems, does not change appreciably going from RHIC to LHC. We intend to explore this puzzle.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Strange Quark Nuggets as Baryonic Dark matter from the Relics of Cosmic QCD Phase transition,"Sinha, Bikash","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, India",Unknown,"The universe is assumed to begin with a large baryonic chemical potential acquired through an Affleck – Dine mechanism, which leads on to a baryon asymmetry of 0(1) without requiring superhigh temperatures. However, the observed baryon asymmetry of 0(10-10) at CMB temperature needs to emerge naturally from such a scenario. This is what could be achieved through a “little inflation” of about 7 e – folding leading to a QCD first order transition [1], while remaining in a deconfined and in a chirally symmetric phase. It was demonstrated [2] using chromoelectric flux-tube fission model that some strange quark “nuggets” (SQN) [3] with an initial baryon number ~ 1044  or more can survive the evaporation process and be stable on cosmological time scales. We demonstrate that these SQN’s are natural candidates for baryonic dark matter. We also argue that these SQNs, together with the natural requirement that the total baryon number of the universe is an integer [4], can explain the occurrence of the cosmological dark energy within the standard model of particle physics.

For this purpose, we have developed CHIMERA, a framework for performing global statistical evaluation of multiple QGP signatures by comparing key soft observables (spectra, HBT and elliptic flow) measured at LHC and RHIC to the results from our multi-stage hydrodynamics/hadron cascade model of heavy ion collision. The unique feature of CHIMERA is that both statistical and systematic uncertainties are used in the evaluation procedure, and these uncertainties are fully propagated in the
determination of the temperature and viscosity to entropy ratio.

The CHIMERA model incorporates different initial state conditions, pre-equilibrium flow, the UVH2+1 viscous hydro model, Cooper-Frye freezeout, and the UrQMD hadronic cascade model. For hydrodynamical evolution, several different equations of state (EoS) , including those derived from the hadron resonance gas model and lattice QCD, are used to test the sensitivity of the observables to a particular choice of EoS.

For a particular selection of initial conditions and pre-equilibrium flow we consider T_{init}-eta/s grid. For each grid point and a particular observable we evaluate the extent of agreement between the model and experimental data by calculating chi-squared values.

\maketitle

\preprint{ }
Event-by-event fluctuations in strangeness may reveal the nature of Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) phase transition and can be used as a probe for QCD critical point \cite{1}. Dynamical fluctuations in $K/\pi$ at lower beam energy were reported to increase with decreasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ \cite{2} while they remained constant at higher $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. STAR results for the study of $K/\pi$ fluctuations have been reported earlier for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 39, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV\cite{3,4}.The results have been found to be independent of beam energy. In this poster, we report new results on event-by-event fluctuations in $K/\pi$ at midrapidity from 19.6 and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions. The use of  Time Projection Chamber(TPC) and Time of Flight(TOF) detector allows particle identification up to $p_{T}$ $\sim${\it{1.6 GeV/c}}. The advantage of this large particle identification reach in momentum and using a collider facility for $K/\pi$ fluctuation studies will be discussed. The results will be compared with the prediction of a transport model(UrQMD) and statistical hadronization model \cite{5}.

Poster Session Reception,poster,A Study of High-pT/High-mass Dielectron Production through Trigger Combination in 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Jung, Kurt",Purdue University (US),USA,"Dileptons are unique probes of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Compared to hadrons, leptons have little interaction with the QGP medium and can thus travel through the entire system with most of the original information intact. This feature allows us to study the properties of the medium during its space-time evolution.  The low mass region (LMR, m < 1.1 GeV/c^2) is dominated by the decay of the vector mesons, in which chiral symmetry restoration in the medium can be studied. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, 1.1 < m < 3.0 GeV/c^2), the dominant dilepton sources are expected to be the thermal radiation of the QGP and the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Systematic measurements in both mass regions and at all pT are crucial in revealing the medium's properties.  Finally, high-pT dileptons in particular allow measurements of direct photons and of spectrum enhancements in the LMR.

To observe the dilepton production at high pT, it is necessary to utilize the data from the high-pT triggers in conjunction with the minimum-bias trigger.  These dielectron measurements are made using data from the STAR time projection chamber, time of flight, and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter (BEMC) at midrapidity.  In this poster, we present a study on the dielectron production in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions recorded by the STAR detector in 2010 using a novel combination of the minimum-bias trigger and three high-pT triggers with different energy thresholds in the BEMC.  Because the mass spectrum from each high-pT trigger is biased, we apply an effective weight to each dielectron pair based on the trigger threshold and scale factor.  Finally, we combine the weighted results from all four triggers.  The analysis details and associated mass spectra will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kurt', 'last_name': 'Jung', 'fullName': 'Jung, Kurt', 'id': '314966', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University (US)', 'emailHash': '662f67b3dc3c07c49324873e9c1e0c10', 'db_id': 314966, 'person_id': 343615}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,How do Jets Affect the Collective Flow of the Quark-Gluon Plasma?,"Andrade, Rone",Universidade de São Paulo USP,Unknown,"In this work we study how highly energetic jets affect the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in an  event-by-event basis. This is done by the introduction of a source term [1] in the energy-momentum conservation equation that describes the evolution of inviscid hydrodynamics (with a realistic equation of state [2]). The source is parametrized in terms of the direction of the jet in the medium and its energy loss rate. The influence of jets on the QGP collective flow is systematically investigated using the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal flow distribution computed at both RHIC and LHC energies. In addition, we discuss the structure of the two-particle correlation function taking into account both initial state fluctuations [3,4] and the effects of jets. While the propagation of jets in a smooth QGP has been extensively studied before, the interplay between the different sources of flow anisotropy (i.e, initial state fluctuations and jets) studied in this work poses some new questions about the hydrodynamical evolution of the QGP. For instance, can Mach cones consistently form in an event-by-event basis? Do the highly high energetic jets present at LHC lead to novel structures in the two-particle correlation function? In this presentation we intend to shed some light on such questions.

The vacuum spectral functions are constructed to agree with tau decay data and Weinberg sum rules. In the medium, the rho spectral function is
taken from effective hadronic many-body theory which is consistent with available dilepton data. The in-medium properties of the rho' are constrained by satisfying the in-medium QCD sum rule.

The measurement of the long range rapidity correlations of the produced particle multiplicities may give us insight into the space-time dynamics of the early stages of the collision.

We report on short and long-range multiplicity correlations for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9, 2.76 and 7.0 TeV in the ALICE experiment for minimum bias as well as for high multiplicity events. This measurement utilizes an absolute coordinate system and preserves the actual spatial separation of the particles. The F-B correlation strengths at 7 TeV for minimum bias events are compared to those of 0-10\% Au+Au collisions at 0.2 TeV from RHIC. Comparison to different event generators will be made. Beam energy dependence of the correlation strengths from ISR, Fermilab to LHC energies will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sudipan', 'last_name': 'De', 'fullName': 'De, Sudipan', 'id': '314980', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': '3bb34873415b04f98259ab0931a71542', 'db_id': 314980, 'person_id': 343622}"

The unmodified photon is used as a reference for the modification of the jet energy by the medium. The low cross section of QCD Compton scattering that produces direct photon - quark pairs added with the enormous production of the background photons requires large amount of Au+Au events to allow a measurement with convincing statistical certainty. In 2010 (Run 10) PHENIX has collected 8.2 billion events of Au+Au collision with 200 GeV of center-of-mass energy per nucleon, a factor of 1.5 times larger than the same collision system collected in 2007 (Run 7). Improvement can also be achieved by event-by-event based methods that would reject large number of the background photons and thus increase the signal-to-background ratio.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Background-subtraction procedure for the measurement of the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour decay electrons in ALICE,"Rascanu, Bogdan Theodor",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.,Germany,"In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, charm and beauty quarks are a sensitive tool to probe the flavour and mass dependence of the parton interaction with the medium created in such interactions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma.
The level of thermalization of heavy quarks can be studied via the azimuthal anisotropy of their emission in the transverse plane, the elliptic flow v2, at low transverse momentum. At high pt, v2 provides insight on the path length dependence of parton energy-loss. 
One channel to measure the heavy-flavour v2 is semi-electronic decays of hadrons carrying a charm or a beauty quark.
ALICE recorded Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV at the end of 2010 and 2011.
The presented poster will focus on the method to subtract the background electron contribution in the measurement of the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour decay electrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with ALICE at mid-rapidity.
The elliptic flow of inclusive electrons is measured with the event plane method. At high pt the contribution of electrons from heavy-flavour decays is expected to be dominant, whereas at low pt most electrons come from Dalitz decays of pi0 and gamma conversions in the detector material. A Monte Carlo simulation, based on the measured elliptic flow and pt distributions of the main background sources, is performed to estimate the contribution from known background electrons. The knowledge of the ratio of inclusive electrons to the known background electrons allows to subtract the background cocktail from the inclusive electron v2 and obtain the heavy flavour decay electron v2.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bogdan Theodor', 'last_name': 'Rascanu', 'fullName': 'Rascanu, Bogdan Theodor', 'id': '314988', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.', 'emailHash': '2be53f5687c76f11229294d59b8bc88c', 'db_id': 314988, 'person_id': 343626}"

Charm survives the QGP evolution and as hadrons emerge in soft hadronization  processes, practically every charm or anticharm quark turns into a charmed hadron, small fraction of the charm yield enters multi-charmed hadrons and charmonium states. We assume that in the hadronization process the single charmed hadrons production is governed by the available phase space and their yield is normalized by the total single charm hadron yield. By allowing for charm hadron to charm hadron decay cascades, we establish total fraction of single charm hadrons found in their ground states. We  show that the yields of charmed mesons can help to determine the charm  hadronization temperature. We further cascade single charmed  hadrons into non-charmed hadrons and show that at LHC these cascade products add  significant fraction to certain strange hadron yields.We discuss particularly interesting examples such as  phi (bar s s) and Xi(ssq).

Calculations then account for variations in path length with jet origin and direction, and most recently also for fluctuations in the medium density (lumpiness), which give rise to fluctuations in energy loss that significantly affect high-pT observables such as the nuclear suppression R_AA or the momentum anisotropies v_n.

Upton, NY 11973-5000, USA

The fact that the multiplicity density in A+A collisions increases faster than the number of participants has led to the popular formula $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/d\eta}=\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{pp}/d\eta} [x N_{\rm part}/2 +(1-x) N_{\rm coll}]$ with the implication that point-like hard-scattering contributes to the total charge multiplicity or $\sum E_T$ distributions. For $\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV $\bar{p}-p$ collisions, the UA2 collaboration~\cite{UA2PLB165} measured that the hard-scattering component of $\sum E_T$ distributions only becomes apparent at the level of $\sim 1/500$ the total cross-section, clearly indicating that the contribution of hard-process to the multiplicity and $\sum E_T$ distributions is negligible. The universal behavior of $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/(0.5N_{\rm part}d\eta)}$ as a function of $N_{\rm part}$ at RHIC and LHC over the range $7\leq \sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq 2760$ GeV, in spite of the dramatic increase in the ratio of $N_{\rm coll}/N_{\rm part}$ due to the increasing N-N interaction cross section, is another indication. Finally, an $E_T$ distribution which satisfies the popular formula for $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/d\eta}$ will be demonstrated and shown to look nothing like any measured $\sum E_T$ distribution. A more reasonable nuclear geometrical description has been given previously~\cite{Voloshin,De,Nouicer} and will be tested with recent data.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Photon and Dilepton Emission from the Hadronization Process in Heavy Ion Collisions,"Chen, Guangyao","Cyclotron Insitute and Department of Physics&Astronomy, Texas A&M University",USA,A new source of photon and dilepton emission from nuclear matter undergoing phase transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is studied. Electromagnetic radiation can be emitted when quark antiquark pairs recombine into pions and other hadrons. The photon and dilepton production rates are found to be comparable to those in quark gluon plasma and hadronic matter around the critical temperature. We compute the photon and dilepton yields from such processes for Au+Au collision at RHIC(\sqrt{s}=200GeV) by convoluting the rates with a hydrodynamic simulation of the system. A comparison of the results to PHENIX and STAR measurements shows that dileptons from hadronization processes could partially explain the excess of low mass dilepton. The transverse momentum spectrum exhibits a smaller effective temperature than the QGP contribution. The elliptic flow of dileptons from the hadronization process behaves similar to the elliptic flow of dileptons from hadronic matter.  Photon yields from these processes are not found to be important compared to QGP emission.,"{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guangyao', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Guangyao', 'id': '315043', 'affiliation': 'Cyclotron Insitute and Department of Physics&Astronomy, Texas A&M University', 'emailHash': 'ca7cf172e99908117bb48d4bb36caa48', 'db_id': 315043, 'person_id': 343654}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Charge Asymmetry Dependency of $\pi^+/\pi^-$ Azimuthal Anisotropy in Au + Au Collisions at STAR,"Ke, Hongwei",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"A recent theoretical study indicates that a chiral magnetic wave at finite baryon density could induce an electric quadrupole moment in the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. The quadrupole deformation will lead to a difference in azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$, between positive and negative pions, and the magnitude of this difference is predicted to be proportional to net charge asymmetry. The net charge asymmetry is defined as $(N_+ - N_-)/(N_+ + N_-)$, while $N_+ (N_-)$ is the number of positive (negative) particles.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dissipative Hydrodynamic Evolution of the QGP at Finite Baryon Density,"Monnai, Akihiko",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"The first results of the heavy ion program at LHC [1] suggest that the near-perfect fluidity discovered at RHIC is a universal property of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) above and around the crossover temperature. The recent developments in hydrodynamic studies take account of the effects of shear and bulk viscosities as well as fluctuations for the quantitative understanding of the hot medium. On the other hand, net baryon number is neglected in most of the modern hydrodynamic analyses even though it is fully conserved at forward rapidity. Since the net baryon carries valuable information on the remnant of the colliding nuclei and thus on the magnitude of kinetic energy loss for the QGP production in the yet-unknown early thermalization stage, the next task for hydrodynamic analyses should be to incorporate finite baryon density.

In this study, I develop a novel dissipative hydrodynamic model with finite net baryon density to investigate the net baryon rapidity distributions at RHIC and LHC [2]. Baryon dissipation is taken into account together with shear and bulk viscosities by a generalized second order theory [3]. The state-of-art lattice QCD equation of state and the color glass type initial conditions are employed. The results show that the net baryon is carried to forward rapidity during the hydrodynamic evolution, which implies that the experimentally observed transparency of the collision at RHIC [4] is effectively enhanced. This indicates that the kinetic energy loss for the production of the hot medium at the initial stage is larger, and then a part of the energy is transferred back to the net baryon components through the strong medium interaction. Furthermore, the net baryon distribution is found sensitive to baryon diffusion as well as to viscosities. This opens a possibility of constraining all the transport coefficients experimentally, including the ones at finite density such as baryon diffusion coefficient and thermo-diffusion cross coefficient. The results indicate that the dissipative hydrodynamic modeling would be important for extracting unique properties of the hot medium even in the high-energy collisions.

Nevertheless, in most of studies, the hard probes were assumed to be created at the late time within the thermalized medium. To understand the thermalization of the medium and its influence on high-energy probes generated in the early time in the strongly-coupled scenario would entail further investigations. In the gravity dual, the thermalization of the medium corresponds to the gravitational collapse and the formation of a black hole. We utilize the AdS-Vaidya metric, which describes a falling mass shell, to analyze the isotropic thermalization. In WKB approximation, the dissipation of a high-energy jet traversing the medium can be characterized by the stopping distance of a massless particle falling along the null geodesic in the gravity dual. We find the stopping distance of an energetic probe in AdS-Vaidya spacetime is equal to that in AdS-Schwarzschild spacetime, which implies that a probe with the energy much greater than the thermalization temperature is not be sensitive to the thermalization process, at least in this idealized scenario. This is different from a gluon probe with finite energy represented by a falling string in the gravity dual, where the stopping distance is governed by the null geodesic starting below the boundary.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Conventional effects in higher cumulant ratios of conserved charges in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Wu, Yuanfang","Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, wuhan China",Unknown,"Higher cumulant ratios of conserved charges are suggested to be sensitive probe of QCD critical end point [1] in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Their behaviors at current relativistic heavy ion collisions are highly interested and studied intensively [2,3]. Before we draw the critical-like fluctuations from the measured higher cumulants, it is necessary to know what the contributions of conventional effects are.  
    In the present work, we firstly derive the Poisson-like statistical fluctuations of net-proton number [4], and net-electric charge. It shows that net-proton kurtosis at top incident energy of RHIC [3] is dominated by Poisson-liked statistical fluctuations [4]. So dynamical higher moments, subtracting the statistical parts, are suggested.  
    Secondly, the influences of the centrality, the efficiency of the detector, and the cuts of transverse momentum (pT) and rapidity in higher cumulant ratios of net-proton are systematically studied by using the sample of Au + Au collisions at 39GeV generated by APMT default model. It is found: (1) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are sensitive to the definitions of centrality. (2) Dynamical cumulant ratios are little efficiency dependent. (3) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are the cuts of phase-space dependent.

Poster Session Reception,poster,A direct measure of anisotropic velocity in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Wu, Yuanfang","Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, Wuhan China",Unknown,"The radial flow parameters are important quantities in relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. They constrain the equation of state [2] and in particular, the anisotropic parameter relates to shear viscosity [3]. They are usually extracted from the spectrum of transverse momentum by the parameterizations of Blast-wave model [4]. 
    In the present work, we suggest a direct measure of radial velocity, i.e., microscopic average velocity of freeze-out particles in azimuthal plane. It contains three parts: average radial expansion velocity, average anisotropic velocity (the amplitude of modulation in radial expansion velocity as function of the relative angle to the reaction plane), and average thermal velocity. 
     Using the sample of Au+ Au collisions at 200 GeV produced by AMPT with string melting model, we demonstrate that this microscopic average velocity is well fitted by two parts: an average isotropic velocity, and an average anisotropic velocity, which is azimuthal angle dependent. This form of radial velocity is the same as theoretically expected radial flow parameterization [5]. But the difference is that the average isotropic velocity contains the contributions of thermal motion. From the particle species dependence of the average isotropic velocity, we demonstrate that the heavier the mass of the particles, the smaller the isotropic velocity is. It is just the character of thermal motion. 
      Fortunately, average thermal velocity is isotropic and therefore has no contribution toward the average anisotropic velocity. In order to confirm this, the centrality dependence of average radial velocity is presented. We find that its anisotropic part is close to zero when the collisions approach to the central ones. It shows indeed no anisotropic velocity in an ideal central collision. 
       Moreover, we carefully extract kinetic freeze-out parameters in the same sample by fitting pt spectrum and elliptic flow using the parameterization of blast-wave model [4,6]. It is found that the average anisotropic velocity is well coincident with the anisotropic flow velocity extracted by blast-wave model. Furthermore, the centrality dependence of average anisotropic velocity is also consistent with that of extracted from the Blast-wave model. So microscopic average anisotropic velocity of final state particles is a good approximation of anisotropic flow velocity.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Chiral phase transition in a dynamical linear sigma model.,"Wesp, Christian",Goethe Universität Frankfurt,Unknown,"One of today's main goals in high energy physics is the exploration of the phase diagram of nuclear matter.
On the theoretical side, much effort has been put into the investigation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), its phase diagramm and symmetries.

An important property of the QCD Lagrangian is its approximate chiral symmetry in the light-quark sector. At low temperatures and density this approximate symmetry is also spontaneously broken, while at higher temperatures and/or densities a chiral-symmetry restoring phase transition is expected. Collider experiments at LHC (CERN) probe the phase diagramm at high energy densities and low chemical and baryon chemical potentials, where the chiral phase transition is expected to be a cross over. Future experiments at FAIR (GSI) probe the region with high chemical potential, where a lower-order phase transition is expected.

We use a dynamical 3+1D linear sigma model with constituent quarks to examine the evolution of equilibrium and non-equilibrium  scenarios. In a first attempt we employ a mean-field ansatz which reproduces the thermodynamical properties of the linear sigma model. To investigate fluctuating observables like the quark- and baryon-density at and near the phase transition, the model is extended with scattering processes between the quark quasi-particles and the chiral fields.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Event-by-Event Fluctuations in Initial Conditions in Relativistic Hydrodynamic Model,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks
and gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are
performed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries is that elliptic flow v_2
was comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,
that a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at
temperature of a few hundreds MeV was established. Recently, the higher
harmonics v_n (n > 2) are observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of
theoretical and experimental interests. Initial condition with
fluctuation from initial nucleon distribution in colliding nuclei is
attributed to one of the major origins of the higher harmonics.

To understand detailed mechanism of how the higher harmonics develop, we
construct an integrated dynamical framework based on relativistic
hydrodynamics [1] and perform massive numerical simulations (10^5
minimum bias events) on an event-by-event basis [2]. In this framework,
the Monte-Carlo versions of factorized Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (fKLN) model
(MC-KLN) and Glauber model (MC-Glauber) are employed as the
initialization models. After describing hydrodynamic evolution of the
matter using fully (3+1) dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, we treat the
subsequent dynamics of hadron gas using a hadron cascade model, JAM.
Using the obtained momentum distribution of the final hadrons, we
finally analyze the harmonics v_n in a way that experimental people
perform the flow analysis such as event plane method, multi-particle
cumulant method. We compare these results with the conventional
theoretically-obtained harmonics with respect to reaction plane or
participant plane to investigate the systematic uncertainty in the
conventional theoretical results. We found that v_n obtained in this way
depends on the flow analysis model, which means the importance of
consistent comparison between theoretical results with experimental
data. We also calculate v_n as a function of centrality using the MC-KLN
and MC-Glauber initialization and found differences of v_2, v_4 and v_5
between these two models. This indicates the simultaneous analysis of
several harmonics would discriminate between the initialization models.

In the clustering of color sources (CSPM) the charged particle transverse momentum spectrum is used to measure the percolation density parameter $\xi$, which determines the initial temperature T, energy density $\epsilon$, and the $\eta/s$ ratio versus T in Au+Au collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV . 
For 0.9 $T_{c} < T < $1.2  $T_{c}$ ($T_{c}$  = 167.7 MeV), the sound velocity $C_{s}^{2}$ from the mass less non interacting constituent version of CSPM agrees with Lattice QCD (LQCD)$C_{s}^{2}$ values . For T$ >$ 1.2$T_{c}$  there is a significant difference with the LQCD  values\cite{eos}. 

The measured CSPM value for $\eta/s$ = 0.20, at 1.15$T_{c}$  is consistent with a strongly coupled QGP and increases with T. The Trace Anomaly $\triangle $ is defined as $(\epsilon-3p)/T^{4}$.
Above $T_{c}$, the LQCD $\triangle $ and the reciprocal of $\eta/s$ fall off with 1/T. At $T_{c}$ , $s/\eta$ has a magnitude of  $\sim$5.5 , non interacting - CSPM  has a  $\triangle\sim$ 5.5  and LQCD $\triangle \sim $5.5.   The change in $\triangle$ and $s/\eta$  with 1/T describes the transition from a strongly to weakly coupled QGP. Above $T_{c}$,  $s/\eta$ and the LQCD $\triangle$ may have the same underlying structure.  The $C_{s}^{2}$ values for the QGP obtained using the  $s/\eta \sim 5.5$  version of CSPM above  $T_{c}$ are in excellent agreement with LQCD \cite{wupp, hotqcd}.

Dielectrons also probe the production of thermal photons in heavy-ion collisions.
ALICE is well-suited to perform this measurement due to its excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities at very low momenta. However, Dalitz decays and photon conversions lead to a high combinatorial background. Additionally, coincident semi-leptonic decays of charm and anti-charm hadrons produce a continuum signal, which dominates over a thermal dielectron signal.
Both contributions can be reduced by an improved Inner Tracking System, to be installed during LHC's long shutdown (2018). It will further improve the tracking efficiency at low p_t and provide excellent detection capabilities for electrons from secondary vertices like conversions and heavy-quark decays. The expected impact of a new ITS on the low-mass dielectron measurement in pp and Pb-Pb collisions will be presented.
To further increase the acceptance for low p_t tracks, a reduction of the magnetic field in the ALICE central barrel from 0.5 T to 0.2 T is considered.

At low momenta, thermal emission, which would provide the ideal measurement of temperature of the quark-gluon plasma, is expected to dominate over other sources of direct photons. However, since the fraction of thermal photon is small, the measurement of direct photons is notoriously difficult due to the large background from hadronic decay photons.

The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is under consideration by the ALICE Experiment to be part of its programme of detectors upgrade to be installed during the LHC shutdown planned for 2018. The MFT is a silicon pixel detector added in the Muon Spectrometer acceptance ($2.5 < \eta < 4$) upstream of the hadron absorber. The MFT will allow a dramatic improvement of the measurements that are presently done with the Muon Spectrometer and, in addition, will give access to new measurements that are not possible with the present Muon Spectrometer set-up. The enhanced pointing accuracy gained by the muon tracks will significantly improve the mass resolution for the low mass resonances $\omega$ and $\phi$, as well as $-$ to a lesser extent $-$ for the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$. The measurement of these resonances down to low $p_\mathrm{T}$ in heavy-ion collisions represents a unique feature at the LHC. The precise measurement of the offset for the muon tracks will also permit a model-independent identification of open charm ($c\tau \sim 150~\mu$m) and beauty ($c\tau \sim 500~\mu$m) production, including displaced vertices related to $J/\psi$ production from $b$. In addition, the MFT will help to reject a large fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over background ratio for all the observables. In order to establish the physics performances achievable at the luminosities expected after 2018, realistic simulations of the MFT setup are being performed within the AliRoot framework. Detailed results will be shown on the physics performances, including background treatment and rejection, for the measurement of low mass neutral mesons and the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ resonances down to low $p_\mathrm{T}$, in central Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.5$~TeV.

Since high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC can be utilized as the exotic hadron factories [1], they would also provide information on exotic interactions such as Lambda-Lambda, Lambda-Sigma, Lambda-Xi interactions, which are important to understand neutron star matter EOS. We have analyzed recent STAR data [2] and find that small negative scattering length (1/a_0 < -1 fm^{-1}) and large effective range (r_{eff} > 3 fm) are favored for Lambda-Lambda interaction [3]. This is consistent with quark model interaction (fss2), recent boson exchange potential (NSC97), and old boson exchange potentials (ND, NF) with large hard-core radius. In the presentation, we first discuss how precisely we can constrain Lambda-Lambda interaction from heavy-ion data.

The suppression of electron yields from semi-leptonic decays of D and B mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC has been observed to be large. Because of the dead-cone effect, heavy quarks are expected to loose less energy than light quarks if the dominant energy loss mechanism is gluon radiation.  The suppression expected on the basis of energy loss depends on the relative contribution of D and B hadrons to the total yield. Therefore, it is important to separate these contributions.
The relative contribution of beauty decays to the total electron yield from heavy flavour decays can be isolated by looking at azimuthal correlation between these electrons and charged hadrons, exploiting the different decay kinematics of D and B hadrons.

The hydrodynamic bulk evolution is quantitatively constrained by bulk and multi-strange hadron spectra and elliptic flow [2]. In the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase, heavy-quark diffusion coefficients are taken from a non-perturbative $T$-matrix approach. The latter leads to resonance formation close to Tc which is implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface. In the hadronic phase, the diffusion of HF mesons is obtained from effective hadronic theory [3]. We compute observables at RHIC and LHC for both HF mesons and non-photonic electrons. In particular, we suggest the R_AA and v_2 of the D_s mesons as a unique observable due to the coupling of charm to the strangeness enhancement in AA collisions [4], which allows to quantitatively test key components of our approach, including recombination and hadronic diffusion effects.

The measurable observables that can provide information about thermalization and collective flow are the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles. The expansion rate at “thermal freeze-out” provides the nuclear collision analogue of the Hubble constant for the Big Bang, while the corresponding freeze-out temperature parallels the temperature of the cosmic microwave background at the point of photon decoupling. 

In this work we will make an estimate of a Hubble parameter for relativistic nuclear collisions similar to cosmological Hubble constant, based on temporal connections between the evolution of nuclear matter produced in a relativistic heavy ion collision and the Universe evolution after the Big Bang. We will present  experimental data obtained in Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies and will compare with the same parameters obtained from simulated data at future CBM-FAIR energies.  

We will investigate the freeze-out process in heavy ion collisions at CBM-FAIR energies and we will present a study of blast-wave fits performed to the transverse momentum spectra obtained from simulated heavy ion collisions using the most important simulation codes from this field. In addition, comparisons with results from Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies will be presented to provide more detailed insight into the properties of the space-time evolution such as collective dynamics of the dense matter. We will compare the freeze-out kinetic parameters obtained from experimental data at RHIC energies with the same parameters obtained from simulated data at future CBM-FAIR energies using the most important simulation codes from this field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alexandru', 'last_name': 'Jipa', 'fullName': 'Jipa, Alexandru', 'id': '315161', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest', 'emailHash': '6424e0c6ae7dcb95c92e4c829b2594ea', 'db_id': 315161, 'person_id': 343727}"

Also the published pT spectra of bulk hadrons (at RHIC) have been reproduced quite nicely [3]. We now bring this closed framework to NLO as rigorously as possible. In particular, we calculate the minijet transverse energy production by using the latest knowledge of nuclear parton distributions (nPDFs), the NLO sets EPS09 [4], and discuss how
the nPDF uncertainties propagate into the computed hydrodynamical initial conditions as well as observable multiplicities. Regarding the NLO minijet production, we develop a new set of infra-red safe measurement functions and study their effect on the multiplicity systematics from RHIC to LHC. Our main goal here is to quantify the
theoretical uncertainties and the predictive power of this NLO pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics -framework.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Confronts the Rapidity Dependence of Transverse Momentum Fluctuations,"Gavin, Sean",Wayne State University,United States,"Interest in the development of the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics is growing [1]. Early efforts suggested that viscous diffusion broadens the rapidity dependence of transverse momentum correlations [2]. That work stimulated an experimental analysis by STAR [3]. We attack this new data along two fronts. First, we compute STAR’s fluctuation observable using the NeXSPheRIO code, which combines fluctuating initial conditions from a string fragmentation model with deterministic viscosity-free hydrodynamic evolution [4]. We find that NeXSPheRIO produces a longitudinal narrowing, in contrast to the data. Second, we study the hydrodynamic evolution using second order causal viscous hydrodynamics including Langevin noise. We obtain a deterministic evolution equation for the transverse momentum density correlation function.  We use the latest theoretical equations of state and transport coefficients to compute STAR’s observable. The results are in excellent accord with the measured broadening. In addition, we predict features of the distribution that can distinguish 2nd and 1st order diffusion.

Moreover, it is addressed that the sign of the dynamical net

Two-particle 2D correlations, $(p_t1,p_t2)$, for minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV from STAR show a broad peak extending from 0.5-4.0 GeV/c [2].  These correlations are formed from all charged particles with $p_t \geq 0.15$ GeV/c, $|\eta| \leq 1$, and $2\pi$ azimuth.  The broad peak is observed in both like- and unlike-sign charge combinations and same- and away-side relative azimuth angles. Variation of peak positions and widths will be reported as a function of centrality.  Interestingly, the peak in the data for away-side or “back-to-back” pairs persists even in more-central collisions, remaining at approximately the same transverse momentum for like- and unlike-sign pairs at all centralities. The event generator HIJING,
often used to model peripheral heavy ion interactions, predicts a
similar peak in this momentum range but only when jets are included.
The peak position for same-side unlike-sign pairs remains at the same approximate momentum for peripheral to mid-central collisions.
However, for more-central collisions the same-side peak separates into two peaks.  The centrality dependence of these data will be compared with that of $p_t$-integral 2D angular correlations [3].  The transverse momentum dependence of the same-side angular correlation structures will also be presented. Possible mechanisms for the observed structures will be discussed and predictions from several models will be presented to test agreement with data.

We combine a realistic phenomenological equation of state at low densities with equations of state around nuclear densities derived both from chiral effective field theories, on one hand, and from the Polyakov-loop-extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, on the other. Our analysis based on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation strongly supports an equation of state of ordinary nuclear matter.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dynamical freeze-out in event-by-event hydrodynamics,"Huovinen, Pasi",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"In hydrodynamical modeling of the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the freeze-out is typically performed at a constant temperature. In this work we introduce a dynamical freeze-out criterion, which compares the hydrodynamical expansion rate with the pion scattering rate [1]. Previous studies [2] have shown that differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria are small in the transverse momentum spectra, but the effect on flow anisotropies has not yet been studied. Recently many calculations have been done using event-by-event hydrodynamics, in which case the expansion rate does not necessarily behave as nicely as in the case of smooth initial conditions. Thus it is interesting to check how the dynamical freeze-out changes hadron distributions with respect to the constant temperature freeze-out.

In this contribution we present hadron spectra and elliptic and triangular flow calculated using (2+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, and show the differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria. First we discuss the systematics of the dynamical freeze-out, and for simplicity these calculations have been performed using smooth initial states. Finally dynamical
freeze-out condition is applied to event-by-event calculations to evaluate $v_2$ and $v_3$. We find that the differences caused by different freeze-out criteria are small in all studied cases.

Accordingly we see in realistic simulations of uRHIC's a rapid evolution from a gluon dominated initial state to a quark dominated plasma close to Tc.

Of particular interest are dilepton probes originating from decays of charmonium and light vector mesons, such as rho/omega -> e+ e-/ mu+ mu-. These dilepton probes do not interact hadronically with the dense medium and as such allow to probe the early, high density phase of the fireball evolution.

In recent years, higher harmonics azimuthal anisotropies v_{n$\ge$3} are in focus because they are expected to be more sensitive to initial participant geometry and $\eta$/s than will be v_{2}.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Influence of a realistic medium description including fluctuations on heavy quark observables,"Nahrgang, Marlene",Duke University,Unknown,"Strong jet quenching and high-pT hadron suppression as observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are striking experimental signatures for the formation of a deconfined QCD plasma, in which partons suffer from medium-induced energy loss. In particular, heavy quarks represent key probes for revealing the properties of the produced matter.

In this talk, we discuss the consequences of a realistic medium description with fluctuating initial conditions on heavy-quark observables. For this purpose, we combine our Monte-Carlo approach to heavy-quark in-medium propagation MC@sHQ [1] with the full 3+1 dimensional fluid dynamic expansion from EPOS [2]. This allows for a consistent treatment of both the heavy-quark production and the collisional and radiative processes leading to the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks. On an event-by-event basis, we report on RAA and v2 of D and B mesons for RHIC and LHC energies and confront our results with recent experimental observations. While with a simplified medium description [3] we find a too strong quenching for LHC conditions, the discrepancy can be resolved with a medium with initial fluctuations. Moreover, in EPOS a lattice QCD equation of state is used. This allows us to study the nature of the effective degrees of freedom present in the vicinity of the crossover transition, cf. [4], because a proportion of hadronic degrees of freedom above Tc would reduce the energy loss of heavy quarks.

measurements in 158 A GeV In+In collisions. The enhancement of di-muon at $M_{\mu\mu} < 1$ GeV/$c^{2}$ can be described by a broadened spectral function. At RHIC, PHENIX experiment observed a significant enhancement in the di-electron continuum in Au+Au collisions at $0.15 < M_{ee} < 0.75$ GeV/$c^2$ at low transverse momentum ($p_{T}$ < 1 GeV/c).  The models, which describe the SPS di-lepton data, have not been able to consistently describe the PHENIX data in the low mass and low $p_{T}$ region.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Thermal meson properties and chiral symmetry: recent advances.,"Gomez Nicola, Angel",Universidad Complutense Madrid,Unknown,"I will review recent and ongoing work on thermal meson properties relevant for the hadron gas regime in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. These include transport coefficients, chemical nonequilibrium, susceptibilities, isospin breaking and different aspects on chiral symmetry restoration and the QCD transition. The basic framework is the use of Chiral Effective Lagrangians  which ensure the model independency of the low-energy and low-temperature regimes and allows to include interactions consistently. This is combined with unitarity when an accurate analytical description of particle scattering is needed, as in the case  of resonance studies, virial analysis and   transport coefficients,  for temperatures and energies where deviations from  Chiral Perturbation Theory are significant. Our scheme provides an adequate phenomenological description  for several quantities.  The shear viscosity is compatible with the KSS bound and recent data on elliptic flow, bulk viscosity correlation with the trace anomaly is established without appealing to the spectral function profile and the electrical conductivity is consistent with the low-energy photon spectrum. At the same time, this framework helps to understand theoretical aspects such as the role of scalar resonances and   degeneration of partners in chiral restoration or the effects of meson interactions in a possible window between chemical and thermal freeze-out. We will pay also  attention to the connection with lattice results, particularly in the analysis of connected and disconnected scalar susceptibilities, whose quark mass and temperature behaviour we can establish rigorously from our isospin-breaking analysis, providing then a useful benchmark for the continuum limit.

are predicted to be enhanced.  The second is the determination of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) gluon parton distributions in nuclei. Recent theoretical progress indicates that

Poster Session Reception,poster,Soft gluon emission and energy loss of heavy flavors in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Abir, Raktim",Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics,UK,"Most of the the calculations on gluon emission off a heavy quark, within perturbative QCD, have been performed in the literature using light cone gauge with eikonal approximations. Recently we revisited the issue in Feynman gauge that resulted in a very compact and elegant expression for the suppression  factor for gluon emission off a heavy quark [1]. This generalization is valid for the full range of rapidity of the radiated gluons and also has no restriction on the scaled mass of the quark with its energy. In the appropriate limit it correctly reproduces the usual dead cone factor in the forward rapidity region [2]. On the other hand, this suppression factor becomes close to unity in the backward direction.  We then obtain the radiative energy loss of a heavy quark in a deconfined medium due to radiation of gluons off them using this derived gluon emission spectrum. We find that the heavy flavor loses energy almost in a similar fashion like light quarks through this process. This indicates a small suppression of gluon emission in the backward region, which should have an impact on the phenomenology of heavy quark energy loss in the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An analysis of the nuclear modification factor for $D$-meson at LHC is found to be in very good agreement with the most recent data from ALICE collaboration at 2.76 ATeV Pb-Pb collisions [3].

To minimize non-trivial biases in jet-quenching measurements by imposing kinematical constraints on the jet fragmentation and to suppress background fluctuations requires a precise description of background fluctuations down to very low momentum. In order to avoid ambiguities in the background fluctuation estimate, caused by additional hard scatterings, especially in the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at lower jet energies, we propose a statistical correction scheme: The Independent Particle Emission Model. In this approach we characterize the soft underlying heavy-ion background fluctuations in a typical jet area via a statistical convolution of multiplicity and (mean) transverse momentum pT fluctuations. In addition higher order flow harmonics (vn) will be taken properly into account. We will present simulation studies in order to estimate the precision of the Independent Particle Emission Model.

The installation of the Barrel Time-Of-Flight-Detector (TOF) has enabled STAR to identify electrons over a wide momentum range. Combined with its large acceptance, excellent PID, and a low material budget in the runs of 2010/11, STAR now provides unique capabilities for the study of dielectron production in heavy ion collisions.
Due to their negligible strong interaction with the dense medium created at RHIC, leptons can escape the interaction region undistorted and thus, carry direct information about the space-time evolution of the fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In the special case of dileptons, their invariant mass ($m_{ee}$) serves as an additional observable: For the BES energies, later dielectron creation times are accessible in the Low-Mass-Region (LMR, $m_{ee}<1.1 GeV/c^2$) where the in-medium vector meson properties and its implications on the dielectron yield can be measured. Earlier creation times, on the other hand, can be studied in the Intermediate-Mass-Region (IMR, $1.1<m_{ee}<3 GeV/c^2$) in which the continuum yield allows a direct measure of the effective QGP temperature. In this regard, the dependence of these observables on the collision energy is of special interest. These aspects, in particular, make dielectrons favorable as a clean penetration probe for the bulk.
The poster will present dielectron invariant mass spectra from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 39 \& 62.4 GeV and its comparisons to cocktail simulations of known hadron sources.

The main features of the femtoscopy measurements in heavy-ion collisions from SPS to RHIC and LHC are i) the increase of the correlation radii with increasing multiplicity of events and ii) the decrease of the radii with increasing pair transverse momentum/transverse mass. These are understood as a manifestation of strong collective flow.
We report the measurement of correlations of two identical kaons (neutral and charged) in pp and Pb-Pb collisions by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The increase of correlation radii for increasing multiplicity was observed both in Pb-Pb and pp collisions. The decrease of kaon radii for increasing transverse momentum was observed in Pb-Pb collisions. Similar behaviour of the radii was observed at high multiplicities in pp collisions. However at low multiplicity the behaviour of the radii is completely different. This observation may indicate a similarity between high multiplicity pp collisions and heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew Donald', 'last_name': 'Steinpreis', 'fullName': 'Steinpreis, Matthew Donald', 'id': '315327', 'affiliation': 'Ohio State University (US)', 'emailHash': 'e524ac52fc41616acb14190c69db36d7', 'db_id': 315327, 'person_id': 343828}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Measurement of net-charge fluctuations by ALICE at the LHC,"Jena, Satyajit",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),Unknown,"Charge fluctuations are considered to provide a possible signature for the existence of the de-confined Quark Gluon Plasma phase (QGP). Charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of hadron gas with unit charged particles. The study of charge fluctuations have been carried out by using the variable, ν(+−,dyn) which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias, i.e., impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of charged particles within the detector acceptance. The dependence of charge fluctuations on the rapidity windows for various centrality bins are analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV in the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC. Furthermore the higher moments of net-charge distribution are examined. It has been demonstrated that higher moments as well as moment products are sensitive to the correlation length and directly connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities computed in the Lattice QCD.

We observe that the dynamical fluctuations, measured in terms of ν(+−,dyn), decrease while going from peripheral to central collisions. We examine the dependence of fluctuations, using the D-measure, on the pseudorapidity interval ∆η, which may account for the dilution of fluctuations during the evolution of the system. The higher moments like mean, sigma (σ), skewness (S), kurtosis (K) and the quantities like Sσ and Kσ2 of net-charge are estimated as a function of centrality. The experimental values are compared to the theoretical expectations for a hadron gas and a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).

Poster Session Reception,poster,Study of the production of B-decay electrons at high momentum in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV using secondary vertex reconstruction in ALICE,"Aronsson, Tomas",Yale University (US),USA,"High-energy heavy-ion collisions at the LHC allow for the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks, charm and bottom, produced in the initial hard scattering processes of the collision are excellent probes of the QGP.
When heavy quarks traverse the QGP they are expected to lose energy and such energy loss is predicted to be smaller than for gluons and light quarks. On the other hand, recent experimental data indicate larger energy loss than expected. Heavy flavour production can be studied using electrons from semi-leptonic decays of D and B mesons. The separation of electrons from these two sources (charm and bottom) is of crucial importance to address the expected mass dependence of energy loss. In this poster, we present the measurement of electrons from bottom in the transverse momentum range of 7-12 GeV in 7 TeV p-p collisions. The ALICE EMCal detector possesses outstanding particle identification for electrons at high pT. Two-track secondary vertices with these electrons and surrounding charged tracks are reconstructed, exploiting the tracking precision provided by the Inner Tracking System, and are used to select displaced decay vertices of B mesons. The cross section for bottom-decay electrons is compared to FONLL pQCD predictions and it serves as a reference for studies of B meson suppression in Pb-Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tomas', 'last_name': 'Aronsson', 'fullName': 'Aronsson, Tomas', 'id': '315339', 'affiliation': 'Yale University (US)', 'emailHash': '0a0ced9cf127f509f68c97c21dc7c75b', 'db_id': 315339, 'person_id': 343835}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,D*-hadron azimuthal correlations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =7 TeV$ with ALICE,"Bjelogrlic, Sandro",University of Utrecht (NL),Netherlands,"Due to their relatively high mass, heavy-flavour quarks, produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are sensitive probes of the interaction dynamics inside the hot and dense QCD matter. 
Since heavy quarks are produced in pairs during the initial stage of the collision, before the formation of the QGP, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides profound information on the properties of the produced medium. A detailed understanding of the pair production mechanisms in proton-proton collisions is interesting both as a QCD test tool as well as a reference for future heavy-ion studies. 
This particular physical process can be investigated using the angular azimuthal correlation between open-charmed mesons and charged hadrons. This correlation exhibits characteristic near-side and away-side structures that are produced by the charged hadrons from the fragmentation and decay of the partner charmed meson. The azimuthal direction is expected to be sensitive to the heavy quark production mechanism and can be compared to the perturbative QCD calculations. 
D mesons are reconstructed in several hadronic channels in the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Using $D*^{\pm}$  mesons is advantageous because they can be selected with higher purity with respect to D0 and $D^{+}$. Correlating with kaons (identified $K^{\pm}$  or reconstructed $K0_{S}$) that are produced with high probability in charm decays, provides a reduction of the background in the correlation distribution.
In this contribution results of this correlation analysis, performed using the minimum bias proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV$ collected by the ALICE experiment in 2010, will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sandro', 'last_name': 'Bjelogrlic', 'fullName': 'Bjelogrlic, Sandro', 'id': '315343', 'affiliation': 'University of Utrecht (NL)', 'emailHash': 'f570becd6acd7db066ea991a18e03e8d', 'db_id': 315343, 'person_id': 343836}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dijet asymmetry A_J within a partonic Boltzmann transport model,"Senzel, Florian",Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,Unknown,"Recent experimental data measured in \sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by ATLAS and CMS showed a significant imbalance in the transverse momenta of the two reconstructed jets with the highest transverse momenta. This momentum imbalance is assumed to be caused by the different energy and momentum loss of the di-jets by scatterings within the created medium. To investigate this momentum loss we extended the transport model BAMPS which solves the full 3+1D Boltzmann equation for partons based on pQCD cross sections. One feature of BAMPS is the stochastic modeling of 2 -> 2 as well as 2 <-> 3 scattering processes. We show that the simulations of the momentum imbalance A_J of full reconstructed jets within BAMPS are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Due to the available particle information in configuration as well as momentum space within such a transport model, it is possible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed jets within the medium and gain a deeper understanding of the emerging jet shapes. With this information we explain the momentum imbalance of di-jets by different in-medium path lengths and thus different energy and momentum loss at parton-level.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Senzel', 'fullName': 'Senzel, Florian', 'id': '315392', 'affiliation': 'Goethe-Universität Frankfurt', 'emailHash': 'a8e39f3c122d849535a618c46a5e4d92', 'db_id': 315392, 'person_id': 343871}"

Event-by-event net charge fluctuation has been proposed as one of the indicators of QGP formation in heavy ion collisions. The fluctuation in net charge depends on the squares of the charges present in the system, which depends on the state from which it originates. The system passing through a QGP phase which has quarks as charge carriers, should result in a significantly different net charge fluctuation as compared to Hadron Gas (HG).  The variance of the ratio of positive and negative charges scaled by the total charge particle multiplicity (a quantity called D) is approximately 4 times smaller for QGP as compared to HG [1].
We will present preliminary results on net charge fluctuations for Au+Au

With our model, including all hadronic resonances up to masses of 2.6 GeV, we show that the strengths of the resonance couplings to the attractive scalar and the repulsive vector fields have a major impact on the order and location of the chiral phase transition. Reasonable vector couplings, found by comparing model data to recent lattice QCD results, limit the phase transition to a smooth cross over and therefore rule out the possible existence of a critical end point.

Furthermore, we study fluctuations of conserved charges at the phase
transition and present related (strange) quark number fluctuations and their associated susceptibility coefficients both at zero baryochemical potential and when crossing the phase transition at different regions in the T-mu plane. We show that susceptibility ratios get significantly suppressed at non-vanishing baryochemical potentials.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Philip', 'last_name': 'Rau', 'fullName': 'Rau, Philip', 'id': '315407', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany', 'emailHash': '2397140cd30346b99b9d8f46d0a9414e', 'db_id': 315407, 'person_id': 343879}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Centrality and pT dependence study of Dielectron Production in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at STAR,"zhao, jie",lbl&sinap,Unknown,"Dilepton production has been proposed to serve as a penetrating probe
for the hot and dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions.
Their small final-state interaction cross sections, let dileptons
escape the interaction region undistorted. Since dileptons originate
from all stages of a heavy ion reaction, their sources vary with the
kinematic phase space under consideration: In the low mass region (LMR:
mass<1.1GeV/$c^{2}$), vector mesons and direct photons are the
dominating source, while dileptons in the intermediate mass region
(IMR:1.1<mass<3GeV/$c^{2}$) primarily stem from QGP thermal radiation
at RHIC energy and semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. In the high
mass region (HMR: mass>3 GeV/$c^{2}$), heavy quark decays and Drell-Yan
processes contribute the most to the dilepton spectrum. Due to the
time-energy correlation, the higher the dilepton pair mass, the earlier
the production. Therefore the dilepton distributions, especially in the
IMR and HMR, provide information on early collision dynamics in heavy
ion collisions.


  In this talk we will present a systematic study of dielectron production in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at STAR experiment. The datasets used are nearly one billion Au+Au minibias events collected in RHIC runs year 2010 and 2011.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Silicon pixel and strip detector development for the upgrade of the ALICE Inner Tracking System,"Contin, Giacomo",Universita e INFN (IT),United States,"The main physics motivation for the upgrade of the Inner Tracking System of the ALICE experiment is to perform new measurements on charm and beauty production in heavy-ion collisions, dealing with the challenge of expected Pb-Pb interaction rates of up to 50 kHz. For this purpose, a new silicon tracker is needed with greatly improved features in terms of determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum, momentum resolution and readout rate capabilities.
The ITS upgrade foresees to replace the present ITS detector with a new seven layer silicon vertex detector. Two layouts are being considered: Layout 1 foresees to equip all layers with monolithic silicon pixel detectors; Layout 2 will consist of 3 layers of hybrid silicon pixel detectors and 4 layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors. For the innermost layers, there is a strong effort to decrease the pixel dimensions to about 20-30 um in the bending direction and equivalently in the beam direction and to reduce the material budget from 1.1% to 0.3% of X0, by using monolithic pixel detectors or hybrid pixel detectors with thinned chip and sensor, and minimizing the contribution coming from supports and services. The different types of monolithic pixel detectors under consideration for the ALICE ITS upgrade are: the rolling shutter, low power, architecture of the MIMOSA26 and ULTIMATE sensors, moved to a 0.18 um technology node; the INMAPS prototype, an in-pixel hit discrimination CMOS sensor based on a deep p-well extension of a triple-well 0.18 um CMOS; the LePIX development, a drift-based monolithic sensor in very deep submicron CMOS. The expected radiation levels for the innermost layer (685 krad TID, 10^13 neq per year) will require a careful validation of the different technologies in terms of radiation resistance. On the outermost layers the needed granularity and pointing resolution can be ensured by a strip detector geometry with a small cell size (95 um strip pitch, 22 mm strip length) and a small strip inclination with respect to the beam direction. The information on the signal amplitude will be preserved for the strip sensors for particle identification purposes. The strip readout chip will incorporate a low power ADC with 10 bits resolution. 
The present status of the technology development for the considered options will be reported.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Giacomo', 'last_name': 'Contin', 'fullName': 'Contin, Giacomo', 'id': '315414', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': '0ddd57aec6f5d3a7a5a174fc9a9d7eed', 'db_id': 315414, 'person_id': 343885}"

The strong coupling constant and the nucleon size are treated as parameters.

The resulting distribution function is evolved with the DGLAP equation to higher momenta by using the QCDNUM package and compared with data as parametrized by nuclear CTEQ.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Di-electron Measurements in $p+p$ collisions by PHENIX using the Hadron Blind Detector,"Sharma, Deepali",S,United States,"Di-electrons are among the most promising probes for studying the
early, hot and dense stages created in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions.  They are color neutral and so interact only
electromagnetically, thus carrying to the detectors information about
the conditions and properties of the medium at the time of their
creation. The di-electrons are emitted over the the entire space-time
evolution of the collision and their spectrum thus carries a wealth of
information.

PHENIX has measured a large, unexpected enhancement in $Au+Au$ collisions
in the low mass region ( 0.2 - 0.8 GeV/c$^2$ ), with respect to the baseline
cocktail scaled from $p+p$ collisions.  However, this result suffers from
a large systematic uncertainty due to the huge combinatorial
background of uncorrelated pairs from partially reconstructed $\pi^0$
Dalitz decays and $\gamma$ conversions.

To combat this challenge, PHENIX installed a hadron blind detector
( HBD ) for the 2009 and 2010 RHIC runs.  Its purpose is to tag and
reject the combinatorial background coming from these decays.  A
reliable analysis of the 2010 $Au+Au$ data hinges on a complete
understanding of the HBD and its unique characteristics. The 2009
$p+p$ run serves as a crucial testing ground for understanding the
systematics associated with this novel detector. The
proof-of-principle obtained in the $p+p$ HBD analysis will be
presented in this poster.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deepali', 'last_name': 'Sharma', 'fullName': 'Sharma, Deepali', 'id': '315419', 'affiliation': 'S', 'emailHash': 'e7d5b79078d715fe9231bfb9e42fd4bb', 'db_id': 315419, 'person_id': 343889}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Non-linear QCD dynamics in photon-photon interactions at high energies,"Cazaroto, Erike",University of Sao Paulo,Unknown,"At high energies the amount of gluons in a hadron is much larger than the amount of any other constituent, for example it is much larger than the amount of sea quarks. Therefore, at high energies the hadronic cross sections are basically a function only of the gluons distribution. The color dipole formalism applied to photon-photon collisions implies that, before interacting, each of the photons fluctuates in a pair quark-antiquark with a certain probability. The pair is colorless and it is also called Color Dipole. In a first approximation we can treat one of the pairs quark-antiquark as if it was a hadron and we can apply the evolution equations of QCD to determine its gluons distribution. Then the photon-photon cross section can be factorized as a product of two terms. The first one is the probabilities for each photon fluctuate in a color dipole and the second term is the dipole-hadron cross section. In order to determine the dipole-hadron scattering amplitude we used non-linear QCD dynamics. The non-linearity of the evolution equations implies that the gluons distribution inside the hadron saturates when a given kinematic regime is reached. The scale separating the saturation regime of the linear one is called Saturation Scale. When the saturation regime is reached it is expected that the gluons distribution form a new state of matter, the called Color Glass Condensate (CGC). The search for the CGC is still going on and it is expected that LHC, as well as the future eRHIC, will give us a definitive answer of its existence. In this work we applied the CGC approach to photon-photon collisions through the color dipole formalism. We calculated cross sections to photon-photon scattering and calculated structure functions of virtual and real photons. We proposed a new model to the dipole-dipole cross section and compared our results with a model available in the literature. Our calculations can be considered as predictions to observables that will be measured in a future linear collider.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Erike', 'last_name': 'Cazaroto', 'fullName': 'Cazaroto, Erike', 'id': '315449', 'affiliation': 'University of Sao Paulo', 'emailHash': '08fe605ba41f6a194ed7c09f5d82c71d', 'db_id': 315449, 'person_id': 343907}"
