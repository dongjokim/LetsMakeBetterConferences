Parallel 4A: Global & Collective Dynamics (Chair P. Sorenson),parallel,"Deviation from quark number scaling of the anisotropy parameter v2 of pions, kaons, and protons in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV","huang, shengli",PHENIX Collaboration,Unknown,"The number of quark ($n_q$) scaling, which is manifested
as $v^{hadron}_{2}(p_T) \approx n_q*v_2(p_T/n_q)$, is an
approximate scaling that comes from the addition of the valence
quark momenta at hadronization. The observation of $n_q$ scaling
has been claimed that a partonic matter with quark-like degrees
of freedom and significant collectivity has been generated in
heavy ion collisions~\ref{1,2}. However, there are several
theoretical considerations that suggest that the $n_q$ scaling
should be violated in certain conditions. For example, the
contribution of sea quarks and gluons have been shown to affect
the $n_q$ scaling in the models including higher Fock states. And
models that consider recombination between ""thermal"" and ""shower""
partons predict centrality dependent deviations from $n_q$
scaling.

   Understanding the limits of the recombination domain is important
in relation to viscous hydrodynamics and the extraction of the
shear viscosity over entropy density ($\eta/s$) from the data, as
well as for developing a unified approach in describing jet energy
loss and high $p_T$ $v_2$. Searches for deviations from $n_q$
scaling are also important for the low-energy scan program at RHIC
as they have been considered as a signature of the transition
between sQGP formation and a hadronic system. In this talk, we
will report on high-statistics measurements of the second order
Fourier coefficient $v_2$ for identified pions, kaons and protons,
which extend to relatively high $p_T$ around 6 GeV/c. Comparisons
with published measurements of $K^{0}_{S}$ and $\Lambda$ are shown
for the different centralities. With these new measurements, the
$p_T$ limits and centrality dependence of the $n_q$ scaling
deviations are being carried out in PHENIX.

Parallel 6B: Exploring the QCD Phase Diagram (Chair K. Rajagopal),parallel,A No-Go Theorem for Critical Phenomena in QCD at finite temperature and density,"Hidaka, Yoshimasa",RIKEN Nishina Center,Unknown,"We discuss the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite T and finite quark chemical potential \mu. In particular, we focus on the QCD critical point(s), which has attracted considerable attention in its search at the relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. However, not only the location, but even the existence has not yet been settled.  In this talk, we show that the critical points are forbidden in flavor-symmetric QCD at finite \mu for any nonzero quark mass, as long as the coordinate (T, \mu) is outside the pion condensed phase in the corresponding phase diagram of QCD at finite isospin chemical potential \mu_I = 2\mu, if the two and higher quark loops are negligible in the thermodynamic potential and the correlation functions (The large-Nc QCD naturally satisfies this condition).

Parallel 6A: Heavy Flavor & Quarkonia (Chair Y. Akiba),parallel,Probing Hot and Dense Matter with c and b Measurements with PHENIX VTX Tracker,"Nouicer, Rachid",Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL),USA,"Well-calibrated penetrating probes are essential for investigating the properties of the hot, dense medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC. One such probe are hadrons which carry heavy flavor (charm and bottom quarks). They are a powerful tool for studying the medium because they are generated early in the reaction and subsequently propagate through the created matter.

Two very striking results have already been seen for open heavy flavor from the PHENIX experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm or bottom quarks.  First, heavy mesons, despite their large mass, exhibit a suppression at high transverse momentum compared to that expected from p+p interactions. This suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium. Secondly, an elliptic flow is observed for heavy mesons which is comparable to that of light mesons like pions. This imply that the same heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow—giving new insight into the strongly coupled nature of the QGP fluid at these temperatures. In these early results, PHENIX was not able to distinguish electrons from c and b independently. In order to understand these medium effects in more detail it is imperative to directly measure the nuclear modification and the flow of c and b separately.

With the addition of the silicon vertex tracker, VTX, to PHENIX these direct measurements are now possible. We will present the latest PHENIX measurements of single electrons from beauty and charm decays, emphasizing the flow, v2, and nuclear modification factor, RAA, including the latest progress with the VTX.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rachid', 'last_name': 'Nouicer', 'fullName': 'Nouicer, Rachid', 'id': '315209', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)', 'emailHash': '3040e318e850403fd595cce07706c471', 'db_id': 315209, 'person_id': 343758}"

Eskola),parallel,Gravitational collapse and holographic thermalization,"Chesler, Paul",MIT,USA,"A remarkable result from heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider is that, shortly after the collision event, the quark-gluon plasma produced behaves as a nearly ideal liquid.   Understanding the dynamics responsible for such rapid ""hydroization"" is a challenge using traditional perturbative field theory.   In recent years holography has emerged as a powerful tool to study non-equilibrium phenomena, mapping the dynamics of certain quantum field theories onto the dynamics of semi-classical gravity. Via holography, the production of quark-gluon plasma maps onto the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation, with the relaxation of the black hole's gravitational field encoding hydroization of the dual quark gluon plasma.  Thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma is encoded in the thermalization of the black hole's Hawking radiation.  I will describe several processes which mimic heavy ion collisions and present results for both hydroization and thermalization times and mechanisms.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Paul', 'last_name': 'Chesler', 'fullName': 'Chesler, Paul', 'id': '315421', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': '23ce53de5c8fc37cae51a96616c94563', 'db_id': 315421, 'person_id': 343499}"

Due to their large mass, the charm quarks are mainly formed in the first instants of the nuclear collision and will consequently experience the full history of the system. It was predicted that the strongly bound J/Ã state will be suppressed in the hot and deconfined quark-gluon plasma due to the color screening effect. This effect was already observed in Au-Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC. It was also predicted that high production yields of charm quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and especially at LHC energies will make possible (re)combination thus possibly leading to J/psi enhancement compared to lower energy nuclear collisions and to pp collisions.
ALICE measures the J/psi at mid-rapidity, |y| < 0.9, down to zero transverse momentum. The reconstruction is performed using the J/psi decay into the di-electron channel. The electron identification is done using energy loss in gaseous detectors (the Time Projection Chamber and the Transition Radiation Detector) and the time-of-flight method (Time Of Flight detector). We will present the J/psi nuclear modification factor as a function of the collision centrality. Discussions and comparisons to theoretical calculations will be provided.

Parallel 6C: New Experimental Developments (Chair J. Stroth),parallel,The ALICE Inner Tracking System Upgrade,"Lemmon, Roy Crawford",Engin. & Phys. Sci. Research Coun. (GB),Unknown,"The major long-term goal of the ALICE experiment at the LHC is to provide precision measurements of the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, the state of deconfined matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Experiments towards the characterisation of strongly interacting matter at high density will need to focus on rare probes and the study of their collective properties and hadronization, particularly at soft momentum scales. Such considerations have motivated the development of a comprehensive upgrade strategy for ALICE to provide high rate capability (50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions) in a near minimum bias mode by building a new Inner Tracking System and by modifying all major ALICE detectors to provide a fully pipelined read-out. This implies also a major upgrade of the data acquisition and high level trigger system. Further details of the overall ALICE upgrade strategy are described in [1]. This contribution will describe the proposed approach to upgrading the Inner Tracking System (ITS) in order to both comply with the new requirements set by the ALICE global upgrade strategy and to dramatically improve the performance for heavy-flavour detection. The ITS Upgrade will have greatly improved features in terms of: determination of the distance of closest approach (dca) to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low pt, momentum resolution and readout capabilities. These improvements are possible as a consequence of the spectacular progress made in the field of imaging sensors over the last ten years as well as the possibility to install a smaller radius beampipe. Moreover a tracker with the above features, in particular a high standalone tracking efficiency, creates an opportunity to perform, in combination with the TRD and TOF detectors, online event selection on the basis of topological and PID criteria. Such a new silicon tracker will allow ALICE to measure charm and beauty production in Pb-Pb collisions with sufficient statistical accuracy down to very low transverse  momentum, measure charm baryons and perform exclusive measurements of beauty production. A comprehensive description of the ITS Upgrade can be found in the recent Conceptual Design Report [2].

Wang),parallel,Dijet Correlations in the Forward pA (eA) Collisions to Map the Phase Structure of Cold Nuclei Matter at Small-x,"Yuan, Feng",LBNL,USA,"As the foundation of high energy hadronic physics, QCD factorization enables us to separate the short distance perturbative physics from the long distance non-perturbative effects. Its prediction power relies on the universality of the parton distributions among different processes. In our recent publication [1], we established an effective factorization in hard processes in nuclei scattered by a dilute probe. This factorization enables us to identify the key observables to probe the so-called unintegrated gluon distributions, the central objects in the saturation framework. This has been a long-standing issue in small-x physics. From our studies, we found that the dijet-correlations in deep inelastic scattering of electron-nucleus collisions directly measure the Weizacker-Williams gluon distribution function, whereas the photon-jet correlation in nucleon-nucleus (pA) collisions probes the dipole gluon distribution. The dijet (di-hadron) correlations in pA collisions can probe both gluon distributions. Current experiments in deuteron-gold (dAu) collisions at RHIC, and future pA collisions at LHC, and the planed electron-ion collider (EIC) experiments, will provide great opportunities to study two-particle collisions and the associated strong interaction dynamics of the gluon distributions in cold nucleus at small-x. 

Recently, both STAR and PHENIX collaborations have reported the measurements of two-hadron correlations in the forward direction of dAu collisions at RHIC [2], where the strong de-correlation of the away-side hadron have been considered as the best evidence for saturation physics. The numeric calculations based on our factorization formalism provides a quantitative and thorough description of the experimental data in the saturation formalism [3], including the large broadening of the angular distribution and suppression of the peak for the away-side hadron. The disappearing of the away-side peak in central collisions indicates that the saturation scale is the same order as the hard jet transverse momentum, which is a clear signal of the onset of the saturation. From the kinematics, we conclude that the saturation scale reaches 2GeV at x~6x10-4 in the center of the gold nucleus with jet transverse momentum kt~3GeV at rapidity 3.2. Future measurements at RHIC and LHC and the planed EIC will provide more information and help to map out the complete phase structure of the cold nuclei matter at small-x.

In this framework the STSA originates from the q -> q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function followed by a  perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks is in qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing projectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T, peaking near the saturation scale Q_s in our framework. Our mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton--nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton--proton collisions. We also observe that in our formalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew', 'last_name': 'Sievert', 'fullName': 'Sievert, Matthew', 'id': '315443', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': 'e058819bfde6f5cec54f04a0870e377b', 'db_id': 315443, 'person_id': 343902}"

suggest that the presence of a CP might result in divergences of the
thermodynamic susceptibilities and correlation lengths [1,2]. The 
statistical moments of the multiplicity distributions of particles 
reflecting conserved quantities, {\it e.g.} net-charge and 
net-strangeness, are expected to depend sensitively on these correlation lengths, making them attractive tools for the search of 
a possible critical point.

In this talk, the centrality and beam energy dependence of the
statistical moments of the net-charge multiplicity distributions will
be presented. The observables studied include the lowest four
statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis), products of
these moments, and the intensive normalized cumulants [2]. The

An incomplete knowledge of the baseline cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, as well as the possibility of competing effects present in the QGP, such as recombination, has hindered a full understanding of the observed heavy ion results.

These collisions promise an array of unique geometrical configurations including odd harmonics and events where the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au.  Such geometries present an opportunity to probe the ""core"" and ""corona"" regions of the collision (which are strongly asymmetric in Cu+Au) by measuring the reaction plane dependence of particle production.  J/psi production may be more sensitive to the least dense part of the collision at the surface - the corona - thus providing a handle of the relative size of the Cu- versus Au-side corona.  An important component of this analysis is the understanding of the light-hadron vn(n=1,2,3,4) and the correlation between the vn event planes in these collisions, which will reveal the underlying hydrodynamical properties of the system.  In particular, the odd harmonics from the Cu+Au system offer sensitivity to v3 generated from the collision geometry as opposed to fluctuations in a symmetric system.

Kaon femtoscopy extends the range of pair transverse mass covered and provides a sample less affected by decay resonances as compared to pions. The correlation functions of non-identical particles in the three-dimensional $\vec{k}^*$ space can reveal a space-time offset of one particle species (e.g. kaons) with respect to another (e.g. pions). Measurement of  $\Lambda-\Lambda$ correlation is closely related to $H_{0}$-dibaryon, a six quark state predicted by Jaffe[1], which could appear as a bump in the $\Lambda-\Lambda$ invariant mass spectra or depletion in pair correlation near the threshold depending on the nature of $H_{0}$-dibaryon state.

A long standing issue in vn measurements is the contamination of nonflow, caused by intrinsic particle correlations unrelated to the collision geometry. Nonflow limits, in part, the precise extraction of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s from data-model comparisons. Isolation of flow and nonflow is critical to the interpretation of the Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations.

In this talk we report measurements of vn azimuthal anisotropies using the two- and mult-particle Q-cumulants method from STAR in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. The centrality and pT dependence of vn will be presented. We compare the four- and six-particle cumulant measurements to gain insights on the nature of flow fluctuations [1,2]. We further analyze two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (eta) bins. Exploiting the collision symmetry about mid-rapidity, we isolate the \Delta\eta-dependent and \Delta\eta-independent correlations in the data with a data-driven method [3]. The \Delta\eta-dependent part arises from near-side nonflow correlations, such as HBT interferometry, resonance decays, and jet-correlations. The \Delta\eta-independent part is dominated by flow and flow fluctuations with relatively small contribution from away-side jet-correlations. The method does not make assumptions about the eta dependence of flow. Our isolated \Delta\eta-independent part from data, dominated by flow, however, is found to be also eta-independent within the STAR TPC of +-1 unit of pseudo-rapidity. The \Delta\eta drop in the measured two-particle cumulant appears to entirely come from nonflow. We assess the effect of the nonflow on eta/s extraction. We reexamine the high-pT triggered dihadron correlations with background subtraction of our decomposed flows.

In this contribution, a different mechanism to favour baryon-over-meson production is proposed: when hadrons are formed in the recombination of nearby quarks and antiquarks, only colour-singlet combinations can be chosen. Hadron formation, in particular the probability to create baryons or mesons, depends on the distribution of colour charges among quarks.

In this contribution, we discuss the predictions of our model for D and B mesons production in URHIC at LHC energies and confront them with experimental results obtained so far by ALICE and CMS collaborations for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76~{\rm TeV}$. 

The slight excess of quenching found w.r.t. the D mesons data at LHC trigers our interest in new effects neglected up to now, such as the influence of gluon damping on radiative energy loss and its phenomenological consequences. In \cite{Bluhm:2011}, we have indeed studied the effect of an absorptive medium on standard LPM \cite{LPM} radiation in electrodynamics and have advocated that the large time needed for the photon formation in Bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic charges is not affordable if damping is taken into account. Similar effect manifests itself in QCD, as we have recently advocated in \cite{Bluhm_2012}. In our QM contribution, we intend to concentrate on the {\em implications} of such an effect on the quenching of particles in URHIC (discussing observables such as spectra, elliptic flow and azimutal correlations) as well as on the single electron puzzle.

Their large masses are not easily affected by the strong interaction with QCD medium, thus they carry clean information from the system at early stage. The interaction between heavy quarks and the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics, therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an ideal probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting QCD matter.
In this talk, we will present the STAR results of open charm hadron production at mid-rapidity in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Open charm mesons were reconstructed directly via hadronic decay channels with daughter particles identified by TPC and TOF detectors.  With abundant statistics of Au+Au collisions collected by STAR in the year 2010 and 2011, the D-meson is measured at $p_T$ from 0.2 to 8 GeV in minimum bias Au+Au collisions. The centrality dependence of D-meson $p_T$ spectra as well as the nuclear modification factor will be presented. A first measurement of the $D^{0}$ elliptic flow in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be reported. These measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations and physics implications will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the open charm hadron measurement in $\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV $p+p$ collisions to study the energy dependence of charm production.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'David', 'last_name': 'Tlusty', 'fullName': 'Tlusty, David', 'id': '315041', 'affiliation': 'PhD student', 'emailHash': '1248f88f602b21c57a1e4149be775fa6', 'db_id': 315041, 'person_id': 343652}"

Jet fragmentation in vacuum is well described by perturbative QCD and is characterized by color coherence effects that lead to the angular ordering of successive branchings along the jet. To investigate the alteration of color coherence in jets in the QGP we study the radiation pattern of a  color-correlated quark-anti-quark antenna  which is in fact the building block of jet evolution in vacuum. 

We show that in a dense medium the onset of coherence is governed by the hardest scale induced by the presence of the medium. In a medium of length $L$ and transport coefficient $\hat q$ this can either be the typical transverse momentum broadening  of the gluon in the medium, $\sqrt{\hat q L}$, or the inverse of the size of the antenna as probed by the medium, namely  $r_\perp^{-1}=(\theta_{qq} L)^{-1}$, where $\theta_{qq}$ is the opening angle of the antenna. Therefore, for $k_\perp<max(\sqrt{\hat q L}, r_\perp^{-1})$  we obtain complete decoherence of the antenna; for larger momenta color coherence is restored. 

We expect the transition from color decoherence to coherence to play an important role in in-medium jet fragmentation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yacine', 'last_name': 'Mehtar-Tani', 'fullName': 'Mehtar-Tani, Yacine', 'id': '314298', 'affiliation': 'IPhT-Saclay', 'emailHash': 'e6575ce1c96c0e4eacc3680f5fde0866', 'db_id': 314298, 'person_id': 343132}"

of mesons and baryons carry important information about the emitting
source. At low relative momentum femtoscopic correlations arise, which
are sensitive to the homogeneity lengths of the system. Hydrodynamic
models predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse
mass of the pair. Such decrease is universally reported for pions,
also at the LHC. Kaons and baryons, having a much larger mass, allow
to significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The femtoscopic
results for heavier particles would put a strong constraint on such
predictions. Non-identical baryon and meson pairs are also sensitive
to emission asymmetries.

Femtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to
the strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon
pair types. Most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction
which has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of
the H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon
potentials, which have a significant contribution from annihilation
channels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle
spectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of
the small proton yield at the LHC.

We show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types
(baryon-baryon, baryon-antibaryon and meson-meson), consisting of
neutral and charged kaons, protons and lambdas. Femtoscopic analysis
is carried out for them, taking into account, when necessary, residual
correlations and annihilation channels. Results are presented as a
function of transverse mass and event multiplicity, comparing with the
pp collisions results when possible. Correlations with lambdas are
analyzed both with femtoscopic methods as well as to study the unknown

Considering cumulants up to the 6th order, we observe that they generically behave as expected from universal scaling laws, which is quite different from cumulants calculated within the hadron resonance gas model. Taking ratios of these cumulants, we obtain volume independent results that can be directly compared to the experimental measurements.

Recently PHENIX has measured CNM effects at midrapidity in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au collisions.  Measurements of reconstructed jets reveal the centrality dependence of both jet suppression and broadening of the away-side jet.  Meanwhile, single electrons from heavy flavor decays exhibit enhancement over a broad $p_T$ range and increasing with centrality.  These results will be presented and compared to our present understanding of CNM effects to see if simultaneous constraints on nuclear shadowing, initial state energy loss, and Cronin effects can be found.

We find that by appropriate adjustment of the initial energy density and/or the initial pseudorapidity distributions, the effects of the initial anisotropy of pressure may be easily compensated and the final hadronic observables become insensitive to early dynamics. 
Our results indicate that the early thermalization assumption is not necessary to describe hadronic data, in particular, to reproduce the measured elliptic flow v2. The complete thermalization of matter (local equilibration) may take place only at the times of about 1–2 fm/c, in agreement with the results of microscopic models.

As the collision energy increases, the resulting increases of the initial temperature, and fireball lifetime, as well as the evolution of the centrality dependence of final charged particle multiplicity are quantitatively studied and compared between the two most popular initial state models, the Monte Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models. For Glauber model initial conditions with a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the differential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) is found to exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of √s around top RHIC energy, rendering it  almost independent of collision energy for 39 < √s < 2760A GeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations [2], this ""saturation"" of elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects. For color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger shear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar ""saturation"" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low pT. We emphasize that this ""saturation"" of the elliptic flow is not associated with the QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which shifts with √s depending on the fluid's viscosity and leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and decreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the √s range where v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) at fixed pT is maximal. By generalizing the definition of spatial eccentricity ecc_x to isothermal hyper-surfaces, we calculate ecc_x on the kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies. Up to top RHIC energy, √s=200A GeV, the fireball is still out-of-plane deformed at freeze out, while at LHC energy the final spatial eccentricity is predicted to approach zero.

The transverse momentum distributions of identified hadrons contain informations about the transverse expansion of the system and constrain the freeze-out properties of the matter created. The ALICE experiment has very good particle identification capabilities over a broad pT-range. Particles are identified using the energy loss signal in the Inner Tracking System and Time Projection Chamber detectors, complemented with the information from the Time of Flight detector to identify hadrons up to pT ∼ 5 GeV/c. In this contribution the results for identified pions, kaons and protons in pp collisions at 0.9 and 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and heavy-ion collisions at 2.76 TeV center-of-mass energy will be presented. These results are compared with other identified particle measurements obtained by the ALICE experiment, and discussed in terms of the thermal and hydrodynamical pictures. The status of extensions of this analysis, with the study of identified particles as a function of event-by-event flow in Pb-Pb collisions and as a function of multiplicity in pp collisions, will also be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leonardo', 'last_name': 'Milano', 'fullName': 'Milano, Leonardo', 'id': '314494', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': 'ab83e3da8079cb0c99e70b044d937c8a', 'db_id': 314494, 'person_id': 343283}"

Scott",Duke University,USA,"The precise value of the QGP kinematic shear viscosity eta/s is a question of intense topical interest. Viscous hydrodynamic simulations are a tool for extracting this information from experiment. The key observables are the anisotropic flow coefficients v_n which (i) can be measured very precisely and (ii) are very sensitive to eta/s which controls the ""conversion efficiency"" v_n/ecc_n for turning initial fireball eccentricities of harmonic order n into final flows of the same harmonic order. 

Both ecc_n and v_n fluctuate strongly from collision to collision. These event-by-event fluctuations have a key influence on the measurements [1] and must be properly taken into account when extracting eta/s. Until recently, most initial-state models accounted only for the shape and density fluctuations arising from the fluctuating positions of the nucleons in the colliding nuclei. This leads to fluctuations in the location of the newly produced matter, and thus of the initial energy density profile of the expanding fireball and its eccentricities ecc_n, but does not account for additional quantum fluctuations in the quark and gluon fields inside the nucleons that lead to fluctuating numbers of secondary particles per nucleon-nucleon interaction. Several recent papers have addressed the implementation of these quantum fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial conditions for the expanding collision fireball. 

Starting from the Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model for generating fluctuating initial profiles for the gluon saturation momentum Q_sat(x_T) in the transverse plane, we have developed a Monte Carlo algorithm that uses a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) generator [2] to generate a distribution of gluonic energy densities centered at the value corresponding to the field Q_sat(x_T), but fluctuating around this profile with the two-point covariance function derived in [3] from the Glasma model. To ensure that the energy density is everywhere positive the GRF is mapped to an appropriate negative binomial distribution (NBD) with the same variance. NBD fluctuations have been recently shown to arise naturally from the Glasma model and to describe the measured multiplicity distributions in pp collisions at the LHC. The resulting density profile features ``hot spots"" as in the MC-KLN model overlaid with a fluctuating field texture characterized by an intrinsic length scale 1/Q_sat(x_T).
 
We show that inclusion of these additional gluonic quantum field fluctuations leads to only a small (few percent) increase of the initial eccentricities ecc_n in central collisions and to almost negligible effects at larger impact parameters. These findings disagree with some of the results reported in [4], and we will discuss possible origins for this discrepancy. Our results imply that an earlier extraction of the QGP shear viscosity from a combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow data from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [5] is robust.

Interpretation of lepton pair production rates in excess of expectations from hadronic decays observed by PHENIX and how the data constrains theoretical models on thermalization and chiral symmetry restoration is a hotly debated topic. At intermediate and high mass, the di-electron spectrum has been used by PHENIX to measure cross sections of open charm and open bottom, as well as Quarkonium suppression with implications for color screening and recombination.

Due to the small signal to background ratio, measurement of the dielectron spectrum, especially at low mass, is very challenging. In PHENIX, the background results mainly from random combinations of electron positron pairs from uncorrelated sources, mostly $\pi^0$ Dalitz decays and photon conversions.

A distinctive feature of the pre-equilibrium system (the Glasma) is the high over-population of phase space for gluons, which we argue plays a central role for the thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. In particular, the over-population (1) coherently amplifies scattering by $1/\alpha_s$ and makes the system behave as a strongly interacting fluid despite being out of equilibrium at weak coupling, (2) may lead to the dynamical, albeit transient formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate over the course of thermalization. A further distinctive feature of our scenario is that the initially single scale ($Q_s$) of Glasma develops into a hierarchy of scales, with the IR scale and the UV separated by coupling $\alpha_s$, precisely as in equilibrium thermal field theory.

Gluon saturation is expected at a low x value when gluon recombination balances gluon splitting. The nuclear (with atomic mass number A) gluon distribution is approximately $A^{1/3}$ larger than the nucleon gluon distribution function at the same x [1]. STAR is sensitive to x between 0.001 and 0.02 for the nuclear gluon distribution via di-jet measurements with calorimeter subsystems covering -1 < eta < 4. The STAR collaboration has measured forward $\pi{0}$-$\pi{0}$ correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200GeV$. The suppression of the away-side peak observed in forward-forward correlations in central d+Au collisions is consistent with the CGC expectation [2,3]. Such suppression does not appear in the forward+mid-rapidity correlations. 

The Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) at STAR covers pseudo-rapidity between 1.08 and 2, providing the opportunity to probe gluons at intermediate x via forward+near-forward correlations. Azimuthal correlations between $\pi{0}$ in the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) and jet-like clusters in the EEMC are sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution in 0.003<x<0.02 region. Together with the forward+forward correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations, we will be able to determine the sharpness of the transition along x from a dilute parton gas to the expected CGC state at low $Q^{2}$. In this talk, we will focus on FMS-$\pi^{0}$ + EEMC-jet-like-cluster azimuthal correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions.

With its more differential power full jets in heavy-ion collisions can then provide excellent tools to study the properties of the QGP and impose constraints on different parton energy loss models.

With this motivation, we investigate the cold nuclear matter(CNM) effects on jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions at LHC with the NLO perturbative QCD. The nuclear modifications for dijet angular distributions, dijet invariant mass spectra, dijet transverse momentum spectra and dijet momentum imbalance due to CNM effects are calculated by incorporating EPS, EKS, HKN and DS parametrization sets of parton distributions in nucleus. It is found that dijet angular distributions and dijet momentum imbalance are insensitive to the initial-state CNM effects and thus provide optimal tools to study the final-state hot QGP effects such as jet quenching. 

Furthermore we present the results and predictions at NLO for productions of the single, double and tagged jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by including parton energy loss effect in the QGP and the CNM effects. We demonstrate how an enhanced di-jet transverse momentum imbalance in central Pb+Pb reactions at the LHC, recently measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, can be derived from these results. We show quantitatively that a significant fraction of this enhancement may be related to the ambiguity in the separation between the jet and soft background medium and point to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of parton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ben-Wei', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Ben-Wei', 'id': '314700', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': 'b03594ed6875144bf8bd3c9dc349a77e', 'db_id': 314700, 'person_id': 343432}"

At larger and larger q, the trailing sound wave becomes less and less prominent.  The outward-going beam of gluon radiation itself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger wavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated.  In this regard, the behavior of the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets produced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction of their energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or their momentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions.  However, we know that quark-gluon plasma must be weakly coupled at short enough distance scales.  This means that even if jet quenching typically occurs as in a strongly coupled plasma, there should be rare events in which a hard parton is scattered by a larger angle, picking up significant transverse momentum.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Krishna', 'last_name': 'Rajagopal', 'fullName': 'Rajagopal, Krishna', 'id': '314795', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': '2c68a5f0ec1dce250f21eee4b240232f', 'db_id': 314795, 'person_id': 343498}"

Net-charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges present in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are expected to be different from those of the hadron gas with unit charged particles. Lattice calculations suggest that the higher moments of net-charge distributions and their products are sensitive to the correlation length, and are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of the system. The method of the Balance function, on the other hand, is sensitive to collective flow and the breakup temperature and was proposed to give a handle on the hadronization time. A combined study of net-charge fluctuations with Balance functions provides insight to the properties of matter created in high energy collisions. We will present the first results of net-charge fluctuations, higher moments of net-charge distributions and Balance functions for Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment at the LHC.

The widths of the Balance functions in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle for non-identified charged particles show a clear centrality dependence, consistent with the picture of a delayed hadronization but also with a system exhibiting larger radial expansion in central collisions.

In this spirit, we study in-medium jet evolution by considering the multiple emission of soft gluons, for which the formation time is much smaller than the size of the medium.

Photons having p_T > 1 GeV/c are thus specially suitable for probing fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density distributions. We present the p_T spectra, ratio of central to-peripheral yield and elliptic flow of thermal photons from an event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic calculation with fluctuating initial conditions (IC).

We show that fluctuations in the IC enhance the production of thermal photons significantly in the range 2 < p_T < 4 GeV/c compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged profile for Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions at RHIC (LHC) [1,2]. The relative effect of fluctuations in the IC is found to be stronger for peripheral collisions and for lower beam energies. Thermal photon p_T spectra are studied for different values of initial formation time \tau_0 as well as for centrality dependent \tau_0 values. We show that a suitably normalized ratio of central-to-peripheral yield as a function of collision centrality and p_T can be a useful measure of the fluctuation size scale [2].

PHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow at RHIC is found to be significantly larger than the v_2 results obtained using ideal hydrodynamics with smooth IC in the region 1 < p_T < 6 GeV/c. We show that fluctuations in the IC increase the elliptic flow for p_T > 2  GeV/c for  mid-central collisions compared to the results from a smooth initial-state-averaged profile [3]. We also show that these results depend strongly on the value of the fluctuation size scale as well as on the initial and final conditions of the  hydrodynamic calculation [3].

Instead, we keep all the terms in the moment expansion and truncate the exact equations of motion for these moments according to a systematic power counting scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers. We apply this formalism to obtain an approximate expression for the non-equilibrium single-particle momentum distribution function of a hadron resonance gas.

To study this possibility under realistic conditions of the expansion and the cooling of the fireball we performed dynamic simulations within our approach of nonequilibrium chiral fluid dynamics. Based on an effective phase transition model, chiral fields and their fluctuations propagate explicitly within a medium that expands fluid dynamically. The interaction between the fields and the fluid leads to dissipation and noise, which in turn affect the chiral propagation. In this talk we present the consequences of this coupled dynamics for different phase transition scenarios.
In the case of a first order phase transition we observe the development of a highly supercooled state. This leads to the dynamic formation and decay of domains of the chirally-symmetric phase in a chirally-broken environment and can be seen in single event studies. At the critical point, due to large relaxation times, we find that critical slowing down weakens the critical phenomena. However, for the first time we are able to demonstrate in a dynamic and realistic study the basic features of a critical point: the growth of the correlation length and the enhancement of event-by-event fluctuations of the sigma field. It is, therefore, expected that both, the first order phase transition and the critical point develop their characteristic signals in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marlene', 'last_name': 'Nahrgang', 'fullName': 'Nahrgang, Marlene', 'id': '314961', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '4751b9ae0f461a7314fe14eb52013856', 'db_id': 314961, 'person_id': 343613}"

Levai),parallel,Evolution of singularities in unequal time two-point correlator in formation of QGP,"Lin, Shu",Brookhaven National Laboratory,United States,"One of the most difficult problems still to be understood is the mechanism of fast thermalization in heavy ion collisions. The problem involves dynamics in strong coupling regime and physics far from equilibrium, therefore is hardly tractable by usual method. The gauge/gravity duality naturally maps the formation of quark gluon plasma to another fundamental problem in black hole physics: information loss in a gravitational collapse process. The present work summarizes our recent results on the study of a particular probe: unequal time two-point correlator for gauge theory in the evolution toward thermal equilibrium. In [1], we found that near equilibrium the spectral functions showed a universal pattern as field equilibrates in a quasi-static approximation. We have then systematically extended the previous work to the far from equilibrium region by using the coordinate representation. In the past two years we have developed a divergence matching method in computing the singularities of the unequal time two-point correlator in a time-dependent background. We found the singularities have a nice interpretation with a geometric optics picture [2,3]. Applying this method to the gravitational collapse model, we found the singularities of the unequal time correlator shifted from the real time to the complex time in the formation of QGP [4]. This signature sheds more light on the mechanism of the thermalization and may have interesting implications to heavy ion phenomenology and experiments.

We study quantitatively to what extent anisotropic flow ($v_n$) is determined by the initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_n$ for a set of realistic simulations, and we discuss which definition of $\varepsilon_n$ gives the best estimator of $v_n$.  We find that the common practice of using an $r^2$ weight in the definition of $\varepsilon_n$ in general results in a poorer predictor of $v_n$ than when using $r^n$ weight, for $n > 2$.   We similarly study the importance of additional properties of the initial state.  For example, we show that in order to correctly predict $v_4$ and $v_5$ for non-central collisions, one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional to $\varepsilon_2^2$ and $\varepsilon_2\varepsilon_3$, respectively.  We find that it makes no difference whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity, or in a single slice at $z=0$, nor is it important whether one uses an energy or entropy density weight.

In addition, an estimate of jet $v_2$ is necessary for background-subtraction in jet-triggered correlation analyses, which are used to study medium-induced jet shape modification.  However, jet $v_2$ measurements are complicated by biases in the event plane calculation due to the presence of the jet, leading to an overestimation of jet $v_2$.

The ratios of the cumulants of conserved number distributions are sensitive to the correlation length of the system created in heavy-ion collisions, hence they are considered as good observables to study phase transitions. QCD based calculations suggests that the ratios of the sixth to second ($C_{6}/C_{2}$) order cumulants of the net baryon number distributions will change rapidly in the phase transition region of the QCD phase diagram.

It is predicted to be the decisive interaction in some high-density matter systems, such as neutron stars [1]. RHIC, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, provides an ideal laboratory to study Y-N interaction because hyperons and nucleons are abundantly produced at high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.

The lifetime and decay modes of the hypertriton, the lightest hypernucleus, which consists of a proton, a neutron and the lightest hyperon Lambda, and the antimatter hypertriton discovered at RHIC[2], provide valuable insights into the Y-N interaction.

The strangeness population factor S3, defined as $\frac{{^3_\Lambda}H/^{3}He}{\Lambda/p}$, is a good representation of the local correlation between baryon number and strangeness[2]. It is predicted that S3 has a different behavior in QGP and pure hadron gas[3,4] thus can be used as a tool to distinguish Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) from a pure hadronic phase.

The RHIC beam energy scan program in 2010-2011 allowed STAR to collecte data from Au+Au collisions over a broad range of energies. This provides an opportunity to study the beam energy dependence of S3. In addition, due to the beam energy independence of our lifetime measurement method, with increased statistics of present datasets, an improved result of lifetime measurement of hypertriton can be obtained.

Using the pT of the isolated photon as an estimate of the energy of the associated parton at production, this measurement allows an unbiased characterization of the in-medium parton energy loss.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yue Shi', 'last_name': 'Lai', 'fullName': 'Lai, Yue Shi', 'id': '315196', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': 'f65b227b063a793042adcb7b975277d4', 'db_id': 315196, 'person_id': 343749}"

Previous work in this direction for a scalar \phi^4 theory [1] has now been extended to QCD. Leading contributions from unstable quantum modes can be resumed to all loop orders and expressed in terms of a gauge invariant spectrum of initial quantum fluctuations, which has been computed recently [2].  These fluctuations play a key role in decoherence of the high occupancy fields, and in their possible isotropization and flow, and in the matching of this initial dynamics to hydrodynamic flow, thereby potentially eliminating a big source of uncertainty in hydrodynamic simulations. We report on progress in the 3+1-D numerical computations implementing these pre-equilibrium dynamics.

the properties of the strongly interacting hot and dense medium

of the heavy-ion collisions and are not affected by strong
interactions, hence can probe the entire evolution of the
collision. Di-lepton production in the low mass range
($M_{ll}<1.1$ GeV/$c^{2}$) allows the study of vector meson
in-medium properties, an observable possibly connected to chiral
symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region
($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$), di-lepton measurements serve as
a tool to extract the medium thermal radiation, which provides
direct information on the temperature of the early system.
Quantitative studies on these properties require systematic
measurements of di-lepton production yields as well as elliptic
flow as a function of invariant mass and transverse momentum
($p_T$). An extension of these studies to energy and centrality
dependent measurements offer crucial information on how the
system properties evolve with collision energies and system
sizes. The STAR experiment, with its large and full azimuthal

Cole),parallel,Systematic Monte-Carlo studies of dijets at the LHC and RHIC,"Coleman-Smith, Christopher",Duke Physics,USA,"Recent results from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC have shown evidence of dramatic medium modification of di-jets. Although asymmetric di-jets are also seen in p+p collisions, di-jets with a large energy asymmetry are found much more often in Pb+Pb collisions. E.g., events with a 200 GeV leading jet and a 80 GeV subleading jet were frequently observed. The increase in the average energy asymmetry is believed to be caused by in-medium energy loss that arises from the  interaction of the colored jet constituents with the hot deconfined matter formed is the collision. The modified di-jets provide a means to study the nature of the high energy interactions of this deconfined matter. 

The observed di-jet suppression has been quantified in terms of the asymmetry A_j, the ratio of the difference between the two jet energies to their sum. It is not a priori clear that this is the observable best suited to extract information about the modification of the di-jets and the nature of their interactions with the deconfined medium. Understanding the sensitivity of di-jet observables to properties of the deconfined medium and to experimental factors is vital if they are to become a useful tool for jet tomography of hot QCD matter.

We have examined the response of the di-jet asymmetry and other di-jet observables to variations in the jet modification mechanism and to variations of the observables. We present a systematic study of di-jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC using the VNI/BMS parton cascade.  VNI/BMS is a jet+medium Monte-Carlo code which provides a controllable testbed with sufficient complexity to model jet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from hydrodynamics and hadronization.   

We consider the medium modification of the di-jet asymmetry A_j and the energy distribution within the di-jets (jet shape).  Di-jets are examined under the modification of: the jet transport coefficient qhat; the path length of leading and sub-leading jets; cuts on the jet energy distributions; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism and the strong coupling constant.  We find that, while the jet asymmetry and jet shape are similarly sensitive to the in-medium path length, the jet-shape is more sensitive to the nature of the interaction with the medium and the value of q-hat than the jet asymmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christopher', 'last_name': 'Coleman-Smith', 'fullName': 'Coleman-Smith, Christopher', 'id': '315252', 'affiliation': 'Duke Physics', 'emailHash': '9377909f916edd5a1f74b80da2b65873', 'db_id': 315252, 'person_id': 343792}"

This mature extraction technique offers an ideal way to obtain a clean and very collimated high-energy beam, without altering the performance of the LHC~\cite{Uggerhoj:2005xz,Scandale:2011zz,LUA9}. The multi-TeV LHC beams grant the most energetic fixed-target experiment ever performed, to study \pp, \pd\ and \pA\ collisions at \mbox{$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \simeq 115\,\mathrm{GeV}$} and \PbA\ collisions at \mbox{$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \simeq 72\,\mathrm{GeV}$}. AFTER -- for A Fixed-Target ExperRiment -- gives access to new domains of particle and nuclear physics complementing that of collider experiments, in particular RHIC and the projects of electron-ion colliders. The typical instantaneous luminosity achievable with AFTER in \pp\ and \pA\ mode~\cite{Brodsky:2012vg} surpasses that of RHIC by more than 3~orders of magnitude  and is comparable to that of the LHC collider mode. This provides a quarkonium and heavy-flavour observatory in \pp\ and \pA\ collisions where, by instrumenting the target-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark distributions of the proton, the neutron and the nuclei can be accessed at large $x$ and even at $x$ larger than unity in the nuclear case.
The nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique opportunity to study cold nuclear matter versus the features of the hot and dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, including the formation of the quark-gluon plasma. During the one-month lead runs, \PbA\ collisions can be studied at a luminosity comparable to that of RHIC and the LHC over the full range of target-rapidity domain. Modern detection technology should allow for the study of quarkonium excited states, in particular the $\chi_c$ and $\chi_b$ resonances, even in the challenging high-multiplicity environment of \pA\ and \PbA\ collisions, magnified by the boost of the fixed-target mode.
Precise data from \pp, \pA\ and \PbA\ should help to greatly improve our understanding of heavy-quark and quarkonium production, to clear the way to use them for gluon and heavy-quark PDF extraction in free and bound nucleons, to unravel cold from hot nuclear effects and to restore the status of heavy quarkonia as a golden test of lattice QCD in terms of dissociation temperature predictions at a \sqrtsNN\ where the recombination process is expected to have a small impact. The fixed-target mode also has the advantage to allow for spin measurements with polarized targets. We will discuss a tentative design for AFTER, and report the projected detector performances from the first preliminary simulations.

At the top RHIC energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is interpreted as a signature of deconfinement and the formation of the QGP phase. A disappearance of the NCQ scaling is expected for a pure hadronic system at low beam energies. Hence it is a necessary signature to identify the phase transition.

Significant difference in $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is observed between particles and corresponding anti-particles for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 39 GeV. These differences are more pronounced for baryons compared to mesons and they increase with decreasing energy and increasing centrality.

Levai),parallel,Derivation of the medium-induced splitting kernels from Soft Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber gluons,"ovanesyan, grigory",LANL,USA,"We derive the splitting kernels for partons produced in large Q^2 scattering processes that subsequently traverse a region of strongly-interacting matter using a recently-developed effective theory Soft Collinear Effective Theory with Glauber Gluons (SCETG). We include all corrections beyond the small-x approximation, consistent with the power counting of SCETG. We demonstrate how medium recoil, geometry, expansion scenarios, and phase space cuts can be implemented numerically for phenomenological applications and quantify the effect of these uncertainties. We also prove the factorization of the medium-induced splitting from the hard process that creates the jet. We show that in the soft gluon approximation our result reduces to the parton energy loss obtained in the framework of the reaction operator approach. This limit is illustrated with an application to inclusive hadron suppression and comparison to the new ALICE and CMS results at the LHC. We discuss ongoing work on obtaining next-to-leading order splitting kernels in the medium and possible applications to heavy ion event generators.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'grigory', 'last_name': 'ovanesyan', 'fullName': 'ovanesyan, grigory', 'id': '315412', 'affiliation': 'LANL', 'emailHash': '92f6d5c6b46d1d3dc4d7db52cc56fdf2', 'db_id': 315412, 'person_id': 343884}"
Parallel 7B: Exploring the QCD Phase Diagram (Chair H. Huang),parallel,Search for the QCD Critical Point by Higher Moments of Net-proton Multiplicity Distributions at STAR,"Luo, Xiaofeng",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program is to search for the QCD Critical Point and the phase boundary in the QCD phase diagram. Higher moments of event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distributions have high sensitivity to the correlation length[1], and they are directly connected to the susceptibilities in the Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) calculations and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. Therefore, they are ideal tools to search for the QCD critical point[4]

In this talk, we will present various moments (variance [σ^2], skewness[S] and kurtosis [κ], moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants (ω3 and ω4) of net-proton and total-proton multiplicity distributions measured by the STAR detector at RHIC. The moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants are related to the volume independent susceptibility ratios. The data presented in this talk will include the measurements of centrality dependence for the net-protons and total-protons from Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. These results have been compared with a Poisson baseline. It is observed that the moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants of net-proton distributions in the 0-5% most central Au+Au collisions show significant deviations from the Poisson expectations around √sNN = 19.6 GeV. Those results will be also compared with UrQMD model calculations.

Parallel 5D: New Theoretical Developments (Chair B. Sinha),parallel,Temperature dependence of the shear viscosity in the semi-QGP,"Pisarski, Robert",Brookhaven National Lab.,USA,"An effective theory for the region near the critical temperature, the ""semi""-QGP, has been developed.  In QCD, this is dominated by the partial ionization of color, up to temperatures about 300 MeV.  Using the effective model, the temperature dependence for the ratio of the shear viscosity, to the entropy, is computed.  This predicts a sharp increase in this ratio between ~ 160 MeV and ~ 300 MeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robert', 'last_name': 'Pisarski', 'fullName': 'Pisarski, Robert', 'id': '315435', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Lab.', 'emailHash': 'eb2e8d78428a2a5b6c2ae18b2c8bed44', 'db_id': 315435, 'person_id': 343897}"
Parallel 3B: Jets (Chair S. Mioduszewski),parallel,Understanding LHC jets in the light of RHIC data,"Renk, Thorsten",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Hard probes are a cornerstone in the ongoing program to determine the properties of hot and dense QCD matter as created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. The first two runs at the LHC have resulted in a wealth of measurements of both reconstructed jets and single inclusive high P_T hadrons, opening new kinematic windows and offering high statistics. Yet on first glance, several observations are counter-intuitive and seem to contradict results from the RHIC high P_T program. I present a combined analysis of high P_T hadronic observables at RHIC and LHC and reconstructed jets at LHC in a framework testing a large number of theoretical models for both medium evolution and shower medium interactions against the systematics of the data. I demonstrate how a consistent picture of shower-medium interaction emerges from the combined results and explain where and why results appear counter-intuitive. In particular, I discuss the role of jet measurements in constraining models critically and suggest measurements sensitive to the gaps in our knowledge.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Thorsten', 'last_name': 'Renk', 'fullName': 'Renk, Thorsten', 'id': '315442', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyväskylä', 'emailHash': '8630df57e574e58d6aa3c8ac319b3b22', 'db_id': 315442, 'person_id': 343453}"
