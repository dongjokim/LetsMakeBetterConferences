Parallel 4A: Global & Collective Dynamics (Chair P. Sorenson),parallel,"Deviation from quark number scaling of the anisotropy parameter v2 of pions, kaons, and protons in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV","huang, shengli",PHENIX Collaboration,Unknown,"The number of quark ($n_q$) scaling, which is manifested
as $v^{hadron}_{2}(p_T) \approx n_q*v_2(p_T/n_q)$, is an
approximate scaling that comes from the addition of the valence
quark momenta at hadronization. The observation of $n_q$ scaling
has been claimed that a partonic matter with quark-like degrees
of freedom and significant collectivity has been generated in
heavy ion collisions~\ref{1,2}. However, there are several
theoretical considerations that suggest that the $n_q$ scaling
should be violated in certain conditions. For example, the
contribution of sea quarks and gluons have been shown to affect
the $n_q$ scaling in the models including higher Fock states. And
models that consider recombination between ""thermal"" and ""shower""
partons predict centrality dependent deviations from $n_q$
scaling.

   Understanding the limits of the recombination domain is important
in relation to viscous hydrodynamics and the extraction of the
shear viscosity over entropy density ($\eta/s$) from the data, as
well as for developing a unified approach in describing jet energy
loss and high $p_T$ $v_2$. Searches for deviations from $n_q$
scaling are also important for the low-energy scan program at RHIC
as they have been considered as a signature of the transition
between sQGP formation and a hadronic system. In this talk, we
will report on high-statistics measurements of the second order
Fourier coefficient $v_2$ for identified pions, kaons and protons,
which extend to relatively high $p_T$ around 6 GeV/c. Comparisons
with published measurements of $K^{0}_{S}$ and $\Lambda$ are shown
for the different centralities. With these new measurements, the
$p_T$ limits and centrality dependence of the $n_q$ scaling
deviations are being carried out in PHENIX.

One such probe are hadrons which carry heavy flavor (charm and bottom quarks). They are a powerful tool for studying the medium because they are generated early in the reaction and subsequently propagate through the created matter.

Two very striking results have already been seen for open heavy flavor from the PHENIX experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi-leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm or bottom quarks.  First, heavy mesons, despite their large mass, exhibit a suppression at high transverse momentum compared to that expected from p+p interactions. This suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium. Secondly, an elliptic flow is observed for heavy mesons which is comparable to that of light mesons like pions. This imply that the same heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow—giving new insight into the strongly coupled nature of the QGP fluid at these temperatures. In these early results, PHENIX was not able to distinguish electrons from c and b independently. In order to understand these medium effects in more detail it is imperative to directly measure the nuclear modification and the flow of c and b separately.

With the addition of the silicon vertex tracker, VTX, to PHENIX these direct measurements are now possible. We will present the latest PHENIX measurements of single electrons from beauty and charm decays, emphasizing the flow, v2, and nuclear modification factor, RAA, including the latest progress with the VTX.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rachid', 'last_name': 'Nouicer', 'fullName': 'Nouicer, Rachid', 'id': '315209', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)', 'emailHash': '3040e318e850403fd595cce07706c471', 'db_id': 315209, 'person_id': 343758}"

Understanding the dynamics responsible for such rapid ""hydroization"" is a challenge using traditional perturbative field theory.   In recent years holography has emerged as a powerful tool to study non-equilibrium phenomena, mapping the dynamics of certain quantum field theories onto the dynamics of semi-classical gravity. Via holography, the production of quark-gluon plasma maps onto the process of gravitational collapse and black hole formation, with the relaxation of the black hole's gravitational field encoding hydroization of the dual quark gluon plasma.  Thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma is encoded in the thermalization of the black hole's Hawking radiation.

Due to their large mass, the charm quarks are mainly formed in the first instants of the nuclear collision and will consequently experience the full history of the system. It was predicted that the strongly bound J/Ã state will be suppressed in the hot and deconfined quark-gluon plasma due to the color screening effect. This effect was already observed in Au-Au collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV at RHIC. It was also predicted that high production yields of charm quarks in nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and especially at LHC energies will make possible (re)combination thus possibly leading to J/psi enhancement compared to lower energy nuclear collisions and to pp collisions.
ALICE measures the J/psi at mid-rapidity, |y| < 0.9, down to zero transverse momentum. The reconstruction is performed using the J/psi decay into the di-electron channel. The electron identification is done using energy loss in gaseous detectors (the Time Projection Chamber and the Transition Radiation Detector) and the time-of-flight method (Time Of Flight detector).

We present measurements of $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons at mid-rapidity in a wide transverse momentum range in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies measured with the ALICE detector. The mesons are reconstructed via their two-photon decays by two complementary methods, using the electromagnetic calorimeters and the central tracking system for photons converted to electron-positron pairs on the material of the inner ALICE barrel tracking detectors.

The spectrum and the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of the $\pi^0$ production measured in Pb-Pb collisions at different collision centralities show a clear pattern of strong suppression with respect to pp collisions. The azimuthal anisotropy ($v_{2}$) of the $\pi^0$ production is consistent with $v_{2}$ for other hadron species.

Experiments at the LHC observed that multiplicities in the central region of proton-proton collisions follow a negative binomial distribution and that they do exhibit KNO scaling. The negative binomial distribution has been theoretically reproduced in the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism with a Gaussian (McLerran-Venugopalan) action.

Poster Session Reception,poster,"Critical fluctuations of the higher moments of order parameter and energy from 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models","Wu, Yuanfang","Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, Wuhan, China",Unknown,"Higher moments of net-baryon are suggested to be sensitive probe of QCD critical end point [1] in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Their critical fluctuations are highly interesting and instructive for the exploration of QCD phase diagram from both theoretical and experimental sides. 
     According to the universality of critical behavior, the QCD critical end point, and the chiral phase transition in two-flavor QCD are argued to be the same universality class of 3 dimensional Ising model [2], and O(2), or O(4) model[3], respectively. The generic structures of net-baryon fluctuations at QCD critical end point and chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential can be discussed by the order-parameter fluctuations in Ising model and the energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) model [4,5]. So in the present work, the higher moments of order parameter and energy from 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models near the critical temperature at finite size are systematically studied, and compared with those obtained from effective models, and Lattice QCD calculations.   
     It is found that the generic structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising, O(2) and O(4) models are similar. So do energy fluctuations. On the other hand, the singular structures of order parameter fluctuations appear at lower moments, e.g., the oscillation structures of 4th moment of order parameter, which may reflect the generic structure of 4th order moment of baryon number in the vicinity of critical end point, are similar to the 3rd moments of energy, which corresponding to the 6th moment of net-baryon number at chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with vanishing baryon chemical potential. This means that even higher moments, such as 6th moments of net-baryon number, are necessary in probing the chiral phase transition temperature, the same as what suggested in ref. [5].
     The generic singular structures of order-parameter fluctuations in 3D-Ising and energy fluctuations in O(2), or O(4) models are qualitatively consistent with corresponding estimations of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [6], Linear Sigma model [7], Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio [8], Polyakov Quark Meson models [9], and current lattice QCD calculations [10].

Experiments towards the characterisation of strongly interacting matter at high density will need to focus on rare probes and the study of their collective properties and hadronization, particularly at soft momentum scales. Such considerations have motivated the development of a comprehensive upgrade strategy for ALICE to provide high rate capability (50 kHz for Pb-Pb collisions) in a near minimum bias mode by building a new Inner Tracking System and by modifying all major ALICE detectors to provide a fully pipelined read-out. This implies also a major upgrade of the data acquisition and high level trigger system. Further details of the overall ALICE upgrade strategy are described in [1]. This contribution will describe the proposed approach to upgrading the Inner Tracking System (ITS) in order to both comply with the new requirements set by the ALICE global upgrade strategy and to dramatically improve the performance for heavy-flavour detection. The ITS Upgrade will have greatly improved features in terms of: determination of the distance of closest approach (dca) to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low pt, momentum resolution and readout capabilities. These improvements are possible as a consequence of the spectacular progress made in the field of imaging sensors over the last ten years as well as the possibility to install a smaller radius beampipe. Moreover a tracker with the above features, in particular a high standalone tracking efficiency, creates an opportunity to perform, in combination with the TRD and TOF detectors, online event selection on the basis of topological and PID criteria. Such a new silicon tracker will allow ALICE to measure charm and beauty production in Pb-Pb collisions with sufficient statistical accuracy down to very low transverse  momentum, measure charm baryons and perform exclusive measurements of beauty production. A comprehensive description of the ITS Upgrade can be found in the recent Conceptual Design Report [2].

Its prediction power relies on the universality of the parton distributions among different processes. In our recent publication [1], we established an effective factorization in hard processes in nuclei scattered by a dilute probe. This factorization enables us to identify the key observables to probe the so-called unintegrated gluon distributions, the central objects in the saturation framework. This has been a long-standing issue in small-x physics. From our studies, we found that the dijet-correlations in deep inelastic scattering of electron-nucleus collisions directly measure the Weizacker-Williams gluon distribution function, whereas the photon-jet correlation in nucleon-nucleus (pA) collisions probes the dipole gluon distribution. The dijet (di-hadron) correlations in pA collisions can probe both gluon distributions. Current experiments in deuteron-gold (dAu) collisions at RHIC, and future pA collisions at LHC, and the planed electron-ion collider (EIC) experiments, will provide great opportunities to study two-particle collisions and the associated strong interaction dynamics of the gluon distributions in cold nucleus at small-x. 

Recently, both STAR and PHENIX collaborations have reported the measurements of two-hadron correlations in the forward direction of dAu collisions at RHIC [2], where the strong de-correlation of the away-side hadron have been considered as the best evidence for saturation physics. The numeric calculations based on our factorization formalism provides a quantitative and thorough description of the experimental data in the saturation formalism [3], including the large broadening of the angular distribution and suppression of the peak for the away-side hadron. The disappearing of the away-side peak in central collisions indicates that the saturation scale is the same order as the hard jet transverse momentum, which is a clear signal of the onset of the saturation. From the kinematics, we conclude that the saturation scale reaches 2GeV at x~6x10-4 in the center of the gold nucleus with jet transverse momentum kt~3GeV at rapidity 3.2. Future measurements at RHIC and LHC and the planed EIC will provide more information and help to map out the complete phase structure of the cold nuclei matter at small-x.

The implications of including multi-strange hadrons and choosing different ensembles (Grand canonical versus Strangeness canonical) in THERMUS model on the $T$ and $mu_{B}$ values will be discussed.

The effect is attributed to the energy loss of the energetic parent partons traversing the created medium.
Since $\pi^0$ and $\omega$ mesons have the same quark content (u and d), the comparison of the suppression between $\pi^$ and $\omega$ can provide 
information whether the energy loss occurs at the parton level or not.

The ALICE detector covers a wide central region (|\eta|<0.9) to reconstruct charged particles and has two electro-magnetic calorimeters with good energy resolution.

The first correlates the azimuthal distribution of particles at mid-rapidity in the central arm of PHENIX with event planes determined by the detectors widely spaced in pseudorapidity to avoid non-flow effects. 
The second method is a two particle correlation between a charge weighted azimuthal angle in the Beam Beam Counters and the azimuthal angle of a track in the central arms of the PHENIX detector. Again, the pseudorapidity gap is present to avoid non-flow effects. This method has the added benefit of not requiring that the reaction plane angle be determined.

asymmetry (STSA) in polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the high-energy scattering approximation. In this framework the STSA originates from the q -> q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function followed by a  perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks is in qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing projectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T, peaking near the saturation scale Q_s in our framework. Our mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton--nucleus collisions should be much smaller than in proton--proton collisions. We also observe that in our formalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew', 'last_name': 'Sievert', 'fullName': 'Sievert, Matthew', 'id': '315443', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': 'e058819bfde6f5cec54f04a0870e377b', 'db_id': 315443, 'person_id': 343902}"

However, a full understanding of these results in terms of direct contributions from the QGP is still evolving. An incomplete knowledge of the baseline cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, as well as the possibility of competing effects present in the QGP, such as recombination, has hindered a full understanding of the observed heavy ion results.

In order to quantify the CNM effects present at RHIC, PHENIX has measured both $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ production in $d$+Au collisions over a wide range in rapidity with the inclusion of new measurements of $\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ production at midrapidity. PHENIX finds a suppression relative to $p$+$p$ collisions which is greater at forward rapidity and similar between the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$, leading to interesting implications of the RHIC heavy ion results. New measurements of the transverse momentum dependence of the $J/\psi$ nuclear modification factor provide further constraints on CNM effects, as well as constraining the Cronin effect at RHIC energies.

These collisions promise an array of unique geometrical configurations including odd harmonics and events where the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au.  Such geometries present an opportunity to probe the ""core"" and ""corona"" regions of the collision (which are strongly asymmetric in Cu+Au) by measuring the reaction plane dependence of particle production.  J/psi production may be more sensitive to the least dense part of the collision at the surface - the corona - thus providing a handle of the relative size of the Cu- versus Au-side corona.  An important component of this analysis is the understanding of the light-hadron vn(n=1,2,3,4) and the correlation between the vn event planes in these collisions, which will reveal the underlying hydrodynamical properties of the system.  In particular, the odd harmonics from the Cu+Au system offer sensitivity to v3 generated from the collision geometry as opposed to fluctuations in a symmetric system.

Poster Session Reception,poster,New method for measuring longitudinal fluctuations and  directed flow in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions,"Eyyubova, Gyulnara",University of Oslo (NO),Unknown,"Recently significant effort is made to study azimuthal flow asymmetries in ultra-relativistic heavy ion reactions. At finite impact parameters the directed flow and the elliptic flow were dominant observables for many years.

In head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. In addition in head-on collisions the third harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, v_3, exceeds the second one, v_2, and becomes the dominant harmonic component in accordance with large fluctuations. The fact that high harmonics, measured up to v_8, survive the fluid dynamical expansion indicates that the QGP fluid is almost perfect, and does not absorb high-harmonics.

Fluctuations must also appear in the longitudinal direction, especially in peripheral reactions where the projectile and target spectators may not be exactly the same size. As a first step of our study, we estimate the Event-by-Event (EbE) c.m. rapidity fluctuations using a method based on Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC)s. In peripheral reactions one can check if significant correlation between the EbE c.m. rapidities measured in the TPC and via the ZDCs do exist. This then leads to the possibility to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations.

The first v_1 measurements at LHC [2] were also arising dominantly from random fluctuations as both the even and odd rapidity combinations gave the same result. As a second step, with the aim to determine the global asymmetry component of the directed flow v_1, we propose that the participant system Event-by-Event shifted from the Lab. c.m. frame to the measurable participant c.m. rapidity EbE, thus removing or minimizing the effect of random longitudinal fluctuations. Then following the global asymmetry the ""odd"" component of the directed flow can be separated and identified using this method.

This new method [3] enables us to separate fluctuating and the global symmetry components in the flow, which is important for the odd harmonics, especially for v_1 and v_3. Thus one can study experimentally the rotation effect [4] and the possible occurrence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability [5] in the globally symmetric component of the collective flow.

A long standing issue in vn measurements is the contamination of nonflow, caused by intrinsic particle correlations unrelated to the collision geometry. Nonflow limits, in part, the precise extraction of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s from data-model comparisons. Isolation of flow and nonflow is critical to the interpretation of the Fourier decomposition of dihadron correlations.

In this talk we report measurements of vn azimuthal anisotropies using the two- and mult-particle Q-cumulants method from STAR in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. The centrality and pT dependence of vn will be presented. We compare the four- and six-particle cumulant measurements to gain insights on the nature of flow fluctuations [1,2]. We further analyze two- and four-particle cumulants between pseudo-rapidity (eta) bins. Exploiting the collision symmetry about mid-rapidity, we isolate the \Delta\eta-dependent and \Delta\eta-independent correlations in the data with a data-driven method [3]. The \Delta\eta-dependent part arises from near-side nonflow correlations, such as HBT interferometry, resonance decays, and jet-correlations. The \Delta\eta-independent part is dominated by flow and flow fluctuations with relatively small contribution from away-side jet-correlations. The method does not make assumptions about the eta dependence of flow. Our isolated \Delta\eta-independent part from data, dominated by flow, however, is found to be also eta-independent within the STAR TPC of +-1 unit of pseudo-rapidity. The \Delta\eta drop in the measured two-particle cumulant appears to entirely come from nonflow. We assess the effect of the nonflow on eta/s extraction. We reexamine the high-pT triggered dihadron correlations with background subtraction of our decomposed flows.

Their production rates provide access to the initial state PDFs, which are expected to be modified by nuclear effects. They also provide a means to calibrate the expected energy of jets that are produced in the medium, and thus are a tool to probe the physics of jet quenching more precisely both through jet rates and fragmentation properties. The ATLAS detector measures photons with its hermetic, longitudinally segmented calorimeter, which gives excellent spatial and energy resolution, and detailed information about the shower shape of each measured photon. This gives powerful rejection against the expected background from neutral pions coming from jets. Rejection against jet fragmentation products is further enhanced by isolation criteria, which can be based on calorimeter energy or the presence of high pT tracks. First results on the rates of isolated direct photons from approximately 140 µb-1 of lead-lead data will be shown, as a function of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and centrality, and their rates compared to expectations from perturbative QCD.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Iwona', 'last_name': 'Grabowska-Bold', 'fullName': 'Grabowska-Bold, Iwona', 'id': '315476', 'affiliation': 'AGH Univesity of Science and  Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': 'd6c60f560a8c55f131facda14403a8e7', 'db_id': 315476, 'person_id': 343918}"

This effect is usually explained by recombination of constituent quarks during QGP hadronisation, or as a consequence of a strong radial flow developed during the heavy-ion collision. In this contribution, a different mechanism to favour baryon-over-meson production is proposed: when hadrons are formed in the recombination of nearby quarks and antiquarks, only colour-singlet combinations can be chosen. Hadron formation, in particular the probability to create baryons or mesons, depends on the distribution of colour charges among quarks. If the distribution is random – a reasonable assumption for Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP) – the baryon-to-meson ratio is nearly twice higher than in the situation where quark colours are pre-arranged to obtain a white hadron in the combination of nearest quarks and antiquarks. The correlation of colour charges in the QGP also influences the distance over which recombination occurs. A study of the dependencies of the baryon-to-meson ratio and of the size of the recombination domain on the colour-correlation configuration will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Karel', 'last_name': 'Safarik', 'fullName': 'Safarik, Karel', 'id': '314750', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '7c0584a0416271ce30fe6cab11de9751', 'db_id': 314750, 'person_id': 343357}"

Parallel 7E: New Theoretical Developments (Chair P.

they interact with light partons through both elastic and radiative processes evaluated by resorting to some parameterization of the running coupling constant, while those partons are spatially distributed along hydrodynamical evolution of the hot medium. This approach is able to explain successfully several observables measured at RHIC, such as the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flow of non-photonic single electrons. The diffusion coefficient of heavy quarks in the quark gluon plasma -- a fundamental property of this state of matter -- can thus be extracted and compared with recent lattice calculations. In this contribution, we discuss the predictions of our model for D and B mesons production in URHIC at LHC energies and confront them with experimental results obtained so far by ALICE and CMS collaborations for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76~{\rm TeV}$. 

The slight excess of quenching found w.r.t. the D mesons data at LHC trigers our interest in new effects neglected up to now, such as the influence of gluon damping on radiative energy loss and its phenomenological consequences. In \cite{Bluhm:2011}, we have indeed studied the effect of an absorptive medium on standard LPM \cite{LPM} radiation in electrodynamics and have advocated that the large time needed for the photon formation in Bremsstrahlung from ultrarelativistic charges is not affordable if damping is taken into account. Similar effect manifests itself in QCD, as we have recently advocated in \cite{Bluhm_2012}. In our QM contribution, we intend to concentrate on the {\em implications} of such an effect on the quenching of particles in URHIC (discussing observables such as spectra, elliptic flow and azimutal correlations) as well as on the single electron puzzle.

The interaction between heavy quarks and the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics, therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an ideal probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting QCD matter.
In this talk, we will present the STAR results of open charm hadron production at mid-rapidity in $p+p$ and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Open charm mesons were reconstructed directly via hadronic decay channels with daughter particles identified by TPC and TOF detectors.  With abundant statistics of Au+Au collisions collected by STAR in the year 2010 and 2011, the D-meson is measured at $p_T$ from 0.2 to 8 GeV in minimum bias Au+Au collisions. The centrality dependence of D-meson $p_T$ spectra as well as the nuclear modification factor will be presented. A first measurement of the $D^{0}$ elliptic flow in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be reported. These measurements are compared to theoretical model calculations and physics implications will be discussed.

Jet fragmentation in vacuum is well described by perturbative QCD and is characterized by color coherence effects that lead to the angular ordering of successive branchings along the jet. To investigate the alteration of color coherence in jets in the QGP we study the radiation pattern of a  color-correlated quark-anti-quark antenna  which is in fact the building block of jet evolution in vacuum. 

We show that in a dense medium the onset of coherence is governed by the hardest scale induced by the presence of the medium. In a medium of length $L$ and transport coefficient $\hat q$ this can either be the typical transverse momentum broadening  of the gluon in the medium, $\sqrt{\hat q L}$, or the inverse of the size of the antenna as probed by the medium, namely  $r_\perp^{-1}=(\theta_{qq} L)^{-1}$, where $\theta_{qq}$ is the opening angle of the antenna. Therefore, for $k_\perp<max(\sqrt{\hat q L}, r_\perp^{-1})$  we obtain complete decoherence of the antenna; for larger momenta color coherence is restored.

of mesons and baryons carry important information about the emitting

are sensitive to the homogeneity lengths of the system. Hydrodynamic
models predict that these will decrease with increasing transverse
mass of the pair. Such decrease is universally reported for pions,
also at the LHC. Kaons and baryons, having a much larger mass, allow
to significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The femtoscopic
results for heavier particles would put a strong constraint on such
predictions. Non-identical baryon and meson pairs are also sensitive
to emission asymmetries.

Femtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to
the strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon
pair types. Most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction
which has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of
the H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon
potentials, which have a significant contribution from annihilation
channels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle
spectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of
the small proton yield at the LHC.

We show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types

neutral and charged kaons, protons and lambdas. Femtoscopic analysis

Effects such as nuclear shadowing, Cronin enhancement, and initial-state parton energy loss, among others, are not only interesting in their own right, but have direct implications on QGP-related measurements in $A+A$ collisions.

Recently PHENIX has measured CNM effects at midrapidity in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV $d$+Au collisions.  Measurements of reconstructed jets reveal the centrality dependence of both jet suppression and broadening of the away-side jet.  Meanwhile, single electrons from heavy flavor decays exhibit enhancement over a broad $p_T$ range and increasing with centrality.  These results will be presented and compared to our present understanding of CNM effects to see if simultaneous constraints on nuclear shadowing, initial state energy loss, and Cronin effects can be found.  The centrality dependence of the nuclear modification, for which there is no a priori model, will be examined in the context of available theoretical models of CNM effects, including the EPS09 nuclear-modified parton distribution functions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Baldo', 'last_name': 'Sahlmueller', 'fullName': 'Sahlmueller, Baldo', 'id': '314279', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '824301bc11f51d64567239f02fc00912', 'db_id': 314279, 'person_id': 343106}"

We search for possible effects of the initial high anisotropy of pressure on the final soft-hadronic observables. We find that by appropriate adjustment of the initial energy density and/or the initial pseudorapidity distributions, the effects of the initial anisotropy of pressure may be easily compensated and the final hadronic observables become insensitive to early dynamics. 
Our results indicate that the early thermalization assumption is not necessary to describe hadronic data, in particular, to reproduce the measured elliptic flow v2. The complete thermalization of matter (local equilibration) may take place only at the times of about 1–2 fm/c, in agreement with the results of microscopic models.

PHENIX has measured the spectra of direct photons in different collision systems and at different energies, over a broad range of transverse momentum. Photons were measured with different methods, using different subsystems, to extend the range of transverse momentum and to minimize the size of systematic uncertainties.

This is often referred to as the ridge, and was found to extend to delta eta 9 units at the LHC. Using preliminary STAR data [3], we discuss methods to decompose 2D di-hadron correlations in Au+Au 200 GeV collisions on the nearside. Our analysis is performed as a function of centrality and pT. We propose a model that encompasses azimuthal flow up to 4 orders (v1, v2, v3, and v4). The remainder of the correlation function is modeled via an asymmetric 2d Gaussian, which we refer to as non-flow. We find our model describes the data very well. The extracted flow parameters are compared to model predictions [4,5]. We investigate possible scalings for the Gaussian remainder, and compare it's properties to a similar structure observed in p+p 200 GeV collisions. These findings will help us shed on the production mechanism of the remainder. Finally, we will provide an estimate of the ratio of non-flow to flow as a function of centrality and pT, which will aid a variety of other flow studies at these energies.

With the addition of the MPC-EX, the neutral pion reconstruction range extends to energies > 80 GeV, a factor of four improvement over current capabilities.  Not only will the MPC-EX strengthen PHENIX's existing forward $\pi^0$ and jet measurements, it also provides the necessary $\pi^0$ rejection to make a direct photon measurement feasible.  With this $\pi^0$ rejection, direct photon yields at high $p_{T}$, $p_{T}$ > 3 GeV, can be statistically extracted using a double ratio method.  The direct photon $R_{dAu}$ measured with the MPC-EX will quantify the level of gluon shadowing or saturation in the Au nucleus at low-x, x ~ 10^-3, with a projected systematic error band a factor of four smaller than EPS09’s current allowable range.  Direct photons at forward rapidities are optimally sensitive to the gluon distribution because, unlike pions, direct photons are only produced by processes that are directly sensitive to the gluon distribution at leading order.

Photons are produced at all stages of the colliding system and through decay of produced particles like neutral pions. The multiplicity measurement of photons on an event-by-event basis is an important measurement complementing the charged particle measurement in a heavy ion collision. Inclusive photon production at forward rapidity shows an energy-independent longitudinal scaling as observed at √sNN = 62.4 and 200 GeV [1,2]. Photons measurements at lower energies will be helpful in further testing the energy dependence of the longitudinal scaling.

This is the first comparison between multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations and flow fluctuations in the same framework. The simultaneous investigation of these observables allows us to study the interplay of correlations induced by collision geometry and common points of production. We employ a framework of initial state Glasma flux tubes followed by later stage hydrodynamic flow modeled in a blast wave. Our approach has the advantage that we can test our calculations over a broad range of collision systems and energies and provide useful benchmarks for more rigorous event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. Our survey over these observables reveals a common energy and centrality dependence that we attribute to the production mechanism. Glasma calculations are consistent with this dependence [2,3].

At low $p_T$ soft processes dominate whereas hard processes dominate at higher $p_T$.  Experimental data has shown drastic change from d+Au to Au+Au collision in $p_T$ spectra, collective phenomena, and baryon/meson ratio at intermediate $p_T$.  This indicates that the relative mixture of particles produced by hard and soft processes differ between Au+Au and d+Au at a given, relatively low $p_T$ (< 2.0GeV).  It is therefore expected that the dihadron correlations will differ between d+Au and Au+Au with relatively low trigger particle $p_T$.  In this talk we present the near-side jet-like correlations in d+Au and Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV by STAR.

To access the time evolution and the initial state, one needs either additional information about the Equation of State (EoS) of this matter, or one needs to analyze penetrating probes, such as direct photon observables. [1] In this talk we review recent hydrodynamic solutions, and show new exact, analytic solutions of hydrodynamics with arbitrary temperature dependent EoS. We investigate special cases of this class of solutions, in particular, we present exact hydrodynamical solutions with the Equation of State determined from lattice QCD calculations. [2] We calculate direct photon spectra, elliptic flow and HBT radii and compare them to recent direct photon measurements performed by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC [3]. The first family of rotating solutions of relativistic and non-relativistic hydrodynamics are also shown [4]. The effect of the total angular momentum of the system on the elliptic flow and HBT radii is also reviewed. It is an important result that elliptic flow may be generated by the rotation of the system.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Antiparticle to particle ratios and identified hadron spectra for p+p collisions in sqrt(s)=62.4 GeV at STAR,"Gupta, Shikshit",University of Jammu,Unknown,"Information about the evolution of the system formed during the high energy p + p collisions can be obtained by investigating the charged particle ratios. The particle ratios serve as an important indicator of the collision dynamics [1]. These can be used to probe the process of hadronization in high energy collisions. In this poster, we will present measurements of mid-rapidity antiparticle to particle ratios in p + p collisions at sqrt(s)= 62.4 GeV from the STAR experiment. The charged pion and kaon particle ratios as well as the antiproton to proton ratios will be measured as a function of transverse momentum using the TPC detector. Charged hadrons will be identiﬁed by using speciﬁc ionization energy loss at the low momentum region (0.15 to 0.75 GeV) [2-3]. We will compare our results with the previous measurements made with same collision system at ISR energies [4]. Antiproton to proton ratio will be obtained after applying background corrections to the proton yields.

The earlier PHENIX measurement, using data taken in 2004 shows significant deviations from hadronic decay expectations. The most recent data set from 2010, taken with the the Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) upgrade designed to reduce the combinatorial background, promises to be a more significant result. This new data set requires an update to the simulations of hadronic cocktail contributions. The cocktail provides the benchmark for studying medium effects, such as the previously reported low mass excess. The new simulation takes into account improved PHENIX measurements of the cross sections for some of the hadrons (\eta, \phi, \omega), as well as an improved line shape of the \rho meson. In addition, it also includes the modified PHENIX acceptance and additional detector material. Results on the new cocktail and comparison with dielectron spectra will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jiayin', 'last_name': 'Sun', 'fullName': 'Sun, Jiayin', 'id': '314297', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '7c016d5b7a53c9928cd92c3854dab029', 'db_id': 314297, 'person_id': 343131}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Can baryon stopping explain the breakdown of constituent quark scaling and proposed signals of chiral magnetic waves at RHIC?,"Campbell, John",T,Unknown,"Azimuthal emission spectra of various hadron species in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \approx $ 200 GeV exhibit a curious hierarchy at intermediate $p_t$ ($\approx 2-3$ GeV). Rather than being ordered by mass, the spectra seem to be ordered by whether the species is a baryon or meson. It is seen that when the elliptic flow $v_2$ and transverse momentum $p_T$ are both scaled by the number of quarks in each hadron, the spectra fall in line with each other [1]. This number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling suggests a system where the relevant degrees of freedom are colored partons as opposed to hadrons: the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Thus, a break down of this scaling as beam energy is reduced could be indicative of the QGP threshold. However, at lower energies, there is also an increase in the number of entrance-channel partons transported to mid-rapidity due to baryon stopping, which can also violate NCQ scaling, even above the QGP threshold [2]. We describe a specific pattern for the break down of the scaling that includes the observed difference in elliptic flow for positive and negative pions. \\
We also contrast baryon stopping with the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [3]--an alternative model for $\pi_{+} / \pi_{-}$ flow difference--and discuss results from tests that can distinguish between them.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Using CMBR tools to study flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Saumia, P S",Institute of Physics,Unknown,"We study the interesting similarities between the physics of cosmic microwave background radiation
anisotropies and the flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. Further we
explore how the techniques in CMBR analysis could be utilized in studying the flow anisotropies in
RHICE. 

 We argue that the initial state fluctuations of the matter formed  in heavy ion collisions have
similar properties as the fluctuations in the early universe generated by the inflaton field, and by 
studying the flow coeffecients ( a plot of v_n vs. n) we can obtain valuable information about  the 
nature and evolution of these fluctuations. We also study the effect of magnetic field on flow. 
In the presence of magnetic field plasma develops three acoustic modes. It is known in literature that
this distorts the CMB acoustic peaks. We show that flow coefficients in relativistic heavy ion collisions 
can be significantly affected by these effects where a a strong magnetic field is known to be 
present in the initial stages (of non-central collisions) and is expected to survive due to strong 
induced fields in the conducting plasma. This raises the possibility whether a larger value of $\eta/s$ 
can be accommodated by RHIC data. We also show that flow anisotropies in relativistic heavy-ion collisions
 can be analyzed using a certain technique of shape analysis of excursion sets recently proposed by us for 
CMBR fluctuations to investigate anisotropic expansion history of the universe. The technique analyzes shapes 
(sizes) of patches above (below) certain threshold value for transverse energy/particle number fluctuations 
(the excursion sets) as a function of the azimuthal angle and rapidity. This provides an alternative way to 
identify the event plane in an event.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'P S', 'last_name': 'Saumia', 'fullName': 'Saumia, P S', 'id': '314310', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics', 'emailHash': '5545044fa3b84b05d3d29aa614ec89a1', 'db_id': 314310, 'person_id': 343144}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Baryon number probability distribution in the presence of the chiral phase transition,"Morita, Kenji",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We discuss the influence of the chiral phase transition on the properties
of the probability distribution of conserved charges based on effective chiral
models and on the Landau theory of phase transition [1].

Statistical fluctuations of the net baryon number have been regarded as a
diagnostic tool of the chiral phase transition in QCD and in heavy ion collisions.
Normally, they are discussed by calculating cumulants of the net baryon
number in the grand canonical ensemble. Lattice QCD and effective model calculations
have revealed their critical behaviors in the vicinity of the chiral phase
transition.

The purpose of this work is to characterize the critical behavior in terms
of the baryon number probability distribution which is a measurable observable 
in heavy ion collisions.

We show the influence of the chiral crossover transition on the net baryon
number probability distribution within the Polyakov loop extended quark-meson model, 
in a non-perturbative approach, based on the functional renormalization group method [1].

We construct an analytically solvable model which respects relevant
symmetries, based on the Landau theory, and discuss properties of the
baryon number probability distribution in the presence of the phase transition.
We emphasize the relationship of the probability distribution to the analytic
structure of the grand canonical partition function in a complex chemical
potential [2-4].
We show, through both numerical and analytic considerations,
that the singular structure, which gives the divergent cumulants,
leads to an interesting anomalous oscillatory behavior in the probability
distribution.

Our theoretical studies are relevant in heavy ion phenomenology to
possibly identify the QCD phase transition and its order
by measuring probability distributions of conserved charges.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Heavy quark energy loss in p+p collisions at the LHC,"Vogel, Sascha",Frankfurt Institute for Advances Studies,Unknown,"One of the most promising probes to study deconfined matter created in high energy nuclear collisions is the energy loss of (heavy) quarks. It has been shown in experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider that even charm and bottom quarks, despite their high mass, experience a remarkable medium suppression in the Quark Gluon Plasma.  

In this investigation we study the energy loss for heavy quarks in high multiplicity proton proton collisions at LHC energies. Although the colliding systems are smaller than compared to those at RHIC (p+p vs. Au+Au) the higher energy might lead to multiplicities comparable to Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC and thus might lead to a deconfined phase. This gives rise to a non-negligible suppression of heavy quark yields in elementary collisions. We study the dependence of this phenomenon on various quantities, such as the deconfinement energy density and the multiplicity reached in proton proton collisions and discuss this measurement as a probe to pin down parameters of the deconfinement phase transition.

Theoretically however there exist various ambiguities, which still need to be resolved. In this work we investigate the dependence on the medium description of heavy quark energy loss. We find that by only changing the theoretical medium description and keeping the energy loss mechanisms intact one can expect huge discrepancies (up to a factor of 2!) in the very same theoretical approach. The medium descriptions we compare are widely used in the field of heavy ion physics, ranging from elliptic fireball models to hydrodynamics.

Thus, by pinning down the energy loss mechanism with other existing approaches and measurements one can use this effect in order to differentiate between various medium descriptions and limit the parameter range of QGP modeling.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sascha', 'last_name': 'Vogel', 'fullName': 'Vogel, Sascha', 'id': '314327', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': '085c843bc9cea525f08295fb89fb0e8f', 'db_id': 314327, 'person_id': 343157}"

To extract the information, the imaginary chemical potential is taken into account.
At $\theta = \pi/2$ where $\theta$ is the imaginary chemical potential divided by the temperature, there is the exact nontrivial center symmetry which is the $Z_2$ symmetry and this symmetry can be spontaneously broken.
This behavior is quite different form the three-color QCD because the nontrivial center symmetry is always broken by the quark degree of freedom
in the three-color QCD.
This means that we can investigate the nontrivial correlation between the chiral and deconfinement transitions in the two-color system clearly than that in the three-color system.
Such nontrivial correlation is very important to construct the effective model of QCD and thus we can expect that several important model constraints are obtained from the two-color QCD analysis.
In this study, we mainly pay attention to the behavior of the Roberge-Weiss (RW) endpoint which appears at $\theta=\pi/2$ in the tho-color system.
We show that the RW endpoint is second-order if the nontrivial correlation is weak, but it turn into first-order when the nontrivial correlation is sufficiently strong.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kouji', 'last_name': 'Kashiwa', 'fullName': 'Kashiwa, Kouji', 'id': '314348', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN BNL Research Center', 'emailHash': '027a68c06677b38a9d9c2fd19016509e', 'db_id': 314348, 'person_id': 343180}"

The anisotropy is typically characterized by $v_2$, the second harmonic coefficient of the Fourier series expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution with respect to the reaction plane. The observed $v_2$ is believed to be sensitive to different particle production mechanisms. At low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm t}$) $v_2$ encodes the information of the expansion driven by the initial pressure gradients. At high $p_{\rm t}$ it may be caused by path-length dependent parton energy loss. At intermediate $p_{\rm t}$ it may be related to the mechanism of quark coalescence.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The importance of e+A collisions at an Electron-Ion Collider,"Lamont, Matthew",BNL,USA,"Over the last decade, there has been a plethora of new and exciting results in heavy-ion collisions emanating from the CERN and Brookhaven Laboratories.  These results have led to a sea change of the view on how the evolution of a high energy heavy-ion collision proceeds.  What has become apparent is that in order to validate claims of perfect fluidity, for example, the initial conditions at small-x need to be well understood.  Whilst d+A and p+A collisions provide a handle on some of these effects, for precision measurements and precise knowledge of the kinematics, e+A collisions become essential.

A proposal has been developed at Brookhaven National Lab to add an electron accelerator to the current RHIC complex, providing for electron beams ranging from 5 GeV to 30 GeV. Complementing the programme on polarised e+p scattering, a broad programme on e+A physics is envisioned which will range from investigating saturation physics at low-x to hadronization at high-x.  In this poster, I will show the recent progress made on the golden measurements which were identified in the proceedings of the Fall programme at the INT [1].

In the talk, I show that hadron distributions inside jets (fragmentation functions) created in s^1/2 = 7 TeV (LHC) proton-proton [1] and also in high-energy electron-positron [2] collisions can be described by a statistical jet-fragmentation model. This model combines microcanonical statistics and super-statistics induced by multiplicity fluctuations.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Thermal Photon emission with partial chemical equilibrium equation of state,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectra and their anisotropy are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1]. Previous computations of photon emission spectra have been mostly carried out in a fully thermalized medium evolving dynamically under the influence of an equation of state with a first order phase transition. Today, a realistic state-of-the-art equation of state based on lattice QCD results and partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) in the hadronic phase is available for relativistic hydrodynamic simulations [2]. The non-zero chemical potentials will enhance thermal photon production rates in the hadronic phase by their corresponding non-equilibrium fugacity factor ~ e^{mu/T}. However, the breaking of chemical equilibrium below the quark hadron phase transition also changes the relation between temperature and energy density, which results in faster cooling evolution during the hadronic phase. This reduces the space-time volume for photon emission from the hadronic phase. In this work, we study PCE effects on the yields and the azimuthal anisotropies of produced thermal photons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, using a realistically evolving hydrodynamic medium. We study in detail the interplay between the chemical potential enhancement in the thermal photon emission rates and faster cooling evolution of the medium. We compare our calculations with data from RHIC, and make  predictions for measurements at the LHC.

Parallel 1A: Global & Collective Dynamics (Chair U. Heinz),parallel,Collision Energy Dependence of Viscous Hydrodynamic Flow in  Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"We present a systematic study on the evolution of hadron spectra and their azimuthal anisotropy from the lowest collision energy studied at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), √s = 7.7A GeV, to the highest energy reachable at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), √s = 5500A GeV [1]. As the collision energy increases, the resulting increases of the initial temperature, and fireball lifetime, as well as the evolution of the centrality dependence of final charged particle multiplicity are quantitatively studied and compared between the two most popular initial state models, the Monte Carlo Glauber and Monte-Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models. For Glauber model initial conditions with a small specific shear viscosity eta/s = 0.08, the differential charged hadron elliptic flow v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) is found to exhibit a very broad maximum as a function of √s around top RHIC energy, rendering it  almost independent of collision energy for 39 < √s < 2760A GeV. Compared to ideal fluid dynamical simulations [2], this ""saturation"" of elliptic flow is shifted to higher collision energies by shear viscous effects. For color-glass motivated MC-KLN initial conditions, which require a larger shear viscosity eta/s = 0.2 to reproduce the measured elliptic flow, a similar ""saturation"" is not observed up to LHC energies, except for very low pT. We emphasize that this ""saturation"" of the elliptic flow is not associated with the QCD phase transition, but arises from the interplay between radial and elliptic flow which shifts with √s depending on the fluid's viscosity and leads to a subtle cancellation between increasing contributions from light and decreasing contributions from heavy particles to v_2 in the √s range where v_2^{ch}(pT, √s) at fixed pT is maximal. By generalizing the definition of spatial eccentricity ecc_x to isothermal hyper-surfaces, we calculate ecc_x on the kinetic freeze-out surface at different collision energies. Up to top RHIC energy, √s=200A GeV, the fireball is still out-of-plane deformed at freeze out, while at LHC energy the final spatial eccentricity is predicted to approach zero.

This mechanism acquires some (up to ~ 40%) current quark mass “from” the charge.  To construct an approximate metric, we model a bare quark as a spherically symmetric static perfect fluid with charge, using a recent exact Maxwell-Einstein metric for the interior, out to a radius r at which the boundary condition is to match to the Reissner-Nordström metric (for spacetime external to a charged mass).  At r, the model produces internal pressure, which should be matched to external pressure.  For reported values of quark charges q and bare masses mq, this construction produces sub-fm radii.

To model the real-time non-perturbative effects in the propagation of a high energy jet through the strongly coupled QCD matter, we adopt an effective dimensionally reduced description in terms of the  $(1+1)$ quasi-Abelian Schwinger theory. This theory is exactly soluble at any value of the coupling and shares with QCD the properties of dynamical generation of ``mesons"" with a finite mass and the screening of ``quark"" charge  that are crucial for describing the transition of the jet into hadrons. We find that this approach describes quite well the vacuum jet fragmentation in $e^+e^-$ annihilation 
at $z\geq0.2$ at jet energies in the range of the LHC heavy ion measurements ($z$ is the ratio of hadron and jet momenta). In QCD medium, we find that the JFS is reproduced if the mean free path $\lambda$ of the jet is short, $\lambda \leq 0.3$ fm, which is in accord with the small shear viscosity inferred from the measurements of the collective flow. The JFS holds since at short mean free path the quantum interference (analogous to the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED) causes the produced mesons to have low momenta $p \sim m$, where $m \simeq 0.6$ GeV is the typical meson mass.

Baryons, having a much larger mass, allow to significantly extend the range of measured m_T. The results from baryon femtoscopy would put a strong constraint on such predictions. Non-identical baryon pairs are also sensitive to emission
asymmetries.

Femtoscopic correlations between baryons arise mostly due to the strong interaction, which is not precisely known for some baryon pair types. The most notable example is the lambda-lambda interaction which has an unknown contribution due to the potential existence of the H0 dibaryon. Equally interesting are baryon-antibaryon potentials, which have significant contributions from annihilation channels. These processes may have an impact on single-particle spectra, and should be investigated as one of the possible sources of the small proton yield at the LHC.

We show the two-particle correlation functions for several pair types (both baryon-baryon and baryon-antibaryon) composed of protons and lambdas. Femtoscopic analysis is carried out for proton  pairs, taking into account residual correlations and annihilation
channel for the proton-antiproton system. Correlations with lambdas are also analyzed, both with femtoscopic methods as well as to study the unknown interaction potentials.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jai', 'last_name': 'Salzwedel', 'fullName': 'Salzwedel, Jai', 'id': '314473', 'affiliation': 'Ohio State University (US)', 'emailHash': 'd06a28555f227f7d1daec9058a877190', 'db_id': 314473, 'person_id': 343263}"

This is easily understood in the CGC framework: the produced partons are initially back-to-back in the transverse plane, but the interaction with the nucleus causes a momentum transfer of the order of the saturation scale. In forward dihadron production the small-x structure of the nucleus is probed, implying a large saturation scale.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Relativistic Fluctuating Hydrodynamics and its Application to Heavy Ion Collisions,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks
and gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are
performed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries was that elliptic flow v_2
was comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,
that a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was
established. Recently, the higher harmonics v_n (n > 2) are
systematically observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of theoretical
and experimental interests. Initial state fluctuations turned out to be
important to explain these higher harmonics.

In addition to initial state fluctuations, thermal fluctuation during
the space-time evolution of the QGP also plays an important role in
event-by-event simulations. We first formulate the relativistic
fluctuating hydrodynamics in the context of the second order causal
theory. Finite relaxation time for dissipative current is required to
make hydrodynamic equation consistent with causality. Instead of
introducing the relaxation term itself, one can define a kernel function
(or a retarded Green function) such that constitutive equation becomes
convolution of the kernel function including relaxation as well as
dissipation and the corresponding thermodynamic force. One can also
introduce a noise field as thermal fluctuation of the dissipative
current like in the Langevin equation. Thus the constitutive equation
becomes no longer a deterministic equation, but a stochastic equation.
The power spectrum of the noise fields is intimately related to the
kernel function via the fluctuation-dissipation relation and,
consequently, noise becomes colored noise rather than white one due to
the finite relaxation time. We then implement the colored noise together
with viscous kernels in numerical simulations of relativistic
hydrodynamics and perform simulations on an event-by-event basis to see
effects of thermal fluctuation on the dynamics of heavy ion collisions.
This framework is beyond the conventional second order dissipative
hydrodynamics and, thus, will become important in the upcoming era of
the precision QGP physics by means of high-energy heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Koichi', 'last_name': 'Murase', 'fullName': 'Murase, Koichi', 'id': '314516', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '819c6d195f763e7be9eb6cba1672536e', 'db_id': 314516, 'person_id': 343300}"
Parallel 4D: Pre-Equilibrium & Initial State (Chair T. Ludlam),parallel,Imprinting quantum fluctuations on hydrodynamic initial conditions,"Moreland, J. Scott",Duke University,USA,"The precise value of the QGP kinematic shear viscosity eta/s is a question of intense topical interest. Viscous hydrodynamic simulations are a tool for extracting this information from experiment. The key observables are the anisotropic flow coefficients v_n which (i) can be measured very precisely and (ii) are very sensitive to eta/s which controls the ""conversion efficiency"" v_n/ecc_n for turning initial fireball eccentricities of harmonic order n into final flows of the same harmonic order. 

Both ecc_n and v_n fluctuate strongly from collision to collision. These event-by-event fluctuations have a key influence on the measurements [1] and must be properly taken into account when extracting eta/s. Until recently, most initial-state models accounted only for the shape and density fluctuations arising from the fluctuating positions of the nucleons in the colliding nuclei. This leads to fluctuations in the location of the newly produced matter, and thus of the initial energy density profile of the expanding fireball and its eccentricities ecc_n, but does not account for additional quantum fluctuations in the quark and gluon fields inside the nucleons that lead to fluctuating numbers of secondary particles per nucleon-nucleon interaction. Several recent papers have addressed the implementation of these quantum fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial conditions for the expanding collision fireball. 

Starting from the Monte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) model for generating fluctuating initial profiles for the gluon saturation momentum Q_sat(x_T) in the transverse plane, we have developed a Monte Carlo algorithm that uses a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) generator [2] to generate a distribution of gluonic energy densities centered at the value corresponding to the field Q_sat(x_T), but fluctuating around this profile with the two-point covariance function derived in [3] from the Glasma model. To ensure that the energy density is everywhere positive the GRF is mapped to an appropriate negative binomial distribution (NBD) with the same variance. NBD fluctuations have been recently shown to arise naturally from the Glasma model and to describe the measured multiplicity distributions in pp collisions at the LHC. The resulting density profile features ``hot spots"" as in the MC-KLN model overlaid with a fluctuating field texture characterized by an intrinsic length scale 1/Q_sat(x_T).
 
We show that inclusion of these additional gluonic quantum field fluctuations leads to only a small (few percent) increase of the initial eccentricities ecc_n in central collisions and to almost negligible effects at larger impact parameters. These findings disagree with some of the results reported in [4], and we will discuss possible origins for this discrepancy. Our results imply that an earlier extraction of the QGP shear viscosity from a combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow data from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [5] is robust.

The next objective at RHIC is to study properties of this partonic matter in detail in terms of color degrees of freedom and the equation of state. The precise measurement of transverse momentum distributions of quarkonia at different centralities, collision systems, and energies will serve as a thermometer of QGP. A large-area and cost-effective Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) at mid-rapidity for the STAR was proposed. The MTD will be constructed with LMRPC instead of small pad read-out MRPC. With this design the number of electronic channels can be reduced effectively and the hit position along the strip can be obtained by the time differences of two ends of the strips.
 A prototype of Long-strip Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (LMRPC) for STAR-MTD has been developed. This 5-gap prototype has an active area of 52x87 cm2 and the signals are read out from 12 strips, which are 3.8cm wide and 87cm long. The 5-gap STAR-MTD LMRPC module has a efficiency up to 98% and time resolution is in the order of 95 ps. The noise level of such modules is quite low. A special machine was developed to make the colloidal graphite electrodes. Using the time difference of the two PMT signals of each of the two long scintillators, a selection of perpendicular cosmic-ray particles is done to get a better time resolution evaluation. 22 LMRPC modules we have been built all passed QC and they have very good performance.

In 1977 Jaffe[1] predicted a six quark state, $H_{0}$-dibaryon, with hypercharge (Y) = 0 and Strangeness (S) = -2 to be stable against strong decay, but not to weak decay. It has been proposed that the $H_{0}$ would appear as a bump in the $\Lambda-\Lambda$ invariant mass spectra if the $H_{0}$ is a resonance state, or it would lead to a depletion of the $\Lambda-\Lambda$ correlation near the threshold if the $H_{0}$ is weakly bound, which can be used to probe whether there is a stable $H_{0}$ or resonance. Considerable experimental efforts have been devoted to search for $H_{0}$. However there is no conclusive experimental evidence for a bound $H_{0}$. In addition to $H_{0}$, many other dihyperon states have been predicted thoeretically. However, very few measurements are available due to low multiplicity of hyperon production in early nuclear collisions. 

Recently STAR has collected unprecedented high statistics data for Au+Au collision at RHIC, which provides a unique opportunity to look for the exotic particles and hyperon-hyperon correlations. In this talk, we will present the measurement of $\Lambda-\Lambda$ correlations for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39-200 GeV in Au+Au collisions using the STAR experiment at RHIC.

The physics goal with the calorimeter is to understand the dynamics and properties of strongly interacting matter created by relativistic heavy-ion collisions and the initial state of the collisions such as high density color field realized at small Bjorken-x.

The W+Si sampling calorimeter is a highly segmented silicon-tungsten

One consists of three or four longitudinal sampling electromagnetic segments, where one segment is composed of 5-7 layers of tungsten (~3.5mm thickness) and 1cm x 1cm Si-pad readout. Si-pad readout is for the energy measurement. The first segment contains 2-4 longitudinal layers of high resolution Si-micro-pad (1mm x 1mm) or Si-pixel (100um x 100um) detectors for the position measurements and two gamma separation.
The other is composed of full layers of W+Si pixel with extreme fine granularity. For the Si pixel, MIMOSA chip, which has been developed as one of the Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS), is utilized for the calorimeter purpose.

The compact stars consist of not only nuclear matter but also hypeons and quarks, we call such stars ""hybrid stars"". However, the equation of state (EOS) is still not clear and many theoretical studies try to elucidate the EOS in the high density and/or temperature.  The crust region of the stars consist of nucleus and nuclear matter. Therefore the inner region of the stars should have hadron-quark mixed phase. Nowadays it is pointed out that the inner structures would affect macroscopic phenomena of the star[1]. However, the inner structures are strongly depend on EOS of the matter. We show that the hadron-quark mixed phase should be restricted to a narrower region because of the finite-size effects and a quark matter region should appear in the central region[2]. The narrow region of the mixed phase seems to explain physical phenomena of neutron stars such as the strong magnetic field and glitch phenomena, and it would give a new cooling curve for the neutron star.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Model-independent separation of flow and nonflow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Kikola, Daniel",Purdue University,USA,"Anisotropic flow, which arises from correlations to the common collision geometry, is sensitive to the early stage of the expansion of the medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Azimuthal anisotropy is measured by final state particle correlations and is thus contaminated by correlations unrelated to the common geometry (nonflow).  The contamination of nonflow hampers further advancement in our study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, in at least two areas: it prevents a more precise determination of the viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s of the QGP medium from flow measurements, and it limits the power of jet-like correlations in probing partonic energy loss mechanisms where flow presents a background to be subtracted. Recently it has been shown that the measured two-particle correlation Fourier coefficients approximately factorize, and it was argued that this indicates the dominance of flow. In this talk we show by PYTHA simulations of p+p collisions that factorization approximately holds also for jet-like correlations and therefore is only a necessary but not sufficient condition for flow [1]. We suggest that nonflow factorization can in turn be used to disentangle flow and nonflow as a function of particle transverse momentum by performing a two-component factorization fit to Fourier coefficients [1]. However, such disentanglement is model dependent, so are all other experimental nonflow studies thus far. To revamp this, we present in this talk a novel, model-independent method to decompose \Delta\eta-dependent and independent correlations using two- and four-partice cumulants between \eta bins, exploiting the symmetry of flow about midrapidity in symmetric heavy-ion collisions [2]. The \Delta\eta-independent correlations are dominated by anisotropic flow while the \Delta\eta-dependent correlations can be identified as nonflow. We illustrate our method using the AMPT and HIJING event generators. We discuss our decomposed flow and nonflow from the models. We further discuss the applicability of our method in separating flow and nonflow in real data at RHIC and LHC.

Parallel 3C: Electro-Weak Probes (Chair J. Kapusta),parallel,Dielectron measurements by PHENIX using the HBD,"Atomssa, Ermias",Stony Brook University,USA,"Measurements of lepton pair spectra are a crucial tool to map out the evolution of the hot dense matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. At low pair mass, direct photons and low mass vector mesons are the main center of interest. Interpretation of lepton pair production rates in excess of expectations from hadronic decays observed by PHENIX and how the data constrains theoretical models on thermalization and chiral symmetry restoration is a hotly debated topic. At intermediate and high mass, the di-electron spectrum has been used by PHENIX to measure cross sections of open charm and open bottom, as well as Quarkonium suppression with implications for color screening and recombination.

Due to the small signal to background ratio, measurement of the dielectron spectrum, especially at low mass, is very challenging. In PHENIX, the background results mainly from random combinations of electron positron pairs from uncorrelated sources, mostly $\pi^0$ Dalitz decays and photon conversions. The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was developed to address this issue. The HBD accomplishes this by tagging and rejecting tracks from conversions and $\pi^0$ Dalitz decays. It was successfully operated in RHIC run years 2009 to 2010, where Au+Au and reference p+p data sets were taken.

A distinctive feature of the pre-equilibrium system (the Glasma) is the high over-population of phase space for gluons, which we argue plays a central role for the thermalization of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. In particular, the over-population (1) coherently amplifies scattering by $1/\alpha_s$ and makes the system behave as a strongly interacting fluid despite being out of equilibrium at weak coupling, (2) may lead to the dynamical, albeit transient formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate over the course of thermalization. A further distinctive feature of our scenario is that the initially single scale ($Q_s$) of Glasma develops into a hierarchy of scales, with the IR scale and the UV separated by coupling $\alpha_s$, precisely as in equilibrium thermal field theory. We demonstrate these features by solving the Boltzmann equation in the small angle approximation and in the regime where the occupation numbers are large.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Initial conditions for fluid dynamics from a parton cascade model,"Bouras, Ioannis",University of Frankfurt a.M.,Unknown,"The initial conditions play a fundamental role in the fluid-dynamical modeling of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Many observables that are important in determining the properties of the QGP, such 
as elliptic flow (v2) and triangular flow (v3), appear to be generated mainly from the initial geometry of the energy density profile. Since the initial conditions remain undetermined, it introduces a large uncertainty in the extraction of the 
properties of the QGP. 

Typically it is assumed that the matter thermalizes and fluid dynamics can be applied after time of the order of $1$ fm/c after the initial nuclear collision. However, the matter itself can be created much earlier, and it undergoes pre-equilibrium evolution 
before fluid dynamics can be applied. In this work, we estimate the impact of the pre-equilibrium evolution of the QGP on the initial conditions for fluid dynamics using a parton cascade model. 

For the initial conditions for the pre-equilibrium evolution we use a realistic 6--dimensional parametrization of the initial single-particle distribution function $f(x, p)$ that reflect, e.g. the observed rapidity and multiplicity distributions at RHIC and LHC.
Then, we solve the time evolution of this distribution using the relativistic Boltzmann equation, up to times of the order of 1 fm/c, for various values of partonic cross sections. The relativistic Boltzmann equation is solved using the 
BAMPS algorithm Ref. [1].

The main advantage of our approach is that we are able to compute, not only the energy density distribution at $t=1$ fm, but also the velocity and shear-stress tensor profiles, which, so far, are mostly unknown.

Parallel 4D: Pre-Equilibrium & Initial State (Chair T. Ludlam),parallel,Forward azimuthal correlations in 200 GeV p+p and d+Au collisions at STAR,"Li, Xuan",Shandong University,Unknown,"The proton gluon distribution function increases rapidly with decreasing x at fixed $Q^{2}$, but cannot increase indefinitely as x goes to 0. Gluon saturation is expected at a low x value when gluon recombination balances gluon splitting. The nuclear (with atomic mass number A) gluon distribution is approximately $A^{1/3}$ larger than the nucleon gluon distribution function at the same x [1]. STAR is sensitive to x between 0.001 and 0.02 for the nuclear gluon distribution via di-jet measurements with calorimeter subsystems covering -1 < eta < 4. The STAR collaboration has measured forward $\pi{0}$-$\pi{0}$ correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200GeV$. The suppression of the away-side peak observed in forward-forward correlations in central d+Au collisions is consistent with the CGC expectation [2,3]. Such suppression does not appear in the forward+mid-rapidity correlations. 

The Endcap Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EEMC) at STAR covers pseudo-rapidity between 1.08 and 2, providing the opportunity to probe gluons at intermediate x via forward+near-forward correlations. Azimuthal correlations between $\pi{0}$ in the Forward Meson Spectrometer (FMS) and jet-like clusters in the EEMC are sensitive to the nuclear gluon distribution in 0.003<x<0.02 region. Together with the forward+forward correlations and forward+mid-rapidity correlations, we will be able to determine the sharpness of the transition along x from a dilute parton gas to the expected CGC state at low $Q^{2}$. In this talk, we will focus on FMS-$\pi^{0}$ + EEMC-jet-like-cluster azimuthal correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions. The impact from underlying-event contributions to the jet-like clusters and effective p+Au results, via a deuteron-beam-facing neutron tag, will be discussed as well.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Turbulent instability in low viscosity quark-gluon plasma,"Csernai, Laszlo Pal",University of Bergen\ Ferdowsi U. of Mashhad,Unknown,"Flow asymmetries are in focus of present heavy ion studies. In head-on collisions there would be no reason to have an azimuthal or longitudinal asymmetry, nevertheless, new observations for the higher harmonics show [1] that even in central collisions there is a strong azimuthal asymmetry in the emitted hadrons, and this asymmetry arises from transverse fluctuations of the initial state. This poses a challenge to separate the flow characteristics arising from collective global asymmetries and from random fluctuations. Here we study flow asymmetries arising from global asymmetries in peripheral collisions.

The dynamical development of collective flow of prefect QGP fluid is studied in a (3+1)D fluid dynamical model for peripheral heavy-ion collisions, with globally symmetric, initial conditions, which take into account the shear flow caused by the forward motion of the matter on the projectile side and the backward motion on the target side.  While at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76A$\,TeV semi-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions the earlier predicted rotation effect [2] is visible in the calculations, at more peripheral collisions, with high resolution and low numerical viscosity the initial development of a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) is observed [3], which alters the flow pattern considerably. On the initial dividing plane a wave develops, and the dividing plane develops into a turning nonlinear wave. The wave develops only in peripheral reactions with very low numerical viscosity. The KHI wave is visible in the reaction plane if we mark the motion of the fluid which was initially on the dividing plane. The direction of the wave is such that it enhances the rotation effect and increases the asymmetry of the global collective $v_1(y)$. The possibility of turbulence in the transverse plane developing from initial fluctuations was also pointed out recently [4].

Although, the predicted rotation effect is not easily detectable due to longitudinal initial state fluctuations, the KHI enhances the flow asymmetry and changes its pattern in peripheral collisions.  The present developments suggest that the global collective $v_1$ flow can be disentangled from random fluctuations. This is necessary to measure the global collective flow in peripheral collisions.

The KHI is very sensitive to the magnitude of the viscosity.  Thus if this research is successful the analysis of global collective $v_1$ flow as a function of beam energy and impact parameter may provide a precision measurement of viscosity and its variation.

Poster Session Reception,poster,QGP shear viscosity from combined analysis of elliptic and triangular flow,"Qiu, Zhi",Ohio State University,USA,"The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions is well described by viscous hydrodynamic simulations. A key QGP transport coefficient, its specific shear viscosity eta/s, can be extracted by comparing such simulations with experimental data. Previous extractions gave (eta/s)_QGP ~ (1-2.5)/(4\pi) where the ~100% uncertainty arises mainly from ambiguities in the initial fireball shape and density profile. To obtain (eta/s)_QGP with better precision, the ambiguities in the initial conditions must be addressed.

Published extractions of the specific shear viscosity have relied on elliptic flow measurements and the fact that eta/s suppresses elliptic flow. It was recently realized that higher order harmonic flows are suppressed even more strongly with increasing eta/s, and that the recently measured triangular flow allows to simultaneously constrain eta/s and the initial conditions: viable initial conditions should describe the elliptic and triangular flows v2 and v3 simultaneously with the same eta/s. We have performed such a simultaneous analysis of v2 and v3 [1]. We show that the normalized elliptic and triangular flow coefficients v2/ecc2 and v3/ecc3 (where ecc_n are the n-th order eccentricities of the initial state) can be obtained with 10-15% accuracy using single-shot hydrodynamical simulations where the initial conditions are averaged before hydrodynamical evolution, instead of the more realistic but costly event-by-event hydrodynamical approach where averaging is done only after separate evolution of each fluctuating initial condition.

For elliptic flow we find that, within 10-15%, v2/ecc2 = v2{2}/ecc2{2} = v2{4}/ecc2{4} where the expression on the left is obtained from single-shot hydrodynamics while the cumulant expressions on the right are extracted from event-by-event hydrodynamics. For triangular flow we find, at the same level of precision, that v3/ecc3=v3{2}/ecc3{2} \neq v3{4}/ecc3{4}. The ALICE data for charged hadron elliptic and triangular flow from Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC [2] are shown to obey these approximate (in-)equalities. Our hydrodynamic analysis [1] shows that the ALICE v2 and v3 data [2] can be explained simultaneously, at all collision centralities, if (eta/s)_QGP \approx 1/(4\pi). This requires MC-Glauber initial conditions which have smaller ecc2 than CGC-motivated MC-KLN initial conditions. For MC-KLN initial conditions the v2 data require larger (eta/s)_QGP ~ (2-2.5)/(4\pi) which, however, then underpredicts the measured triangular flow by 35-40%. We conclude that the large v3 measured at the LHC requires either almost minimal QGP shear viscosity (eta/s)_QGP \approx 1/(4\pi), or a presently unknown mechanism for increasing the triangularity fluctuations in the initial state by ~50%.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Role of chaoticity and information entropy in Multiparticle production at collider experiments,"Das, Supriya",Bose Institute,Unknown,"Recent data from LHC has revived the question whether the matter produced in high energy hadronic collisions is thermalized or not. With the published data from ALICE and CMS experiments, we have shown that the multi-particle production in p+p collisions at LHC energies available up to now, follows the scaling of information entropy if one takes the chaotic and coherent sources of particle production into account and the information entropy is extracted from the chaotically produced particles. Based on these scaling properties we have argued that in hadronic collisions at the highest energies projected for LHC, almost all the particles will be produced chaotically. This indicates that a collective behavior will be observed even in the hadron-hadron collisions at that energy.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Lack of modifications in jet-like correlations from d+Au to Au+Au collisions for trigger particle p_T in both jet and hydrodynamic domains measured by STAR,"Pei, Hua",University of Illinois at Chicago,USA,"Angular correlations with respect to a back-to-back trigger pair of high-p_T hadrons with similar momenta (above 4 GeV/c) have shown no differences between d+Au and Au+Au collisions suggesting tangential emission of selected di-jets. In this talk we increase the p_T threshold of the leading hadron in the pair (8, 10 and 12 GeV/c) to vary the degree of the surface bias. The di-jet energy imbalance is assessed via the difference of total momenta in the same- minus away-side peaks, and the measured imbalance is over-predicted by path-length dependent models, while showing possible evidence of softening of jet fragmentation. We find no qualitative change in the same-side peak of 2+1 correlation.

Removing the back-to-back partner maximizing the asymmetry, the 2+1 reduces to the ordinary dihadron correlation, where significant modification is indeed observed on the away-side but the near-side remains similar between the d+Au and Au+Au events, indicating surface bias. We further lower the trigger p_T to as low as 1.5 GeV/c, where hydrodynamic production of particles are thought to dominate and jet-like correlations are expected to diminish. However, we find the identical near-side correlation between d+Au and Au+Au persists. The data cannot be described by the AMPT and HIJING models, and challenge the particle production paradigm in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hua', 'last_name': 'Pei', 'fullName': 'Pei, Hua', 'id': '314650', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Chicago', 'emailHash': 'df7e1e77279a1049b4b89f3075976724', 'db_id': 314650, 'person_id': 343402}"

PHENIX results of $v_{2}$ in Au$+$Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV for heavy-flavor decays are comparable to the $v_{2}$ measurements of other hadrons. This indicates that both the flow and the energy loss characteristics in heavy quarks are similar to light quarks, which is not well understood.

open heavy flavor production across a wide range of temperature,

consistent with FONLL pQCD calculations.  New analysis techniques 
have extended the momentum coverage and provide constraints on the 
bottom cross section.  Measurements in $d+$Au collisions exhibit a 
strong cold nuclear matter Cronin enhancement of electrons from 
$D-$mesons, which is roughly consistent with the mass-ordering 
observed for the lighter $\pi, K,$ and $p$ families.  This also 
shows that the nuclear baseline for interpreting Au+Au data could be 
significantly modified from the $p+p$ shape.  Collisions of Cu 
nuclei provide a crucial intermediary testing ground between the 
small $d$+Au collision system and the large Au+Au system, and show 
how the cold nuclear matter enhancement is overtaken by competing 
hot nuclear matter suppression as the system size increases towards 
the most central Au+Au collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,"Heavy Flavour Electron azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ from 2- and 4-particle correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200, 62 and 39 GeV at STAR","Kikola, Daniel",Purdue University,USA,"Heavy quarks (charm and bottom) are produced early in the collisions and therefore are important probes of the hot and dense matter created in the reactions at RHIC energies. Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy flavour mesons (so called non-photonic electrons, NPE) are the most feasible tool so far for studying heavy quarks in-medium interactions. NPE azimuthal anisotropy, $v_2$, is of particular interest because it provides additional means to discriminate between models which describe heavy quark
in-medium interactions. 

In this presentation we will report the $v_2$ measurements using  2- and 4-particle correlations, $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$, at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200, 62 and 39 GeV at STAR. Non-photonic electrons in this study are identified using three main STAR subsystems: Time Projection Chamber, Time of Flight Detector and Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter. $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$ have different sensitivity to the flow fluctuations and so called nonflow (correlations not related to the reaction plane) - there is a positive contribution of fluctuation and nonflow to the $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ while, in the case of $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$, nonflow is negligible and the effect of fluctuations is negative. Therefore $v_2\lbrace2\rbrace$ and  $v_2\lbrace4\rbrace$ provide an upper and lower limit on the average azimuthal anisotropy of non-photonic electrons. Moreover, bottom/charm production ratio at lower energies is expected to be reduced compared to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV, therefore low $p_T$ NPE azimuthal anisotropy at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 62 and 39 GeV would reflect charm $v_2$ better than at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Kikola', 'fullName': 'Kikola, Daniel', 'id': '314664', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'a8c56649f1f172a78f95103962c986e1', 'db_id': 314664, 'person_id': 343358}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,The Emergent QCD Plasma from RHIC to LHC,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University & RIKEN BNL Research Center,USA,"One of the main discoveries at RHIC is the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), based particularly on the observed ""perfect fluid"" and strong jet quenching. One of the most interesting physics to see at LHC is whether and how such sQGP properties will change. Based on the deep and generic electric-magnetic duality, we've suggested that the QCD plasma contains the quarks and gluons (color-electric D.o.F) as well as the EMERGENT monopoles (color-magnetic D.o.F.) with the latter becoming dominant at strong gauge coupling as in the near-Tc QCD plasma . An important prediction of this ""magnetic scenario"" is a RAPID turn-off of the magnetic dominanace when increasing temperature  beyond the near-Tc regime of 1-1.5Tc, accompanied by rapid decrease (due to non-perturbative running) of QCD coupling in this regime. 

This scenario, therefore, implies the QCD plasma to be less perfect a fluid and more transparent a medium at LHC, despite only modest increase in tempearture. We will discuss such expected change of the emergent QCD plasma from RHIC to LHC energies. Furthermore, we will examine the changes in the two most important medium properties: 1) evidences for a less perfect fluid from our molecular dynamics simulations as well as from other groups' hydrodynamic modelling of flow data at LHC; 2) evidences for a more transparent medium as predicted from our analysis of geometric data for jet quenching and from other groups' modelling for LHC Raa data and extraction of jet quenching parameter at LHC.

The QCD-like theory is useful to understand the mechanism of color confinement. Dynamics of the QCD-like theory is studied by imposing the TBC on the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The Z_{Nc} symmetry is preserved below some temperature Tc, but spontaneously broken above Tc. The color confinement below Tc preserves the flavor symmetry. Above Tc, the flavor symmetry is broken, but the breaking is suppressed by the entanglement between the Polyakov loop and the chiral condensate. Particularly at low temperature, dynamics of the TBC model is similar to that of the PNJL model with the standard fermion boundary condition, indicating that the Z_{Nc} symmetry is a good approximate concept in the latter model even if the current quark mass is small.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Elastic scattering: The undersides of quarkonia propagation and collectivity in the QGP,"Berrehrah, Hamza",Subatech,Unknown,"One of the most advocated probes of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) properties is the $J/\psi$ suppression. However, the comparison between experimental data and theoretical scenarios is still rather inconclusive, as several mechanisms might participate to explain the observed suppression (sequential suppression, dynamical or statistical recombination, formation time,...), not to mention the cold nuclear matter effects. In recent experimental studies at PHENIX and STAR, the $v_2$ of the $J/\Psi$'s has been measured. In conjunction with $R_{AA}$, this observable should improve our understanding of quarkonia production in the QGP and puts higher constrains on models aiming at describing the $J/\psi$ suppression. However, most of them neglect the possible diffusion of $Q\bar{Q}$ correlations (""pre $J/\psi$'s"") in the QGP although it is 
generically an essential ingredient for the understanding of the $v_2$ of all particles.

 Motivated by SPS results of $v_2^{J/\psi}$ and recent RHIC and LHC results suggesting a strong thermalization of charm quarks in the medium, our approach is focused not only on the suppression phenomenon but also on the physical evolution of those correlations, including an original treatment of their diffusion in the QGP due to their Compton scattering with gluons and the implications of such a diffusion on $J/\psi$ energy loss and collectivity, studied in a hydrodynamic transport model. The general tendency of our results indeed shows that elastic processes may have a non-negligible influence on the quarkonia propagation in the QGP.
   
   In our contribution, we will discuss the theoretical framework we have developed to evaluate the elastic cross section of $J/\psi$'s (and more generally $\Q\bar{Q}$ correlations) by combining analytical calculations based on pQCD and results from lQCD. We will then address the quarkonia propagation under the influence of such collisions, treated in a Fokker-Planck approach, and will present results deduced from our transport code MC@SHQ.

We express the contribution from multiple parton scattering and induced radiative energy loss to the DY dilepton spectra in terms of nuclear modified effective beam (anti)quark distribution functions. The modification depends on the quark transport parameter in nuclear medium. This is similar to the final-state multiple parton scattering in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off large nuclei and leads to the suppression of the Drell–Yan cross section in p + A relative to p + p collisions. The modifications to (anti)quark distribution functions from (anti)quark-antiquark double scattering are shown to be determined by the (anti)quark distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark distribution functions inside the beam hardon. We also calculate DY spectra in p + A collisions and find the nuclear suppression due to beam parton energy loss negligible at the Fermilab energy Elab = 800 GeV in the kinematic region as covered by the E866 experiment. Most of the observed nuclear suppression of DY spectra in E866 experiment can be described well by parton shadowing in target nuclei as given by the EPS08 parameterization.

At the LHC, a  good description of the experimental data can be achieved only in mid-central and peripheral Pb+Pb collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Upsilon suppression in PbPb collisions at LHC energies,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"We suggest that the combined effect of screening, gluon-induced dissociation, Landau damping, and reduced feed-down explains most of the suppression of Y states that has been observed by CMS [1] in PbPb relative to pp collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV at the CERN LHC. The suppression is thus a clear, albeit indirect, indication for the presence of a qgp.

In particular, we calculate the suppression of both the Y(1S) ground state in the quark-gluon plasma in minimum-bias PbPb collisions, and of the Y(2S + 3S) states relative to the ground state. In a major extension of our schematic phenomenological approach presented in [2], we now explicitly consider the time dependence with transverse and longitudinal expansion, and the effect of Landau damping [3] on the widths of the states, in addition to gluodissociation.

The effect of Landau damping of the Y(nS) and Chi_b(nP) states is computed from a complex potential, and is found to be of the same order of magnitude as the gluon-induced dissociation [2] for the 1S state at the temperatures that are relevant at LHC.
The gluodissociation is treated explicitly for all five states considered here (1S, 2S, 3S, 1P and 2P), including the influence of the confining string contribution on the dissociation rates.

As compared to pp collisions at the same energy, the feed-down cascade leading to the Y(1S) ground state is drastically modified due to the substantial suppression of the excited states through screening, damping and gluodissociation. The 1S ground state remains very stable with respect to screening, its suppression is essentially due to damping, gluodissociation and reduced feed-down.

Our results are presented for different Y formation times and qgp lifetimes. For reasonable plasma temperatures at Y formation time, we obtain good agreement with the CMS data for the Y(1S) suppression factor, but less suppression than is needed
for the measured [1] ratio Y(2S + 3S)/ Y(1S) - which requires, however, better statistics.
Should the result persist in the 2011 data, it is likely that additional suppression mechanisms are at work.

It is believed that the QGP phase dominates the evolution briefly during the early time of the Universe.  In high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC, the new form of matter, strongly interaction quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), has been formed [1]. The question now is what is the structure of the QCD phase diagram.

In this talk, we will report a systematic study of the freeze-out properties and collectivities as a function of collision energies. These studies were performed with the AMPT and URQMD models. The region where the hadronic interaction dominant in the QCD phase diagram will be identified within the model studies.

Eskola),parallel,Jet probes of cold and hot QCD matter,"Zhang, Ben-Wei",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Parton energy loss in the hot QCD medium will manifest itself not only in leading hadron spectra but also in reconstructed jet productions in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. With its more differential power full jets in heavy-ion collisions can then provide excellent tools to study the properties of the QGP and impose constraints on different parton energy loss models.

With this motivation, we investigate the cold nuclear matter(CNM) effects on jet productions in high-energy nuclear collisions at LHC with the NLO perturbative QCD. The nuclear modifications for dijet angular distributions, dijet invariant mass spectra, dijet transverse momentum spectra and dijet momentum imbalance due to CNM effects are calculated by incorporating EPS, EKS, HKN and DS parametrization sets of parton distributions in nucleus. It is found that dijet angular distributions and dijet momentum imbalance are insensitive to the initial-state CNM effects and thus provide optimal tools to study the final-state hot QGP effects such as jet quenching. 

Furthermore we present the results and predictions at NLO for productions of the single, double and tagged jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by including parton energy loss effect in the QGP and the CNM effects. We demonstrate how an enhanced di-jet transverse momentum imbalance in central Pb+Pb reactions at the LHC, recently measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, can be derived from these results. We show quantitatively that a significant fraction of this enhancement may be related to the ambiguity in the separation between the jet and soft background medium and point to a suite of measurements that can help build a consistent picture of parton shower modification in heavy ion collisions at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ben-Wei', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Ben-Wei', 'id': '314700', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': 'b03594ed6875144bf8bd3c9dc349a77e', 'db_id': 314700, 'person_id': 343432}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Quark-gluon plasma shear viscosity at RHIC and the LHC: results from the hybrid model VISHNU,"Song, Huichao",The Ohio State University,USA,"Viscous hydrodynamic calculations have shown that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) shear viscosity can be extracted from elliptic and triangular flow data [1]. However, strong non-equilibrium effects, both in the chemical composition and the kinetic evolution, during the hadronic stage influence the development and distribution of flow anisotropy and must be correctly accounted for when extracting the QGP viscosity. For an improved description of the hadronic evolution, we developed the hybrid model VISHNU which couples viscous hydrodynamic expansion of a QGP fluid to a microscopic description of hadronic rescattering and chemical and thermal freeze-out using the UrQMD cascade [2]. In this talk, we will summarize a number of key results obtained with VISHNU:

a) We present a robust method for extracting the QGP viscosity from the collision centrality dependence of the eccentricity-scaled charged hadron elliptic flow [3].

b) We extract the  QGP shear viscosity at RHIC energies from elliptic flow data, giving quantitative estimates for and initial pre-equilibrium flow and from model ambiguities of the initial fireball eccentricity. We discuss the prospects for reducing the main uncertainties from initial conditions through a combined analysis of elliptic, triangular and higher-order harmonic flow coefficients using event-by-event VISHNU simulations.

c) We show that, with the QGP viscosity extracted in [3], VISHNU yields an excellent description of all soft-hadron data from Au+Au collisions at top RHIC energy [4].

d) Extrapolating to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and comparing with recent experimental results from the ALICE Collaboration, we show that the LHC data are again well described by VISHNU, with
approximately the same constant QGP viscosity as at RHIC energies [5], including the proton elliptic flow in the most central collisions which cannot be correctly reproduced in a purely hydrodynamic approach [6].

e) Using an improved implementation of baryon-antibaryon annihilation in UrQMD, VISHNU is shown to resolve the ``proton puzzle"" at the LHC [7].

This surprising result has challenged the view of gluon radiation dominating over elastic 2-to-2 processes as a cause of parton energy loss in a quark-gluon plasma. To study the effectiveness of elastic collisions as the suppression mechanism in detail, we have developed a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation describing the non-eikonal propagation of high-energy gluons and light quarks interacting with the quarks and gluons from the expanding QCD medium. The partonic collision rates are computed in leading-order perturbative QCD, while four different scenarios are used to model the QCD medium: 1) a simple static model for case studies of energy loss probability distributions; 2) (1+1)-dimensional hydro with initial conditions from the EKRT model for modeling the central heavy ion collisions; 3) (2+1)-dimensional hydro with a smooth sWN profile obtained from the optical Glauber model for non-central collisions; and 4) event-by-event hydro with an eBC profile from the Monte Carlo Glauber model for a detailed study of the initial state density fluctuation effects.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Event-by-event distribution of azimuthal asymmetries in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Niemi, Harri","University of Jyväskylä, Department of Physics",Unknown,"Nowadays, relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is a common tool to
describe the space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) 
created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The validity of the fluid-dynamical approach is experimentally confirmed by the fact that
initial-state anisotropies are directly converted into nonvanishing
(event-averaged) Fourier coefficients $\langle v_n \rangle$ of the 
decomposition of the single-inclusive momentum distribution of hadrons
with respect to the azimuthal angle. From the magnitude of the $\langle v_n \rangle$ one can obtain information about the size of dissipative corrections and thus infer the value of the viscous coefficients of the QGP.

It has been realized that, for a proper comparison to experimental data
and a reliable extraction of viscosity, fluid-dynamical calculations have to be performed on an event-by-event basis. Therefore, fluid dynamics should not only be able to predict the correct event-averaged $\langle v_n\rangle$, but also their distributions. In this paper, we investigate the event-by-event distribution of the initial-state eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$, and show how they correlate with the event-by-event distribution of the Fourier coefficients $v_n$. In order to generate the initial state, we use the Monte-Carlo Glauber model of Ref.\ [1]. For the fluid-dynamical evolution, we use the model of Refs.\ [2]. The final hadron spectra are calculated with the Cooper-Frye freeze-out procedure.

We demonstrate that the event-by-event distributions of the $v_n$,
and not only their average values, are promising observables to 
gain information about the initial state of the fluid-dynamical evolution and the transport properties of the hot and dense, strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The universality of eta/s,"Sinha, Bikash","Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata, India",Unknown,"ALICE, ATLAS and CMS detectors at LHC and previously PHENIX and STAR detectors at RHIC have provided
compelling evidence for higher order flow components apart from the elliptic flow v2. It is by now well established that
both RHIC and LHC have produced a ”perfect fluid” of Quark Gluon Plasma with eta/s close to zero, as predicted by
AdS/CFT limit. One expects that higher order harmonics and in particular triangular flow v3 will constrain eta/s more
precisely. Although, the particle density per participant pair at 2.76 TEV (LHC) is a factor of 2.15 higher than at
RHIC, eta/s remain almost the same going from RHIC to LHC. It is known that [1] eta/s / 1/g4 and 1/g2  [ln(T/T )]2,
thus /s becomes and increasing function of the temperature. However, a simple [2] estimate indicates, that the initial
temperature for eta/s 0.08 changes from 360 MeV for RHIC to 530 MeV for LHC. Given the logarithmic dependence
of /s on the temperature, it is almost natural that /s at LHC (2.76 TeV) does not changes perceptibly going from
RHIC to LHC [3]. Our prediction is that even for the highest energy of LHC, eta/s will not change perceptably.
The second great puzzle is the universality of /s  1/4, applicable across a large number of phenomena, dra-
matically different from each other. Ultracold quantum degenerate strongly interacting atomic Fermi gas, Graphene,
even Giant resonances in finite nuclei exhibit the same behavior of /s  1/4. It is remarkable that both the coldest
and hottest matter on earth are rather similar. This universaility is a direct consequence of strong coupling due to
many body interaction leading to observable correlation. This observation will be presented.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Is the event plane dependent modification to jet-like correlations due to analysis biases or jet-medium interactions?,"Konzer, Joshua",Unknown,Unknown,"The STAR results [1] from dihadron correlations as a function of the high-pt trigger azimuth relative to the event plane (phi_s) show a significant change from in-plane (phi_s~0) to out-of-plane direction (phi_s~90 degree). The near-side correlation is composed of two components: the jet-like correlation and the ridge; The former is found to be invariant over phi_s while the ridge is primarily observed in-plane. On the other hand, the away-side ""double hump"" is present only out-of-plane. It has been found that the recently characterized triangular flow does not change the qualitative conclusions [1]. However, the question remains, whether the observed phi_s dependent modification is due to analysis biases in flow background subtraction or jet-medium interactions.

In this talk we analyze high-pt triggered dihadron correlations relative to the event plane in the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) parton cascade model. The AMPT model, with its string melting, has been previously shown to reproduce some of the global phenomena seen in heavy-ion collisions, specifically flow [2]. We first obtain the near-side jet-like correlations from the difference of large and small delta-eta azimuthal correlations and find AMPT does not reproduce the STAR data. We then analyze the large delta-eta azimuthal correlation by subtraction of v2, v3, and v4 harmonic flows. The vn harmonic flows are obtained from two- and four-particle cumulant method and compared to the true average<vn>   calculated using the initial geometry harmonic planes in AMPT. We assess the non-flow contributions in vn by the newly developed decomposition method [3], and address possible biases in our AMPT correlation analysis. We discuss their implications to the STAR data by comparing the vn subtracted event plane dependent dihadron correlations in AMPT to the STAR results. We discuss the remaining effects of jet-medium interactions in AMPT.

PHENIX, as an infrastructure of technologically different systems, has been recording data since 2000. Research results by the PHENIX experiment have already made an impact on the broad field of 
experimental nuclear physics. Being in its second decade of research, PHENIX intends to expand its physics program; thus consideration of possible upgrades has recently started. Calorimetry detectors are expected to be part of the upgraded PHENIX in forward and central regions. We consider a sampling detector that uses plastic scintillator tiles for future PHENIX hadronic calorimeters. The R&D program has commenced and, as its first phase, a reconfigurable sampling scintillator prototype calorimeter is being fabricated. With its lateral active detection area of 35 cm x 35 cm, the calorimeter will be capable of taking data with electron and hadron beams. The fabricated prototype calorimeter will allow comprehensive test beam studies to research and optimize design and technical performance parameters of the possible future hadronic calorimeter.

do not interact strongly, and thus are used to make a tomographic view of those collisions.

The ratio of their yield in Pb-Pb to pp collisions is sensitive to initial state effects. 
Furthermore, direct photons can be used tag the away-side parton in photon-jet or photon-hadron

is an important experimental tool to suppress the contamination from decay photon, but also 
from fragmentation and Bremstrahlung photons.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Suppression of D-mesons production at relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Begum, Umme Jamil","Debraj Roy College, Golaghat, Assam, India",Unknown,"Charm quarks/antiquarks produced in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions, would traverse the quark gluon plasma, colliding with quarks and gluons and radiating gluons before appearing as D-mesons. Thus the final spectra of D-mesons would contain information of the medium modification suffered by the charm quarks/antiquarks. We have made a detailed study for the nuclear modification factor of production of D-mesons from the initial fusion of partons in a nuclear collision at RHIC and LHC energies. 
As a first step, we made a comparative study of some of the energy loss formalisms of charm quarks/antiquarks available in the literature with the same initial conditions [1]. 
We consider both the radiative and collision energy loss along with longitudinal expansion of the plasma for the prediction of nuclear modification factor. As at RHIC and LHC energies, parton densities reach very high values leading to effective nuclear shadowing, we use the modified structure functions due to shadowing effect given by EKS98 group, in 1998 [2]. Peterson fragmentation function [3] is used for fragmentation of Charm quarks/antiquarks into D-mesons.
 We have seen that our result can satisfactorily explain the ALICE experimental data for nuclear modification of D-mesons at Pb+Pb collision @ 2.76 ATeV. The result with a recent radiative energy loss calculation [4] has an increasing trend at high transverse momentum and explains the nuclear modification for transverse momentum up to 15 GeV very well. The inclusion of collisional energy loss of charm quarks/antiquarks further suppresses the muclear modification factor of D-mesons.

Parallel 5D: New Theoretical Developments (Chair B. Sinha),parallel,Shining a Gluon Beam through Quark-Gluon Plasma,"Rajagopal, Krishna",MIT,USA,"A holographic calculation of the quenching of a beam of gluons with typical momenta q shining through strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma shows that such a beam is attenuated rapidly over a distance of order q^{1/3} (pi T)^{-4/3} as it propagates at the speed of light, shedding trailing sound waves with momenta of order (pi T).  At larger and larger q, the trailing sound wave becomes less and less prominent.  The outward-going beam of gluon radiation itself shows no tendency to spread in angle or to shift toward larger wavelengths, even as it is completely attenuated.  In this regard, the behavior of the beam of gluons that we analyze is reminiscent of the behavior of jets produced in heavy ion collisions at the LHC that lose a significant fraction of their energy without appreciable change in their angular distribution or their momentum distribution as they plow through the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma produced in these collisions.  However, we know that quark-gluon plasma must be weakly coupled at short enough distance scales.  This means that even if jet quenching typically occurs as in a strongly coupled plasma, there should be rare events in which a hard parton is scattered by a larger angle, picking up significant transverse momentum.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Krishna', 'last_name': 'Rajagopal', 'fullName': 'Rajagopal, Krishna', 'id': '314795', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': '2c68a5f0ec1dce250f21eee4b240232f', 'db_id': 314795, 'person_id': 343498}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,How does longitudinal drag change the radiative energy loss rate?,"Qin, Guang-You",Duke University/Wayne State University,USA,"Jets propagating through dense matter are modified due to the scattering between the patrons of the jet with the constituents of the medium. Such scattering leads to an exchange of momenta between the medium and the jet, and has components that are both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of jet propagation. These scatterings introduce both drag and diffusion, and also change the rate of parton splitting leading to radiative energy loss. In all current calculations of jet modification, only the effect of transverse scattering (quantified by $\hat{q}$) on stimulated emission has been considered. The effect of longitudinal exchange, leading to a drag and diffusion of the produced patrons, is included separately. We compute, for the first time, the gluon emission rate from a hard quark in the presence of both transverse and longitudinal exchange. Depending on the size of the longitudinal drag and diffusion coefficients, longitudinal scattering is shown to influence the radiative energy loss of a hard quark in a dense medium in a non-intuitive way.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Quantum Description of Impurities - Heavy Quarks and Quarkonia,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Nagoya University,United States,"Single heavy quark system has been considered as a hard probe for dynamical information of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), namely drag force, while heavy quarkonium has been thought to probe static information, such as heavy quark potential. However, this intuitive picture is not correct, in particular for the latter. Recent theoretical developments have shown that dynamical feature is also important in the physics of heavy quarkonia through complex heavy quark potential [1]. This complex potential can be understood as stochastic process in the medium [2]. However, as pointed out in [2], complete description must also explain the irreversible process, which results in drag force in the classical limit. In other words, a unified description of heavy quark systems is required.
In this presentation, I will develop such a quantum description for heavy quark systems in QGP on the basis of closed-time formalism in non-equilibrium field theory. In this description, I will explain how we can obtain the stochastic process and the drag force from the first principle and derive the master equation for quantum evolution of the heavy quark systems.

Net-charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges present in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are expected to be different from those of the hadron gas with unit charged particles. Lattice calculations suggest that the higher moments of net-charge distributions and their products are sensitive to the correlation length, and are related to the thermodynamic susceptibilities of the system. The method of the Balance function, on the other hand, is sensitive to collective flow and the breakup temperature and was proposed to give a handle on the hadronization time. A combined study of net-charge fluctuations with Balance functions provides insight to the properties of matter created in high energy collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Theory and phenomenology of quarkyonic percolation of finite density QCD matter,"Torrieri, Giorgio","JW Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt",Unknown,"We generalize the percolating transition discovered in [1] to the full phase diagram, exploring the onset of ""quarkyonic percolation"" for SU(N) Yang-Mills matter when baryon density, temperature and number of colors are varied.
We show that percolation's dependence on number of colors is  different from deconfinement, suggesting that the two phases are generally distinct, with the percolating phase being similar to the quarkyonic phase conjectured in [2].  
We find that, in our world (3 colors, 2-3 flavors) a percolating but confined phase can arise at 2-3 times nuclear density and moderate temperature.    The new phase is confined and contains baryons, yet quark-hole states can propagate to arbitrary distances due to the onset of percolation of tunneling transitions across baryons.
We conclude by sketching an effective theory of percolating matter, and suggesting experimental signatures of it in lower energy heavy ion collisions (FAIR,NICA and the RHIC low energy scan) as well as within neutron stars and supernovae.

Poster Session Reception,poster,The Micro-Vertex-Detector of the CBM-Experiment,"Tischler, Tobias","Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt",Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) is one of the core experiments of the future FAIR facility at Darmstadt/Germany. The experiment will explore the phase diagram of hadronic matter in the regime of highest baryon densities. Nuclear fireballs created in heavy ion collisions of 8-45 AGeV beam energy will be studied with numerous probes, among them open charm.
Reconstructing those rare probes requires a vacuum compatible micro vertex detector (MVD) with unprecedented properties. Its sensor technology has to feature a spatial resolution of <5μm, a radiation tolerance of >10e13 n/cm² and a time resolution of few 10 μs. The detector station must combine an active cooling of the sensors
(~1W/cm²) with a material budget below few 0.1% radiation length.
To match those requirements, we rely on the CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors provided by the IPHC Strasbourg. The highly granular and 50 μm thin sensors will be mounted on a cooling support made from CVD diamond. This support drives the dissipated power to a heat sink outside the detector acceptance. The readout of the
sensors will be done by means of ultra-thin flex print cables.
We discuss the concept of the CBM MVD and report about the status of our prototyping.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tobias', 'last_name': 'Tischler', 'fullName': 'Tischler, Tobias', 'id': '314827', 'affiliation': 'Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt', 'emailHash': '0cd95d09959c078a2b83b9028cc9cd11', 'db_id': 314827, 'person_id': 343522}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Inhomogeneous chiral phase in the QCD phase diagram and cooling of hybrid stars,"Tatsumi, Toshitaka","Department of Physics, Kyoto University",Unknown,"Recently there has been much discussed the appearance of inhomogeneous chiral phases in the vicinity of the chiral restoration [1,2]. The critical end point should be the Lifshitz point, which properties have not been explored so much.Here we discuss an implication of inhomogeneous phase on cooling of hybrid stars.
We consider the dual-chiral-density-wave (DCDW) specified by the spatially modulated quark condensates with amplitude \Delta and wave number q [1], and study the beta decay of quarks. Since the DCDW state can be represented as a chirally rotated state, the quark weak-current is accordingly transformed to have an additional phase factor which modifies the energy-momentum conservation at the vertex. The direct evaluation of the neutrino luminosity shows that it is proportional to \Delta^2q^2T^6, which exhibits a similar form to the pion cooling [3]. Since the DCDW phase develops only in the limited density region, this novel mechanism may give an interesting scenario that lower mass stars should be cooler than heavy-mass ones, which has been also proposed to explain the recent data of Cas A in the context of color superconductivity [4].

Poster Session Reception,poster,Morphology of High-Multiplicity Events in Heavy Ion Collisions,"Gaardhoje, Jens Jorgen",Niels Bohr Institute,Unknown,"We discuss opportunities that may arise from subjecting high-multiplicity events in relativistic heavy ion collisions to an analysis similar to the one used in cosmology for the study of fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). To this end, we discuss examples of how pertinent features of heavy ion collisions including global characteristics, signatures of collective flow and event-wise fluctuations are visually represented in a Mollweide projection commonly used in CMB analysis, and how they are statistically analyzed in an expansion over spherical harmonic functions. If applied to the characterization of purely azimuthal dependent phenomena such as collective flow, the expansion coefficients of spherical harmonics are seen to contain redundancies compared to the set of harmonic flow coefficients commonly used in heavy ion collisions. Our exploratory study indicates, however, that these redundancies may offer novel opportunities for a detailed characterization of those event-wise fluctuations that remain after subtraction of the dominant collective flow signatures. By construction, the proposed approach allows also for the characterization of more complex collective phenomena like higher-order flow and other sources of fluctuations, and it may be extended to the characterization of phenomena of non-collective origin such as jets.

In the low mass range ($M_{ll}<1.1$GeV/$c^{2}$), we can study the vector meson in-medium properties through their di-leptons decays, the observable of possible chiral symmetry restoration. It has been proposed that the elliptic flow measurements of di-leptons in different mass regions will enable us to probe the properties of medium from hadron-gas dominated to QGP dominated. In 2010 and 2011 more than one billion minimum bias events were taken. The 2$\pi$ azimuthal coverage of the newly installed time-of-flight subdetector

at long times the equations of motion should contain a second-order

this strongly-coupled system the lowest “non-hydrodynamical”

that the asymptotic solution of this theory valid at times much larger

Photons having p_T > 1 GeV/c are thus specially suitable for probing fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density distributions. We present the p_T spectra, ratio of central to-peripheral yield and elliptic flow of thermal photons from an event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic calculation with fluctuating initial conditions (IC).

We show that fluctuations in the IC enhance the production of thermal photons significantly in the range 2 < p_T < 4 GeV/c compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged profile for Au+Au (Pb+Pb) collisions at RHIC (LHC) [1,2]. The relative effect of fluctuations in the IC is found to be stronger for peripheral collisions and for lower beam energies. Thermal photon p_T spectra are studied for different values of initial formation time \tau_0 as well as for centrality dependent \tau_0 values. We show that a suitably normalized ratio of central-to-peripheral yield as a function of collision centrality and p_T can be a useful measure of the fluctuation size scale [2].

PHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow at RHIC is found to be significantly larger than the v_2 results obtained using ideal hydrodynamics with smooth IC in the region 1 < p_T < 6 GeV/c. We show that fluctuations in the IC increase the elliptic flow for p_T > 2  GeV/c for  mid-central collisions compared to the results from a smooth initial-state-averaged profile [3]. We also show that these results depend strongly on the value of the fluctuation size scale as well as on the initial and final conditions of the  hydrodynamic calculation [3].

This analysis is based on 0.306/ub of data from 2010, with recently extended number (and range) of pseudorapidity and centrality bins. The transverse energy per unit of pseudorapidity increases faster with collision energy than the multiplicity of charged particles. This implies that the mean energy per particle and hence the temperature of the system is increasing with collision energy.

Parallel 2B: Jets (Chair P.

These measurements make use of the high-statistics jet-triggered data recorded in 2011, including the total available PbPb luminosity of 150/ub. Charged particles are reconstructed using an iterative algorithm and spurious high-pT tracks are suppressed by requiring appropriate energy deposits in the calorimeter system. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm, using combined information from tracking and calorimetry. The charged particle and jet transverse momentum distributions are measured in the pseudorapidity range of |eta|<1 and |eta| < 1.6, and in pT up to 100 GeV/c, and from 100 to 300 GeV/c, respectively. The nuclear modification factors, RAAs, for charged hadrons and jets are presented as a function of pT and collision centrality. In the range pT = 5-10 GeV/c the charged hadron production in PbPb collisions is suppressed by up to a factor of seven, compared to the pp yield scaled by the number of incoherent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The charged hadron RAA increases at higher pT and approaches a value of approximately 0.5 in the range pT = 40-100 GeV/c.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marguerite Belt', 'last_name': 'Tonjes', 'fullName': 'Tonjes, Marguerite Belt', 'id': '314900', 'affiliation': 'University of Maryland (US)', 'emailHash': '7ee368330f3799bca6e5dd0e3b3dc7cb', 'db_id': 314900, 'person_id': 343572}"

The challenge is to keep high efficiencies (above 90%) and good time resolutions (less than 80ps) at particle fluxes up to 20kHz/cm2, which is not accessible to conventional float-glass MRPCs. For this purpose, a type of low-resistivity doped glass with bulk resistivity on the order of 1010 Ωcm was produced at Tsinghua University. Several high-rate prototypes based on this material have been developed and tested in beam.
In the current conceptual design, the whole CBM-TOF wall is arranged in four “rate regions”. In the inner region of the wall (region 1), pad readout MRPCs based on low-resistive glass can be efficiently used to cope with the high particle fluxes and granularities (above 20 kHz/cm2), while strip-readout MRPCs represent a natural choice for the outer region where the system occupancy is orders of magnitude lower. Recently, our effort is to realistically adapt the MRPC geometry to suit the conceptual design of the TOF wall. Two kinds of real-size MRPC modules made of low-resistivity doped glass were developed, and beam tested were performed both with protons at the Electron Linac with high Brilliance and low Emittance (ELBE) facility at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). 
We summarize here the results from the latest beam test of the two real-size modules at ELBE facility at HZDR. The counters show high efficiencies above 90%, and time resolutions (MRPC+FEE) down to 60ps, at particle flux up to 100 kHz/cm2, thus fulfill the CBM requirements.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jingbo', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Jingbo', 'id': '314902', 'affiliation': 'Department of Engineering Physics, Tsinghua University,  Key Laboratory of Particle & Radiation Imaging, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100084, China', 'emailHash': '697cd40e944817b70b4b4aac9bdd5d4b', 'db_id': 314902, 'person_id': 343321}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Systematic study of the dipolar flow associated with initial density fluctuations in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC within a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model,"Radhakrishnan, Sooraj Krishnan",State University of New York (US),USA,"The anisotropy associated with the initial dipole asymmetry in heavy ion collisions is studied via the first harmonic coefficient $v_{1,1}$ of the two-particle azimuthal angle correlations, within AMPT and HIJING model (AMPT is essentially HIJING + parton/hadron transport). For a broad selection of centrality, transverse momenta and pseudorapidity ($\eta$), a fitting method is used to decompose $v_{1,1}$ into a rapidity-even component, characterized by the Fourier coefficient $v_1$, and a global momentum conservation component. We found that the $v_{1,1}$ data from HIJING can be entirely described by the momentum conservation component, while description of the data from AMPT requires both components. This proves that the rapidity-even $v_1$ is indeed a collective phenomena transferred from initial dipole asymmetry by the strong final state interaction. The extracted $v_1$ values are negative for pT < 0.7-0.9 GeV, reach a maximum at 2-3 GeV, and decreases at higher pT. The $v_1$ values vary weakly with $\eta$ and centrality, but increase with collision energy, strong coupling constant ($\alpha_s$) and parton cross-section ($\sigma$). We compare our results with ATLAS $v_1$ data extracted from same two-component fit [1]. This comparison allows us to constrain $\alpha_s$ and $\sigma$, and consequently the values of shear viscosity. We analyze the values of the extracted global momentum conservation component and compare with those calculated based on Borghini et.al. [2]; the comparison suggests that the effective size of the system that conserve momentum is about 1/3 of the total multiplicity of the event, also consistent with the ATLAS data. We then extract $v_1$ using the modified event plane method proposed by Luzum et.al. [3] and compared with those obtained from two-particle correlation. The differences between the two methods, and consequently the caveat for applying this event plane method to experimental analysis, are discussed. Finally, we extend our simulation to identified particles (proton, kaon and meson). This extension allows us to predict/test the constituent quark scaling which was only done before for higher-order harmonic flow. These studies represent a significant extension of our results presented in a recent publication [4].

QCD sum rules incorporate finite temperature effects in form 
of changing values of the various gluonic condensates that appear 
in the operator product expansion. These changes depend on the 
energy density and pressure at finite temperature, which we extract 
from lattice QCD.
As a result, we find that the charmonium states J/\psi, \eta_c, \chi_{c0}

The main difference between our approach and the traditional 14-moment approximation is that we do not close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion by truncating the expansion of the single-particle momentum distribution function. Instead, we keep all the terms in the moment expansion and truncate the exact equations of motion for these moments according to a systematic power counting scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers. We apply this formalism to obtain an approximate expression for the non-equilibrium single-particle momentum distribution function of a hadron resonance gas. Then, we investigate the implications of our new formalism in the freeze-out description of the hadron resonance gas and compare it with the method traditionally used in heavy-ion collisions, the 14-moment approximation.

Initial charge separations of about 10 % for 200 GeV, 5 % for 39 GeV, 0 % for 11.5 GeV appear to be necessary. This is consistent with decreasing Chiral Magnetic Effect as the incident energy decreases at RHIC. A reduced partonic interaction cross section is also needed for 11.5 GeV, indicating possible significant contributions from the hadronic stage. For Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV, 10% initial charge separation can produce similar behaviors as those at the top RHIC energy.

Further expanding on this analysis, we present our results on looking at these correlations through pairing kaons and pions produced during the collision events (while fixing the third particle to be another pion). The idea behind looking at kaon-pion (K-Pi) correlations is that the two-body correlations between these distinct particles are weaker than those between pions with themselves. It may be that the tendency of two pions to be emitted at small angles to one another can be an important ingredient in a strong interaction background [2]. Hence, looking at K-Pi correlations may reduce potential effects from such backgrounds and possibly other parity-even effects that may contribute to the three-particle correlator.

We present charge dependent azimuthal correlations between pions and kaons identified by using the Time-Of-Flight detector as a function of centrality, $\delta\eta$ and $\deltap_{T}$ between pairs in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Modifications depending on elliptic flow are also applied to the correlators as an additional measure to possibly reduce P-even background effects on the three-particle correlators.

Direct photons are very convenient tool for investigation of nuclear effects since 
they are not expected to be accompanied by any final state interaction, either energy loss or absorption. Therefore, besides the Cronin enhancement at medium-high p_T and small isotopic corrections at larger p_T, one should not expect any nuclear effects. However, data from the PHENIX experiment at mid-rapidities demonstrate a significant large-p_T suppression in central d+Au and Au+Au collisions that cannot be induced by coherent phenomena (gluon shadowing, Color Glass Condensate). We demonstrate that such an unexpected result is a subject to the energy conservation constraints (ECC) in initial state multiple parton interactions. The corresponding suppression factor falls steeply with p_T and leads to rather strong decrease with p_T of the nuclear modification factor violating so QCD factorization. In the RHIC kinematic region at forward rapidities we include also coherent phenomena as an additional source of nuclear suppression. In the LHC energy range ECC effects are irrelevant at mid-rapidities, but they are going to be important with increasing rapidity. We study for the first time a relative contribution of both sources of nuclear suppression at different rapidities performing predictions that could be verified in the future by experiments at RHIC and LHC.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Direct Photon and Lepton Pair Production from Viscous quark-gluon plasma,"Sinha, Bikash",V,Unknown,"We have studied the effect of shear viscosity effects on direct photons as well as lepton pair production from Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The production rate for both these two thermodynamic signals gets modified due to: (i) changed space-time evolution of the viscous fluid and (ii) non-equilibrium correction to the equilibrium distribution function. The non-equilibrium correction grows with viscosity as well as transverse momentum. Viscous effects on photon production are strong [1]. The space-time evolution of QGP was obtained by solving Israel-Stewart’s second order hydrodynamics for $\sqrt_{NN}$=200 GeV Au+Au collisions. Effect of viscosity is to stiffen the dilepton spectra and reduce the elliptic flow [2]. Although, the rate of applicability is limited in the pT range due to non-equilibrium effects, the thermometric signals can limit the initial temperature and viscosity, the ratios of dileptons to photons it is expected, can be a fairly good measure of viscosity without the uncertainty of initial conditions. Shear viscosity per entropy, it seems, does not change appreciably going from RHIC to LHC. We intend to explore this puzzle.

This is what could be achieved through a “little inflation” of about 7 e – folding leading to a QCD first order transition [1], while remaining in a deconfined and in a chirally symmetric phase. It was demonstrated [2] using chromoelectric flux-tube fission model that some strange quark “nuggets” (SQN) [3] with an initial baryon number ~ 1044  or more can survive the evaporation process and be stable on cosmological time scales. We demonstrate that these SQN’s are natural candidates for baryonic dark matter. We also argue that these SQNs, together with the natural requirement that the total baryon number of the universe is an integer [4], can explain the occurrence of the cosmological dark energy within the standard model of particle physics.

Propagating through the created matter they serve as a probe of the dynamics of the strongly-interacting, hot and dense plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP).
The transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow (v2) of heavy quarks is sensitive to the properties of the QGP.
A non-zero v2 of low transverse momentum electrons from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavours indicates a collective motion of the heavy quarks with respect to the bulk of the created matter. Whereas, the high transverse momentum v2 is sensitive to the path length dependence of heavy-quark energy loss within the QGP.
We present measurements of heavy-flavour electron v2 in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE experiment at mid-rapidity. In 2011, the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) provided a dedicated online trigger for measurements of high momentum electrons in Pb-Pb collisions. The electrons were identified in these triggered events using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal).

To study this possibility under realistic conditions of the expansion and the cooling of the fireball we performed dynamic simulations within our approach of nonequilibrium chiral fluid dynamics. Based on an effective phase transition model, chiral fields and their fluctuations propagate explicitly within a medium that expands fluid dynamically. The interaction between the fields and the fluid leads to dissipation and noise, which in turn affect the chiral propagation. In this talk we present the consequences of this coupled dynamics for different phase transition scenarios.
In the case of a first order phase transition we observe the development of a highly supercooled state. This leads to the dynamic formation and decay of domains of the chirally-symmetric phase in a chirally-broken environment and can be seen in single event studies. At the critical point, due to large relaxation times, we find that critical slowing down weakens the critical phenomena. However, for the first time we are able to demonstrate in a dynamic and realistic study the basic features of a critical point: the growth of the correlation length and the enhancement of event-by-event fluctuations of the sigma field. It is, therefore, expected that both, the first order phase transition and the critical point develop their characteristic signals in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marlene', 'last_name': 'Nahrgang', 'fullName': 'Nahrgang, Marlene', 'id': '314961', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '4751b9ae0f461a7314fe14eb52013856', 'db_id': 314961, 'person_id': 343613}"

\preprint{ }
Event-by-event fluctuations in strangeness may reveal the nature of Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) phase transition and can be used as a probe for QCD critical point \cite{1}. Dynamical fluctuations in $K/\pi$ at lower beam energy were reported to increase with decreasing $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ \cite{2} while they remained constant at higher $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. STAR results for the study of $K/\pi$ fluctuations have been reported earlier for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 39, 62.4, 130 and 200 GeV\cite{3,4}.The results have been found to be independent of beam energy. In this poster, we report new results on event-by-event fluctuations in $K/\pi$ at midrapidity from 19.6 and 27 GeV Au+Au collisions. The use of  Time Projection Chamber(TPC) and Time of Flight(TOF) detector allows particle identification up to $p_{T}$ $\sim${\it{1.6 GeV/c}}. The advantage of this large particle identification reach in momentum and using a collider facility for $K/\pi$ fluctuation studies will be discussed. The results will be compared with the prediction of a transport model(UrQMD) and statistical hadronization model \cite{5}.

Poster Session Reception,poster,A Study of High-pT/High-mass Dielectron Production through Trigger Combination in 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Jung, Kurt",Purdue University (US),USA,"Dileptons are unique probes of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Compared to hadrons, leptons have little interaction with the QGP medium and can thus travel through the entire system with most of the original information intact. This feature allows us to study the properties of the medium during its space-time evolution.  The low mass region (LMR, m < 1.1 GeV/c^2) is dominated by the decay of the vector mesons, in which chiral symmetry restoration in the medium can be studied. In the intermediate mass region (IMR, 1.1 < m < 3.0 GeV/c^2), the dominant dilepton sources are expected to be the thermal radiation of the QGP and the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Systematic measurements in both mass regions and at all pT are crucial in revealing the medium's properties.  Finally, high-pT dileptons in particular allow measurements of direct photons and of spectrum enhancements in the LMR.

To observe the dilepton production at high pT, it is necessary to utilize the data from the high-pT triggers in conjunction with the minimum-bias trigger.  These dielectron measurements are made using data from the STAR time projection chamber, time of flight, and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter (BEMC) at midrapidity.  In this poster, we present a study on the dielectron production in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions recorded by the STAR detector in 2010 using a novel combination of the minimum-bias trigger and three high-pT triggers with different energy thresholds in the BEMC.  Because the mass spectrum from each high-pT trigger is biased, we apply an effective weight to each dielectron pair based on the trigger threshold and scale factor.  Finally, we combine the weighted results from all four triggers.  The analysis details and associated mass spectra will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kurt', 'last_name': 'Jung', 'fullName': 'Jung, Kurt', 'id': '314966', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University (US)', 'emailHash': '662f67b3dc3c07c49324873e9c1e0c10', 'db_id': 314966, 'person_id': 343615}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,How do Jets Affect the Collective Flow of the Quark-Gluon Plasma?,"Andrade, Rone",Universidade de São Paulo USP,Unknown,"In this work we study how highly energetic jets affect the hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in an  event-by-event basis. This is done by the introduction of a source term [1] in the energy-momentum conservation equation that describes the evolution of inviscid hydrodynamics (with a realistic equation of state [2]). The source is parametrized in terms of the direction of the jet in the medium and its energy loss rate. The influence of jets on the QGP collective flow is systematically investigated using the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal flow distribution computed at both RHIC and LHC energies. In addition, we discuss the structure of the two-particle correlation function taking into account both initial state fluctuations [3,4] and the effects of jets. While the propagation of jets in a smooth QGP has been extensively studied before, the interplay between the different sources of flow anisotropy (i.e, initial state fluctuations and jets) studied in this work poses some new questions about the hydrodynamical evolution of the QGP. For instance, can Mach cones consistently form in an event-by-event basis? Do the highly high energetic jets present at LHC lead to novel structures in the two-particle correlation function? In this presentation we intend to shed some light on such questions.

Parallel 7E: New Theoretical Developments (Chair P. Levai),parallel,Evolution of singularities in unequal time two-point correlator in formation of QGP,"Lin, Shu",Brookhaven National Laboratory,United States,"One of the most difficult problems still to be understood is the mechanism of fast thermalization in heavy ion collisions. The problem involves dynamics in strong coupling regime and physics far from equilibrium, therefore is hardly tractable by usual method. The gauge/gravity duality naturally maps the formation of quark gluon plasma to another fundamental problem in black hole physics: information loss in a gravitational collapse process. The present work summarizes our recent results on the study of a particular probe: unequal time two-point correlator for gauge theory in the evolution toward thermal equilibrium. In [1], we found that near equilibrium the spectral functions showed a universal pattern as field equilibrates in a quasi-static approximation. We have then systematically extended the previous work to the far from equilibrium region by using the coordinate representation. In the past two years we have developed a divergence matching method in computing the singularities of the unequal time two-point correlator in a time-dependent background. We found the singularities have a nice interpretation with a geometric optics picture [2,3]. Applying this method to the gravitational collapse model, we found the singularities of the unequal time correlator shifted from the real time to the complex time in the formation of QGP [4]. This signature sheds more light on the mechanism of the thermalization and may have interesting implications to heavy ion phenomenology and experiments.

Such a study is essential for the interpretation of a pertinent signal from dilepton data in heavy-ion collisions. We start from vacuum spectral functions which include both ground- and excited-state resonances for both the vector and axial-vector channels, supplemented by an identical perturbative continuum. The vacuum spectral functions are constructed to agree with tau decay data and Weinberg sum rules. In the medium, the rho spectral function is
taken from effective hadronic many-body theory which is consistent with available dilepton data. The in-medium properties of the rho' are constrained by satisfying the in-medium QCD sum rule. For the axial-vector channel, different ansaetze are chosen for the in-medium a1 (broadening, mass drop, two-level model), while the medium modification of the excited state is again constrained by the QCD sum rule. These different ansaetze are then tested for chiral symmetry restoration through the Weinberg sum rules.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Paul', 'last_name': 'Hohler', 'fullName': 'Hohler, Paul', 'id': '314975', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'emailHash': '2f0a949016da2c933b4897ced7bec6c3', 'db_id': 314975, 'person_id': 343620}"

The level of thermalization of heavy quarks can be studied via the azimuthal anisotropy of their emission in the transverse plane, the elliptic flow v2, at low transverse momentum. At high pt, v2 provides insight on the path length dependence of parton energy-loss. 
One channel to measure the heavy-flavour v2 is semi-electronic decays of hadrons carrying a charm or a beauty quark.

The presented poster will focus on the method to subtract the background electron contribution in the measurement of the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour decay electrons in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with ALICE at mid-rapidity.
The elliptic flow of inclusive electrons is measured with the event plane method. At high pt the contribution of electrons from heavy-flavour decays is expected to be dominant, whereas at low pt most electrons come from Dalitz decays of pi0 and gamma conversions in the detector material. A Monte Carlo simulation, based on the measured elliptic flow and pt distributions of the main background sources, is performed to estimate the contribution from known background electrons.

The data shows only a small collision energy dependence and indicates a common scaling behaviour with event multiplicity from pp to semi-central Pb--Pb collisions. In central Pb--Pb collisions, the results deviate from this trend, exhibiting a significant reduction of the fluctuation strength.

The study indicates a sensitivity of the data to different mechanisms to model high-multiplicity pp events. A comparison of Pb--Pb results to HIJING and AMPT suggests a strong relation between transverse momentum fluctuations and collectivity in central events, and disfavors an independent superposition scenario.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stefan Thomas', 'last_name': 'Heckel', 'fullName': 'Heckel, Stefan Thomas', 'id': '314992', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

As a very promising probe we intend to study direct photons and correlations involving photons, pions, and jets over a broad range rapidity in p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the highest LHC energies.

Charm survives the QGP evolution and as hadrons emerge in soft hadronization  processes, practically every charm or anticharm quark turns into a charmed hadron, small fraction of the charm yield enters multi-charmed hadrons and charmonium states. We assume that in the hadronization process the single charmed hadrons production is governed by the available phase space and their yield is normalized by the total single charm hadron yield. By allowing for charm hadron to charm hadron decay cascades, we establish total fraction of single charm hadrons found in their ground states. We  show that the yields of charmed mesons can help to determine the charm  hadronization temperature.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Realistic medium-averaging in GLV radiative energy loss,"Sun, Deke",Purdue University,USA,"There has been a lot of interest in testing radiative energy loss 
calculations against data from RHIC and the LHC. It is customary, as in the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) approach, to formulate the energy loss of a jet parton as a line integral from the production point along a straight-line trajectory. Calculations then account for variations in path length with jet origin and direction, and most recently also for fluctuations in the medium density (lumpiness), which give rise to fluctuations in energy loss that significantly affect high-pT observables such as the nuclear suppression R_AA or the momentum anisotropies v_n.

These studies, however, ignore that the line integrals themselves

The fact that the multiplicity density in A+A collisions increases faster than the number of participants has led to the popular formula $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/d\eta}=\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{pp}/d\eta} [x N_{\rm part}/2 +(1-x) N_{\rm coll}]$ with the implication that point-like hard-scattering contributes to the total charge multiplicity or $\sum E_T$ distributions. For $\sqrt{s}=630$ GeV $\bar{p}-p$ collisions, the UA2 collaboration~\cite{UA2PLB165} measured that the hard-scattering component of $\sum E_T$ distributions only becomes apparent at the level of $\sim 1/500$ the total cross-section, clearly indicating that the contribution of hard-process to the multiplicity and $\sum E_T$ distributions is negligible. The universal behavior of $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/(0.5N_{\rm part}d\eta)}$ as a function of $N_{\rm part}$ at RHIC and LHC over the range $7\leq \sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq 2760$ GeV, in spite of the dramatic increase in the ratio of $N_{\rm coll}/N_{\rm part}$ due to the increasing N-N interaction cross section, is another indication. Finally, an $E_T$ distribution which satisfies the popular formula for $\mean{dN_{\rm ch}^{AA}/d\eta}$ will be demonstrated and shown to look nothing like any measured $\sum E_T$ distribution. A more reasonable nuclear geometrical description has been given previously~\cite{Voloshin,De,Nouicer} and will be tested with recent data.

Electromagnetic radiation can be emitted when quark antiquark pairs recombine into pions and other hadrons. The photon and dilepton production rates are found to be comparable to those in quark gluon plasma and hadronic matter around the critical temperature. We compute the photon and dilepton yields from such processes for Au+Au collision at RHIC(\sqrt{s}=200GeV) by convoluting the rates with a hydrodynamic simulation of the system. A comparison of the results to PHENIX and STAR measurements shows that dileptons from hadronization processes could partially explain the excess of low mass dilepton. The transverse momentum spectrum exhibits a smaller effective temperature than the QGP contribution. The elliptic flow of dileptons from the hadronization process behaves similar to the elliptic flow of dileptons from hadronic matter.

Since the net baryon carries valuable information on the remnant of the colliding nuclei and thus on the magnitude of kinetic energy loss for the QGP production in the yet-unknown early thermalization stage, the next task for hydrodynamic analyses should be to incorporate finite baryon density.

In this study, I develop a novel dissipative hydrodynamic model with finite net baryon density to investigate the net baryon rapidity distributions at RHIC and LHC [2]. Baryon dissipation is taken into account together with shear and bulk viscosities by a generalized second order theory [3]. The state-of-art lattice QCD equation of state and the color glass type initial conditions are employed. The results show that the net baryon is carried to forward rapidity during the hydrodynamic evolution, which implies that the experimentally observed transparency of the collision at RHIC [4] is effectively enhanced. This indicates that the kinetic energy loss for the production of the hot medium at the initial stage is larger, and then a part of the energy is transferred back to the net baryon components through the strong medium interaction. Furthermore, the net baryon distribution is found sensitive to baryon diffusion as well as to viscosities. This opens a possibility of constraining all the transport coefficients experimentally, including the ones at finite density such as baryon diffusion coefficient and thermo-diffusion cross coefficient. The results indicate that the dissipative hydrodynamic modeling would be important for extracting unique properties of the hot medium even in the high-energy collisions.

We study quantitatively to what extent anisotropic flow ($v_n$) is determined by the initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_n$ for a set of realistic simulations, and we discuss which definition of $\varepsilon_n$ gives the best estimator of $v_n$.  We find that the common practice of using an $r^2$ weight in the definition of $\varepsilon_n$ in general results in a poorer predictor of $v_n$ than when using $r^n$ weight, for $n > 2$.   We similarly study the importance of additional properties of the initial state.  For example, we show that in order to correctly predict $v_4$ and $v_5$ for non-central collisions, one must take into account nonlinear terms proportional to $\varepsilon_2^2$ and $\varepsilon_2\varepsilon_3$, respectively.  We find that it makes no difference whether one calculates the eccentricities over a range of rapidity, or in a single slice at $z=0$, nor is it important whether one uses an energy or entropy density weight.

To understand the thermalization of the medium and its influence on high-energy probes generated in the early time in the strongly-coupled scenario would entail further investigations. In the gravity dual, the thermalization of the medium corresponds to the gravitational collapse and the formation of a black hole. We utilize the AdS-Vaidya metric, which describes a falling mass shell, to analyze the isotropic thermalization. In WKB approximation, the dissipation of a high-energy jet traversing the medium can be characterized by the stopping distance of a massless particle falling along the null geodesic in the gravity dual. We find the stopping distance of an energetic probe in AdS-Vaidya spacetime is equal to that in AdS-Schwarzschild spacetime, which implies that a probe with the energy much greater than the thermalization temperature is not be sensitive to the thermalization process, at least in this idealized scenario. This is different from a gluon probe with finite energy represented by a falling string in the gravity dual, where the stopping distance is governed by the null geodesic starting below the boundary.

Their behaviors at current relativistic heavy ion collisions are highly interested and studied intensively [2,3]. Before we draw the critical-like fluctuations from the measured higher cumulants, it is necessary to know what the contributions of conventional effects are.  
    In the present work, we firstly derive the Poisson-like statistical fluctuations of net-proton number [4], and net-electric charge. It shows that net-proton kurtosis at top incident energy of RHIC [3] is dominated by Poisson-liked statistical fluctuations [4]. So dynamical higher moments, subtracting the statistical parts, are suggested.  
    Secondly, the influences of the centrality, the efficiency of the detector, and the cuts of transverse momentum (pT) and rapidity in higher cumulant ratios of net-proton are systematically studied by using the sample of Au + Au collisions at 39GeV generated by APMT default model. It is found: (1) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are sensitive to the definitions of centrality. (2) Dynamical cumulant ratios are little efficiency dependent. (3) Both dynamical and directly measured cumulant ratios are the cuts of phase-space dependent.

Poster Session Reception,poster,A direct measure of anisotropic velocity in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Wu, Yuanfang","Institute of Particle Physics, CCNU, Wuhan China",Unknown,"The radial flow parameters are important quantities in relativistic heavy ion collisions [1]. They constrain the equation of state [2] and in particular, the anisotropic parameter relates to shear viscosity [3]. They are usually extracted from the spectrum of transverse momentum by the parameterizations of Blast-wave model [4]. 
    In the present work, we suggest a direct measure of radial velocity, i.e., microscopic average velocity of freeze-out particles in azimuthal plane. It contains three parts: average radial expansion velocity, average anisotropic velocity (the amplitude of modulation in radial expansion velocity as function of the relative angle to the reaction plane), and average thermal velocity. 
     Using the sample of Au+ Au collisions at 200 GeV produced by AMPT with string melting model, we demonstrate that this microscopic average velocity is well fitted by two parts: an average isotropic velocity, and an average anisotropic velocity, which is azimuthal angle dependent. This form of radial velocity is the same as theoretically expected radial flow parameterization [5]. But the difference is that the average isotropic velocity contains the contributions of thermal motion. From the particle species dependence of the average isotropic velocity, we demonstrate that the heavier the mass of the particles, the smaller the isotropic velocity is. It is just the character of thermal motion. 
      Fortunately, average thermal velocity is isotropic and therefore has no contribution toward the average anisotropic velocity. In order to confirm this, the centrality dependence of average radial velocity is presented. We find that its anisotropic part is close to zero when the collisions approach to the central ones. It shows indeed no anisotropic velocity in an ideal central collision. 
       Moreover, we carefully extract kinetic freeze-out parameters in the same sample by fitting pt spectrum and elliptic flow using the parameterization of blast-wave model [4,6]. It is found that the average anisotropic velocity is well coincident with the anisotropic flow velocity extracted by blast-wave model. Furthermore, the centrality dependence of average anisotropic velocity is also consistent with that of extracted from the Blast-wave model. So microscopic average anisotropic velocity of final state particles is a good approximation of anisotropic flow velocity.

In addition, an estimate of jet $v_2$ is necessary for background-subtraction in jet-triggered correlation analyses, which are used to study medium-induced jet shape modification.

On the theoretical side, much effort has been put into the investigation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), its phase diagramm and symmetries.

An important property of the QCD Lagrangian is its approximate chiral symmetry in the light-quark sector. At low temperatures and density this approximate symmetry is also spontaneously broken, while at higher temperatures and/or densities a chiral-symmetry restoring phase transition is expected. Collider experiments at LHC (CERN) probe the phase diagramm at high energy densities and low chemical and baryon chemical potentials, where the chiral phase transition is expected to be a cross over. Future experiments at FAIR (GSI) probe the region with high chemical potential, where a lower-order phase transition is expected.

We use a dynamical 3+1D linear sigma model with constituent quarks to examine the evolution of equilibrium and non-equilibrium  scenarios. In a first attempt we employ a mean-field ansatz which reproduces the thermodynamical properties of the linear sigma model. To investigate fluctuating observables like the quark- and baryon-density at and near the phase transition, the model is extended with scattering processes between the quark quasi-particles and the chiral fields.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Event-by-Event Fluctuations in Initial Conditions in Relativistic Hydrodynamic Model,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"To investigate the physics of the strongly interacting system of quarks
and gluons under extreme conditions, heavy-ion collision experiments are
performed at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). One of the major discoveries is that elliptic flow v_2
was comparable with an ideal hydrodynamic prediction and, as a result,
that a new paradigm of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at
temperature of a few hundreds MeV was established. Recently, the higher
harmonics v_n (n > 2) are observed at RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of
theoretical and experimental interests. Initial condition with
fluctuation from initial nucleon distribution in colliding nuclei is
attributed to one of the major origins of the higher harmonics.

To understand detailed mechanism of how the higher harmonics develop, we
construct an integrated dynamical framework based on relativistic
hydrodynamics [1] and perform massive numerical simulations (10^5
minimum bias events) on an event-by-event basis [2]. In this framework,
the Monte-Carlo versions of factorized Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (fKLN) model
(MC-KLN) and Glauber model (MC-Glauber) are employed as the
initialization models. After describing hydrodynamic evolution of the
matter using fully (3+1) dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, we treat the
subsequent dynamics of hadron gas using a hadron cascade model, JAM.
Using the obtained momentum distribution of the final hadrons, we
finally analyze the harmonics v_n in a way that experimental people
perform the flow analysis such as event plane method, multi-particle
cumulant method. We compare these results with the conventional
theoretically-obtained harmonics with respect to reaction plane or
participant plane to investigate the systematic uncertainty in the
conventional theoretical results. We found that v_n obtained in this way
depends on the flow analysis model, which means the importance of
consistent comparison between theoretical results with experimental
data. We also calculate v_n as a function of centrality using the MC-KLN
and MC-Glauber initialization and found differences of v_2, v_4 and v_5
between these two models. This indicates the simultaneous analysis of
several harmonics would discriminate between the initialization models.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Relation Between the Trace Anomaly and Shear Viscosity in  Clustering of Color Sources and the Equation of State of the QGP,"Scharenberg, Rolf",Purdue University,USA,"The major challenge in heavy ion physics is to extract the equation of state and the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ from the data. In the clustering of color sources (CSPM) the charged particle transverse momentum spectrum is used to measure the percolation density parameter $\xi$, which determines the initial temperature T, energy density $\epsilon$, and the $\eta/s$ ratio versus T in Au+Au collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV . 
For 0.9 $T_{c} < T < $1.2  $T_{c}$ ($T_{c}$  = 167.7 MeV), the sound velocity $C_{s}^{2}$ from the mass less non interacting constituent version of CSPM agrees with Lattice QCD (LQCD)$C_{s}^{2}$ values . For T$ >$ 1.2$T_{c}$  there is a significant difference with the LQCD  values\cite{eos}. 

The measured CSPM value for $\eta/s$ = 0.20, at 1.15$T_{c}$  is consistent with a strongly coupled QGP and increases with T. The Trace Anomaly $\triangle $ is defined as $(\epsilon-3p)/T^{4}$.
Above $T_{c}$, the LQCD $\triangle $ and the reciprocal of $\eta/s$ fall off with 1/T. At $T_{c}$ , $s/\eta$ has a magnitude of  $\sim$5.5 , non interacting - CSPM  has a  $\triangle\sim$ 5.5  and LQCD $\triangle \sim $5.5.   The change in $\triangle$ and $s/\eta$  with 1/T describes the transition from a strongly to weakly coupled QGP. Above $T_{c}$,  $s/\eta$ and the LQCD $\triangle$ may have the same underlying structure.  The $C_{s}^{2}$ values for the QGP obtained using the  $s/\eta \sim 5.5$  version of CSPM above  $T_{c}$ are in excellent agreement with LQCD \cite{wupp, hotqcd}.

The Muon Forward Tracker (MFT) is under consideration by the ALICE Experiment to be part of its programme of detectors upgrade to be installed during the LHC shutdown planned for 2018. The MFT is a silicon pixel detector added in the Muon Spectrometer acceptance ($2.5 < \eta < 4$) upstream of the hadron absorber. The MFT will allow a dramatic improvement of the measurements that are presently done with the Muon Spectrometer and, in addition, will give access to new measurements that are not possible with the present Muon Spectrometer set-up. The enhanced pointing accuracy gained by the muon tracks will significantly improve the mass resolution for the low mass resonances $\omega$ and $\phi$, as well as $-$ to a lesser extent $-$ for the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$. The measurement of these resonances down to low $p_\mathrm{T}$ in heavy-ion collisions represents a unique feature at the LHC.

In addition, the MFT will help to reject a large fraction of muons coming from pion and kaon decays, improving the signal over background ratio for all the observables. In order to establish the physics performances achievable at the luminosities expected after 2018, realistic simulations of the MFT setup are being performed within the AliRoot framework.

Because of the dead-cone effect, heavy quarks are expected to loose less energy than light quarks if the dominant energy loss mechanism is gluon radiation.  The suppression expected on the basis of energy loss depends on the relative contribution of D and B hadrons to the total yield. Therefore, it is important to separate these contributions.
The relative contribution of beauty decays to the total electron yield from heavy flavour decays can be isolated by looking at azimuthal correlation between these electrons and charged hadrons, exploiting the different decay kinematics of D and B hadrons.

The lifetime and decay modes of the hypertriton, the lightest hypernucleus, which consists of a proton, a neutron and the lightest hyperon Lambda, and the antimatter hypertriton discovered at RHIC[2], provide valuable insights into the Y-N interaction.

The strangeness population factor S3, defined as $\frac{{^3_\Lambda}H/^{3}He}{\Lambda/p}$, is a good representation of the local correlation between baryon number and strangeness[2]. It is predicted that S3 has a different behavior in QGP and pure hadron gas[3,4] thus can be used as a tool to distinguish Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) from a pure hadronic phase.

The RHIC beam energy scan program in 2010-2011 allowed STAR to collecte data from Au+Au collisions over a broad range of energies. This provides an opportunity to study the beam energy dependence of S3. In addition, due to the beam energy independence of our lifetime measurement method, with increased statistics of present datasets, an improved result of lifetime measurement of hypertriton can be obtained.

In this talk, the hypertriton analysis results for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 200 GeV will be presented. With the excellent particle identification of Time Projection Chamber, we are able to reconstruct $^{3}_{\Lambda}H$($^{3}_{\bar{\Lambda}}\bar{H}$) via its two-body decay channel to $^{3}He$ and $\pi^{-}$($\overline{^{3}He}$ and $\pi^{+}$). The combined $^{3}_{\Lambda}H$ plus $^{3}_{\bar{\Lambda}}\bar{H}$ raw yield is about 600 and its significance can reach 9.5$\sigma$. With this increased statistics, our lifetime measurement will be presented and the beam energy dependence of S3 will also be discussed.

number, strangeness, charge, and isospin are suggested to carry information about the de-confinement and chiral phase transitions. An
observation of enhanced dynamical fluctuations or non-monotonic behavior of transverse momentum correlations as a function of colliding energy might indicate the system has probed the predicted QCD critical point.

The STAR experiment has performed a comprehensive study of the energy
and charge dependence of dynamical particle ratio ($K/\pi$, $p/\pi$,
and $K/p$) fluctuations, net-charge fluctuations, and transverse
momentum correlations in the STAR TPC at mid-rapidity, as well as
neutral-charge pion fluctuations at forward rapidity. The charge
dependence of particle ratio fluctuations exhibit differences between
same and opposite sign dynamical particle ratio fluctuations compared
to inclusive charged dynamical fluctuations. Neutral-charge pion
fluctuations at forward rapidity are measured by detecting neutral pion
decay photons in the Photon Multiplicity Detector and charged pions by the Forward Time Projection Chamber, which cover the same pseudorapidty
region.

The centrality, energy, and charge dependence from new measurements of the fluctuation observables $\nu_{dyn}$ and $r_{m,1}$ and the energy dependence of transverse momentum correlations from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV Au+Au collisions will be presented.

It is shown that the correlations between the isospins of nucleons in the final state are almost negligible over a wide range of collision energy. This leads to a factorization of the distribution function of the proton, neutron, and their antiparticles in the final state with binomial distribution functions. Using the factorization, we derive formulas to determine nucleon number cumulants, which are not direct experimental observables, from proton number fluctuations which are experimentally observable in event-by-event analyses.
With a simple treatment for strange baryons, the nucleon number
cumulants are further promoted to the baryon number ones. 
Experimental determination of the baryon number cumulants makes
it possible to compare various theoretical stduies on them directly with experiments. Effects of nonzero isospin density on this formula are addressed quantitatively.

Jet measurements play a critical role not only for probing the hot and high energy density matter in heavy ion collisions through parton energy loss, but also to observe possible modifications of the hot and dense matter itself by the lost energy.
Hadron-jet correlations allow us to maximize the pathlength of the parton through the medium by selecting trigger hadrons with high transverse momenta that are biased to coming from the surface of the QGP.

The modification is strongly related with properties of hot and dense matter and the study of jet properties is a versatile probe for the properties of the QGP.
However, in heavy-ion collisions it is difficult to recover the jet quenching effects at small particle momentum due to large backgrounds from thermal bulk in such a multi-body system.
The measurement of hadrons with respect to a reconstructed jet allows to relate more directly the momentum and direction of the original parton to the distribution of its fragmentation products.

The hydrodynamic bulk evolution is quantitatively constrained by bulk and multi-strange hadron spectra and elliptic flow [2]. In the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase, heavy-quark diffusion coefficients are taken from a non-perturbative $T$-matrix approach. The latter leads to resonance formation close to Tc which is implemented as a hadronization (recombination) mechanism on a hydrodynamic hypersurface. In the hadronic phase, the diffusion of HF mesons is obtained from effective hadronic theory [3]. We compute observables at RHIC and LHC for both HF mesons and non-photonic electrons. In particular, we suggest the R_AA and v_2 of the D_s mesons as a unique observable due to the coupling of charm to the strangeness enhancement in AA collisions [4], which allows to quantitatively test key components of our approach, including recombination and hadronic diffusion effects.

An interesting phenomenon at the kinetic freeze-out stage of the system evolution is the collective transverse expansion as it is entirely generated during the collision and therefore reflect the collision dynamics. Experimental data collected at RHIC have shown that the system produced in Au-Au collisions is thermalized and undergoes a strong collective expansion, that could be characterized by the Hubble law. The measurable observables that can provide information about thermalization and collective flow are the transverse momentum spectra of produced particles. The expansion rate at “thermal freeze-out” provides the nuclear collision analogue of the Hubble constant for the Big Bang, while the corresponding freeze-out temperature parallels the temperature of the cosmic microwave background at the point of photon decoupling. 

In this work we will make an estimate of a Hubble parameter for relativistic nuclear collisions similar to cosmological Hubble constant, based on temporal connections between the evolution of nuclear matter produced in a relativistic heavy ion collision and the Universe evolution after the Big Bang. We will present  experimental data obtained in Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies and will compare with the same parameters obtained from simulated data at future CBM-FAIR energies.  

We will investigate the freeze-out process in heavy ion collisions at CBM-FAIR energies and we will present a study of blast-wave fits performed to the transverse momentum spectra obtained from simulated heavy ion collisions using the most important simulation codes from this field.

Also the published pT spectra of bulk hadrons (at RHIC) have been reproduced quite nicely [3]. We now bring this closed framework to NLO as rigorously as possible. In particular, we calculate the minijet transverse energy production by using the latest knowledge of nuclear parton distributions (nPDFs), the NLO sets EPS09 [4], and discuss how
the nPDF uncertainties propagate into the computed hydrodynamical initial conditions as well as observable multiplicities. Regarding the NLO minijet production, we develop a new set of infra-red safe measurement functions and study their effect on the multiplicity systematics from RHIC to LHC. Our main goal here is to quantify the
theoretical uncertainties and the predictive power of this NLO pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics -framework.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Fluctuating Hydrodynamics Confronts the Rapidity Dependence of Transverse Momentum Fluctuations,"Gavin, Sean",Wayne State University,United States,"Interest in the development of the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics is growing [1]. Early efforts suggested that viscous diffusion broadens the rapidity dependence of transverse momentum correlations [2]. That work stimulated an experimental analysis by STAR [3]. We attack this new data along two fronts. First, we compute STAR’s fluctuation observable using the NeXSPheRIO code, which combines fluctuating initial conditions from a string fragmentation model with deterministic viscosity-free hydrodynamic evolution [4]. We find that NeXSPheRIO produces a longitudinal narrowing, in contrast to the data. Second, we study the hydrodynamic evolution using second order causal viscous hydrodynamics including Langevin noise. We obtain a deterministic evolution equation for the transverse momentum density correlation function.  We use the latest theoretical equations of state and transport coefficients to compute STAR’s observable. The results are in excellent accord with the measured broadening. In addition, we predict features of the distribution that can distinguish 2nd and 1st order diffusion.

The dijet momentum balance and angular correlations are studied in detail as a function of collision centrality and leading jet transverse momentum. For the most peripheral PbPb collisions, the dijet momentum balance distributions are in good agreement with pp data and with reference calculations at the same collision energy. More central collisions show a strong imbalance between the leading and subleading jet transverse momenta, which is found to persist to the largest values of leading jet transverse momenta studied.

The flavor dependence of jet quenching is a powerful handle to discriminate models of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Two-particle correlations on transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV at STAR.,"Oldag, Elizabeth","UT Austin, STAR Collaboration",Unknown,"Correlations on transverse momentum $p_t$ include important aspects of the six dimensional correlation space ($p_t1,\eta_1,\phi_1,p_t2,\eta_2,\phi_2$) [1].  Two-particle 2D correlations, $(p_t1,p_t2)$, for minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV from STAR show a broad peak extending from 0.5-4.0 GeV/c [2].  These correlations are formed from all charged particles with $p_t \geq 0.15$ GeV/c, $|\eta| \leq 1$, and $2\pi$ azimuth.  The broad peak is observed in both like- and unlike-sign charge combinations and same- and away-side relative azimuth angles. Variation of peak positions and widths will be reported as a function of centrality.  Interestingly, the peak in the data for away-side or “back-to-back” pairs persists even in more-central collisions, remaining at approximately the same transverse momentum for like- and unlike-sign pairs at all centralities. The event generator HIJING,
often used to model peripheral heavy ion interactions, predicts a
similar peak in this momentum range but only when jets are included.
The peak position for same-side unlike-sign pairs remains at the same approximate momentum for peripheral to mid-central collisions.
However, for more-central collisions the same-side peak separates into two peaks.  The centrality dependence of these data will be compared with that of $p_t$-integral 2D angular correlations [3].  The transverse momentum dependence of the same-side angular correlation structures will also be presented. Possible mechanisms for the observed structures will be discussed and predictions from several models will be presented to test agreement with data.

Following on this discovery,the PHENIX collaboration has embarked on a  number of upgrades to study the QGP properties in detail,  with the next step being a significant overhaul of the PHENIX detector called sPHENIX. sPHENIX includes upgrading the central detector with a compact solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry to study jets produced in p+p, p+A, and A+A collisions at RHIC. The location of the calorimetry in vicinity of the solenoid requires an optical readout that is compact and immune to magnetic fields. For this reason, the sPHENIX calorimetry will use a Silicon Photomultiplier(SiPM) based readout system for both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.

The number of correlated like-sign dimuons due to neutral B meson oscillation is directly related to the total number of open bottom meson pairs and thus can provide a way of constraining the open bottom contribution to the dimuon continuum in the high mass region.

How the initially locally thermalized hydro state comes into being across three dimensions involves fundamentally new QCD physics, which we can hope to diagnose via measurements spanning wide ranges of rapidity and correlations across them.  

Here we present and discuss the so-called ""Club Sandwich picture"", an inclusive framework for describing and parameterizing 3-D initial energy density profiles, not based on any particular stopping mechanism but only on the general considerations of energy and momentum conservation and causality.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dynamical freeze-out in event-by-event hydrodynamics,"Huovinen, Pasi",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"In hydrodynamical modeling of the ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions the freeze-out is typically performed at a constant temperature. In this work we introduce a dynamical freeze-out criterion, which compares the hydrodynamical expansion rate with the pion scattering rate [1]. Previous studies [2] have shown that differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria are small in the transverse momentum spectra, but the effect on flow anisotropies has not yet been studied. Recently many calculations have been done using event-by-event hydrodynamics, in which case the expansion rate does not necessarily behave as nicely as in the case of smooth initial conditions. Thus it is interesting to check how the dynamical freeze-out changes hadron distributions with respect to the constant temperature freeze-out.

In this contribution we present hadron spectra and elliptic and triangular flow calculated using (2+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics, and show the differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out criteria. First we discuss the systematics of the dynamical freeze-out, and for simplicity these calculations have been performed using smooth initial states. Finally dynamical
freeze-out condition is applied to event-by-event calculations to evaluate $v_2$ and $v_3$. We find that the differences caused by different freeze-out criteria are small in all studied cases.

The latter, able to describe lattice QCD thermodynamics, implies a ""chemical"" equilibrium ratio between quarks and gluons strongly increasing as T -> Tc, the phase transition temperature. Accordingly we see in realistic simulations of uRHIC's a rapid evolution from a gluon dominated initial state to a quark dominated plasma close to Tc. The quark to gluon ratio can be modified by about a factor of 20 in the bulk of the system and appears to be large also in the high pT region.
We discuss how this aspect, often overflown, can be essential for a quantitative study of several key issues in the QGP physics: shear viscosity, jet quenching, quarkonia suppression.

The high beam intensity and -quality of the SIS300 accelerator (SIS100 in the first step), together with a detector concept optimized for high event rate capability, allow to achieve exceptional high luminosities (reaction rates up to 10 MHz) and to study in particular rare probes.
Of particular interest are dilepton probes originating from decays of charmonium and light vector mesons, such as rho/omega -> e+ e-/ mu+ mu-. These dilepton probes do not interact hadronically with the dense medium and as such allow to probe the early, high density phase of the fireball evolution.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Influence of a realistic medium description including fluctuations on heavy quark observables,"Nahrgang, Marlene",Duke University,Unknown,"Strong jet quenching and high-pT hadron suppression as observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are striking experimental signatures for the formation of a deconfined QCD plasma, in which partons suffer from medium-induced energy loss. In particular, heavy quarks represent key probes for revealing the properties of the produced matter.

In this talk, we discuss the consequences of a realistic medium description with fluctuating initial conditions on heavy-quark observables. For this purpose, we combine our Monte-Carlo approach to heavy-quark in-medium propagation MC@sHQ [1] with the full 3+1 dimensional fluid dynamic expansion from EPOS [2]. This allows for a consistent treatment of both the heavy-quark production and the collisional and radiative processes leading to the in-medium energy loss of heavy quarks. On an event-by-event basis, we report on RAA and v2 of D and B mesons for RHIC and LHC energies and confront our results with recent experimental observations. While with a simplified medium description [3] we find a too strong quenching for LHC conditions, the discrepancy can be resolved with a medium with initial fluctuations. Moreover, in EPOS a lattice QCD equation of state is used. This allows us to study the nature of the effective degrees of freedom present in the vicinity of the crossover transition, cf. [4], because a proportion of hadronic degrees of freedom above Tc would reduce the energy loss of heavy quarks.

($1.1<M_{ll}<3.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$), di-lepton measurements serve as
a tool to extract the medium thermal radiation, which provides
direct information on the temperature of the early system.
Quantitative studies on these properties require systematic
measurements of di-lepton production yields as well as elliptic
flow as a function of invariant mass and transverse momentum
($p_T$). An extension of these studies to energy and centrality
dependent measurements offer crucial information on how the
system properties evolve with collision energies and system
sizes. The STAR experiment, with its large and full azimuthal
acceptance, clean electron identification over a wide momentum
range and low material environment, is very well suited to carry
out systematic studies on di-lepton production. In the years
2010 and 2011, more than one billion events were taken in 200
GeV Au+Au collisions and several hundred million events were
recorded at lower energies by the STAR experiment. In this
presentation, results from di-electron mass spectra as a
function of $p_T$ and centrality as well as the dependence of
elliptic flow on invariant mass in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions will
be presented. The results on mass, width, dN/dy, $p_{T}$ spectra
of $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons will be reported. The first STAR
results of di-electron mass spectra and $p_T$ distributions at
midrapidity for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 39
and 62.4 GeV will be presented. These distributions will be
compared to model calculations of in-medium vector and thermal
radiation contributions to infer medium properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Huang', 'last_name': 'Bingchu', 'fullName': 'Bingchu, Huang', 'id': '315251', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Lab', 'emailHash': '92de14bc9a8b4d1fc83e49f23f49cf32', 'db_id': 315251, 'person_id': 343791}"
Parallel 5C: High pt and Jets (Chair B. Cole),parallel,Systematic Monte-Carlo studies of dijets at the LHC and RHIC,"Coleman-Smith, Christopher",Duke Physics,USA,"Recent results from Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC have shown evidence of dramatic medium modification of di-jets. Although asymmetric di-jets are also seen in p+p collisions, di-jets with a large energy asymmetry are found much more often in Pb+Pb collisions. E.g., events with a 200 GeV leading jet and a 80 GeV subleading jet were frequently observed. The increase in the average energy asymmetry is believed to be caused by in-medium energy loss that arises from the  interaction of the colored jet constituents with the hot deconfined matter formed is the collision. The modified di-jets provide a means to study the nature of the high energy interactions of this deconfined matter. 

The observed di-jet suppression has been quantified in terms of the asymmetry A_j, the ratio of the difference between the two jet energies to their sum. It is not a priori clear that this is the observable best suited to extract information about the modification of the di-jets and the nature of their interactions with the deconfined medium. Understanding the sensitivity of di-jet observables to properties of the deconfined medium and to experimental factors is vital if they are to become a useful tool for jet tomography of hot QCD matter.

We have examined the response of the di-jet asymmetry and other di-jet observables to variations in the jet modification mechanism and to variations of the observables. We present a systematic study of di-jet suppression at RHIC and the LHC using the VNI/BMS parton cascade.  VNI/BMS is a jet+medium Monte-Carlo code which provides a controllable testbed with sufficient complexity to model jet modification without confounding results with fluctuations from hydrodynamics and hadronization.   

We consider the medium modification of the di-jet asymmetry A_j and the energy distribution within the di-jets (jet shape).  Di-jets are examined under the modification of: the jet transport coefficient qhat; the path length of leading and sub-leading jets; cuts on the jet energy distributions; jet cone angle and the jet-medium interaction mechanism and the strong coupling constant.  We find that, while the jet asymmetry and jet shape are similarly sensitive to the in-medium path length, the jet-shape is more sensitive to the nature of the interaction with the medium and the value of q-hat than the jet asymmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christopher', 'last_name': 'Coleman-Smith', 'fullName': 'Coleman-Smith, Christopher', 'id': '315252', 'affiliation': 'Duke Physics', 'emailHash': '9377909f916edd5a1f74b80da2b65873', 'db_id': 315252, 'person_id': 343792}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Thermal meson properties and chiral symmetry: recent advances.,"Gomez Nicola, Angel",Universidad Complutense Madrid,Unknown,"I will review recent and ongoing work on thermal meson properties relevant for the hadron gas regime in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions. These include transport coefficients, chemical nonequilibrium, susceptibilities, isospin breaking and different aspects on chiral symmetry restoration and the QCD transition. The basic framework is the use of Chiral Effective Lagrangians  which ensure the model independency of the low-energy and low-temperature regimes and allows to include interactions consistently. This is combined with unitarity when an accurate analytical description of particle scattering is needed, as in the case  of resonance studies, virial analysis and   transport coefficients,  for temperatures and energies where deviations from  Chiral Perturbation Theory are significant. Our scheme provides an adequate phenomenological description  for several quantities.  The shear viscosity is compatible with the KSS bound and recent data on elliptic flow, bulk viscosity correlation with the trace anomaly is established without appealing to the spectral function profile and the electrical conductivity is consistent with the low-energy photon spectrum. At the same time, this framework helps to understand theoretical aspects such as the role of scalar resonances and   degeneration of partners in chiral restoration or the effects of meson interactions in a possible window between chemical and thermal freeze-out. We will pay also  attention to the connection with lattice results, particularly in the analysis of connected and disconnected scalar susceptibilities, whose quark mass and temperature behaviour we can establish rigorously from our isospin-breaking analysis, providing then a useful benchmark for the continuum limit.

Plenary VIB: Flash Talks,other,Emission of Low Momentum Particles at Large Angles from Jet,"Tachibana, Yasuki","Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo",Unknown,"Hot and dense QCD matter, namely the quark gluon plasma, is created in high energy heavy ion collisions. High energy partons are also created through initial hard scatterings and have to traverse the QGP medium. These energetic partons are subject to lose their energy due to strong interactions with the medium. So jets in heavy ion collisions are expected to give information about the stopping power of the QGP.
While jets traverse the QGP medium, they could induce collective flow in the fluid by depositing energy and momentum. Thus the space-time evolution of the QGP fluid would be affected when jets pass through the medium. In fact, the CMS Collaboration observed a lot of low momentum hadrons at large angles from a quenched jet [1]. These low momentum hadrons are intimately related with jet energy loss since the total momentum of these hadrons together with the quenched jet balances the momentum of the other jet propagating in the opposite direction. The CMS result can be interpreted as manifestation of a wake of the QGP fluid by jet energy loss.
In this study, we construct a model to describe the dynamics of QGP fluid and jets simulta- neously. We model a source term in the relativistic hydrodynamic equations which originates from the energy and momentum deposited from traversing jets. Without linearization we solve these non-linear hydrodynamic equations numerically in fully three dimensional space and describe the dynamics of the background QGP medium.
A Mach cone like structure and a vortex ring appear behind the jet traversing a uniform medium. When a pair of jets go through a fluid expanding three dimensionally, the Mach cone like structure is distorted by radial flow. As a result, low momentum particles from the medium are preferentially emitted at large angles from the jet axis. The result exhibits the same trend as the one observed by the CMS Collaboration.

Recently we revisited the issue in Feynman gauge that resulted in a very compact and elegant expression for the suppression  factor for gluon emission off a heavy quark [1]. This generalization is valid for the full range of rapidity of the radiated gluons and also has no restriction on the scaled mass of the quark with its energy. In the appropriate limit it correctly reproduces the usual dead cone factor in the forward rapidity region [2]. On the other hand, this suppression factor becomes close to unity in the backward direction.  We then obtain the radiative energy loss of a heavy quark in a deconfined medium due to radiation of gluons off them using this derived gluon emission spectrum. We find that the heavy flavor loses energy almost in a similar fashion like light quarks through this process. This indicates a small suppression of gluon emission in the backward region, which should have an impact on the phenomenology of heavy quark energy loss in the hot and dense matter produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. An analysis of the nuclear modification factor for $D$-meson at LHC is found to be in very good agreement with the most recent data from ALICE collaboration at 2.76 ATeV Pb-Pb collisions [3].

This mature extraction technique offers an ideal way to obtain a clean and very collimated high-energy beam, without altering the performance of the LHC~\cite{Uggerhoj:2005xz,Scandale:2011zz,LUA9}. The multi-TeV LHC beams grant the most energetic fixed-target experiment ever performed, to study \pp, \pd\ and \pA\ collisions at \mbox{$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \simeq 115\,\mathrm{GeV}$} and \PbA\ collisions at \mbox{$\sqrt{s_{NN}} \simeq 72\,\mathrm{GeV}$}. AFTER -- for A Fixed-Target ExperRiment -- gives access to new domains of particle and nuclear physics complementing that of collider experiments, in particular RHIC and the projects of electron-ion colliders. The typical instantaneous luminosity achievable with AFTER in \pp\ and \pA\ mode~\cite{Brodsky:2012vg} surpasses that of RHIC by more than 3~orders of magnitude  and is comparable to that of the LHC collider mode. This provides a quarkonium and heavy-flavour observatory in \pp\ and \pA\ collisions where, by instrumenting the target-rapidity region, gluon and heavy-quark distributions of the proton, the neutron and the nuclei can be accessed at large $x$ and even at $x$ larger than unity in the nuclear case.
The nuclear target-species versatility provides a unique opportunity to study cold nuclear matter versus the features of the hot and dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, including the formation of the quark-gluon plasma. During the one-month lead runs, \PbA\ collisions can be studied at a luminosity comparable to that of RHIC and the LHC over the full range of target-rapidity domain. Modern detection technology should allow for the study of quarkonium excited states, in particular the $\chi_c$ and $\chi_b$ resonances, even in the challenging high-multiplicity environment of \pA\ and \PbA\ collisions, magnified by the boost of the fixed-target mode.
Precise data from \pp, \pA\ and \PbA\ should help to greatly improve our understanding of heavy-quark and quarkonium production, to clear the way to use them for gluon and heavy-quark PDF extraction in free and bound nucleons, to unravel cold from hot nuclear effects and to restore the status of heavy quarkonia as a golden test of lattice QCD in terms of dissociation temperature predictions at a \sqrtsNN\ where the recombination process is expected to have a small impact. The fixed-target mode also has the advantage to allow for spin measurements with polarized targets. We will discuss a tentative design for AFTER, and report the projected detector performances from the first preliminary simulations.

To minimize non-trivial biases in jet-quenching measurements by imposing kinematical constraints on the jet fragmentation and to suppress background fluctuations requires a precise description of background fluctuations down to very low momentum. In order to avoid ambiguities in the background fluctuation estimate, caused by additional hard scatterings, especially in the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at lower jet energies, we propose a statistical correction scheme: The Independent Particle Emission Model. In this approach we characterize the soft underlying heavy-ion background fluctuations in a typical jet area via a statistical convolution of multiplicity and (mean) transverse momentum pT fluctuations. In addition higher order flow harmonics (vn) will be taken properly into account. We will present simulation studies in order to estimate the precision of the Independent Particle Emission Model.

Plenary VIB: Flash Talks,other,$\omega(782)$ and $\phi(1020)$ mesons from di-leptonic decay channels at the STAR experiment,"Wada, Masayuki",University of Texas at Austin,USA,"Hadronic resonances can play a pivotal role in providing experimental
evidence for partial chiral symmetry restoration in the deconfined
quark-gluon phase produced in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.
Their lifetimes, which are comparable to the lifetime of the fireball,
make them a valuable tool to study medium modifications to the
resonant state due to the chiral phase transition signatures of mass
shifts and/or width broadenings. This can be done via the leptonic
decay of resonances with relatively small interaction of leptonic
daughter particles with dense hadronic medium, however hadronic
regeneration of resonances feeds into this signature as well.
Particle identification based on the STAR upgraded Time-of-Flight
detector in conjunction with energy-loss (dE/dx) from the Time
Projection Chamber is used for a clean electron and positron
identification.
We will present the measurement of masses, widths, transverse momentum
spectra, and yields of $\omega(782)$ and $\phi(1020)$ mesons at

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dielectron Production in Au+Au-Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =39 \& 62.4 GeV at STAR,"Huck, Patrick",CCNU/LBNL,USA,"In the years 2010/11, the Solenoidal Tracker At RHIC (STAR) conducted a Beam Energy Scan (BES) over a wide range of center-of-mass energies with the purpose of studying the properties of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) as well as searching for the onset of deconfinement and the critical point of the QCD phase diagram. The installation of the Barrel Time-Of-Flight-Detector (TOF) has enabled STAR to identify electrons over a wide momentum range. Combined with its large acceptance, excellent PID, and a low material budget in the runs of 2010/11, STAR now provides unique capabilities for the study of dielectron production in heavy ion collisions.
Due to their negligible strong interaction with the dense medium created at RHIC, leptons can escape the interaction region undistorted and thus, carry direct information about the space-time evolution of the fireball created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In the special case of dileptons, their invariant mass ($m_{ee}$) serves as an additional observable: For the BES energies, later dielectron creation times are accessible in the Low-Mass-Region (LMR, $m_{ee}<1.1 GeV/c^2$) where the in-medium vector meson properties and its implications on the dielectron yield can be measured. Earlier creation times, on the other hand, can be studied in the Intermediate-Mass-Region (IMR, $1.1<m_{ee}<3 GeV/c^2$) in which the continuum yield allows a direct measure of the effective QGP temperature. In this regard, the dependence of these observables on the collision energy is of special interest. These aspects, in particular, make dielectrons favorable as a clean penetration probe for the bulk.
The poster will present dielectron invariant mass spectra from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 39 \& 62.4 GeV and its comparisons to cocktail simulations of known hadron sources. In addition, the energy dependencies of low mass dielectron production, as well as the slope parameters of $p_T$ distributions from IMR dielectrons will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Patrick', 'last_name': 'Huck', 'fullName': 'Huck, Patrick', 'id': '315316', 'affiliation': 'CCNU/LBNL', 'emailHash': '1f9603dd0488410bd5d2a0693765f66f', 'db_id': 315316, 'person_id': 343823}"

Similar structure was also present in an inclusive un-triggered di-hadron correlation analysis [2]. We study the <p_{T}> evolution of un-triggered analysis by increasing the lower p_{T} cut of both charged particles. A smooth evolution of data is observed and our results reproduce the initial triggered analysis structure near <p_{T}> = 2.7 GeV/c. We further quantify the correlation structure evolution by fitting a model function. The model function emphasizes possible initial state fluctuation contribution via the use of higher harmonic model components; v_{n} (n=1,2,3,4) and the remainder is modeled via an asymmetric 2d Gaussian. Extracted harmonic parameters are compared to model predictions [3,4] and remainder is quantified via p+p data at #sqrt(S_{NN}) = 200GeV and charge dependent studies.

One of the motivations for building such a detector is the study of direct photons, as well as correlations including photons, pions and jets in pp,pA and AA collisions at the highest LHC energies. Such measurements will require a detector of extremely high granularity, capable of discriminating photons from neutral pions at high energies. This detector will also have unique capabilities to resolve overlapping showers in a very high-multiplicity environment.

A prototype of a sub-100 $\mu m$ pixel detector based on a silicon-tungsten layered structure was built in 2011. The active regions of the prototype consist of MIMOSA chips, having a thin active detecting element, and an undepleted silicon layer with readout electronics directly on top of it.

The main features of the femtoscopy measurements in heavy-ion collisions from SPS to RHIC and LHC are i) the increase of the correlation radii with increasing multiplicity of events and ii) the decrease of the radii with increasing pair transverse momentum/transverse mass. These are understood as a manifestation of strong collective flow.
We report the measurement of correlations of two identical kaons (neutral and charged) in pp and Pb-Pb collisions by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The increase of correlation radii for increasing multiplicity was observed both in Pb-Pb and pp collisions. The decrease of kaon radii for increasing transverse momentum was observed in Pb-Pb collisions. Similar behaviour of the radii was observed at high multiplicities in pp collisions.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Measurement of net-charge fluctuations by ALICE at the LHC,"Jena, Satyajit",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),Unknown,"Charge fluctuations are considered to provide a possible signature for the existence of the de-confined Quark Gluon Plasma phase (QGP). Charge fluctuations are sensitive to the number of charges in the system, thus the fluctuations in the QGP, with fractionally charged partons, are significantly different from those of hadron gas with unit charged particles. The study of charge fluctuations have been carried out by using the variable, ν(+−,dyn) which, by its construction, is free from the collisional bias, i.e., impact parameter fluctuations and fluctuations from the finite number of charged particles within the detector acceptance. The dependence of charge fluctuations on the rapidity windows for various centrality bins are analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN = 2.76 TeV in the ALICE experiment at CERN-LHC. Furthermore the higher moments of net-charge distribution are examined. It has been demonstrated that higher moments as well as moment products are sensitive to the correlation length and directly connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities computed in the Lattice QCD.

We observe that the dynamical fluctuations, measured in terms of ν(+−,dyn), decrease while going from peripheral to central collisions. We examine the dependence of fluctuations, using the D-measure, on the pseudorapidity interval ∆η, which may account for the dilution of fluctuations during the evolution of the system. The higher moments like mean, sigma (σ), skewness (S), kurtosis (K) and the quantities like Sσ and Kσ2 of net-charge are estimated as a function of centrality. The experimental values are compared to the theoretical expectations for a hadron gas and a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).

Poster Session Reception,poster,Study of the production of B-decay electrons at high momentum in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV using secondary vertex reconstruction in ALICE,"Aronsson, Tomas",Yale University (US),USA,"High-energy heavy-ion collisions at the LHC allow for the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks, charm and bottom, produced in the initial hard scattering processes of the collision are excellent probes of the QGP.
When heavy quarks traverse the QGP they are expected to lose energy and such energy loss is predicted to be smaller than for gluons and light quarks. On the other hand, recent experimental data indicate larger energy loss than expected. Heavy flavour production can be studied using electrons from semi-leptonic decays of D and B mesons. The separation of electrons from these two sources (charm and bottom) is of crucial importance to address the expected mass dependence of energy loss. In this poster, we present the measurement of electrons from bottom in the transverse momentum range of 7-12 GeV in 7 TeV p-p collisions. The ALICE EMCal detector possesses outstanding particle identification for electrons at high pT. Two-track secondary vertices with these electrons and surrounding charged tracks are reconstructed, exploiting the tracking precision provided by the Inner Tracking System, and are used to select displaced decay vertices of B mesons.

Poster Session Reception,poster,D*-hadron azimuthal correlations in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =7 TeV$ with ALICE,"Bjelogrlic, Sandro",University of Utrecht (NL),Netherlands,"Due to their relatively high mass, heavy-flavour quarks, produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are sensitive probes of the interaction dynamics inside the hot and dense QCD matter. 
Since heavy quarks are produced in pairs during the initial stage of the collision, before the formation of the QGP, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadron production provides profound information on the properties of the produced medium. A detailed understanding of the pair production mechanisms in proton-proton collisions is interesting both as a QCD test tool as well as a reference for future heavy-ion studies. 
This particular physical process can be investigated using the angular azimuthal correlation between open-charmed mesons and charged hadrons. This correlation exhibits characteristic near-side and away-side structures that are produced by the charged hadrons from the fragmentation and decay of the partner charmed meson. The azimuthal direction is expected to be sensitive to the heavy quark production mechanism and can be compared to the perturbative QCD calculations. 
D mesons are reconstructed in several hadronic channels in the ALICE experiment at the LHC. Using $D*^{\pm}$  mesons is advantageous because they can be selected with higher purity with respect to D0 and $D^{+}$. Correlating with kaons (identified $K^{\pm}$  or reconstructed $K0_{S}$) that are produced with high probability in charm decays, provides a reduction of the background in the correlation distribution.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Pion-Kaon Femtoscopy at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV collisions in STAR at RHIC,"Yang, Yan",Ohio State University,USA,"Correlations between non-identical particles at low relative momentum
in the center of mass ($|\vec{k}^*|$) encode unique information on the
space-time structure of the emitting system. In addition to size of
the homogeneity region, analysis of correlation functions in the three-
dimensional $\vec{k}^*$ space can reveal a space-time offset of one
particle species (e.g. kaons) with respect to another (e.g. pions). Early
results from STAR at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 130 GeV showed such an
asymmetry, which was consistent with collective radial flow.  This early
analysis was hampered by the limited particle identification capabilities
of the STAR Time Projection Chamber, as well as from marginal statistics
and photon conversion due to a significant material budget close to the beam.
In year 2010 and year 2011, STAR had accumulated more than one billion
minimum bias events at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions
with full Time of Flight detector in operation, which enables detailed
non-identical femtoscopy measurements.

We present new measurements of pion-kaon correlations in the more
sensitive spherical harmonic decomposition representation at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV collisions from these data sets with a lower
material budget and much higher statistics. The analysis greatly benefits
when information from the STAR Time of Flight detector is used to
extend particle identification capabilities. Centrality dependence of
pion-kaon femtoscopy in Au+Au collisions will be presented for the
first time. Finally, we present a first similar analysis of p+p collisions
at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yan', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Yan', 'id': '315365', 'affiliation': 'Ohio State University', 'emailHash': '7be7c6440ab91f5ebd6d26b34c97ef3a', 'db_id': 315365, 'person_id': 343851}"

For the first time, a long-range correlation structure up to |delta-eta|~4 at small delta-phi (near side) is observed for such very high-pT (e.g., pT~20 GeV/c) trigger particles correlated with low-pT (a few GeV/c) associated particles. The observed long-range correlations in |delta-eta| on the near side are consistent with the single-particle azimuthal anisotropy (characterized by the Fourier harmonics, vn) of high-pT trigger particles measured relative to the event-plane angle determined with the forward hadronic calorimeters. After subtracting the vn harmonics component, the shape and yield on the near (|delta-phi| < 1) and away (|delta-phi| > 1) side of the residual dihadron correlations have been studied systematically over a wide kinematic range in trigger (12 < pT[trig] < 50 GeV/c) and associated ( 0.5 GeV/c < pT[assoc] < pT[trig]) particle pT, as a function of pseudorapidity and collision centrality.

Poster Session Reception,poster,Dijet asymmetry A_J within a partonic Boltzmann transport model,"Senzel, Florian",Goethe-Universität Frankfurt,Unknown,"Recent experimental data measured in \sqrt{s}=2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by ATLAS and CMS showed a significant imbalance in the transverse momenta of the two reconstructed jets with the highest transverse momenta. This momentum imbalance is assumed to be caused by the different energy and momentum loss of the di-jets by scatterings within the created medium. To investigate this momentum loss we extended the transport model BAMPS which solves the full 3+1D Boltzmann equation for partons based on pQCD cross sections. One feature of BAMPS is the stochastic modeling of 2 -> 2 as well as 2 <-> 3 scattering processes. We show that the simulations of the momentum imbalance A_J of full reconstructed jets within BAMPS are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Due to the available particle information in configuration as well as momentum space within such a transport model, it is possible to reproduce the entire evolution of the reconstructed jets within the medium and gain a deeper understanding of the emerging jet shapes. With this information we explain the momentum imbalance of di-jets by different in-medium path lengths and thus different energy and momentum loss at parton-level.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Senzel', 'fullName': 'Senzel, Florian', 'id': '315392', 'affiliation': 'Goethe-Universität Frankfurt', 'emailHash': 'a8e39f3c122d849535a618c46a5e4d92', 'db_id': 315392, 'person_id': 343871}"

Fourier components of the anisotropic azimuthal distribution, ranging from the third to the sixth component, are obtained using four different analysis techniques: event plane, two- and four-particle correlations, and Lee-Yang Zeros. The results are reported as a function of the particle transverse momentum (pT) for pT = 0.5 - 20 GeV/c and collision centrality. The long-range azimuthal dihadron correlations are extensively studied with a Fourier-decomposition analysis. Using a data driven method, the extracted Fourier coefficients (up to the fifth order) are found to factorize into a product of single-particle azimuthal anisotropies up to pT~3-3.5 GeV/c for at least one particle from each pair, except for the second-order harmonics in the most central PbPb events. Based on the factorization studies, the implications of flow and non-flow effects in the long-range correlations are discussed.

By utilizing the broad coverage of the CMS foward calorimetry, contamination from back-to-back dijets is suppressed. The results presented in this talk significantly improve on the statistical precision of previous v2 measurements for pT> 12 GeV/c, and explore for the first time the harmonic components of the azimuthal dependence in the very high pT region beyond 20 GeV/c. Beyond pT>10 GeV/c, the observed v2 values show a moderate decrease with pT, being consistent with zero only above pT~40 GeV/c and for mid-central (30-60%) collisions. A common trend in the centrality dependence of v2 is observed for particles over a wide range of pT up to approximately 48 GeV/c that is independent of pseudorapditiy, suggesting a potential connection to the initial geometry.

One of the most important observables from high-energy nuclear collisions to study the early evolution of the expanding system is the elliptic flow $v_{2}$. At the top RHIC energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is interpreted as a signature of deconfinement and the formation of the QGP phase. A disappearance of the NCQ scaling is expected for a pure hadronic system at low beam energies. Hence it is a necessary signature to identify the phase transition.

We present the $v_2$ measurement at midrapidity from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 62.4 GeV for inclusive charged hadrons, light nuclei ($d$, $\bar{d}$) and identified hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $K_{S}^{0}$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$) up to 4 GeV/$c$ in $p_{T}$. The beam energy and centrality dependence of charged hadron $v_2$ are presented with comparison to higher energies at RHIC and LHC. The identified hadron $v_{2}$ are used to discuss the NCQ scaling for different beam energies. Significant difference in $v_{2}(p_{T})$ is observed between particles and corresponding anti-particles for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} <$ 39 GeV. These differences are more pronounced for baryons compared to mesons and they increase with decreasing energy and increasing centrality.

Their small final-state interaction cross sections, let dileptons
escape the interaction region undistorted. Since dileptons originate
from all stages of a heavy ion reaction, their sources vary with the
kinematic phase space under consideration: In the low mass region (LMR:
mass<1.1GeV/$c^{2}$), vector mesons and direct photons are the
dominating source, while dileptons in the intermediate mass region
(IMR:1.1<mass<3GeV/$c^{2}$) primarily stem from QGP thermal radiation
at RHIC energy and semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. In the high
mass region (HMR: mass>3 GeV/$c^{2}$), heavy quark decays and Drell-Yan
processes contribute the most to the dilepton spectrum. Due to the
time-energy correlation, the higher the dilepton pair mass, the earlier
the production. Therefore the dilepton distributions, especially in the

Poster Session Reception,poster,Silicon pixel and strip detector development for the upgrade of the ALICE Inner Tracking System,"Contin, Giacomo",Universita e INFN (IT),United States,"The main physics motivation for the upgrade of the Inner Tracking System of the ALICE experiment is to perform new measurements on charm and beauty production in heavy-ion collisions, dealing with the challenge of expected Pb-Pb interaction rates of up to 50 kHz. For this purpose, a new silicon tracker is needed with greatly improved features in terms of determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, standalone tracking efficiency at low transverse momentum, momentum resolution and readout rate capabilities.
The ITS upgrade foresees to replace the present ITS detector with a new seven layer silicon vertex detector. Two layouts are being considered: Layout 1 foresees to equip all layers with monolithic silicon pixel detectors; Layout 2 will consist of 3 layers of hybrid silicon pixel detectors and 4 layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors. For the innermost layers, there is a strong effort to decrease the pixel dimensions to about 20-30 um in the bending direction and equivalently in the beam direction and to reduce the material budget from 1.1% to 0.3% of X0, by using monolithic pixel detectors or hybrid pixel detectors with thinned chip and sensor, and minimizing the contribution coming from supports and services. The different types of monolithic pixel detectors under consideration for the ALICE ITS upgrade are: the rolling shutter, low power, architecture of the MIMOSA26 and ULTIMATE sensors, moved to a 0.18 um technology node; the INMAPS prototype, an in-pixel hit discrimination CMOS sensor based on a deep p-well extension of a triple-well 0.18 um CMOS; the LePIX development, a drift-based monolithic sensor in very deep submicron CMOS. The expected radiation levels for the innermost layer (685 krad TID, 10^13 neq per year) will require a careful validation of the different technologies in terms of radiation resistance. On the outermost layers the needed granularity and pointing resolution can be ensured by a strip detector geometry with a small cell size (95 um strip pitch, 22 mm strip length) and a small strip inclination with respect to the beam direction. The information on the signal amplitude will be preserved for the strip sensors for particle identification purposes. The strip readout chip will incorporate a low power ADC with 10 bits resolution. 
The present status of the technology development for the considered options will be reported.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Giacomo', 'last_name': 'Contin', 'fullName': 'Contin, Giacomo', 'id': '315414', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': '0ddd57aec6f5d3a7a5a174fc9a9d7eed', 'db_id': 315414, 'person_id': 343885}"
Poster Session Reception,poster,Strong Color Fields in Nuclei from Fits to Nuclear Parton Distributions,"Ozonder, Sener",University of Minnesota,USA,"We consider a modified version of the McLerran-Venugopalan model where the thickness of the nucleus is finite and infrared divergences are removed by the color neutrality condition. The strong coupling constant and the nucleon size are treated as parameters. To determine these parameters, the x-dependent gluon distribution function is calculated at very low momentum, which is the region of validity of this model. The resulting distribution function is evolved with the DGLAP equation to higher momenta by using the QCDNUM package and compared with data as parametrized by nuclear CTEQ. This allows us to infer the parameters, and hence to calculate the classical color fields representing the initial conditions in high energy heavy-ion collisions without any free parameters.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sener', 'last_name': 'Ozonder', 'fullName': 'Ozonder, Sener', 'id': '315415', 'affiliation': 'University of Minnesota', 'emailHash': 'ada87f3db03365faad277d55b91f928e', 'db_id': 315415, 'person_id': 343886}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Di-electron Measurements in $p+p$ collisions by PHENIX using the Hadron Blind Detector,"Sharma, Deepali",S,United States,"Di-electrons are among the most promising probes for studying the
early, hot and dense stages created in relativistic heavy-ion
collisions.  They are color neutral and so interact only
electromagnetically, thus carrying to the detectors information about
the conditions and properties of the medium at the time of their
creation. The di-electrons are emitted over the the entire space-time
evolution of the collision and their spectrum thus carries a wealth of
information.

PHENIX has measured a large, unexpected enhancement in $Au+Au$ collisions
in the low mass region ( 0.2 - 0.8 GeV/c$^2$ ), with respect to the baseline
cocktail scaled from $p+p$ collisions.  However, this result suffers from
a large systematic uncertainty due to the huge combinatorial
background of uncorrelated pairs from partially reconstructed $\pi^0$
Dalitz decays and $\gamma$ conversions.

To combat this challenge, PHENIX installed a hadron blind detector
( HBD ) for the 2009 and 2010 RHIC runs.  Its purpose is to tag and
reject the combinatorial background coming from these decays.  A
reliable analysis of the 2010 $Au+Au$ data hinges on a complete
understanding of the HBD and its unique characteristics. The 2009
$p+p$ run serves as a crucial testing ground for understanding the
systematics associated with this novel detector. The
proof-of-principle obtained in the $p+p$ HBD analysis will be
presented in this poster.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deepali', 'last_name': 'Sharma', 'fullName': 'Sharma, Deepali', 'id': '315419', 'affiliation': 'S', 'emailHash': 'e7d5b79078d715fe9231bfb9e42fd4bb', 'db_id': 315419, 'person_id': 343889}"
Parallel 7B: Exploring the QCD Phase Diagram (Chair H. Huang),parallel,Search for the QCD Critical Point by Higher Moments of Net-proton Multiplicity Distributions at STAR,"Luo, Xiaofeng",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"One of the main goals of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program is to search for the QCD Critical Point and the phase boundary in the QCD phase diagram. Higher moments of event-by-event net-proton multiplicity distributions have high sensitivity to the correlation length[1], and they are directly connected to the susceptibilities in the Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) calculations and the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model. Therefore, they are ideal tools to search for the QCD critical point[4]

In this talk, we will present various moments (variance [σ^2], skewness[S] and kurtosis [κ], moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants (ω3 and ω4) of net-proton and total-proton multiplicity distributions measured by the STAR detector at RHIC. The moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants are related to the volume independent susceptibility ratios. The data presented in this talk will include the measurements of centrality dependence for the net-protons and total-protons from Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. These results have been compared with a Poisson baseline. It is observed that the moment products (κσ^2, Sσ) and intensive normalized cumulants of net-proton distributions in the 0-5% most central Au+Au collisions show significant deviations from the Poisson expectations around √sNN = 19.6 GeV. Those results will be also compared with UrQMD model calculations.

The spectra will be compared to QCD-inspired models such as PYTHIA and PHOJET, which in general underpredict the experimental results on the yields of strange resonances. The ratios of yields of baryonic resonances to stable particles, namely $\Sigmastar / \Lambda$, $\Lambdastar / \Lambda$ and $\Xistar / \Xi$ will be compared with both thermal models and corresponding values from previous experiments at different colliding energies.

In contrast, some recent studies suggest that the static quark antiquark potential for describing bound quarkonia should include an imaginary part. This shows a ﬁnite life time of the bound state in the medium and initiate a quest for dynamical picture of the dissociation. The dynamical picture becomes more relevant when the medium is expanding and cooling down rapidly, as in the case of heavy ion collision. A possible general framework for this dynamics is to view the quarkonia as an open system. We have designed a novel approach, based on the wave function, to address the real time dynamics of heavy quarkonia in medium (thermally equilibrated or not) produced in heavy ion collision.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nirupam', 'last_name': 'Dutta', 'fullName': 'Dutta, Nirupam', 'id': '315439', 'affiliation': 'Doctoral Student, Bielefeld University', 'emailHash': '12fc64da7d3bb98f4db978756e9e3a63', 'db_id': 315439, 'person_id': 343899}"

Poster Session Reception,poster,Non-linear QCD dynamics in photon-photon interactions at high energies,"Cazaroto, Erike",University of Sao Paulo,Unknown,"At high energies the amount of gluons in a hadron is much larger than the amount of any other constituent, for example it is much larger than the amount of sea quarks. Therefore, at high energies the hadronic cross sections are basically a function only of the gluons distribution. The color dipole formalism applied to photon-photon collisions implies that, before interacting, each of the photons fluctuates in a pair quark-antiquark with a certain probability. The pair is colorless and it is also called Color Dipole. In a first approximation we can treat one of the pairs quark-antiquark as if it was a hadron and we can apply the evolution equations of QCD to determine its gluons distribution. Then the photon-photon cross section can be factorized as a product of two terms. The first one is the probabilities for each photon fluctuate in a color dipole and the second term is the dipole-hadron cross section. In order to determine the dipole-hadron scattering amplitude we used non-linear QCD dynamics. The non-linearity of the evolution equations implies that the gluons distribution inside the hadron saturates when a given kinematic regime is reached. The scale separating the saturation regime of the linear one is called Saturation Scale. When the saturation regime is reached it is expected that the gluons distribution form a new state of matter, the called Color Glass Condensate (CGC). The search for the CGC is still going on and it is expected that LHC, as well as the future eRHIC, will give us a definitive answer of its existence. In this work we applied the CGC approach to photon-photon collisions through the color dipole formalism. We calculated cross sections to photon-photon scattering and calculated structure functions of virtual and real photons. We proposed a new model to the dipole-dipole cross section and compared our results with a model available in the literature. Our calculations can be considered as predictions to observables that will be measured in a future linear collider.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Erike', 'last_name': 'Cazaroto', 'fullName': 'Cazaroto, Erike', 'id': '315449', 'affiliation': 'University of Sao Paulo', 'emailHash': '08fe605ba41f6a194ed7c09f5d82c71d', 'db_id': 315449, 'person_id': 343907}"
