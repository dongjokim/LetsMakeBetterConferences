Poster session,poster,Dielectron elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE experiment,"Yang, Hongyan",University of Utrecht (NL),Netherlands,"Correlated unlike sign dielectrons provide important and relatively clean information to access the properties of the hot and dense matter, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Once they are produced, they traverse the fireball without interacting strongly with the medium. The collective behaviour of the dielectrons with respect to a global event plane provides rich information of the initial stage of the expanding fireball where flow starts developing. 

In the central barrel ($|\eta|<0.8$) of the ALICE experiment, electrons (and positrons) can be detected and identified by the Inner Tracking System, the Time Projection Chamber and the Time-Of-Flight. For the study of the dielectron elliptic flow at mid-rapidity, the VZERO scintillators at forward rapidity are used for event plane estimation to avoid auto-correlations.

In this poster, a first attempt to measure the elliptic flow of dielectrons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV with the ALICE experiment is presented. An effort is put into removing the background $v_2$ from uncorrelated unlike sign dielectrons with the mixed-event approach. A comparison to the elliptic flow of identified particles measured in the same system, as well as measurements from experiments at RHIC will be discussed. This work is expected to be the first step towards the measurement of the elliptic flow of thermal photons radiated from the fireball, which is regarded as a unique probe to study the formation time of the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hongyan', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Hongyan', 'id': '1729114', 'affiliation': 'University of Utrecht (NL)', 'emailHash': 'cb75be569bd0ea09d7bd1dac67f71c4d', 'db_id': 1729114, 'person_id': 1868191}"

The method relies on astro-seismology based on special global oscillation modes (r-modes) that emit gravitational waves. They would prevent pulsars from spinning with their observed high frequencies, unless the damping of these modes, determined by the microscopic properties of matter, can prevent this. We show that for each form of matter there is a distinct region in a frequency/spindown-rate diagram where r-modes can be present.

High $p_{\rm T}$ neutral mesons are used to study the modifications of partons in the medium that is created in heavy-ion collisions. In pp and p-Pb collisions, they can be used to study fragmentation functions, and modification of nuclear PDFs in the lead nucleus, respectively.

The measurement of high $p_{\rm T}$ neutral mesons is challenging due to various reasons. First, they are a rare probe that requires the use of triggers to collect sufficient statistics for the measurement. Furthermore, the opening angle of the decay photon decreases with increasing transverse momentum and their electromagnetic showers in the detector showers in the detector have a higher probability to overlap.

imaginary-part too becomes larger and thus contribute
more to the thermal width, compared to the in-medium correction of the Coulomb term alone. With these cumulative observations, we studied the dissociation where a resonance is said to be dissolved in a medium when its binding energy decreases with temperature and eventually becomes equal to its width and have found that the bound states are now dissociated at higher
temperature, in the absence of nonperturbative term. 
Finally we extend our calculation to a medium which exhibits 
a local momentum anisotropy and calculate both the real- and imaginary-part of potential, by the leading anisotropic corrections to the propagators. The presence of anisotropy makes the real-part of the potential more stronger while the imaginary-part is weakened slightly and hence width of
a particular resonance becomes narrower, compared to
an isotropic medium. However, since the temperature
corrections to the imaginary-part is a small perturbation to the
vacuum part, so overall the anisotropy makes the dissociation

Poster session,poster,Chemical Freeze-out Irregularities and  Quark Gluon Bags Formation,"Oliinychenko, Dmytro","Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Frankfurt, Germany",Unknown,"We made  a thorough analysis of  the hadron resonance gas model
for  the Breit-Wigner and for the Gauss resonance width parameterizations [1]. 
The latter  model allows us to treat the usual hadrons and  the quark gluon  bags on the same footing and to study the stability of the results obtained within different formulations of the hadron resonance gas model.  
Three versions of this model are fitted to reproduce  111 independent hadronic multiplicity ratios measured 
for 14 values of the center of mass collision  energies in the interval $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 2.7--200 GeV. We  found 
 that  in a narrow range of  collision energy $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 4.3--4.9 GeV  there exist the peculiar   irregularities in various thermodynamic quantities calculated at chemical  freeze-out.  The most remarkable irregularity  is   an unprecedented    jump of the number of effective degrees of freedom observed in this narrow energy range which is seen in all realistic versions of the hadron resonance gas model.
 Thus, the ratio of the freeze-out  entropy density to the cube of  its temperature and 
 the ratio of the freeze-out  pressure to its temperature to the fourth are, respectively, increased   in 1.67 and 1.5 times, while the center of mass collision energy  changes on  about 14 \% (see figure below). 
 We are arguing that these irregularities evidence for the  formation 
of quark gluon  bags.  To understand  such irregularities  we study 
the apparent width of wide hadronic  resonances and quark gluon  bags in a thermal medium. 
We discuss
two new effects  generated  for  the 
wide resonances  and quark gluon  bags  by a thermal medium near the threshold of decay: 
their thermal  enhancement and 
their  thermal  sharpening. 
We argue  that the most optimistic chance to experimentally  find    the quark gluon bags   may be related to their sharpening and enhancement  in  a thermal medium.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Emission angle and particle mass dependence of HBT Interferometry in  Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV,"Esumi, Shinichi",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"The initial density distribution in a heavy ion collision fluctuates
due to the finite number of participating nucleons, which leads to
higher harmonic flow as recently measured at RHIC and the LHC.  Such
spatial fluctuations may be preserved until kinetic freeze-out,
depending on the strength of the initial fluctuations, the flow
profile, the expansion time, and viscosity of the created matter.

Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is a powerful tool to
study the space-time extent of a particle emitting source in heavy ion
collisions. PHENIX has measured the azimuthal angle dependence of HBT
radii with respect to the 2\textsuperscript{nd} and
3\textsuperscript{rd}-order event planes in Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$~GeV.

The results for the 2\textsuperscript{nd}-order dependence indicate
that the initial eccentricity is reduced during the medium evolution,
but not reversed in the final state, which is consistent with previous
results. In contrast, the results for the 3\textsuperscript{rd}-order
dependence indicate that the initial triangular shape is signicantly
reduced and potentially reversed by the end of the medium evolution,
and that the 3\textsuperscript{rd}-order oscillations are largely
dominated by the dynamical effects from triangular flow.  The
measurement of the HBT radii from different particle correlations such
as charged kaons over the wide $m_T$ ranges give deeper insight on the
emission source dynamics.  We will report and discuss these new
comprehensive HBT measurement in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}

Poster session,poster,Elucidating the event-by-event flow fluctuations in heavy ion collisions via the event-shape selection and twisting techniques,"Huo, Peng",Stony Brook University,USA,"Recent discovery of significant higher-order flow harmonics and theoretical study of the non-linear hydrodynamics have led to the realization of a large set of new event-by-event (EbyE) flow observables that can be measured in heavy-ion collisions. These observables can be expressed generally as a joint probability distribution of flow coefficients $v_n$ and their phases $\Phi_n$, $p(v_n, v_m, ..., \Phi_n,\Phi_m....)$. Initial measurements of a small subset of these flow observables, namely $p(v_n)$ and event-plane correlations $p(\Phi_n,\Phi_m....)$ at LHC, have already provided new insights on the geometry fluctuations in the initial state and the non-linear hydrodynamics in the final state. In a recent work, we propose an experimental method to further probe other flow observables based on the recently proposed event-shape selection technique a new event-shape twisting technique. In the first method (arXiv:1311.7091), events in fixed centrality are further divided in bins of $v_n$ values in the forward pseudorapidity ($\eta_F$). This allows us to measure how the $v_m$ and event-plane correlation respond to the change in $v_n$, which provide access to two classes of observables not studied before: $p(v_n, v_m)$ and $p(v_n, \Phi_n,\Phi_m....)$. Furthermore our method also allows a quantitative study of the correlation of $v_n$ in different rapidity: $p(v_n(\eta_F),v_n(\eta))$. The robustness of this method is demonstrated using the AMPT model, which is known to describe reasonably the centrality dependence of $v_n$ and event-plane correlations. Strong positive correlations are observed among all even harmonics v2, v4, and v6, between v2 and v5 and between v3 and v5, consistent with the effects of non-linear hydrodynamic response, while a significant anti-correlation is observed between v2 and v3. The $v_n(\eta)$ for events selected on $v_n(\eta_F)$ shows a significant forward/backward asymmetry, which indicates the de-correlation of event planes over pseudorapidity. In the second method (paper to be submitted), a twist angle between the event planes in the forward and backward rapidity is enforced by cutting on $\Delta\Phi = \Phi_n(\eta_F)-\Phi_n(\eta_B)$. This twisting procedure leads to a non-zero $\eta$-dependence $<\sin(n(\phi-\Psi_n))>$ component in between, which can be used to calculate the event plane angle as a function of $\eta$. This allows us to distinguish between two competing mechanisms for the rapidity de-correlation: a systematic rotation versus a random fluctuation of event plane angles along the $\eta$ direction. Indeed, a significant fraction of the observed rapidity de-correlation in the AMPT model is found to arise from a systematic rotation of event plane angles along the $\eta$ direction. Our studies show that the event-shape selection and event-shape twisting techniques promise to provide unprecedented details on the EbyE flow fluctuations. The prospects of applying these techniques to Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC and LHC are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peng', 'last_name': 'Huo', 'fullName': 'Huo, Peng', 'id': '1728185', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': 'aaea26f14f5a4cfc1337ebed5b4107fe', 'db_id': 1728185, 'person_id': 1867461}"

We calculated the photon rate in the semi-QGP and found indeed a suppression of the photon rate due to non-trivial Polyakov loop, as compared to standard thermal perturbative results. We also calculated dilepton rate in the same semi-QGP. On the contrary, we found non-trivial Polyakov loop enhances the dilepton rate.

However, a perturbative computation of various QCD characteristics requires Faddeev-Popov ghosts to cancel  unphysical degrees of freedom which are present in a wide class of covariant gauges. The question thus arises how to introduce the ghosts for non-equilibrium QCD. Using the functional methods, we derive a relation analogous to the Slavnov-Taylor identity which expresses the ghost propagator of the Keldysh-Schwinger formalism through the gluon one. Then we show that the ghost propagator obtained in this way allows one to construct a gauge invariant perturbative expansion of various characteristics of non-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alina', 'last_name': 'Czajka', 'fullName': 'Czajka, Alina', 'id': '1728232', 'affiliation': 'Jan Kochanowski University', 'emailHash': '259d71ff88582e3e85c4ef97559fe3a2', 'db_id': 1728232, 'person_id': 1867504}"

However, the broad variety of their sources requires models that can describe the complete nuclear reaction properly. For this, transport approaches (e.g. the UrQMD model) are frequently used, as they yield a realistic microscopic description of the collision dynamics. However, such microscopic models usually do not include any in-medium effects and are limited to hadronic degrees of freedom. We therefore present an alternative approach that uses coarse-grained output from transport calculations to extract local thermodynamic properties and determine thermal dilepton emission rates. The approach has the advantage that it can cover all collision energies and the whole space-time evolution in a unified description. To account for the medium effects on the $\rho$ meson we apply and contrast the spectral function by Eletsky et al., which is obtained from empirical scattering amplitudes, and the many-body calculation by Rapp et al.

temperature and moderately high density is particularly challenging for
theorists. The phase structure in that region is determined by
competition between Cooper pairing (driven by attractive strong
interactions) and the strange quark mass (which is a source of flavor
asymmetry, separating the Fermi momenta of the three quark flavors).
There are various proposed outcomes of this competition, including
crystalline (""LOFF"") condensates and deformed Fermi surfaces. We argue
that a condensate of Cooper quartets rather than pairs is a strong
candidate for the ground state. The quartet is favored by the same QCD
attraction that drives Cooper pairing, but with four quarks rather than
two it is easier to construct a translationally invariant condensate
that includes different flavors without paying an energy penalty due to
the flavor asymmetry. This concept is also applicable to other systems
of fermions with flavor asymmetry, including ultracold atoms and nuclear
matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andreas', 'last_name': 'Windisch', 'fullName': 'Windisch, Andreas', 'id': '1728199', 'affiliation': 'University of Graz', 'emailHash': '331a128bf108f047cf4152a5001f6792', 'db_id': 1728199, 'person_id': 1867475}"

the higher order cumulants can reveal remnants of the $O(4)$ criticality
at  the chiral crossover [2].

We will discuss  criticality in the probability distribution  of
conserved charges close to the chiral transition.
We calculate  the probability distribution of the net baryon number
$P(N_B)$ in the  chiral quark-meson model within  the functional renormalization
group method, and compare its properties to  the non-critical
Skellam function [3,4].

We will show, that the ratio of $P(N_B)$ to the Skellam distribution
exhibits a characteristic narrowing which is due to  remnants of the $O(4)$   chiral transition [4].

We will apply the
above analysis  to the experimental data measured by  STAR
collaboration,  and  show  that  STAR data taken at the most central events
exhibit a similar narrowing  as found in  the model calculations [4]. 
 
We will  indicate  a  relevant reference distribution for the net electric charge fluctuations. We show that the binomial and negative binomial
distribution cannot account for the characteristic behavior seen in
the chiral transition, and that  due to quantum  statistics and multi-charged
particle contribution,   the Skellam distribution is also  not a correct baseline for the  recent STAR data on fluctuations of the electric charge [4].

Poster session,poster,Master equations of quarkonia in the Lindblad form,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Nagoya University,United States,"Understanding the quantum dynamics of quarkonia is essential in the description of bottomonia and charmonia in the quark-gluon plasma. So far, it has been quite naively assumed that their dynamics can be described by the Schrödinger equation with in-medium, screened potential. Such a naïve approach is not correct anymore, in particular if one wants to study their time-evolution. After the discovery of imaginary part in the in-medium potential [1], it must be recognized that quarkoia should be viewed as open quantum systems in the environment of quark-gluon plasma [2].

In the open quantum system, master equation instead of the Schrödinger equation describes the quantum dynamics of quarkonia. Open quantum system techniques, such as influence functional approach, have been applied to quarkonia [3]. In this presentation, I will summarize developments in this approach and show an additional step toward a more complete description. In particular, I will show how to obtain the Lindblad-form master equation, which preserves the complete positivity of the density matrix of the system [4].

Heavy  quarks (charm and beauty) are an effective probe to investigate  the properties of the QGP. They are produced almost exclusively  in the initial partonic scattering processes and they interact  strongly with the surrounding matter throughout its evolution.  Moreoever, the in-medium parton energy loss is expected to depend  both on the parton mass and its colour charge making  flavour-separated measurements of charm and beauty useful to test  models of in-medium energy loss.

Experimentally one way to measure heavy quarks is via electrons  from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. The comparison  of the $p_{\rm T}$  spectra of heavy-flavour decay electrons  in pp and Pb-Pb collisions gives insight into the energy loss of  heavy quarks in the QGP. To achieve a flavour-separated  measurement of heavy-flavour decay electrons, first the electrons  have to be identified. This is done using the excellent particle  identification capabilities of ALICE. In addition the electrons  have to be separated according to their source (e.g. charm and  beauty hadron decays, $\pi^{0}$  Dalitz decays, photon  conversion etc.). This separation is done statistically using the  impact parameter of the electrons. The latter is typically larger  for electrons from hadrons containing a beauty quark due to the  larger mean proper decay length ($c\tau\approx500 \mu \mathrm{m}$)  of these hadrons compared to other hadrons decaying into  electrons.

Poster session,poster,Observation of the charm baryon $\Lambda_{c}$ with ALICE at the LHC and perspectives for future measurements with the ALICE upgrade,"Romita, Rosa",University of Liverpool (GB),UK,"ALICE is the LHC experiment dedicated to the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in Pb-Pb collisions. Heavy quarks are very powerful probes to explore the QGP formation and its properties, since they are abundantly produced at LHC energies and they experience the entire evolution of the medium.
The measurement of the $\Lambda_{c}$ yield relative to D mesons in Pb-Pb collisions would address the baryon over meson ratio in the heavy-quark sector. In pp and p-Pb collisions, the measurement of the $\Lambda_{c}$ production cross-section provides the necessary baseline to understand the results from heavy-ion collisions and improves the precision of the measurement of the total charm cross section. 
This baryon is observed with the present detector in pp and p-Pb collisions in the decay channel $\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow {\rm p K}^{-} \pi^{+}$.
Given the small displacement of the $\Lambda_{c}$ secondary vertex from the interaction vertex ($\Lambda_{c}$ mean proper decay length c$\tau$ = 60 $\mu$m), the charm baryon is reconstructed using mainly kinematical selections and exploiting the ALICE particle identification capabilities. 
However, the observation of $\Lambda_{c}$ in Pb-Pb collisions is very challenging with the present detector, because of the large combinatorial background and because the mean proper decay length of the $\Lambda_{c}$ is smaller than the present vertex resolution for the $\Lambda_{c}$ decay, reconstructed from the three daughter tracks. An upgrade of the ALICE detector, including a new Inner Tracking System (ITS) is scheduled for the second long shutdown of the LHC. The new ALICE apparatus will provide improved resolution on the track impact parameter (by about a factor of 3) and will allow us to record data with higher rate. These new features will enable us to measure rare probes in Pb-Pb collisions, such as the $\Lambda_{c}$. Simulation studies, based on a detailed description of the new
ITS, indicate that the measurements of the $\Lambda_{c}$ nuclear modification factor and
azimuthal anisotropy will become possible with the integrated luminosity of
10 nb$^{-1}$, which is the target of the ALICE programme after the upgrade.

This results in a reduction of beauty-quark energy loss compared to charm-quark energy loss. Therefore the separate study of charm and beauty production allows us to test theoretical predictions.

The analysis of D-meson production in p-Pb collisions can provide information on how much the heavy-flavour production in nuclear collisions is influenced by cold nuclear matter effects, such as the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions and initial-state multiple scatterings. 

The magnitude of cold nuclear matter effects can be investigated by means of the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm pPb}$. It is defined as the ratio between the D-meson yield in p-Pb and the yield in pp scaled by the average number of binary collisions. The ALICE Collaboration measured the ${\rm D^{\ast +}}$ multiplicity-integrated $R_{\rm pPb}$ in the central rapidity region in the momentum range $1 < p_{\rm T} < 24$ GeV/$c$, which was found to be compatible with unity and with model calculations including initial state effects. The study of the same observable in different multiplicity intervals provides insight into the dependence of cold nuclear matter effects on the geometry of the collision. However, in p-Pb collisions the connection between the collision geometry and the observed multiplicity through a Glauber approach has proven to be very challenging. Different multiplicity estimators are used to investigate this connection.

This indicates that charm and beauty quarks interact significantly, losing energy, with the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions. The study of azimuthal correlations between electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays and jets opens the possibility to measure the properties of jets coming from heavy-quark fragmentation, complementing the information on the energy-loss mechanism provided by single-particle observables. In particular, the request of a high $p_{\rm T}$ 'trigger' electron can select preferentially electrons and jets deriving from quark pairs produced at the surface of the QGP fireball, allowing us to study in more detail the dependence of the energy loss on the path length travelled by the quark in the medium. Furthermore, by varying the jet radius, the angular distribution of the radiated energy can be investigated. 
Besides providing a reference for the Pb-Pb case, the analogous study in pp and p-Pb collisions can supplement the measurements of $p_{\rm T}$-differential cross sections of charm and beauty particles with angular-differential information, adding sensitivity to the different heavy-flavour production processes (e.g. pair production vs. gluon splitting).

Poster session,poster,Causal hydrodynamic fluctuation and its implementation in full (3+1)-D dissipative hydrodynamic simulation,"Murase, Koichi",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"We formulate relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with causal hydrodynamic fluctuations and implement them into our dynamical model for more quantitative analysis of the transport coefficients of the matter created in heavy ion collisions.

The hydrodynamic fluctuations are thermal fluctuations arising in the event-by-event hydrodynamic evoluation of the system, and its power spectrum is determined through the fluctuation-dissipation relation. While, the higher harmonics $v_n$ ($n>2$) are systematically observed in RHIC and LHC and attract a lot of theoretical and experimental interests. Initial state fluctuations turned out to be important to explain these higher harmonics through event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. The event-by-event hydrodynamic fluctuation, although its average is locally zero, also has effects on the higher harmonics and other observables in the same manner as the initial fluctuations which vanish in the averaged picture of the initial condition.

Recently, it is actively discussed to extract the shear viscosity from the experimental observables using hydrodynamic simulations with the initial fluctuations. The initial fluctuations are converted to observables through the response of the matter, which enables us to obtain information on the properties of the matter as well as on the initial state. But, the higher harmonics are created not only by initial state fluctuations, and the other sources of fluctuations such as the hydrodynamic fluctuation also play important roles. Therefore, to extract the quantitative properties of the quark-gluon plasma from experimental data, it is important to properly implement all the sources of fluctuations including hydrodynamic fluctuations in an integrated dynamical model with models of initial states, hydrodynamics of quark-gluon plasma and subsequent hadronic cascades.

First, we formulate relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with the hydrodynamic fluctuation \[1\] in the context of the causal dissipative hydrodynamics which are commonly used in dynamical models for heavy-ion collisions. In causal dissipative hydrodynamics, the hydrodynamic fluctuation of the dissipative currents becomes colored noise due to the fluctuation-dissipation relation. But, interestingly, noise turns out to be always white in the differential form of the constitutive equations, which comes from general properties of the response function of the dissipative currents including causality and resulting constraints on the structure of the constitutive equations. Next, we implement the hydrodynamic fluctuations into our integrated dynamical model and investigate the behavior of the hydrodynamic fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions and discuss effects on experimental observables. The effect can be more significant in  higher orders of the harmonics $v_n$, and in smaller systems such as peripheral collisions or central pA collisions.

Poster session,poster,Prospects for beauty-jet measurements with ALICE,"La Pointe, Sarah",Universita e INFN (IT),Unknown,"Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are ideal probes of the QCD matter formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are predominantly produced in the early stage of the collision via initial hard parton scatterings. While propagating through the dense matter, they lose energy through elastic scatterings and radiative processes. Theoretical models predict that the energy loss of high-energy partons depends on the color charge and parton mass, with the expectation that in the medium beauty quarks lose less energy than charm and light quarks. These dependencies can be explored by comparing the modification in Pb-Pb collisions, relative to pp collisions, of beauty jets with that of charm or light-parton jets. 

In this poster we present Monte Carlo based performance studies of different b-jet tagging algorithms in ALICE for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. The algorithms, which benefit from the long lifetime of B mesons, are based on the identification of secondary decay vertices and displaced single tracks. In addition, the identification of electrons in jets can be used to profit from the large semi-electronic decay branching ratios of B mesons. Their capability to discriminate beauty jets from charm and light-parton jets will be discussed along with the analysis strategy and outlook.

Poster session,poster,Title: The centrality dependence of jet and leading particle production in d-Au and p-Pb collisions,"Kordell, Michael",W,Unknown,"We take a detailed look at high transverse momentum (high $p_T$) particle and jet production in d-Au collisions at RHIC and p-Pb collision at LHC. In particular, we study the correlation between jet production and the number of charged particles produced, which allows collisions to be binned in centrality. While Hulthen distributions are used to sample the spatial distribution of nucleons in deuteron, nucleon distributions within the larger nucleus are sampled form either correlation-free Woods-Saxon or shell model distributions with nucleon-nucleon correlations. The collision of a nucleon from the deuteron with a column of nucleons in the nucleus is carried out by modifying the PYTHIA event generator. Two methods are presented: one retains exact isospin conservation (prior to weak decays) by tracking each nucleon-nucleon collision and another with exact energy conservation where the energy of a column of $N$ nucleons is incorporated within a single ``super'' nucleon by enhancing the parton distribution functions by $N$.

This is the first-ever two-gluon production calculation including saturation effects to all orders in one of the nuclei (heavy ion) along with a single saturation correction in the projectile (light ion). The calculation of the correlation function predicted (qualitatively) two identical ridge-like correlations, near- and away-side. This prediction was later supported by experiment findings. Concentrating on the energy and geometry dependence of the correlation functions we find that the correlation function

We detail a method, employed by PHENIX, for determining centrality classes in $p(d)+A$ collisions via cuts on the produced charge particle multiplicity in the nucleus-going (-3.9<$\eta$<-3.0) direction. Using a Glauber Monte Carlo simulation we are able to map the centrality classes to geometric quantities of interest, along with corresponding systematic uncertainties. Within this framework we calculate the centrality bias-correction factors on the nuclear modification factor $R_{p(d)+A}$ due to correlations between a measured process and the multiplicity in the nucleus-going direction. These bias-correction factors are tested further using the HIJING MC generator, confirming that for $d+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV the corrections are small and vary by less than 5% (10%) for hadron production at midrapidty up to $p_{T}$=10(20) GeV/$c$. In contrast, we find that the bias correction factors for $p+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV are an order of magnitude larger and exhibit a strong dependence on hadron $p_T$, which likely is due to the larger effect of multiparton interactions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Darren', 'last_name': 'McGlinchey', 'fullName': 'McGlinchey, Darren', 'id': '1728256', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado', 'emailHash': '7bd2666c83617469ddf84e808f8692f7', 'db_id': 1728256, 'person_id': 1867528}"

In a second experiment in March 2010, a different beam nucleus of $^{20}$Ne at 2 $A$GeV was employed in a similar setup. The experimental approach was developed to measure and study hypernuclei produced in the projectile rapidity region. Such $\Lambda$-hypernuclei are assumed to be obtained by the coalescence between $\Lambda$ hyperon produced in the mid rapidity region of the participant zone and projectile spectator fragments from the collision between the beam and target nuclei. Final results of the first experiment $^{6}$Li+$^{12}$C at 2$A$GeV will be presented, demonstrating that $\Lambda$ hyperon, $^{3}_\Lambda$H and $^4_\Lambda$H hypernuclei were observed by performing the vertex reconstruction and the measurement of their invariant mass. Their lifetimes were extracted and were in good agreement with the world data. A review of the lifetime of these light hypernuclei was performed and showed that their measured lifetimes are significantly shorter than the $\Lambda$ lifetime which bring new interrogation about their fundamental structures. As well, the evidence of a bound state of two neutrons and one $\Lambda$ hyperon, $^3_\Lambda$n, will be presented. It corresponds to the first observation of a neutral bound state. Finally the estimation of the production cross section of the observed $\Lambda$ hyperon and hypernuclei will be shown, corresponding the first experimental estimation of those observables. These estimations will be useful for constraining theoretical models of the hypernuclear production, and an insight on these implications will be given.

For investigating this momentum loss we extended the partonic transport model BAMPS which solves the full 3+1D Boltzmann equation for partons based on pQCD cross sections. Among the features of BAMPS is the stochastic modeling of both 2->2 and 2<->3 scattering processes by employing a new, improved Gunion-Bertsch matrix element together with a microscopic running coupling.

Poster session,poster,Projection method and new formulation of leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics,"Tinti, Leonardo",UJK,Unknown,"Successful applications of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the description of heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC triggered large interest in the development of the hydrodynamic framework. An example of the new approach to relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics is anisotropic hydrodynamics  --- the framework where effects connected with the expected high pressure anisotropy of the produced matter are included in the leading order of the hydrodynamic expansion. 

Very recently, also the second order anisotropic hydrodynamics has been formulated in [1]. The new approach introduced in [1] allows for description of arbitrary transverse expansion of matter in the way which becomes consistent with more traditional approaches to dissipative hydrodynamics in the small anisotropy limit. This formalism  uses, however, the Romatschke-Strickland form [2] of the distribution function  in the leading order, which implies that the two components of pressure in the transverse plane may be different only if the second-order corrections are taken into account.

In this work we present a new methodology for including three substantially different pressure components already in the leading order of hydrodynamic expansion. Our approach is based on the projection method introduced in [3], which has turned out to be a convenient tool to replace complicated tensor equations of relativistic hydrodynamics by a small set of scalar equations. 

We take into account the radial expansion of the produced matter (in addition to the longitudinal Bjorken flow) but our considerations are confined to the case with cylindrical symmetry. We generalize the Romatschke-Strickland form to the case where all three pressure components may be different. Compared to earlier works on anisotropic hydrodynamics in the leading order, where the zeroth and first moments of the Boltzmann equation have been studied, an important novel feature of our present work is the analysis of the second moment of the Boltzmann equation. We argue that a successful agreement with the Israel-Stewart theory in the limit of small anisotropies may be achieved if we take into account two equations constructed from the second moment of the Boltzmann equation rather than taking one equation from the zeroth moment and another equation from the second moment [4].

Recently the correlation of different order event planes has also emerged as a promising tool to study the initial state of the high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.  In the idealized case, event planes at different rapidities are completely correlated. However, initial parton production has significant fluctuations in the longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction. The longitudinal fluctuations of the initial transverse parton density can lead to fluctuations of the longitudinal azimuthal anisotropy at different rapidities and de-correlation of event planes with large rapidity gaps.

 In this work, we will explore the correlations of event planes of the same harmonics with different rapidity gaps in Pb+Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ =2.76 TeV using two different dynamical models that incorporate initial conditions with longitudinal fluctuations in the initial energy density. The dynamical models used in our work are AMPT and a 3+1D ideal hydrodynamic model. The initial conditions for both models are given by the HIJING model that incorporates a Monte Carlo Glauber model for multiple nucleon interactions and two-component model for particle production. Particle production from soft coherent interaction of overlapping nucleons and incoherent semi-hard parton scatterings leads to fluctuations of local energy density in the transverse as well as longitudinal direction.

Poster session,poster,Knee structure in the elliptic flow in ultracentral U+U collisions,"Goldschmidt, Andy",The Ohio State University,USA,"Using event-by-event viscous fluid dynamics to evolve fluctuating initial density profiles for U+U collisions, we find a ""knee""-like structure in the elliptic flow as a function of collision centrality, located around 0.5% centrality as measured by the final charged multiplicity. This knee is due to the preferential selection of tip-on-tip collision geometries by a high-multiplicity trigger. It arises from a similar knee in the ellipticity distribution in the initial states; hydrodynamic evolution translates the knee in the ellipticity vs. centrality into a knee of the elliptic flow in the final state. The conversion efficiency v2/ε2 is found to be independent of centrality in the knee region. A non-monotonic centrality dependence of v2/ε2 as initially reported by the STAR collaboration can be obtained by normalizing the final v2 values with initial eccentricities calculated from a different initial-state model than the one used in the hydrodynamic simulations. – No knee structure is seen in odd flow harmonics. A weaker knee structure in the centrality dependence of the 4th-order eccentricity is washed out by nonlinear hydrodynamic evolution effects and thus no longer visible in the centrality dependence of the final quadrangular flow v4. – We find that the knee structure in v2 is robust against adding Γ-distributed multiplicity fluctuations, consistent with constraints from measured multiplicity distributions in p+p collisions, but may be washed out when allowing for extreme hot spots as implemented by Rybczynski et al.

Poster session,poster,The onset of pion condensation in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies,"Begun, Viktor",UJK,Unknown,"Statistical models of hadron production have become one of the cornerstones of our understanding of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. However, the measured proton abundances in Pb+Pb collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 2.76 TeV at LHC do not agree with the most common versions of the thermal models. Besides the proton anomaly, the same LHC data exhibits the low-transverse-momentum enhancement of pion spectra by about 25-50% with respect to the predictions of various thermal and hydrodynamic models [2]. 

In the recent work [3] we connect the proton anomaly with the pion enhancement effect and show that the two problems may be solved naturally within the statistical model which assumes chemical non-equilibrium at the freeze-out and a special combination of freeze-out geometry and flow - the Krakow single-freeze-out model in the Monte-Carlo version implemented in THERMINATOR [4].

We find a remarkable agreement between our model and the measured transverse-momentum spectra of pions and kaons. Although the protons are not included in the fit, our model explains well their spectrum, in addition to their yield. We also find a satisfactory description of hyperons with the same parameters. 

Correct description of the low-transverse-momentum enhancement of pions within our model suggests that it may be interpreted as a signature of the onset of pion condensation in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. This is so, since the freeze-out conditions in the model are very close to the pion condensation point.

Poster session,poster,Charge splitting of directed and elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions,"Rybicki, Andrzej","Institute of Nuclear Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences",UK,"We investigate the effect of the Coulomb field of the spectator matter on the directed and elliptic flow of charged pions. By means of a numerical Monte Carlo simulation, we find that the spectator charge induces sizeable values of directed flow. At beam and target rapidities, these can reach $v_1$=0.2 which is comparable to values reported by the WA98 collaboration in the corresponding kinematical range [1].

This effect is opposite for positive and negative pions, resulting in a *charge splitting of directed flow*. In the range of lower RHIC and SPS energies, the charge splitting extends down to midrapidity where our predicted values are in good agreement with very recent measurements reported by the STAR collaboration [2]. This effect appears to be strongly sensitive to the position of the pion formation zone with respect to the spectator system. Therefore, it provides *new, independent information* on the expansion of participant matter in the course of the collision.

By comparing the results of our predictions with the STAR and WA98 data, we investigate the *geometrical features* characterizing pions at freeze-out as they appear from our study of electromagnetic effects. We discuss the possibility to use the spectator-induced electromagnetic interaction as a new source of information on the space-time evolution of particle production at high energies.

Finally, for the first time, we present our new results on the *charge splitting of elliptic flow* which we discuss in the context of measurements reported by the STAR collaboration [3]. Additionally, we stress the complementarity of our study to the very recent analysis by Gursoy, Kharzeev and Rajagopal [4].

Poster session,poster,Centrality Detector for Collider-based Heavy Ion Experiments,"Milov, Alexander",Weizmann Institute of Science (IL),Unknown,"Parameters of the initial state of the heavy-ion (HI) interaction are commonly denoted by the term “centrality”. Centrality includes the impact parameter of the interaction, amount of interacting material and relative orientation of colliding nuclei. Unfortunately, none of these parameters can be directly measured. In all currently operating and planned HI experiments centrality is measured indirectly, using particles produced in the HI interactions, usually at high-rapidity. That requires assumptions about the high-rapidity particle production mechanisms that are not very well studied, and also requires a model relating produced particles to the initial state geometry, the Glauber model. These two assumptions lead to significant systematic uncertainties in centrality determination. Further, use of produced particles is affected by the correlations between the centrality determination rapidity and the rest of the detector coverage, where the physics measurements are done. This, in turn, requires additional corrections resulting in additional systematic uncertainties. Recent results from the LHC experiments reveal the importance of the long-range rapidity correlations in HI interactions. The proton-lead results also demonstrate that the Glauber model itself may require further adjustments.
    In collider-based HI experiments there is a unique possibility to measure centrality parameters by registering spectator fragments remaining from the collision on both sides. Spectator fragmentation mechanism is decoupled from particle production mechanism. This approach does not require Glauber model as spectators and participants are related via the total number of nucleons in the colliding species. Spectators continue flying along the direction of the colliding beams retaining practically unmodified longitudinal momentum, however their mass-to-charge ratio is typically lower than that of the colliding species.
       We propose a concept of the Centrality Detector, which measures masses of most of the fragments by measuring their deflection in the magnetic field of the collider elements and their charges. The field, and a set of detectors integrated in the structure of collider rings act as a very precise mass-spectrometer for such fragments. First calculations based on the DPMJet generator show that the Centrality Detector can provide better accuracy than currently used methods. Main factors affecting its performance will be discussed in the presentation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alexander', 'last_name': 'Milov', 'fullName': 'Milov, Alexander', 'id': '1728309', 'affiliation': 'Weizmann Institute of Science (IL)', 'emailHash': 'dabec4a547e4b7726bba1e938754840e', 'db_id': 1728309, 'person_id': 1867581}"

While it is challenging to probe this mechanism directly, there are now several observables available which allow tomographic imaging of the initial state geometry, which is expected to carry remnant information of the equilibration mechanism. On the fluid dynamics side, scaled fluctuations in the momentum space anisotropy parameters v_n image the initial eccentricity fluctuations epsilon_n almost directly with only a weak dependence on fluid dynamics. From a different direction, due to the strong non-linear dependence of their emission rates on temperature, thermal photons and their v_n are very sensitive to the initial state graininess. Finally, the v_2 and v_3 of high P_T hadrons coming from hard processes reflect the attenuation pattern of partons propagating through the inhomogeneous matter density after some fluid dynamical evolution. Combining information from all these channels does not yet lead to a fully consistent picture, however intriguing trends pointing towards non-trivial initial state dynamics emerge.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Equilibration of anisotropic quark-gluon plasma produced by decays of color flux tubes,"Florkowski, Wojciech","Institute of nuclear Physics, Krakow",UK,"A set of kinetic equations is used to study equilibration of the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma produced by decays of color flux tubes possibly created at the very early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The decay rates of the initial color fields are given by the Schwinger formula, and the collision terms are treated in the relaxation-time approximation. By connecting the relaxation time with viscosity we are able to study production and thermalization processes in the plasma characterized by different values of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, ${\bar \eta}$. For the lowest (KSS) value of this ratio, $4\pi{\bar \eta} = 1$, and realistic initial conditions for the fields, the system approaches the viscous-hydrodynamics regime within  1--2 fm/c. On the other hand, for larger values of the viscosity, $4\pi{\bar \eta} \geq 3$, the collisions in the plasma become inefficient to destroy collective phenomena which manifest themselves as oscillations of different plasma parameters. The presence of such oscillations brings in differences between the kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions, which suggest that the viscous-hydrodynamics approach after 1--2 fm/c is not complete if $4\pi{\bar \eta} \geq 3$ and should be extended to include dissipative phenomena connected with color conductivity.

Its formation is assisted by the gauge configuration in the glasma state created right after the collisions. Then we show that the center domains are an important facet of the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma from its birth up to hadronization.

Poster session,poster,Exact solutions of kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation,"Ryblewski, Radoslaw",Institute of Nuclear Physics PAS,UK,"Experimental and theoretical studies of relativistic heavy-ion collisions showed that the behavior of matter produced in such collisions is very well described within hydrodynamic models. These results brought a lot of attention to the studies of kinetic coefficients whose values determine the magnitude of important observables such as the elliptic flow. Interestingly, different theoretical methods lead to different values of the kinetic coefficients. Our idea is to perform comparisons of exact solutions of simple kinetic equations with various hydrodynamic approaches, which allows us to select correct forms of these coefficients. For this purpose we exactly solve the relaxation-time approximation Boltzmann equation for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion. We compare the resulting exact numerical solutions

Initial state physics,parallel,Decoherence between the initial and final state radiation in a dense QCD medium,"Martinez Guerrero, Mauricio",The Ohio State University,USA,"We study medium modifications to the interference pattern between initial and final state radiation. We compute single gluon production off a highly energetic parton that undergoes a hard scattering and subsequently crosses a dense QCD medium of finite size. Multiple soft scatterings with the medium are resumed within the harmonic oscillator approximation. We find the decoherence of correlated partons traversing the medium depends on two scales:  the medium length $L$ and the decorrelation time of the gluon due to the medium $\tau_f$. This interplay gives origin to two different asymptotic limits of the gluon spectrum: the coherent ($\tau_f\gg L$) and incoherent regime ($\tau_f\ll L$). We discuss the main characteristics of each regime. We show that in both cases there is a gradual onset of decoherence between the initial and final state radiation due to multiple scatterings, that opens the phase space for large angle emissions. By examining the multiplicity of produced gluons, we observe a potentially large double logarithmic enhancement for dense media and small opening angles. This result points to a possible modification of the evolution equations due to a QCD medium of finite size. We comment on the phenomenological consequences (such as radiative energy loss) of this setup in pA collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mauricio', 'last_name': 'Martinez Guerrero', 'fullName': 'Martinez Guerrero, Mauricio', 'id': '1728325', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': '2c40c9917457db3a0dc0510e7cf72a2f', 'db_id': 1728325, 'person_id': 1867594}"

Photons are produced at all stages of the colliding system directly as well as through decay of produced particles like neutral pions. The multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distribution of photons on an event-by-event basis is an important measurement complementing the charged particle measurement in a heavy ion collision. The Photon Multiplicity Detector in the STAR experiment measures inclusive photons in the pseudo-rapidity region −3.7 < η < −2.3. The photon multiplicity per participating nucleon pair was observed to be independent of collision centrality for Au + Au collision at √sNN = 200 and 62.4 GeV indicating that photon production is dominated by soft processes [1, 2]. Inclusive photon production at forward rapidity also shows an energy-independent longitudinal scaling at these energies [1, 2]. We will present the multiplicity and pseudo-rapidity distributions of photons in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 39, 27 and 19.6 GeV for different event centralities at rapidity close to the beam rapidity to further test the energy and centrality dependence of the longitudinal scaling.  
Photon multiplicity as well as pseudo-rapidity distributions show more photons as compared to that expected from longitudinal scaling; the deviation increasing for peripheral collisions. We assume that these additional photons from excited spectators due to proximity of PMD to beam rapidity. We propose a simple parameterization to calculate the effective number of photon sources, N’, to include contribution from participants as well as spectators, at all three energies. The photon multiplicity when scaled with N’ exhibits longitudinal scaling even beyond the beam rapidity.

After expansion and cooling, the hadrons are created in a freeze-out. Their distribution describes the final state of this medium. Exact hydrodynamics provides a tool to have an analytic handle on the connection between the initial state, the dynamic parameters of the system and the observables. Usually azimuthal or elliptical symmetry is assumed in the transverse plane, as these are simple to handle and represent geometries to yield realistic observables like spectra, Bose-Einstein correlation functions and elliptic flow. However, nuclei contain a finite number of nucleons, are thus (on an event-by-event basis) not spherically symmetric. This results in an event-by-event fluctuating initial condition, which gives rise to higher order flow coefficients, with respect to higher order reaction planes. Correlation radii can also be measured with respect to higher order reaction planes, their comparison to higher order flow coefficients gives insight into the dynamics of the system. In this work we show the first exact analytic solutions of relativistic hydrodynamics [Ref1,Ref2] that assume higher order asymmetries (see Fig. [1]) and thus give realistic higher order flow coefficients (see Fig. [2]). Besides presenting the first such model, we also show a comparison of our results to various measured hadronic observables.

Different equations of state imply different hydrodynamic responses, the impact thereof on final state anisotropies are investigated. The results of our calculations are compared to the data from RHIC at 130 GeV and 200 GeV. It is found that the three equations of state used in the calculations describe the data reasonably well; differences can be observed, but they are quite small. The insensitivity to the equation of state seems to weaken the need for a locally thermalized description of the system, at least for the observables analyzed in this work. A precise determination of transport coefficients by fitting collective flow parameters in the framework of hydrodynamics still requires caution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Danuce', 'last_name': 'Dudek', 'fullName': 'Dudek, Danuce', 'id': '1728343', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual Paulista', 'emailHash': '34b4298ad9549becee81486f9ba07018', 'db_id': 1728343, 'person_id': 1867610}"

In order for fluid dynamics to be applicable the microscopic and macroscopic scales of the system have to be sufficiently separated. The degree of separation can be quantified by the ratio between these scales, usually refered as the Knudsen number. In this work, we calculate the Knudsen numbers reached in fluid dynamical simulations of AA and pA collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. For this purpose, we consider different choices of shear viscosity parameterizations, initial states and initialization times. We then estimate the values of shear viscosity for which the fluid dynamical description of ultrarelativsitic AA and pA collisions breaks down. In particular, we calculate how such values depend on the initial condition and system size. We found that the maximum shear viscosity allowed in AA collisions is of the order $\eta/s \sim 0.1 - 0.2$, which is similar in magnitude to the viscosities currently employed in simulations of heavy ion collisions.

Poster session,poster,On Chemical Freeze-outs of Strange and Nonstrange Hadrons,"Bugaev, Kyrill","Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics of  NAS of Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine",UK,"\noindent
We performed a thorough analysis of two alternative approaches to treat the chemical freeze-out of  strange particles in hadron resonance gas model with the multicomponent hard-core repulsion [1]. 
The first approach accounts for their chemical non-equilibrium via the usual $\gamma_s$ factor and such a model describes the hadron multiplicities measured in nucleus-nucleus collisions  at AGS, SPS and RHIC energies with $\chi^2/dof  = 63.4/55 \simeq$ 1.15. In contrast to earlier beliefs, we find that strangeness rather tends to be enhanced than suppressed at low collision energies, i.e. $\gamma_s > 1$, at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $  2.7, 3.3, 3.8,  4.9, 6.3, 9.2 GeV. 
Second approach is to treat strange particle freeze-out separately from non-strange particle freeze-out. Conservation laws allow us to connect the freeze-outs of strange and non-strange hadrons and end up with the same number of free parameters as for $\gamma_s$ approach. We show that this approach works not worse than the $\gamma_s$ approach with $\chi^2/dof  = 58.5/55 \simeq $ 1.06 and for $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 6.3, 12 and 17 GeV it significantly improves the fit quality. For all considered collision energies we see that  $\bar p/\pi^-$,   $\bar \Lambda/\Lambda$,  $\bar \Xi^-/\Xi^-$ and  $\bar \Omega/\Omega$ ratios are described better than within the traditional $\gamma_s$ approach,  since a separation of chemical freeze-outs relaxes the strong connection between the non-strange and strange baryons. 
The novel concept of strange particle freeze-out allows us to describe 111 independent hadron ratios measured at 14 different energies with the highest quality ever achieved. 
Basing on these results we conjecture that an apparent strangeness enhancement is due to the separate strangeness chemical freeze-out. \\

produced, and thus carry information about the space-time thermal
properties of the medium.  We present new results on the centrality

measurements provide stringent tests of the hydrodynamic space-time
evolution as a detailed function of the collision geometry.

These soft photons have different angular emission patterns depending
on their production mechanism. Previous published PHENIX results
indicate that the second order Fourier coefficient ($v_2$) is postive
for $p_T < 4$ GeV/$c$, which is qualitatively explained by
hydrodynamical model calculations, but not quantitatively.  The
3\textsuperscript{rd} order Fourier coefficient ($v_3$) of photons has
been proposed as a critical additional handle to understand the photon
emission.  Photons emitted under the presence of strong magnetic field
created in the collision would have a significant influence on $v_2$
while very little on $v_3$.  In contrast, hydrodynamical models
predict a sizable photon $v_3$.  We report the latest results on the

The realization of thermal and chemical equilibrium are hot questions in relativistic heavy ion physics. The elliptic flow of direct photon serves as a more strict clock to those questions than other observables.

The enhancement is present in d+Au collisions as well as Au+Au collisions and increases with centrality. We compare a class of peripheral Au+Au collisions with a class of central d+Au collisions which have a comparable number of participants and binary collisions. The $p_T$ dependent ratios for these classes display a remarkable similarity.   The nuclear modification of hadrons at higher  transverse momentum also reveal interesting effects.  Geometry selection in d+Au/p+Pb collisions is crucial for understanding the physics underlying modified nuclear parton distribution functions, gluon saturation and glasma diagrams, initial state energy loss, and possible hydrodynamic flow in these small systems. Data from the p+Pb LHC results indicate potentially large biases in the geometry determination in these small systems. The PHENIX collaboration presents tests of auto-correlation biases.  Our findings indicate that these biases are an order of magnitude smaller at RHIC as compared to the LHC, and are thus well quantified.

Poster session,poster,Chemical and Thermal analysis of LHC data within a blast-wave model with two freeze-outs,"Lee, Kang Seog",Chonnam National University,Unknown,"Within a blast-wave model which assumes two different freeze-outs, i.e. the chemical and thermal ones, both the hadron multiplicities and the transverse momentum spectra of various hadrons are analyzed in one model. In this calculation multiplicities of both the thermal hadrons and those decayed from resonances in a certain rapidity interval are calculated separately and the sum is fitted to the data. Usually the measured number of hadrons within a certain rapidity interval is converted into a number of hadrons in the whole rapidity region and the number in the whole rapidity region is regarded as a sum of the thermal ones and those decayed from resonances and fitted. This procedure is correct only when the rapidity distributions of both the thermal hadrons and the decayed ones are same. 

Once the chemical analysis is done, by fixing the number of thermal hadrons of a certain species as the one at the chemical freeze-out, the transverse momentum spectra of various hadrons are fitted. Hence the adjustment of magnitudes of the pT spectra of various hadrons is not necessary.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kang Seog', 'last_name': 'Lee', 'fullName': 'Lee, Kang Seog', 'id': '1728409', 'affiliation': 'Chonnam National University', 'emailHash': '9c0d2d828ac10b48594dd6116196b52a', 'db_id': 1728409, 'person_id': 1867666}"
Poster session,poster,Early thermal and chemical equilibration of quarks and gluons,"Monnai, Akihiko",RIKEN BNL Research Center,USA,"Local equilibration of a QCD medium has been a long-standing issue in hadron physics since the discovery of a nearly-perfect fluid in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. The pre-collision state is considered to be described as color glass condensate, which has a relatively large number of high-momentum gluons but almost no quarks. The success of hydrodynamic approaches, on the other hand, indicate that the medium should quickly turn into an equilibrated quark-gluon plasma in less than 1 fm/$c$.

 Equilibration of a heavy-ion system requires (i) isotropization, (ii) thermalization and (iii) chemical equilibration of partons. In this work we focus on the latter two and aim to provide an efficient description for producing low-momentum quarks and gluons by modeling collinear parton splitting and recombination processes. Parton-medium interaction, which is required for creating off-shell partons, is embedded in the model by drag and diffusion effects in relativistic Fokker-Planck equation. We perform numerical simulation in a transverse direction for qualitative analyses to find that the gluon distribution approaches the thermal one in a very short time, and quark thermal/chemical equilibration is slower than the gluon thermalization though it is reasonably fast. The recombination is suggested to be essential in chemical equilibration as quark production from over-populated low-momentum gluons would be suppressed by Pauli exclusion principle. The results imply that the collinear processes play an important role in early thermal and chemical equilibration of the QCD matter produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Akihiko', 'last_name': 'Monnai', 'fullName': 'Monnai, Akihiko', 'id': '1728412', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN BNL Research Center', 'emailHash': 'f0bc1e93e692d54116d1ad7b4720cbac', 'db_id': 1728412, 'person_id': 1867669}"

Heavy quarks lose energy interacting with the medium via inelastic processes (medium-induced gluon radiation) and elastic collisions. The nuclear modification factor, $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of the heavy-flavour production yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the binary scaled pp one, is an observable sensitive to in-medium energy loss. In particular, the comparison of the $R_{\rm AA}$ of charm, beauty and light-flavour hadrons provides information about the colour charge and parton mass dependence of the energy loss.
Open heavy-flavour production was measured with ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76~\mathrm{TeV}$ using D mesons ($ {\rm D^0} $, ${\rm D^{*+}}$, $ {\rm D^{+}} $ and ${\rm D_s^+}$  ) reconstructed from their hadronic decays and electrons from heavy-flavour decays at central rapidity, and muons from heavy-flavour decays at forward rapidity.

The comparison of the nuclear modification factors of strange and non-strange D mesons will be presented, as well as the ${\rm D^0}$ $R_{\rm AA}$ measured in different azimuthal regions with respect to the reaction plane of the collision.

Poster session,poster,New results in the formalism and application of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics,"Jaiswal, Amaresh",Tata Institute of Fundamental Research,Unknown,"We derive relativistic viscous hydrodynamic equations for various
forms of the non-equilibrium single-particle phase-space distribution
function $f(x,p)$, and apply these results to relativistic heavy-ion
collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies.

In the first part of this work, we derive hydrodynamic equations
invoking the generalized second law of thermodynamics for two
different forms of $f(x,p)$ within Grad's 14-moment approximation. We
find that the relaxation times in these two derivations are identical
for shear viscosity but different for bulk viscosity. These equations
are used to study thermal dilepton and hadron spectra within
longitudinal scaling expansion of the matter formed in relativistic
heavy-ion collisions. For consistency, the same $f(x,p)$ is used in
the particle production prescription as in the derivation of the
viscous evolution equations. Appreciable differences are found in the
transverse-momentum spectra corresponding to the two forms of
$f(x,p)$. We emphasize that an inconsistent treatment of the
non-equilibrium effects influences the particle production
significantly, which may affect the extraction of transport properties
of quark-gluon plasma [1].

In the second part, we consider an alternative Chapman-Enskog-like
method, which unlike the widely used Grad's method, involves a small
expansion parameter. We derive an expression for $f(x,p)$ to second
order in this parameter. We show analytically that while Grad's method
leads to the violation of the experimentally observed $1/\sqrt{m_T}$
scaling of the longitudinal femtoscopic radii, the alternative method
does not exhibit such an unphysical behavior. We compare numerical
results for hadron transverse-momentum spectra and femtoscopic radii
obtained in these two methods, within the one-dimensional scaling
expansion scenario. Moreover, we demonstrate a rapid convergence of
the Chapman-Enskog-like expansion up to second order. This leads to an
expression for $\delta f(x,p)$ which provides a better alternative to
Grad's approximation for hydrodynamic modelling of relativistic
heavy-ion collisions [2].

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Thermal photon $v_3$ at LHC from event-by-event hydrodynamics,"Chatterjee, Rupa",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Thermal photon $v_3$ is calculated for 0--40% central collisions of Pb nuclei at LHC from event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic model [1]. The differential triangular flow parameter $v_3(p_T)$ calculated with respect to the participant plane (PP) is found to be  non-zero, positive, and shows similar qualitative nature to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2(p_T)$ [2].  At $p_T=$ 1 GeV $v_3$(PP) is found to be about half of  $v_2$(PP) however, for larger values of $p_T$ these two anisotropy parameters  become comparable.  The global geometry of the produced matter as well as the local fluctuations in the initial density distribution are responsible for  this substantial value of the triangular flow parameter for thermal photons  where $v_3$(PP)  probes the initial state geometry in an indirect way via the generation of additional transverse flow.   $v_3$ calculated with respect to the reaction plane as expected is close to zero.  $v_3$(PP) strongly depends on the value of the fluctuation size parameter $\sigma$ especially in the higher $p_T$ region where, a larger $\sigma$ results in a smaller $v_3$(PP). In addition, the $v_3$(PP) is found to increase with the initial formation time of the system.

Therefore heavy quark hadrons are suggested as a clean probe for the studying of early dynamic evolution of the dense and hot medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions. To enhance the study of heavy quark production at RHIC, the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) for the STAR experiment has been built and installed before RHIC Run 14. The HFT consists of four layers of silicon detectors. The two outermost layers are silicon strip detectors and the two innermost layers are made from the state of art ultra thin CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS). This is the first application of the CMOS MAPS detector in a collider experiment. The thin pixel sensors plus the carbon fiber supporting design reduces the material to 0.4 % radiation length per pixel detector layer, enabling reconstruction of low pT heavy flavor hadrons.

Systematic measurements of the quarkonia production in different colliding systems are hence crucial for disentangling relative contributions of these effects.

Poster session,poster,Triangular Flow of Inclusive Charged and Identified Particles at RHIC,"Sun, Xu",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,USA,"Triangular flow ($v_{3}$), the third harmonic of the azimuthal particle distribution relative to the event plane, is getting more attention in recent years. It is considered that $v_{3}$ is generated by event-by-event initial state fluctuations. Therefore, it is natural to use $v_{3}$ as a tool to study initial state fluctuations and the subsequent evolution of the collision system. Another aspect of identified-particle $v_{3}$ measurements is the study of the energy dependent difference between particles and anti-particles $v_{3}$. That is especially important after the observation of a difference in elliptic flow between particles and anti-particles in Beam Energy Scan data at STAR.

We present $v_{3}$ measurements from STAR of identified particles ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\phi$, $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$) relative to the third-order event plane as a function of $p_\mathrm{T}$ for different centralities (0\%-80\%, 0\%-10\%, 10\%-40\%, and 40\%-80\%) at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} =$ 27 GeV, 39 GeV and 200 GeV.

Subtraction of the di-hadron correlation in low-multiplicity p+Pb collisions from high-multiplicity ones reveals a back-to-back double ridge structure ($\Delta\phi\approx 0$ and $\pi$). A similar double ridge is observed in high-multiplicity d+Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment in their limited acceptance. Differences between multiplicity-selected d+Au collisions (and p+p collisions) have been observed before by STAR. However, the question remains open whether the ridge in d+Au collisions is a jet-related difference between central and peripheral collisions, or a new physics phenomenon such as anisotropic flow in d+Au. STAR, with its large acceptance, can rigorously address this question.

The $\Delta\phi$ correlation functions are also analyzed via a Fourier series decomposition; the $|\Delta\eta|$ and multiplicity dependencies of the Fourier coefficients are investigated.

Hydrodynamic models predict a decrease of these homogeneity lengths with increasing pair transverse mass ($m_{\rm T}$), which has been confirmed by pion analyses. Femtoscopic analyses of heavier particles are able to extend the $m_{\rm T}$ range and thus further constrain theoretical models.

Poster session,poster,Quark-hadron phase transition in the PNJL model with hadronic excitations,"Yamazaki, Kanako",University of Tokyo,Unknown,"We study the QCD phase transition, especially the change of degrees of freedom from hadrons to quarks. In order to describe the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement transition at the same time, we choose the Nambu-Jana-Lasinio model with Polyakov loop (PNJL model). This model was proposed by combining the Nambu-Jana-Lasinio model which describes the chiral transition and the Polyakov loop which works as an order parameter of deconfinement transition. We calculated an equation of state by an approach beyond the mean field approximation to take thermal excitations of hadrons into account. In this method, mesons can be introduced as auxiliary fields, and their excitations are described as thermal fluctuations of auxiliary fields. We will present an equation of state concerning mesonic excitations at zero quark chemical potential in the two- and three-flavor PNJL model for interacting quarks [1, 2]. In addition, we have thought the way to introduce baryonic correlation as the three body system of quarks at finite chemical potential. In this case, it is necessary to consider how to put interactions between three quarks, unlike mesons as the two body system of quark and anti-quark. We will also discuss about that.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,QGP properties from flow and correlations,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Recently the results of  azimuthal HBT measurements with respect to 
the second and third order event plane are presented by PHENIX [1]. 
They extract $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii 
which contain information about not only the source shape at freezeout 
but also the space-time evolution of QGP matter.  
They show the relation between initial $\epsilon_{2, 3}$ which are obtained  
using a Glauber model and final $\epsilon_{2,3}$ which are extracted from 
the HBT radii. 
They find that the final $\epsilon_2$ from the HBT radii is finite and smaller 
than the initial $\epsilon_2$. 
On the other hand, the final $\epsilon_3$ is vanishing, in spite of existence of 
finite initial $\epsilon_3$. 
The interesting different response of $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$  during 
space-time evolution gives us a clue to understand the detailed QGP properties. 

For analyses of such high statistics experimental results, we develop a 
state of the art numerical scheme of causal viscous hydrodynamics for 
relativistic heavy ion collisions, which has a shock-wave capturing scheme and less 
numerical dissipation [2]. Furthermore, using the hydrodynamic algorithm, 
we construct a hybrid model of hydrodynamic model plus UrQMD to include the realistic 
freezeout processes.  
Using the model we investigate the time evolution of spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$. 
We find that the sign of $\epsilon_3$ changes from positive to negative during the space-time evolution, 
which suggests a solution of the vanishing final $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii by PHENIX. 
From detailed analyses from flow and correlations,  we discuss the initial conditions of 
hydrodynamic model and the detailed QGP properties such as transport coefficients.

Since in both formulations the gauge links are integrated out analytically, the sign problem is much milder than in conventional lattice QCD. The resulting dual representation in terms of color singlets allows to better understand the nature of nuclear interactions. Since both fermion discretizations have different lattice artifacts, a comparison is instructive to isolate the physical content which persists as one aims for the continuum limit, in particular the existence of the critical end point.

The strong coupling limit of staggered fermions is well established, recent results on the corresponding $\mu-T$ phase diagram and its corrections to the strong coupling limit are presented.

Using this system, a systematic study of the Au-Au collisions at SIS-100 (FAIR-GSI) energies with a few simulation codes, as well as using a phenomenological geometric picture of the relativistic nuclear collisions [2,3] collisions was been done. Three types of charged particles were considered. The predictions of a few simulation codes (UrQMD, AMPT) were used for estimation in the mentioned model of the terms of the equation of state related to energy density, temperature and compressibility. The proton-proton collisions at similar energies have been used for comparisons. When possible, comparisons with existing experimental results at similar energies were included. 
The Rankine-Hugoniot equation permits estimations of the compressibility coefficient, the estimations being between 100 MeV and 1000 MeV. The estimations for viscosity coefficient, according to the model, indicated a significant increase from proton-proton collision to nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same incident energy. A small increase of this coefficient with the increase of the beam energy can be observed, too. A short analysis of the nuclear matter jets formation [4] in nucleus-nucleus collisions at these energies is done.
Difference among the simulation codes predictions were observed, too.

phase diagram of QCD.  A critical point (CP) is expected at large baryonic
chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$) in the $T$ vs. $\mu_{B}$ phase diagram. Its
location experimentally will provide one of the most stringent tests of
QCD calculations. In the BES program $T$ and  $\mu_{B}$  are varied by
changing the center of mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) from 200 to 7.7 GeV.
The observables chosen for CP search are the product of moments of
conserved(like net-charge) multiplicity distributions or their proxies
(such as net-kaon for net-strangeness and net-proton for net-baryons)
measured in the experiments. The various moments (mean ($M$), standard
deviation ($\sigma$), skewness ($S$) and kurtosis ($\kappa$)) are related
to correlation length ($\xi$) of the system (variance: $\sigma^{2}$ $\sim$
$\xi^{2}$; skewness: $S$ $\sim$ $\xi^{4.5}$ and kurtosis: $\kappa$ $\sim$
$\xi^{7}$) [1] and are expected to show a non-monotonic variation with
beam energy in the presence of CP.

We report new measurements of product of moments: $\sigma^{2}/M$,
$S\sigma$ and $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ of net-kaon distributions ($\Delta N_{K}$

the corresponding results from net-charge [2] and net-proton

reconstruction efficiency and will be compared to baseline distributions
constructed following Poisson and Negative Binomial/Binomial statistics.
They will also be compared to calculations from HIJING, AMPT and UrQMD
models, which do not include a CP. Deviations from some of the baseline
measures and model calculations are observed for net-kaon and  net-proton
distributions. The implications of the observation to CP physics will be

collisions suffer from a lack of elliptical flow as compared to the experimental data if they reproduce $R_{\rm AA}$, often referred to by experimentalists as a ""tension between  $R_{\rm AA}$  and  $v_2$"". One possible reason for this discrepancy may be the disregard of  D-meson rescattering in hadronic matter  in the latest stage of the evolution. To study this is the core of our contribution. 

The drag and diffusion coefficients of D-mesons propagating in a hot and dense hadronic matter are calculated. The hadronic medium consists of pions, kaons, etas, rho-mesons and nucleons. We find that the transport coefficients increase with the temperature of the medium. The dominant contributions to the drag and diffusion coefficients come from pions, but at higher temperatures the contributions from other (heavier) hadrons become important as well. In addition, we evaluate the thermal relaxation rate of D-mesons, which is in agreement with the model estimate of He, Fries and Rapp. The relaxation rate reaches approx. 0.1/fm in the vicinity of the critical temperature; this is comparable to non-perturbative T-matrix calculations of charm-quark relaxation in QGP. The size of the transport coefficients in hadronic matter shows that the hadronic contributions should be included when evaluating the nuclear suppression factor and the elliptic flow for single leptons originating from the decays of D-mesons or for D-mesons during the expansion of the matter created in heavy ion reactions at mid-rapidity. 
   
 Finally, we study the consequence for the $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy mesons by using a hydrodynamical model for the expansion of QGP and the hadron gas in which the chemical freeze-out is modelled by the effective chemical potential. We present the modification of the $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of D-mesons due to the hadronic rescattering, for both, RHIC and LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vitalii', 'last_name': 'OZVENCHUK', 'fullName': 'OZVENCHUK, Vitalii', 'id': '1728501', 'affiliation': 'subatech', 'emailHash': '9767b34891a54aa84323fa3de01013bd', 'db_id': 1728501, 'person_id': 1867751}"

Recent work by Betz and Gyulassy on the other hand claims simultaneous reproduction of this set of observables with simple pQCD-motivated energy loss formulas, in contrast with our earlier finding that realistic transverse expansion strongly suppresses elliptic flow. We resolve the apparent contradiction via a study that contrasts different bulk medium evolution models (based on hydrodynamics and covariant transport) combined with different implementations of Djordjevic-Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev radiative energy loss for light partons and heavy quarks. A key new ingredient relative to earlier dE/dL and (D)GLV studies is that we pay special attention to formulate energy loss in a way that results do not depend on the calculational frame. We find that covariant formulation accentuates the interplay between bulk medium evolution and parton energy loss, and show how this affects light hadron and heavy flavor anisotropic flow.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Denes', 'last_name': 'Molnar', 'fullName': 'Molnar, Denes', 'id': '1728505', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': '2499fb643638c071cf30c16e8ec80df3', 'db_id': 1728505, 'person_id': 1867755}"

They validate the characteristic signature expected for the system size dependence of viscous damping at each collision energy studied. The extracted viscous coefficients, that encode the magnitude of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$, are observed to decrease to an apparent minimum as the collision energy is increased from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7$ to approximately 62.4~GeV; thereafter, they show a slow 
increase with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ up to 2.76 TeV.

Heavy flavor,parallel,Gluon radiation by heavy quarks at intermediate energies,"Gossiaux, Pol",Subatech,Unknown,"It is generally admitted that heavy quarks (c and b) created in the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions through hard processes are among the best probes of the later QGP stage. Perturbative QCD allows for the calculation of the production cross sections (in contradistinction to light quarks) and these cross sections have also been measured. Also the details of the chiral/confinement phase transition are less important than for light quarks because, due to its mass, the momentum of the heavy quark determines the momentum of the open charm hadrons. In addition, the momentum distribution at production and at the transition is very different from that expected if the heavy quarks are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma of light quarks and gluons. Therefore the modification of the initial momentum distribution by the interaction of the heavy quarks with the plasma carries information on the plasma properties.

The interaction of the heavy quark with the plasma has two parts, elastic collisions and radiative collisions. For the first a model was developed [1] in which the cross section of the elementary interactions are calculated by 
perturbative QCD with a running coupling constant and an infrared behavior adjusted so as to match hard thermal loop calculations. Embedding these cross sections in the hydrodynamical description of the expanding plasma of Heinz and Kolb it was shown that the collisional energy loss underpredicts the measured energy loss of heavy mesons at large momenta as well as their elliptic flow by roughly a factor of two.

It is the purpose of the present work to extend our pQCD calculation toward the calculation of the radiative energy loss for heavy quarks at intermediate energies. To this end we compute the gluon emission cross section of a heavy quark colliding a light parton from the plasma in pQCD at leading order [2]. We first derive the high-energy approximation that naturally extends results obtained by Gunion and Bertsch for the light quark sector to heavy quarks. We next show that it is possible to compute the complete energy dependence of the result. This allows us to assess the range of applicability in energy of the high-energy approximation. We then extend the calculation to the case of intermediate energy, for which the invariant mass $s$ in the collision does not exceed the squared heavy quark mass $m_Q^2$ in large amounts. We discuss in particular the relevance of the dead cone effect as well as the consequences of a finite heavy quark energy, which is often neglected in the literature. For this purpose, we address quantities such as the average energy loss in a bath at finite temperature as well as the nuclear modification factor as a function of the transverse momentum.

Heavy quarks are expected to be produced in the initial partonic scatterings and interact with the deconfined medium making them ideal probes of the QGP. According to the color-screening model, quarkonium states are suppressed in the medium with different dissociation probabilities for the various states. Recent results from the ALICE collaboration on the measurement of the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of inclusive J/$\psi$ indicate that a significant fraction of the observed J/$\psi$ is produced via the recombination of charm quarks from the QGP phase. Quarkonium detection at forward rapidity is performed with the ALICE muon spectrometer in the range -4 $< \eta <$ -2.5 down to $p_{\rm T}$ = 0. We report on the first measurement of a low-$p_{\rm T}$  J/$\psi$ yield excess ($p_{\rm T} <$ 300 MeV/$c$) in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, in the centrality bins 50-70$\%$ and 70-90$\%$. Photoproduction of J/$\psi$ (occuring at $b < 2R$) is proposed as the underlying physics mechanism. Such a mechanism may represent a promising signature to probe the charmonium color-screening dissociation in the QGP at LHC energies. In this poster, we will present two methods to quantify the J/$\psi$ low-$p_{\rm T}$ yield excess and we will give the status and perspectives of this analysis.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Laure Marie', 'last_name': 'Massacrier', 'fullName': 'Massacrier, Laure Marie', 'id': '1728519', 'affiliation': 'Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et des Technologies Associe', 'emailHash': 'a231b6dc11b7240167f6a285d631250a', 'db_id': 1728519, 'person_id': 1867764}"

The field in non-central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energy should reach about $10^{14}$ T.  It is not only the most intense in the universe, far beyond the field on the surfaces of magnetars ($\sim 10^{11}$ T), but also is interesting in terms of fundamental physics as it is well above the critical magnetic field of electrons ($4 \times 10^9$ T) where non-linear behaviors of QED (e.g. photon splitting, real photons decaying into di-leptons, etc.) are theoretically expected.

  We have proposed new approaches to experimentally detect the field via a number of asymmetry measurements of dielectrons from direct virtual photons.  The anisotropy of virtual photon decay, or the “polarization” of virtual photons, due to the field has been evaluated by QED calculations, and found possible to reach the order of $10^{-1}$.

Heavy flavor,parallel,J/$\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Martin Blanco, Javier",Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et des Technologies Associe,Unknown,"The study of charmonium production, bound states of c and $\bar{c}$ quarks, is an intense research activity, both experimentally and theoretically. The peculiar properties of some of the charmonium states, like their small size (< 1 fm) and strong binding energy (several hundred MeV), make them ideal probes of the strongly interacting matter, the so-called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

ALICE is dedicated to the study of QGP properties in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. A suppression of the J/$\psi$ has been found in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV, with respect to the J/$\psi$ measured in pp collisions at the same center-of-mass energy. At the beginning of 2013, p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV have been studied at the LHC, in order to measure the effects related to cold nuclear matter, which, for charmonia, include gluon shadowing (or gluon saturation), energy loss and nuclear absorption. The study of these effects in p-Pb collisions is important in order to be able to disentangle hot and cold nuclear matter effects in Pb-Pb collisions. 

The obtained results on the J/$\psi$ production and nuclear modification factor as a function of rapidity or transverse momentum in p-Pb collisions, will be presented and compared to theoretical models. The rapidity ranges considered will include forward and backward rapidity (dimuon decay channel) and mid rapidity (dielectron decay channel). Likewise, a discussion on the forward-to-backward ratios will be held.

The first results on quarkonium suppression in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC seem to indicate that for charmonia both regeneration and colour screening mechanisms play a role while for bottomonia the regeneration mechanism should be small. Initial state effects can play a role in bottomonium production in Pb-Pb collisions and thus should be studied using proton-nucleus collisions, where no deconfined state is expected to be created.

Poster session,poster,Statistically inferring nuclear modification of charm and beauty hadrons from PHENIX electron data,"Adare, Andrew",University of Colorado,USA,"Quantitative knowledge of heavy quark momentum distributions in the hot nuclear medium created by ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is of high value in quantitatively understanding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase of nuclear matter. In particular, the modification of heavy-quark momentum distributions from nuclear collisions as compared to smaller collision environments (such as p+p) provides important clues about the density of color charges and their coupling strength, which is of fundamental importance in QCD. This poster describes a procedure for statistical inference of D and B meson $p_{T}$ yields from nonphotonic electrons (NPEs). The relative yield of D and B mesons is sensitive to the electron $p_{T}$ and displaced-vertex distributions because of their mass and lifetime difference. The dataset is composed of an invariant NPE yield vs. $p_{T}$ as well as the electron displaced-vertex information, both measured near midrapidity. The yield of $D,B$ and subsequent decay ($D\to e$ and $B\to e$) is modeled using a monte carlo event generator (e.g. PYTHIA). Using real data and the generative model as inputs, the yield of parent mesons is inferred in a rigorous Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. The result is a full posterior distribution of D and B meson yields over a large $p_{T}$ range.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrew', 'last_name': 'Adare', 'fullName': 'Adare, Andrew', 'id': '1728529', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado', 'emailHash': '8eecdd7d07cf129f011eded6d475e410', 'db_id': 1728529, 'person_id': 1867773}"

The slope parameter $r$ of the linear dependence of $\Delta v_{2}=v_{2}(\pi^{-})-v_{2}(\pi^{+})$ on $A_{ch}=(N^{+}-N^{-})/(N^{+}+N^{-})$ is yielded by the conversion from an initial electric charge quadrupole distribution to a charge-dependent elliptic flow via a strong parton cascade process. The slope parameter $r$ is increased by the hadronization of coalescence, and then decreased by final resonance decays.  Because the slope parameter $r$ is very sensitive to both initial electric charge quadrupole percentage and centrality, a helpful constraint of the effect from chiral magnetic wave is extracted out in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy.

Without final-state interaction and collective expansion, dihadron correlations from HIJING simulations have a typical structure from minijets that contains a near-side two-dimensional peak and an away-side ridge along the η-direction. In contrast, event-by-event (3+1)D ideal hydrodynamic simulations with fluctuating initial conditions from the HIJING+AMPT model produce a strong dihadron correlation that has an away-side as well as a near-side ridge. Relics of intrinsic dihadron correlation from minijets in the initial conditions still remain as superimposed on the two ridges. By varying initial conditions from HIJING+AMPT, we study effects of minijets, non-vanishing initial flow and longitudinal fluctuation on the final state dihadron correlations. With a large rapidity gap, one can exclude near-side correlations from minijet relics and dihadron correlations can be described by the superposition of harmonic flows up to the 6th order. When long-range correlations with a large rapidity gap are subtracted from short-range correlations with a small rapidity gap, the remaining near-side dihadron correlations result solely from relics of minijets.

Successively we study the propagation of the heavy quarks in the plasma with the relativistic Langevin equation and, eventually, their hadronization in the medium.

Heavy flavor,parallel,Towards continuum results of the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient,"Kaczmarek, Olaf",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"Among quantities playing a central role in the theoretical interpretation of
heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC are so-called transport
coefficients. Out of those heavy quark diffusion coefficents play an important
role e.g. for the analysis of the quenching of jets containing
$c$ or $b$ quarks ($D$ or $B$ mesons) as observed at RHIC and LHC.

We report on a lattice investigation of heavy quark momentum diffusion within
pure SU(3) plasma above the deconfinement transition, with the quarks treated
to leading order in the heavy mass expansion. We measure the relevant
""colour-electric"" Euclidean correlator and based on several lattice spacings
perform the continuum extrapolation. This extends our previous study [1,2]  progressing towards a removal of lattice artifacts and a physical
interpretation of the results.

We find that the correlation function clearly exceeds its
perturbative counterpart which suggests that at temperatures just above the
critical one, non-perturbative interactions felt by the heavy quarks are
stronger than within the weak-coupling expansion. Our results will be
compared to heavy quark diffusion coefficients [3] obtained from
charmonium vector correlation functions.

Poster session,poster,Charm quark dynamics in the QGP,"Berrehrah, Hamza",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS),Unknown,"We study the in- and out-off equilibrium dynamics of heavy quarks in the strongly interacting partonic and hadronic medium within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach [1] which incorporates explicit partonic degrees-of-freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasi-particles (quarks and gluons) in line with an equation of state from lattice QCD as well as the dynamical hadronization and hadronic collision dynamics in the final reaction phase. The off-shell properties of quasi-particles- masses and widths - are described within the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) and strongly depend on the temperature.

We calculate the different cross sections for perturbative partons (massless on-shell particles in the vacuum) and for dynamical quasi-particles (off-shell particles in the QGP medium as described by the DQPM) using the leading order Born diagrams [2]. We find that the finite width of the quasi-particles in the DQPM-which encodes the multiple partonic scattering - has little influence on the cross section for qQ ->qQ as well as gQ ->gQ scattering except close to thresholds. Thus when studying the dynamics of energetic heavy quarks in a QGP medium the spectral width of the charm quarks may be discarded.

Using the obtained on- and off-shell cross sections we have calculated the transport properties of the charm quarks in an equilibrated QGP such as the relaxation time [3], dynamical collisional energy loss, drag and diffusion coefficients, longitudinal and transverse momentum fluctuations, etc.

Finally we incorporate the charm scattering processes in the PHSD transport approach and study the dynamics of heavy quarks in realistic heavy-ion collisions addressing observables such as the elliptic flow v_2 and R_AA.

Early measurements conducted at RHIC experiments have provided compelling evidence of jet quenching. In more recent years LHC experiments have confirmed these observations at a higher collisional energy, which allows full jet reconstruction over a much wider kinematic range. Jets are reconstructed in ALICE utilizing both the central tracking system for the charged constituents and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the neutral constituents. One of the most important challenges of jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is the large fluctuating background energy density coming from the underlying event. A data-driven method has been used to correct for it which, combined with the unfolding of the detector effects, makes it possible to compare with other experimental results and theoretical predictions. Jet spectra will be reported for Pb-Pb and for pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 ATeV. The pp measurement serves also as the baseline for the determination of the nuclear modification factor, which shows a strong suppression of jet production in central Pb-Pb collisions.

We propose and discuss new azimuthal observables for anisotropic flow analyses which can be measured for the first time with our new framework. Effects of finite detector granularity on multi-particle correlations are quantified and discussed in detail. We point out the existence of a systematic bias in traditional differential flow analyses which stems solely from the applied selection criteria on particles used in the analyses, and is also present in the ideal case when only flow correlations are present.

We employ this framework to study deformed U+U collisions, asymmetric Cu+Au collisions and the effect of deformation in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. A combined study of these heavy ion systems with varying initial geometries can provide a unique opportunity to determine the origin of different sources of fluctuations that affect global observables like multiplicity and flow. We study the sensitivity of multiplicity, eccentricity and their event-by-event distributions to the details of initial state geometry. Results are compared to a two component MC-Glauber model implementation that includes Negative-Binomial multiplicity fluctuations. We argue that measurements of global observables for these systems at RHIC can constrain the mechanism of multi-particle production [4].

Poster session,poster,Color path-integral Monte-Carlo simulations of strongly coupled of quark-gluon plasma,"Filinov, Vladimir","Joint Institute for High Temperatures, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia",Unknown,"Based on the quasiparticle model of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a color quantum path-integral Monte-Carlo (PIMC) method for calculation of thermodynamic properties and -- closely related to the latter -- a Wigner dynamics method for calculation of transport properties of the QGP are formulated. The QGP partition function is presented in the form of a color path integral with a new relativistic measure instead of the Gaussian one traditionally used in the Feynman-Wiener path integrals. A procedure of sampling color variables according to the SU(3) group Haar measure is developed for integration over the color variable. It is shown that the PIMC method is able to reproduce the lattice QCD equation of state at zero baryon chemical potential at realistic model parameters (i.e. quasiparticle masses and coupling constant) and also yields valuable insight into the internal structure of the QGP. Our results indicate that the QGP reveals quantum liquid-like rather than gas-like properties up to the highest considered temperature of 525 MeV. The pair distribution functions clearly reflect the existence of gluon-gluon bound states, i.e. glueballs, at temperatures just above the phase transition, while meson-like bound states are not found. The calculated self-diffusion coefficient agrees well with some estimates of the heavy-quark diffusion constant available from recent lattice data and also with an analysis of heavy-quark quenching in experiments on ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, however, appreciably exceeds other estimates. The lattice and heavy-quark-quenching results on the heavy-quark diffusion  are still rather diverse.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Gluon transport equation in the small-angle approximation and the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University,USA,"To understand the evolution of a dense system of gluons, such as those produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, is an important and challenging problem. We describe the approach to thermal equilibrium using the small angle approximation for gluon scattering in a Boltzmann equation that includes the effects of Bose statistics. The role of Bose statistical factors in amplifying the rapid growth of the population of the soft modes is essential. With these factors properly taken into account, one finds that elastic scattering alone provides an efficient mechanism for populating soft modes, and in fact leads to rapid infrared local thermalization. 

Furthermore recent developments suggest that high initial overpopulation plays a key role and may lead to dynamical Bose-Einstein Condensation. The kinetics of condensation is an interesting problem in itself. By solving the transport equation for initial conditions with a large enough initial phase-space density the equilibrium state contains a Bose condensate, and we present numerical evidence that such over-populated systems reach the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in a finite time. It is also found that the approach to condensation is characterized by a scaling behavior. Finally we discuss a number of extensions of the present study.

Using the gauge-gravity correspondence approach, we study the patterns of conserved charge fluctuations in two types of holographic models for QCD, the D4/D8 and the D3/D7 models. We compute and compare the quark number susceptibilities in both models and find an interesting common feature of the two: at very strong coupling higher order susceptibilities are suppressed and the conserved charge fluctuations become purely Gaussian. In light of the state-of-the-art lattice QCD results we also discuss what we can learn from these susceptibilities about the underlying degrees of freedom in the $1\sim 2 T_c$ quark-gluon plasma and examine the viability of different ideas such as holography, quasi-particles, as well as bound states. From analysis of second order cross-flavor susceptibilities we conclude that the bound states exist and are important in the $1\sim 2 T_c$ region. Based on that we have further constructed model with  predictions for several ratios of fourth-order susceptibilities that are in good agreement with lattice QCD results.

The extracted radii are in the range 1-5 fm, reaching highest values for very high multiplicity pPb, also for similar multiplicity PbPb collisions, and decrease with increasing $k_{T}$. The dependence of radii on multiplicity and $k_{T}$ largely factorizes and appears to be insensitive to the type of the colliding system and center-of-mass energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ferenc', 'last_name': 'Siklér', 'fullName': 'Siklér, Ferenc', 'id': '1728683', 'affiliation': 'Wigner RCP, Budapest (HU)', 'emailHash': '9d5b24b874f66d8ffeb3eabd52d9783c', 'db_id': 1728683, 'person_id': 1867878}"

In these collisions, the nuclei are separated by an impact parameter

The interaction proceeds through the emission of a photon, generated by the electromagnetic field of one of the two nuclei, fluctuating into a quark-antiquark pair,that interacts with the target nucleus.

The cross section for this process is sensitive to the gluon
distribution in the nucleus and can therefore probe the nuclear gluon shadowing.

The ALICE Collaboration has performed the first measurement of the
coherent $\psi$(2S) photoproduction cross section in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.

This charmonium excited state is tagged via the $\psi(2S) \rightarrow
l^{+} l^{-}$ and $\psi(2S) \rightarrow J/\psi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decays,

QCD phase diagram,parallel,From conserved charge fluctuations to the QCD critical point,"Schmidt, Christian",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"Higher order cumulants of fluctuations of conserved charges are an important diagnostic tool for the thermodynamic properties of strong interacting matter close to freeze out [1] at LHC energies as well as in the entire energy range covered with the beam energy scan (BES) at RHIC. We present recent progress on the calculation of conserved charge fluctuations with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ action). In particular we will focus on higher order cumulants up to 6th order of net baryon number, net electric charge and net strangeness fluctuations. We will discuss how these quantities approach the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures, the perturbative limit at high-T [2] and analyze to what extent they show sensitivity to universal scaling behavior, *i.e.* we estimate the relative strength of contributions from the regular and singular part of the free energy. Based on this analysis we discuss consequences for the QCD phase diagram and the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the QCD partition function. The latter can be used to locate the QCD critical point. Furthermore, we comment on the signature of the QCD critical point in various ratios of conserved charge fluctuations that are measured in the BES at RHIC.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Differential HBT method to analyse rotation in heavy ion collisions,"Csernai, Laszlo",Department of Physics and Technology,Unknown,"With increasing beam energies the angular momentum of the fireball in peripheral heavy ion collisions is increasing.  The earlier predicted rotation effect and Kelvin Helmholtz Instability, leads to space-time momentum correlations among the emitted particles. For these reactions two particle correlations are studied. A specific combination of two particle correlation measurements is proposed, the Differential Hanbury Brown and Twiss method, which can sensitively detect the rotation of the emitting system. In case of azimuthally symmetric systems without rotation the new method gives zero signal, while it is sensitive to the rotation in the system. The method is studied in simple models and in numerical fluid dynamic model results.

Poster session,poster,Lambda Polarization in peripheral heavy ion collisions,"Csernai, Laszlo",Department of Physics and Technology,Unknown,"Due to the low viscosity and strongly interacting QGP at high LHC energies flow fluctuations were observed up to the 8th flow harmonics. Similarly rotation, turbulence and even Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability were predicted and these may be observable by different methods. Apart of the usual flow harmonics analysis, other methods like two particle correlations, or particle polarizations may arise as a consequence of these processes.  The appearance of turbulent phenomena in these experiments would be additional direct proof of the low viscosity.

In particular we observed in 3+1D fluid dynamical calculations at LHC and RHIC energies that Lambda polarization arising from thermal and mechanical equilibrium, can provide measurable signal in given azimuthal directions. The signal is predicted to be somewhat stronger at RHIC energies because the higher temperature at LHC decreases thermal vorticity (polarization) even if the angular momentum is larger at LHC. This mechanism is considerably stronger than the polarization arising from the direct electro-magnetic effect of the strong and rapidly changing fields during the collision.

In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of a nonzero bulk viscosity coefficient on transverse momentum spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy. We then extract the optimal values of the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients that are able to describe these observables. For ultracentral heavy ion collisions, measured by ATLAS and CMS, we perform this analysis using several initial condition models. For other centrality classes, we determine these coefficients using the IP-Glasma initial condition model. Our fluid-dynamical description is the most complete available and includes all possible second order terms that appear in Israel-Stewart theory, including those that couple bulk viscous pressure to shear stress. The transport coefficients of all terms are computed using kinetic theory. We find that the optimum values of shear viscosity extracted from data can be modified up to 50% when bulk viscosity is included.

"Future experimental facilities, upgrades, and instrumentation",unknown,Future upgrade and physics perspectives of the ALICE TPC,"Gunji, Taku",University of Tokyo (JP),Unknown,"The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is one of the main tracking and PID devices in the central barrel 
of the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.
It provides precise charged-particle tracking, momentum measurement, and particle identification
in very high multiplicity heavy-ion collisions.
The readout rate of the TPC is currently limited by the necessity to prevent ions from the
amplification region of the MWPC-based readout chambers to drift back into the drift volume,
which is achieved through active ion gating by operating a dedicated Gating Grid.
The relevant ion drift times limit the maximum trigger rate of the TPC to about 3.5 kHz.

In order to make full use of the increase in luminosity after the second long shutdown of the LHC,
it is foreseen to operate the detector in an ungated mode with continuous readout.
Therefore the existing MWPC readout will be replaced by a Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) readout,
which provides intrinsic ion capture capability without additional gating.
Furthermore, new readout electronics will be implemented to match the requirements of continuous
readout with GEMs.
Together with advanced techniques for online space-charge corrections, the upgrade will enable
the detector to perform to specifications at collision rates of up tp 50 kHz foreseen for 
the LHC Pb-Pb program in RUN 3. 
After the upgrade of the TPC, the data collection rate of the TPC in Pb-Pb will be increased by about a factor 100
as compared to the present system, which will enable improved measurements to understand heavy quark and quarkonium production, low-mass dielectron production, jets and jet correlations, and the production of exotic hadrons.

In this talk, the expected physics performance and status of the extensive R&D program to reach 
this ambitious goal will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Taku', 'last_name': 'Gunji', 'fullName': 'Gunji, Taku', 'id': '1728749', 'affiliation': 'University of Tokyo (JP)', 'emailHash': '1825138d8492c108edf04fd048611894', 'db_id': 1728749, 'person_id': 1867923}"
Heavy flavor,parallel,AdS/CFT heavy-quark energy loss beyond the leading order,"Horowitz, William",University of Cape Town,Unknown,"We present new predictions for the suppression of heavy quark decay products at RHIC and LHC from a NLO AdS/CFT energy loss model.  Previous predictions from a tomographic model based on only the leading order AdS/CFT contribution to energy loss and constrained by RHIC data disagreed with LHC D meson measurements.  In this work we include for the first time a correct treatment of the momentum fluctuations induced in the heavy quark motion from the strongly-coupled thermal medium: we resolve the ambiguity in the evaluation of the stochastic Langevin equations using the Wong-Zakai theorem and properly take into account the fluctuations' deviations from the Einstein relations.  The addition of the fluctuations leads to corrections to the suppression predictions, which are significant for charm quarks and their decay products.  We demonstrate how further experimental measurements can provide insight into the dominant energy loss mechanisms in, and hence the physical properties of, the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'William', 'last_name': 'Horowitz', 'fullName': 'Horowitz, William', 'id': '1728750', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': '55f364f277a24e4fba7936eefe9fac04', 'db_id': 1728750, 'person_id': 1867924}"

Suppression of the $J/\psi$ production due to color screening of the $c\overline{c}$ binding potential in the deconfined medium has been proposed as a signature of the QGP formation. High-$p_T$ $J/\psi$ measurements in $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC published recently by the STAR collaboration show significant suppression in the most central collisions. Since secondary production via $c\overline{c}$ recombination and so called cold nuclear matter effects are small at high $p_T$, these results point to the color screening features. The energy density is expected to be on average about 20% higher in $U+U$ collisions than in $Au+Au$ collisions, therefore the $J/\psi$ measurement in $U+U$ collisions at high $p_T$ can provide new insight in the study of color screening features for charmonium.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Exploiting intrinsic triangular geometry in relativistic He3+Au collisions to disentangle medium properties,"Romatschke, Paul",U,Unknown,"Recent results in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide evidence for collective expansion and flow of the created medium. We propose a control set of experiments to directly compare particle emission patterns from p+Au, d+Au, and He3+Au or t+Au collisions at the same sqrt(sNN). Using Monte Carlo Glauber we find that a He3 or triton projectile, with a realistic wavefunction description, induces a significant intrinsic triangular shape to the initial medium and that, even with viscous damping, this survives into a significant third order flow moment v3. By comparing systems with one, two, and three initial hot spots, one can disentangle the effects from the initial spatial distribution of the deposited energy and viscous damping. These are key tools to answering the question of how small a droplet of matter is necessary to form a quark-gluon plasma described by nearly inviscid hydrodynamics.

Poster session,poster,Upgrade STAR as a possible EIC detector,"Shao, Ming",Univ. of Sci. and Tech. of China,Unknown,"An Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is being considered as the next generation QCD facility to understand the fundamental question that how the visible universe is built up. More specifically, the EIC will probe the low Bjorken-x domain where  gluons and sea quarks dominate with unprecedented precision, for both nucleon and nuclei. A possible realization of the accelerator facility based on the (currently operating) Relativistic Heavy Ion Collier (RHIC), called eRHIC, is proposed. The STAR detector, as one of the two major experiments at RHIC, has planned to evolve itself to eSTAR with a suite of upgrades optimized for EIC physics programs. The major components of the baseline upgrades will be introduced. The eSTAR detector performance and a broad range of deliverable measurements, which have been identified as the flagship science cases in an EIC, are demonstrated through simulation. An eSTAR has been found to be well suitable for an initial stage of eRHIC.

It has been attributed to mechanisms that involve initial-state effects, such as gluon saturation and colour connections forming along the longitudinal direction, and final-state effects, such as parton-induced interactions and collective effects developing in a high-density system possibly formed in these collisions. In order to understand the nature of this double-ridge structure the two-particle correlation analysis has been extended to identified particles. The observed mass dependence in p-Pb resembles qualitative expectations from hydrodynamics, and is also observed in Pb-Pb collisions. A study of correlations at forward rapidity probes the low-x regime of the nucleus, where saturation effects are expected to become stronger. The possibility of accessing this regime using the ALICE forward muon detector is explored.

Poster session,poster,Multi parton interaction studies in pp and p-Pb,"Leogrande, Emilia",University of Utrecht (NL),Unknown,"Two-particle angular correlations between unidentified charged trigger and associated particles are measured by the ALICE detector in pp collisions at a centre of mass energy of $0.9$, $2.76$, $7$ TeV and in p-Pb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy of $5.02$ TeV. The particle correlations are expressed as an associated yield per trigger particle in the transverse-momentum range $0.7 < p_{\rm T}, assoc < p_{\rm T}, trig < 5.0$ GeV/$c$, to include jets down to the lowest energy (minijets). In p-Pb collisions, long-range near-side correlations, projected onto the azimuthal angle difference, are subtracted from both near- and away-side short-range correlations in order to remove the non-jet-related components, namely the double-ridge. Near- and away-side per trigger yields are studied as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at mid-rapidity. 

The extracted yields provide information about parton fragmentation at low transverse momenta, as well as about the contribution of multiple parton
interactions (MPIs) to particle production. We find that in pp collisions the uncorrelated seeds stagnate at high multiplicity, showing a limit in the number of MPIs. On the contrary, in p-Pb they increase linearly with multiplicity. Further, moving from multiplicity to geometry parameters, we observe the expected scaling of MPIs with Glauber $\rm N_{coll}$ only in the intermediate Glauber $\rm N_{coll}$ region, revealing a bias in the number of hard scatterings when estimated from the Glauber model.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emilia', 'last_name': 'Leogrande', 'fullName': 'Leogrande, Emilia', 'id': '1728778', 'affiliation': 'University of Utrecht (NL)', 'emailHash': '67fa024f82bb848d47dc0b257b2586cd', 'db_id': 1728778, 'person_id': 1867949}"

The code evaluates jet path integral involving running coupling DGLV induced radiated gluon energy loss rates as well as elastic energy loss for jets propagating though viscous hydrodynamics VISH 2+1D expanding thermal fields $T(x,y,t)$ constrained by fits to bulk low $p_T$ observables.  We compare numerical results as a function of our main control parameter, $\alpha_{max}$, an assumed upper bound on the vacuum running coupling in the infrared. A $\chi^2/d.o.f.$ analysis shows that $R^\pi_{AA}$ data from RHIC and LHC are consistent with CUJET2.0 at the $\chi^2/d.o.f.< 2$ level for $\alpha_{max}=0.22-0.27$. The corresponding $\hat{q}(E_{jet}, T)/T^3$ effective jet transport coefficient field of this model is evaluated and compared to other (HT-BW, HT-M, MARTINI, McGill-AMY) JET collaboration models [2]. We focus here on the main current jet quenching puzzle (not discussed in [2]) the underestimation of jet elliptic asymmetry, $v_2(p_T)$ at both RHIC and LHC by CUJET and most other pQCD based tomographic models. We show that relaxing the assumption that $\alpha_{max}$ is independent of the local T field can reduce the $v_2$ discrepancy between CUJET and data to the $\chi^2_{v_2}/d.o.f.< 2$ level by allowing as small as $10\%$ variations of the path averaged $\alpha_{max}(T(z))$ along in and out paths. We speculate about origin of such variations and propose additional future tests to help elucidate the ""tricky azimuthal dependence"" of jet quenching seen at RHIC and LHC.

Poster session,poster,Hadron-Quark Crossover as a Possible Resolution of Hyperon Crisis in Massive Neutron Stars,"Masuda, Kota",Univ. of Tokyo / RIKEN,Unknown,"Recent observations of two solar-mass neutron stars
bring a serious conflict between the stiff equation of state (EOS)
required from the observations and the soft EOS
with hyperons required from theory.
We call this problem the ""Hyperon Crisis"".

We propose a possible resolution of this problem
from the point of view of the smooth crossover
between the hadronic matter with hyperons and
the strongly interacting (2+1)-flavor quark matter
at around 3 times the normal nuclear matter density.
The sound velocity is found to increase in the crossover region, which
leads to a stiff EOS and hence to two solar-mass neutron stars
with reasonable radius of about 11-12 km [1,2].
Our idea is in sharp contrast to the conventional approach
of the first-order hadron-quark transition where
the EOS always becomes soft.

The above conclusion is robust in the sense that
the qualitative results do not depend on the different choices of
hadronic EOS nor the different ways of interpolation
between the hadronic EOS and quark EOS.
Also, we found that the three-body
forces acting among nucleons and hyperons play
essential role for the onset density of strangeness
mixing and the cooling of neutron stars, while
the effect of the color superconductivity does
not affect the above conclusion.

Our analyses strongly indicate the necessity of
strongly interacting quark matter inside
massive neutron stars.

Poster session,poster,Inclusive Spectrum of Reconstructed Charged Jets in Central Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV by the STAR Experiment,"Rusnak, Jan",Nuclear Physics Institute Prague,UK,"Jet interaction in the medium provides sensitive observables to study
 properties of the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy-ion
 collisions. However, due to the large and fluctuating background, full jet
 reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is an extremely challenging
 task.

In this poster, we present a new measurement of the inclusive spectra
 of reconstructed jets in central Au+Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV by the STAR collaboration at RHIC. Jets are
 reconstructed using charged tracks from the time projection chamber.

 We utilize an experimental technique in which jet reconstruction
 is stable against the emission of an additional soft hadron, even in
the high-multiplicity environment. In this technique the large combinatorial
background is suppressed by a threshold cut on the leading hadron of each
 jet candidate. This cut, however, is not safe against collinear splitting
 of hard partons and thus is systematically explored.
The jet spectra are fully corrected for background fluctuations and
detector effects
 utilizing two different unfolding techniques. We compare this measurement to the

Poster session,poster,Measurements Of Non-Photonic Electron Production And Correlation With STAR Experiment,"Rusnakova, Olga",Czech Technical University in Prague,Unknown,"Heavy quarks, primarily produced in initial hard scattering processes at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), are important tools for understanding the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The heavy quark interaction with the QGP can be studied through non-photonic electrons (NPE), which are produced from semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavor mesons. In $p+p$ collisions measurements of heavy flavor production serve as a test of the pQCD framework and are used as a baseline for comparison to measurements from heavy ion collisions. In $Au+Au$ and $d+Au$ the hot and cold nuclear matter effects can be quantified through the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$, $R_{dA}$).

Models with different assumptions describe relatively well the suppression and elliptic flow of NPE at the top RHIC energy. New observables are required to discriminate between models. An energy dependence of $R_{AA}$ and elliptic flow $v_2$ and correlations of non-photonic electrons to hadrons can be used to further probe the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium.

In this talk, we will present a new measurement of NPE production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV in a broad transverse momentum range (0.4< $p_{T}$ < 12 GeV/c). We will discuss the energy dependence of NPE production and azimuthal anisotropy measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =39, 62.4 and 200 GeV.  Nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ in Au+Au collisions and $R_{dA}$ in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV will be presented too.

As most of the newly created hadrons are produced below or slightly above their free NN-thresholds, data are usually interpreted with the help of phenomenological models, rather than comparing to elementary reference measurements. Driven by advance in detector technology, more and more rare and penetrating probes have become accessible, and still keep challenging our knowledge about the properties of the created system and its dynamical evolution.
The recently collected HADES data from Au+Au collisions at 1.23 A GeV represents in this energy regime the most advanced sample of heavy ion collisions in terms of precision and statistics (7*10$^{9}$ collected events). Using the yields and spectra of reconstructed hadrons ($\pi^{+-}, K^{+-},K^{0}_{s}, \Lambda$) provides therefore the optimal bases to test state of the art models and to question the extent of our present understanding of hadron production.

A measurement of J/$\psi$ di-electron decays at midrapidity is particularly desirable for providing insight on quarkonium formation in the plasma since cold nuclear matter effects are smaller there than at forward and backward rapidity.  The 2010 RHIC run has five times the luminosity of the last the data set used for a dielectron measurement at midrapidity. The Hadron Blind Detector (HBD) was added to PHENIX for operation in 2010 to study low mass dielectron pairs, with the goal of improving electron identification by eliminating conversion electrons from the beam pipe, and hadrons misidentified in the Ring Imaging Cherenkov and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The presence of the HBD can also be beneficial for the higher mass region and for the J/$\psi$ analysis in particular.

Jets,parallel,Quantifying jet modification as a function of energy lost and jet mass depletion,"Majumder, Abhijit",Wayne state university,United States,"Jet modification measurements to date are carried out by comparing a surviving jet, exiting a dense medium, with a vacuum (unmodified) jet at the same energy. We propose an extension to classify jet modification in heavy-ion collisions by also including the jet mass. The mass of a jet, as measured by jet reconstruction algorithms, is intimately connected to the jet's virtuality (or scale), which in turn has a considerable effect on such observables as the fragmentation function and jet shape observables. The leading hard parton, propagating through a dense medium tends to experience substantial virtuality (or mass) depletion along with energy loss, and thus accurate comparisons between surviving jets and jets produced in p-p collisions should take these effects into account. Using the event generator PYTHIA, we show the close relationship between the actual jet mass and that after applying a jet reconstruction algorithm. Using the in-medium event generator MATTER++, we demonstrate the clear difference between the mass of a surviving parton exiting a dense medium and a parton with a similar energy formed in a hard p-p event. Effects of this difference in jet mass on the ratio of fragmentation functions and jet shapes are also calculated.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Abhijit', 'last_name': 'Majumder', 'fullName': 'Majumder, Abhijit', 'id': '1728805', 'affiliation': 'Wayne state university', 'emailHash': '142826def1e1fcb2071607ebc000c9e9', 'db_id': 1728805, 'person_id': 1867521}"

Poster session,poster,RAA and v2 of muons from heavy flavour decays at forward rapidities at 2.76 ATeV,"Begum, Umme Jamil","Debraj Roy College, Golaghat, Assam, India",Unknown,"Heavy quarks produced in the initial stage of heavy ion collisions would traverse the quark gluon plasma. While traversing the quark gluon plasma, they will loose energy by colliding with quarks and gluons and also by radiating gluons. After their production, they may get fragmented into heavy mesons by picking up light quarks/antiquarks and in turn may decay through leptonic channels. These leptons would carry information of the initial stage of heavy ion collisions and also the evolution of the plasma.

In this work, we have made a detailed study for the nuclear modiﬁcation factor, RAA and elliptic flow, v2 of muons from heavy flavours decay at forward rapidities in Pb+Pb collision @ 2.76 ATeV at LHC. The pT distribution of heavy quarks produced from the initial fusion of partons, is obtained from  FONLL ( Fixed Order Next-to-Leading Logarithms) approach [3, 4]. We consider both the radiative and collision energy loss along with a boost-invariant expansion of the plasma for the prediction of RAA as well as v2. The fragmentation of heavy quarks into D-mesons is governed by Peterson fragmentation function [5].

We compare our result of muon RAA from heavy flavour in Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE data and found that our result can satisfactorily explain the experimental data. The nuclear modification factor of muons at 0-10% centrality calculated by the present formalism [2] has shown very good agreement with the ALICE data [6]. However the calculation shows more suppression while we take account the collisional energy loss. 
We also compare our result of muon v2 from heavy flavour at 20-40% centrality for Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 ATeV with the ALICE Preliminary data [7].

Achieving a good agreement with non-perturbative calculations at zero density, we extend the investigations to nonzero quark density and isospin. We present the impact of unquenching effects in the Polyakov-loop potential on the phase structure at non-vanishing quark densities and show predictions for thermodynamics at nonzero isospin. We test the reliability of those models by confronting its results with lattice data on the isospin dependence of the transition temperature.

Poster session,poster,Phase diagram of lattice QCD in auxiliary filed Monte-Carlo method in the strong coupling region,"Ohnishi, Akira",Kyoto University,Unknown,"We study the QCD phase diagram in the strong coupling region by using the auxiliary field Monte-Carlo method. Elucidating the phase diagram structure in QCD is a big challenge. The strong coupling lattice QCD is a promising machinery, in which the effective action is obtained by integrating the link variables analytically at a given order of the strong coupling expansion, then the sign problem is weakened. 

We have recently obtained the QCD phase diagram with fluctuation effects in the strong coupling limit by using the auxiliary field Monte-Carlo (AFMC) method [1]. Compared with the mean field results, hadron phase is found to be suppressed (extended) at low (high) chemical potential. These results are consistent with those obtained in the monomer-dimer-polymer (MDP) simulation [2].

It is staightforward to include finite coupling effects in AFMC. Next-to-leading order (NLO) effective action terms proportional to $1/g^2$ appear from one plaquette configurations and are found to contain four-Fermi and eight-Fermi interactions of quarks. Sequential extended Hubbard-Stratonovich transformations lead to an effective action in the bilinear form of quarks. Preliminary results seems to suggest that finite coupling effects make the sign problem more severe than in the strong coupling limit [3].

In the presentation, we also discuss the order of the phase transition based on the finite size scaling of the chiral susceptibility in the strong coupling limit. Several prescriptions to weaken the sign problem are also discussed.

Both at RHIC and LHC energies it has been observed a puzzling correlation
between the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$  and the elliptic flow $v_2$ that has challenged
all the existing models, especially for D mesons,  We discuss how the treatment of the
charm quark dynamics according to a Boltzmann or a Langevin dynamics  can be responsible
for a large part of such a puzzle. In particular, we see that depending on the angular and
temperature dependence of the scattering matrix the $v_2$ can be
quite different. In particular, once one reproduces the $R_{AA}$ with both a Boltzmann
and/or a Langevin approach the $v_2(p_T)$ that is build-up can be as different as a 50-80%.
This together with a coalescence hadronization mechanism strongly quenches the puzzling
$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ observation.
Differences between Boltzmann and Langevin dynamics can be traced back to the fact that
especially for large screening mass (nearly isotropic scatterings)  the transferred momentum
is not small but comparable with the charm mass as well as to the average momentum of the bulk.
On the other hand such differences disappear for bottom quarks which are predicted to be free
of the ambiguities coming from the difference between a Boltzmann or a Langevin approach,
and should more properly considered as heavy quarks as regards their transport in the QGP.
Our study allows also to shed lights on the different predictions of several models
currently compared with the first data at LHC on D mesons.

ion collisions can be described by a coalescence or a thermal model.
An upgrade of the ALICE apparatus is scheduled for the second long LHC 
shutdown (LS2) in 2019 and it will give access to otherwise unreachable processes. 
The new Inner Tracking System (ITS), with largely enhanced tracking precision and efficiency, and the improved readout capability of most of the ALICE detectors will be crucial for the measurement of light (anti)hypernuclei. 
The identification of light nuclei is also important for the reconstruction of the weak decays of hypernuclei in which a nucleus and a pion are emitted with a V0--like topology. A method for tagging light nuclei with the new ITS, using the information on the size of the produced pixel clusters was developed.
The study of the $\mathrm{^{3}_{\Lambda}H} \rightarrow \mathrm{^{3}He} + \pi^{-}$ decay channel has been carried out using a detailed simulation of the new ITS. The expected yield, signal-to-background ratio and significance have been determined taking into account the target integrated luminosity of 10 nb$^{-1}$ for the ALICE upgrade programme.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stefania', 'last_name': 'Bufalino', 'fullName': 'Bufalino, Stefania', 'id': '1728841', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': '3154d7540c36db82fa50e507ee9a22f2', 'db_id': 1728841, 'person_id': 1868000}"
Poster session,poster,Diffractive vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions from the Color Glass Condensate,"Mäntysaari, Heikki",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Deep inelastic scattering is a powerful tool to 
study the structure of hadrons and test our understanding of the strong 
interaction. The precise proton structure 
function measurements done at HERA have been a crucial test for 
the Color Glass Condensate effective field
theory description of the high energy hadronic interactions.
Ideally one would want to continue the analysis with nuclear targets where
gluon saturation effects are expected to be even stronger. 

Because the role of the electron in DIS events is to only act as a source of virtual
photons, one can study the same physics in ultraperipheral (large impact
parameter) heavy ion collisions. In these events the dominant process is the 
one where one nucleus acts as a photon source, and one is left with a 
similar photon-nucleus scattering as in DIS. 

Recently diffractive vector meson production in ultraperipheral collisions has
gained a lot of theoretical and experimental attention, because the cross section
is especially sensitive to the saturation effects and also probes the spatial 
distribution of gluons. For example the ALICE collaboration has measured the 
diffractive J/Psi cross sections in lead-lead collisions [1].

We calculate coherent and incoherent diffractive vector meson production from
the Color Glass Condensate framework and compare our results and predictions
with the ALICE data. We discuss the dependence on the vector meson properties and 
the modelling uncertainties. We also present predictions for proton-nucleus 
collisions. [2]

formed at the extreme energy densities reached in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.

Heavy quarks are sensitive probes of this medium, because they are produced at the initial stage of the collision and they subsequently 
interact with the medium itself.
In particular, an accurate measurement of heavy flavour production provides information on fundamental properties
of the medium, like the transport coefficients and the thermalization and the hadronization mechanisms.

Interesting results have been obtained in the first three years of data-taking at the LHC,
but there are still open questions, which would require measurements beyond the present capabilities of the ALICE apparatus. 

Among the completely unexplored fields, the measurement of the production of the heavy flavour baryons,
like $\rm{\Lambda_c}$ and $\rm{\Lambda_b}$, can bring insight on the heavy quark hadronization mechanism in the presence of a partonic medium. 

These measurements are not accessible in Pb-Pb collisions with the present ALICE apparatus and LHC luminosity.  
The ALICE upgrade planned for the second Long Shutdown in 2019 includes a new Inner Tracking System,
with three times better tracking precision. In addition, a faster readout for most of the detectors will permit to fully exploit
the increased Pb-Pb interaction rate of up to 50 kHz.

Covering the pseudo-rapidity range $2.5 < \eta < 3.6$, the MFT will be composed of six silicon pixel planes added in the acceptance of the existing Muon Spectrometer, upstream to the hadron absorber. 

Detailed results on the expected physics performances of MFT will be given in central Pb–Pb collisions for various benchmark analyses, assuming an integrated luminosity of $10~\mathrm{nb^{-1}}$ as expected for the LHC Run 3 (2020-2022).

Poster session,poster,Nonperturbative gluonic three-point correlations,"Huber, Markus",KFU Graz,Unknown,"The correlation functions of QCD are the fundamental building blocks for hadron phenomenology and strong-interaction matter studies based on functional continuum methods. A better understanding of these correlations from first principles constrains the input of more phenomenological studies.  Here, we report on the first self-consistent solution of the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for the three-gluon vertex [1]. Based on our earlier results for the propagators [2] which match data from lattice Monte-Carlo simulations, we obtain kinematically complete results for the three gluon vertex that are in very good agreement with available lattice data likewise. Feeding these results back into the propagator DSEs allows us to assess previously used model input and approximations. The full iterative solution to the coupled DSEs of pure Landau gauge QCD without quarks, which now for the first time dynamically includes the complete set of three-point  vertex functions, then provides encouraging evidence of the convergence of this type of vertex expansion for QCD.

Within this upgrade strategy, the Inner Tracking System (ITS) upgrade forms an important cornerstone, providing precise measurements for heavy-flavour interactions with the QGP medium and for the production of thermal photons and low-mass dileptons by highly improved tracking and vertexing capabilities. These new measurements would provide an insight to the study of, in particular, the thermalization of heavy quarks in the QGP and the in-medium energy loss, and to assess the initial temperature and degrees of freedom of the system, respectively.

The dijets are modeled as external sources in the energy-momentum conservation equations, which are solved on an event-by-event basis within the ideal hydro approximation. Differential anisotropic flow coefficients in the range $p_T > 1$GeV are found to be significantly enhanced if each jet deposits, on average, more than 8 GeV in the medium. Moreover, because this jet-induced extra anisotropic flow is not related to the initial fluctuations of the geometry, the correlation between the integrated $v_2$ and $v_3$ coefficients and their corresponding eccentricities previously found to hold in jetless simulations is considerably weakened. The extra amount of direct flow induced by dijets may be quantified by comparing the azimuthal dependence of dihadron correlations in dijet events with the corresponding quantity computed in events without dijets. This information can be used to give a rough estimate of the magnitude of the effective coupling between the jets and the medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rone', 'last_name': 'Andrade', 'fullName': 'Andrade, Rone', 'id': '1728854', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de São Paulo USP', 'emailHash': '8f5f0348b699d4169785bceab1afcc33', 'db_id': 1728854, 'person_id': 1867423}"

N. Gribov proposed in 1978 a method to restrict the integration domain of the path integral to only one gauge field representative of each physical field configuration. As a result, the quadratic part of the gluon propagator is modified in the infrared, so that it acquires complex poles, i.e., complex ""masses"". This implies the absence of gluons in the physical spectrum, which is a necessary condition for confinement. An analogous reasoning
may be applied to quark fields coupled to the gauge fields. As a consequence, the quark propagator also gets modified in the infrared, giving rise to unphysical propagators (i.e., with complex poles) at small momenta. Such a property is understood as a sign of both quark confinement and of the breaking of chiral symmetry in the vacuum. In this work, we study the thermodynamics of this model by exactly calculating the partition function using standard methods of finite-temperature quantum field theory.

Kiev, Ukraine",UK,"Hybrid approaches are very successful in describing the dynamics of heavy ions collisions. The hot and dense medium is described well by fluid dynamic calculations whereas hadron transport accounts for particle rescatterings in the late stages of the reaction. The application of fluid dynamics requires rapid thermalization of the system. How and whether it is reached remains debatable. In this contribution we use the UrQMD hadron transport to study the early time dynamics of heavy ion collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 3-20$ GeV. We consider the energy-momentum tensor of coarse-grained UrQMD events as a function of space and time to explore the degree of local equilibration of the system. In addition, to find out how well fluid dynamics can describe the system at these energies, we initialize UrQMD and viscous hydrodynamics in the same way and compare their $T^{\mu \nu}$ during the space-time evolution.
    At the end of the fluid-dynamical evolution particles are generated on the transition hypersurface according to the Cooper-Frye formula. This description suffers from so-called negative contributions – particles flying from outside back to the fluid-dynamical region. We compare negative contributions obtained in the Cooper-Frye description to the actual particle trajectories across the hypersurface, again in a coarse-grained UrQMD evolution, where all the microscopic information is available. We show that results of these two calculations may significantly differ and the discrepancy becomes especially large, when the transition surface is not smooth, which may be the case in event-by-event calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Dmytro', 'last_name': 'Oliinychenko', 'fullName': 'Oliinychenko, Dmytro', 'id': '1728892', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Germany; Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics.

Poster session,poster,Estimation of electric conductivity of the quark gluon plasma via asymmetric heavy-ion collisions,"Hirono, Yuji",The University of Tokyo,United States,"The quark gluon plasma (QGP), which consists of deconfined quarks and gluons, is expected to have filled the early Universe, and is also produced experimentally through the relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in BNL and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in CERN. There has been much effort to extract detailed properties of the QGP by constraining transport coefficients such as shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and charge diffusion constants.

We here propose a new way of estimating the electric conductivity of the QGP via asymmetric nucleus-nucleus collisions at ultrarelativistic energies [1]. Theoretically, lattice QCD simulations and perturbative QCD calculations have been utilized to estimate electric conductivity of the QGP. So far, the estimated values of have differed significantly from each other and experimental information is very much awaited. Very recently, asymmetric collisions between copper and gold nuclei have been performed at RHIC. We point out that Cu+Au collisions can be useful for extracting the electric conductivity of the QGP. We show that, in off-central Cu+Au collisions, a substantial magnitude of electric field directed from a colliding Au nucleus to Cu nucleus is generated in the overlapping region, by performing event-by-event calculations of produced electromagnetic fields. This happens only when colliding two nuclei carry the different number of electric charge. The electric field would induce a current in the matter created after the collision, resulting in a dipole deformation of the charge distribution in the medium. We show that the charge-dependent directed flow parameters $v_1^{\pm}$ of the observed hadrons are sensitive to the electric conductivity of the QGP.

Poster session,poster,Measurement of the Charge Balance Function at RHIC from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV,"Westfall, Gary",Michigan State University,USA,"The balance function, which measures the correlations between opposite sign charge pairs, is sensitive to the mechanisms of charge formation and the subsequent relative diffusion of the balancing charges. The study of the balance function can provide information about charge creation times as well as the subsequent collective behavior of particles.  We present charge balance functions in terms of relative pseudorapidity  ($\Delta \eta$) from Au+Au collisions at incident energies ranging from $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV and compare these results with recent results for Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV from the ALICE Collaboration [1]. We find that the charge balance function narrows as the collisions become more central and as the incident energy increases.  This behavior is consistent with the concept of delayed hadronization of a deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP). We also present balance functions in terms of relative rapidity ($\Delta y$) for identified $\pi^{+}/\pi^{-}$ pairs, $K^{+}/K^{-}$ pairs, and $p/\bar{p}$ pairs from central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  We compare to a model [2] that relates these balance functions to the correlations of deconfined up, down, and strange quarks in the QGP that is created in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV.  We find our results are consistent with two waves of quark creation in time, one early in the collision ($\sim 1$ fm/$c$) and a second occurring at hadronization ($\sim 5-10$ fm/$c$).  We find that the densities of up, down, and strange quarks in the QGP extracted from the model comparison are consistent with current lattice gauge calculations.

Poster session,poster,Constraining initial stages of heavy-ion collisions from RHIC and LHC data,"Retinskaya, Ekaterina",CEA,Unknown,"We propose a systematic approach for constraining models of initial conditions using a combined analysis of elliptic $v_2$ and triangular $v_3$ flow data with viscous hydrodynamic calculations. For $v_2$ and $v_3$ harmonics the hydrodynamic response to the initial state is dominated by linear response, which means $v_2$ is proportional to the ellipticity $\varepsilon_2$ and $v_3$ is proportional to the triangularity $\varepsilon_3$, i.e. $v_n = C_n\varepsilon_n$, where $C_n$ is the linear response coefficient. Experimental data on elliptic and triangular flow, combined with the calculation of $C_n$ in relativistic hydrodynamics, provide us with rms values of initial anisotropies $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$. By varying free parameters in hydrodynamic calculations, we get an allowed region in the (rms $\varepsilon_2$, rms $\varepsilon_3$) plane. Thus we are able to compare Monte Carlo models of the initial state with the allowed region and exclude several of these models. We provide a simple test that can be performed on any candidate model to determine its compatibility with data. We also illustrate that the effect of changing the granularity of the initial state is similar to changing the medium properties, making these effects difficult to disentangle using only these data.

Thermodynamics and hadron chemistry,parallel,"$\Omega$ and $\phi$ production in p+p, Au+Au and U+U collisions at STAR","Zhu, Xianglei",Tsinghua University,China,"Multi-strange hadrons are excellent probe to the hadronization of
the hot and dense medium produced in heavy ion collisions, since
they may decouple earlier from the hadronic system. The STAR measurements of $\Omega$ to $\phi$ ratio and $\Omega$, $\phi$ nuclear modification factors at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ at top RHIC energies are consistent with expectations from recombination/coalescence models, which assume a seemingly thermalized partonic medium created at RHIC. However, the limited statistics put large uncertainties in those measurements. The high-statistics p+p, Au+Au and U+U data collected by STAR during the years of 2011 and 2012 will enable a high-precision systematic survey of these observables. Comparing data from Au+Au and U+U collisions also allows us to identify possible different medium properties due to different system size.

Jets,parallel,A hybrid strong/weak coupling approach to jet quenching,"Pablos, Daniel",Universitat de Barcelona,Unknown,"We propose and explore a new hybrid approach to jet energy loss in a strongly coupled medium. The basis of this phenomenological approach is to treat physics processes at different energy scales differently. The high-$Q^2$ processes associated with the QCD evolution of the jet from the hard production up to hadronization are treated perturbatively, following DGLAP evolution, to which we ascribe a space-time structure. The interactions of the shower partons with the deconfined matter leads to energy loss, which is dominated by soft processes and therefore, strong coupling effects are important. These interactions are modeled as inferred from studying energy loss of energetic probes via the gauge/gravity duality. We embed this hybrid model into  a model for the production and expansion of hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and confront it to high energy jet data at the LHC. We also confront the results of this model to the energy loss mechanism dominant at weak coupling.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Pablos', 'fullName': 'Pablos, Daniel', 'id': '1728914', 'affiliation': 'Universitat de Barcelona', 'emailHash': '7dd4ea1921dfff9f9a0373d20692786b', 'db_id': 1728914, 'person_id': 1868054}"

Poster session,poster,Properties of neutral pions in a hot and magnetized quark matter,"Sadooghi, Neda","Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran",Unknown,"The study of quark matter at extreme temperature and in the presence of very strong magnetic fields has attracted much attention over the past few years. There are evidences for the creation of very strong and short-living magnetic fields in the early stages of noncentral heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Depending on the collision energies and impact parameters, they are estimated to be of order $eB\sim 1.5 m_{\pi}^{2}$ at RHIC and $eB\sim 15 m_{\pi}^{2}$ at LHC.

In this talk, we will focus on the effect of constant magnetic fields on the properties of neutral mesons in a hot and dense quark matter. In particular, we will explore the temperature (T) dependence of neutral pion masses as well as their refraction indices for various fixed magnetic fields (eB). Moreover, using the generalized PCAC relations for hot and magnetized pions, we will derive the low energy Goldberger-Treiman (GT) and Gell--Mann-Oakes-Renner (GOR) theorems for neutral pions at finite T and eB.

To do this, we will mainly use the energy dispersion relation of neutral pions, including nontrivial form factors. It will be derived from the effective action of a two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model in a derivative expansion up to second order.

We will show that the refraction index of neutral pions exhibits certain anisotropy in the transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the direction of the external magnetic field. Moreover, as it turns out, the transverse refraction indices are, in contrast to their longitudinal refraction indices, larger than unity. These results are consistent with generalized low energy GT and GOR theorems for neutral pions at finite T and eB.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Neda', 'last_name': 'Sadooghi', 'fullName': 'Sadooghi, Neda', 'id': '1728926', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran', 'emailHash': 'd6151329b6d8914a06175b95a6328d9f', 'db_id': 1728926, 'person_id': 1868060}"

Poster session,poster,Cumulative Particle Production in p+A Collisions and z-Scaling,"Aparin, Alexey",JINR,Russia,"Experimental data on inclusive charged particle spectra in p+A collisions are analyzed in the framework of z-scaling. The data on cross sections were taken by groups of G.Leksin at FNAL (Batavia), L.Zolin and V.Gapienko at IHEP (Protvino) with nuclear targets from beryllium up to tungsten. Spectra cover a special kinematics known as a cumulative region. Cumulative particles can be only produced in nuclear collisions. Their production is assumed to be sensitive to the state of the nuclear matter formed at the extreme conditions. Theory of z-scaling is developed for analysis of the cumulative processes and search for phase transition effects. The concept of z-scaling is based on principles of self-similarity, locality and fractality of constituent interactions at small scales. The momentum spectrum of the inclusive particle is recalculated to scaling function Ψ(z) which depends on self-similarly parameter z. A microscopic scenario of pA interactions in terms of momentum fractions x1, x2 is discussed. Results of the analysis are compared with the noncumulative data on high-pT hadron production in pA collisions obtained by J.Cronin, R.Sulyaev and D.Jaffe groups.

Initial state physics,parallel,A unified picture of parton multiple scattering in the small-x regime and forward physics at RHIC and the LHC,"Kang, Zhongbo",L,Unknown,"The quest for experimental signatures of small-x gluon saturation has been one of the major goals in p+A (d+A) programs at RHIC and LHC. Experimental measurements of single particle and two-particle correlations in the forward direction have revealed novel nuclear suppression patterns, which might help pinpoint the small-x gluon dynamics. At the moment there are two formalisms which can both describe reasonably well the nuclear suppression observed in these experiments. One is the so-called higher-twist factorization approach, which describes the parton multiple scattering in terms of the power corrections to the differential cross section [1,2].  The other one is the so-called small-x color glass condensate (CGC) approach [3]. So far the precise connection between these two approaches has not been established. In this talk, we demonstrate how the multiple parton scattering picture and the small-x gluon saturation picture are related and show how the transition from a dilute parton system to a dense gluon saturation region occurs.  Our work unifies the two approaches in studying the nonlinear small-x parton dynamics. On the example of forward rapidity photon production in p+A collisions, we demonstrate that in the broad transition region between a dilute parton system and a deeply saturated regime the two approaches give identical results. This work also helps understand the constraints on the small-x phenomenological studies.

In this talk we investigate the noncongruence of the deconfinement PT and compare it with the nuclear liquid-gas PT at subsaturation densities. The used equation of state is calculated from the chiral SU(3) model, which is one of the few models for the deconfinement PT, which contains quarks and hadrons in arbitrary proportions (i.e., a “solution”) and gives a continuous transition from pure hadronic to pure quark matter above a critical point. The study shows the universality of the applied concept of noncongruence for the two PTs and illustrates the different typical scales involved. In addition, we find a principle difference between the liquid- gas and the deconfinement PTs: in contrast to the ordinary Van-der-Waals-like PT, the phase coexistence line of the deconfinement PT has a negative slope in the pressure-temperature plane. As another qualitative difference we find that the noncongruent features of the deconfinement PT become vanishingly small around the critical point.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthias', 'last_name': 'Hempel', 'fullName': 'Hempel, Matthias', 'id': '1728938', 'affiliation': 'Basel University', 'emailHash': 'a7df25475491c1dbb0c7f26873fdb2a6', 'db_id': 1728938, 'person_id': 1868068}"

initial hard scattering processes and thus they experience the whole

the mechanisms of energy loss and hadronisation in the hot and dense 
state of matter, that is expected to be formed in the collision. In order 
to investigate these medium effects proton-proton (pp) and proton-nucleus (p-A)

complementary approach has been recently studied, in which less stringent selections are applied and the background

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Early isotropization of the quark-gluon plasma,"Epelbaum, Thomas",IPhT,Unknown,"In recent years, the problem of thermalization in Heavy Ion Collision has received much attention, but has yet to be solved.

 The issue is the following: on one hand, viscous hydrodynamics simulations suggest that the matter produced in such collisions (called the Quark Gluon Plasma, or QGP) behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, and does so very shortly after the collision (around 1 fm/c). Since hydrodynamics has local thermal equilibrium in its prerequisites, this tends to show that the QGP has thermalized during the very early stages of the collision. On the other hand, theoretical models (based on microscopic theories like the Color Glass Condensate, or CGC) predict that the QGP is very far from local thermal equilibrium at the initial time (among other non-thermal features, its energy-momentum tensor is very anisotropic).

 One of the approaches developed to study this non-perturbative problem in QCD is a resummation scheme that amounts to averaging over classical fields, with random initial conditions given by a one loop calculation in the CGC framework.

We present here the results that we obtained by following this approach – the so-called classical statistical approximation or CSA, showing an early isotropization of the system compatible with viscous hydrodynamics.

 We show that the final observables are sensitive to the initial state fluctuations and its granularity, as well as to the shear viscosity in the hydrodynamic stage. Fortunately the simultaneous reproduction of rapidity/$m_T$ distributions from NA49 and newer elliptic flow data from STAR can constrain both the granularity of the initial state and shear viscosity in hydrodynamic phase. We also explore the impact of different equations of state on final observables, and the possibility to discriminate between them.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Iurii', 'last_name': 'Karpenko', 'fullName': 'Karpenko, Iurii', 'id': '1728965', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Germany; Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics, Kiev, Ukraine', 'emailHash': '5501c33bc03ff4bfa730e4170f8a0a6c', 'db_id': 1728965, 'person_id': 1868038}"
Poster session,poster,New results on hadron spectra in Be+Be collisions from NA61/SHINE at the CERN SPS,"Kaptur, Emil Aleksander",University of Silesia (PL),Poland,"The NA61/SHINE experiment performs a detailed study
 of the onset of deconfinement and search for critical point
 of strongly interacting matter by colliding nuclei
of different sizes (protons, Be, Ar, Xe and Pb) at various
beam momenta in the SPS energy range.

The study of the onset of deconfinement is carried out by comparing inclusive hadron spectra from the recent Be+Be data taking campaign to the NA61/SHINE reference results on p+p interactions, as well as Pb+Pb data from the NA49 experiment.

The new Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) allows for excellent centrality measurement and determination of projectile spectator number with one nucleon precision in a model independent way.

First evidence for collectivity in Be+Be collisions is observed based on the transverse mass spectra of negatively charged pions. The spectra are corrected for detector effects, as well as feed-down from weak decays and secondary interactions. The shape of the mid-rapidity transverse mass spectrum in central Be+Be collisions is non-exponential in the soft regime. This feature, also observed in the Pb+Pb data, may indicate transverse collective effects in Be+Be collisions.

The analysis of Be+Be data allows to extract the mean multiplicity of negatively charged pions from the rapidity spectrum and normalize it to the mean number of wounded nucleons. The results are compared with the corresponding ones obtained for p+p and central Pb+Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emil Aleksander', 'last_name': 'Kaptur', 'fullName': 'Kaptur, Emil Aleksander', 'id': '1728969', 'affiliation': 'University of Silesia (PL)', 'emailHash': '1ff96d7b3aa3f1e527e492c7e14da0f2', 'db_id': 1728969, 'person_id': 1868086}"

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Viscous corrections to photon emission in heavy-ion collisions,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectrum and its anisotropy coefficients, $v_n$, are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1,2]. In this talk, we will present state-of-the-art calculations of event-by-event photon emission from nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies including both shear and bulk viscous corrections. Momentum spectra of thermal photons and their $p_T$-differential anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ ($n$ up to 5) are computed, both with and without accounting for viscous corrections to the standard thermal emission rates. Viscous corrections to the rates are found to have a larger effect on the $v_n$ coefficients than the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic flow anisotropies. Effects from non-zero initial flow and viscous pressure tensor to photon spectra and their anisotropies are also investigated by evolving fluctuating initial density profiles with free-streaming on the event-by-event basis before matching to hydrodynamics. Complementary to the majority of hadronic observables, thermal photons provide us with additional constraints on the evolution of the viscous pressure tensor as well as the early dynamics of heavy-ion collisions. Their anisotropic flows, especially higher order $v_n$, can be used as a sensitive viscometer for the quark-gluon plasma.

created in the collision of two heavy
nuclei. Elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $\phi$ meson in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV has provided a clear evidence for partonic collectivity[1]. This was possible because of the small hadronic interaction cross section and early freeze-out for $\phi$ mesons[2].  On the other hand hadrons like protons (with similar mass as $\phi$ meson) have significantly large hadronic interaction cross section and freeze-out late. Therefore, comparison between $v_{2}$ of $\phi$ meson and proton 
will be useful to understand the dynamical evolution of the hot and dense media created in such collisions.

In order to study the QCD phase structure, RHIC has conducted the beam energy scan program since 2010. In this talk, we report the measurement of $p_{T}$ integrated $v_{2}$ of $\phi$
mesons as a function of center of mass energy from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV
to demonstrate the decrease in partonic contribution to collectivity
with the decrease in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We compare the $\phi$-meson
$v_{2}$  to the corresponding values for protons. At high collision
energies, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $>$ 27 GeV for example, we observe similar
values for the  integrated $v_{2}$ for both protons and $\phi$ meson. At lower energies, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$  $<$ 19.6 GeV, however, $\phi$-meson $v_{2}$ become much smaller, indicating that hadronic interactions become dominant in the energy region.
 Further we compare to
transport model calculations with and without partonic interactions to emphasize our
conclusions.  In addition, the effect of hadronic re-scattering on $v_{2}(p_{T})$ will be shown by
comparing  $v_{2}(p_{T})$ of $\phi$ and proton. The study of re-scattering
effect on $v_{2}$ will be further corroborated by  using various

Poster session,poster,Bottomonium melting from a stochastic potential,"Rothkopf, Alexander",H,Unknown,"Understanding the suppression patterns of heavy Quarkonium promises valuable insight into the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. Here we present simulations of Bottomonium real-time evolution [1] in an idealized, i.e. static, QGP at high temperature, based on the open-quantum systems concept of stochastic potential [2]. 

If a heavy Quarkonium bound state is submerged in the QGP, it is subject to screening and scattering from the surrounding light partons. Effective field theory tells us that under such circumstances its correlation function obeys a Schrödinger equation with a complex potential V(r).

We interpret the resulting loss of correlations with the initial state, i.e. the presence of Im[V], as decoherence, which is induced by the thermal fluctuations of the medium. To incorporate this phenomenon into the non-relativistic description, we use a purely real potential, whose values are stochastically varied at each time step by purely real noise.  It is the spatial noise correlations that are then intimately related to Im[V].

Based on this setup, we discuss the intricate interplay between state mixing and thermal (de-)excitations, which governs the real-time evolution of Bottomonium vacuum initial states, as they propagate in the QGP.

Poster session,poster,Charm Quark Medium Modification within a Linearized Boltzmann Approach,"Moreland, J. Scott",Duke University,USA,"Heavy-flavour probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) have yielded a number of surprising results. Due to their large mass and the temperature scale of the collision,
it was anticipated that the charm and bottom quarks would interact weakly with the produced medium. It therefore came as a surprise when experimental results for D mesons indicated 
charm quarks with small $R_{AA}$ and large elliptic flow $v_n$. This suggests that heavy-flavour probes are sensitive to the collective dynamics of the QGP medium which are now 
well described by viscous hydrodynamics.

What is, however, not so well understood is the value of the coupling of the heavy quarks to the QGP medium. In this study, we couple the evolution of open charm quarks to 
viscous hydrodynamics using a linearized Boltzmann equation [1] with pQCD based matrix elements for the heavy-quarks interacting with the QGP medium.

We compare the elastic energy loss transport coefficients $\hat{e}$ and $\hat{q}$ in this scheme for an infinite medium at finite temperature against those extracted using a Langevin equation 
which describes the kinematics of the Boltzmann equation in the limit of small momentum transfer. We also examine the charm response to a thermal medium with fixed velocity profile, and present
first results for charm elastic energy loss in a realistic medium described by viscous hydrodynamics coupled to a hadronic afterburner [2].

Poster session,poster,Dynamical simulation of a linear sigma model near the critical point,"Wesp, Christian",Goethe Universität Frankfurt,Unknown,"The intention of this study is the search for signatures of the chiral phase transition and the impact of non-equilibrium effects. 
To investiage the impact of fluctuations, e.g. on the baryon density, near the chritical point or the chiral phase transition of QCD, we developed a 3+1D numerical, non-equilibrium simulation of an effective linear sigma model. Chiral fields are approximated as classical fields, quarks are described by quasi-particles via a Vlasov equation. For additional dynamics, kinetic quark-quark and chemical quark-sigma interactions have been implemented. The challenge is the consistent description of hard interactions between particles and classical fields.

Poster session,poster,The thermodynamics of heavy light hadrons at freezeout,"Sharma, Sayantan",Bielefeld University,United States,"In the discussion of hadronization at or close to the freeze-out
curve, statistical (hadron resonance gas) models play an important
role. In particular in the charmonium sector, regeneration models
are considered which rely on the fact that charmonium states can
form again already at temperatures well above the QCD crossover
or hadronization temperature. An important ingredient in these
considerations is the regeneration or hadronization of open charm
states.

In this talk we report on a lattice QCD analysis of correlations of 
open strangeness [1] and charm [2] with other conserved quantum numbers
like the net baryon number and electric charge. We analyze the temperature 
range in which an uncorrelated hadron resonance gas (HRG) provides an 
adequate description of such correlations. This limits the range of 
validity of HRG based thermodynamics in open flavor channels and 
provides an estimate for the melting temperature of heavy-light hadrons. 
We find that the strange or charmed HRG description breaks down at 
or very close to the QCD crossover temperature.

In order to identify electrons, a RICH detector and several layers of TRDs will be employed. The RICH detector will be operated with CO2 as a radiator gas, a spherical glass mirror plane, and MAPMTs as photon detectors.  The mirror system consists of about 70 square mirror tiles of an area of about 40x40 cm2 each. To verify the developed RICH concept a laterally scaled prototype has been constructed, in which all modules of the main components have approximately the same dimensions and properties as foreseen for the full detector. The mirror system of the prototype consists of four tiles, which enables studies of mirror-boarder effects on Cherenkov rings and their reconstruction and fit quality. The prototype has been implemented in the CBM software framework with realistic properties of the detector components. Its performance has been simulated and measured during beam times at the CERN-PS facility with electron-pion beams of momenta between 2 and 10 GeV/c.

Besides many important aspects that guaranty successful operation of the detector, the determination of upper limits of gas impurity and mirror displacements have systematically been simulated and measured.

Heavy flavor,parallel,Theoretical predictions of jet suppression: a systematic comparison with RHIC and LHC data,"Djordjevic, Magdalena","Institute of Physics Belgrade, University of Belgrade",Unknown,"Accurate theoretical predictions of jet suppression are necessary for studying the properties of QCD matter created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. However, testing the prediction accuracy - and extracting useful qualitative knowledge - is often limited by constraining the predictions to only few experimental probes at a time, and by using free parameters. To address this issue, we will present comprehensive suppression predictions, which run across all available probes and different centrality regions at RHIC and LHC. To generate these predictions, we use the finite size dynamical QCD formalism that we previously developed, together with its recent extensions to finite magnetic mass [1] and running coupling [2]; this formalism is integrated into a numerical procedure that uses no free parameters in model testing. We obtain a very good agreement with the experimental results across all particle species [2,3], for different centrality regions [4], and for both RHIC and LHC. We will also discuss improved qualitative understanding of the relevant experimental data, which follows from such comprehensive comparison.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Charge asymmetry dependency of $\pi$/K anisotropic flow in U+U and Au+Au collisions at STAR,"Shou, Qi-Ye","SINAP, BNL",USA,"Theoretical studies [1] indicate that in relativistic heavy collisions a chiral magnetic wave at finite baryon density could induce an electric quadrupole moment, which will lead to a difference in elliptic flow of hadrons with opposite charge. The magnitude of this difference is predicted to be proportional to the charge asymmetry $A_\mathrm{ch}$, defined as $A_\mathrm{ch} \equiv \langle \left (N_{+} -N_{-} \right )/\left ( N_{+} +N_{-}  \right ) \rangle$. Charge-asymmetry dependency of the pion elliptic flow has been observed in Au+Au collisions at the STAR experiment. On the other hand, it is argued that the local charge conservation at freeze-out, together with the characteristic shape of $v_{2}(\eta)$ and $v_{2}(p_\mathrm{T})$, may also contribute to elliptic flow splitting as a function of $A_\mathrm{ch}$. This can be manifested by implementing the corresponding measurement for higher flow harmonics $v_{3}$ [2].

Here, we present STAR's measurements of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for charged pions and kaons at low transverse momentum range (0.15 $< p_\mathrm{T} <$ 0.5 GeV/c), as a function of event charge asymmetry ($A_\mathrm{ch}$) in both U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 193 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

Right solution can be obtained, using correlations between multiplicity and sum of all, – light and heavy, - fragment-spectators (Fig a).  Great significance of heavy fragment analysis has already been pointed out in the works of NA-49 (H. Appelshauer, 1998) and NICA (M. Golubeva, 2013), BNL 2012 RHIC&AGS Annual Users’ Meeting ”eRHIC – understanding the initial condition of the heavy ion”. 
In the present work investigation of initial conditions for interactions of light – (C, O, Ne), medium - (Si, S) and heavy – (Au, Pb) nuclei with heavy – (Ag/Br) and light – (C/N/O) nuclei have been analyzed on the data of JINR-AGS-SPS target emulsion experiments with limited statistics. The analysis example for interaction Si (14.7) and S (200) A GeV with (C/N/O) nuclei is presented on fig. Detection of both shower particles and fast fragment-spectators with identical possibilities in this method open the way to the useful study of this problem. The analysis has shown, that nonlinearity in the multiple and fragmentation processes to become stronger with the impact parameter increasing.  Physical explanation of the fluctuation growing consists in new effect creation – nonregularity in the production of heavy fragment-spectators with intermittent mass distribution (Fig c, d, top). Fluctuations in this case correspond to the Levy flights, but not small Gaussian variations in a data series around the mean. Integrally the patterns of heavy and light fragmentation are totally different. In the proton fragmentation mass distributions have the most smoothly – Gaussian-like – behavior both in central and peripheral interactions (Fig d, c, d, below). New process, - the strong intermittent behavior in the heavy mass fragment distributions with high probability occur in colliding of light nuclei.

First, we develop a formula in which canonical partition functions are constructed

the grand partition functions as a function of the fugacity, $\exp(\mu/T)$, from which
we can investigate the system when it goes near to the QCD phase transition line.
We discuss the applicability limit that comes from the maximum number of the

We extend the fugacity to the complex number region, and show the Lee-Yang zero

We calculate the Lee-Yang zero structure by the lattice QCD simulations, and
find a very striking feature, i.e., the Roberge-Weiss transition at the deconfinement

The produced heavy quarks travel through the medium, experiencing all the stages of its evolution and finally they hadronize inside or outside the medium. The measurement of the charm production cross section in pp collisions provides an interesting insight in QCD processes and the necessary reference for heavy-ion studies.

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) designed to carry out comprehensive measurements of the particles produced in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions, in order to study QCD matter at high temperature and energy density and the transition between confined matter and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). D mesons are reconstructed through their hadronic decay channels. The detectors used for the D-meson reconstruction and selection are: the Inner Tracking System (ITS), the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Time-of-Flight (TOF). In addition the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) was used, with energy threshold ranging from 1.5 to 2 GeV, to trigger on events with a high energy particle, which allows us to have a data sample enriched of events with heavy flavours.

Since heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are produced on a shorter time scale with respect to the hot fireball, they are suited to probe the interaction dynamics inside the medium.

The ALICE collaboration has measured the production of open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via the semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The azimuthal distribution of heavy-flavour hadrons reflects the initial spatial anisotropy of the heavy-ion collision in case of sufficient re-scattering of the heavy quarks in the hot and dense matter. Therefore the heavy-flavour elliptic flow, the second harmonic in the Fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution, is an observable sensitive to the degree of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the medium at low $p_{\rm T}$, as well as to the path length dependence of the energy loss of heavy quarks at high $p_{\rm T}$.

The elliptic flow measurements are presented for prompt charm mesons, i.e D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, D$^{*+}$, and heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity, as well as for heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV for various centrality intervals.

In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks are regarded as

subsequently interact with it.
The nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of

Indeed, due to their large mass, charm and beauty quarks are produced in initial hard scattering processes among partons of the colliding nuclei, before the formation of the QGP, and they traverse the medium and interact with its constituents.
The ALICE Collaboration measured the production of open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV respectively.
A strong suppression of the open charm hadron yields at high $p_{\rm T}$ was observed in Pb-Pb collisions relative to pp interactions: this effect is attributed to a substantial in-medium energy loss of the charm quarks.
Further insight into the effects of the medium on charm and beauty quarks can be obtained by measuring the angular correlations between open heavy-flavour hadrons and charged hadrons.
The comparison of the correlation function in pp and Pb-Pb collisions can provide deeper information on the way heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and can spot possible modifications to the charm parton shower and hadronisation in the presence of the medium. Furthermore, by studying the correlations of electrons from heavy-flavour decays and the charged hadrons in pp, it is possible to statistically separate the charm and beauty contributions to the yield of heavy-flavour decay electrons, making this analysis an excellent tool to test pQCD calculations.
The observation of double-ridge long range correlations in p-Pb collisions for light-flavour hadrons could originate from a collective behaviour of the system, as well as from gluon saturation in the initial state (color glass condensate). The same effect can be studied for heavier quarks via the correlation between heavy-flavour hadrons (or their decay electrons) and charged particles.
Results from the correlation analyses, performed using the data collected with ALICE in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented in this contribution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sandro', 'last_name': 'Bjelogrlic', 'fullName': 'Bjelogrlic, Sandro', 'id': '1729112', 'affiliation': 'NIKHEF (NL)', 'emailHash': 'f570becd6acd7db066ea991a18e03e8d', 'db_id': 1729112, 'person_id': 1868189}"

Since we aim to confront the $p_T$ spectra at mid-rapidity of all observed hadrons, $\pi$, K, p, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, $\phi$ and $\Omega$, the system is highly contained. There are thousands of soft hadrons and hard jets produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV. Minijets can fragment into soft patrons with multiplicities so high that their effects on the patrons created in the soft interaction of the bulk can't be ignored. So the primary feature of our work is to quantify the effect of hard and semihard jets on the soft sector. What we find is that the soft patrons generated by the hard patrons are so overwhelming at LHC, compared to the situation at RHIC. It becomes clear that the hadronization problem at LHC is drastically different from that at RHIC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lilin', 'last_name': 'Zhu', 'fullName': 'Zhu, Lilin', 'id': '1729119', 'affiliation': 'Sichuan University', 'emailHash': '99b483092f05d64404e90ba374516b4f', 'db_id': 1729119, 'person_id': 1868195}"
Jets,parallel,Measurement of hadron composition in charged jets from pp collisions with the ALICE experiment,"Lu, Xianguo",Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,"Jets are defined in QCD as cascades of consecutive emission of partons from an initial hard scattering.

They are produced in an early stage of the collision from hard scattered partons that hadronize and eventually form jets as a spray of charged and neutral particles.
The measurement in p-Pb provides an important reference to study the effects of cold nuclear matter on jet production and hadronization. This is possible because the formation of a hot and dense medium like in Pb-Pb is not expected. Besides the comparison to Pb-Pb collisions, p-Pb analyses can also be an important constraint for the nuclear parton density functions providing information about the nuclear environment.
In terms of analysis techniques, the exact evaluation of the background from the underlying event is an important ingredient. It is much smaller than in Pb-Pb so that the methods for background estimation need to be refined.
Our jet analysis of p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is performed on data taken by the ALICE detector at the LHC in the beginning of 2013. The focus of our analysis lies on the jet spectra and their comparison to the spectra from pp collisions, including results depending on the multiplicity or centrality classes given in p-Pb collisions.

Jets can be used to probe the QGP.

Earlier studies at the LHC have shown that jet production is suppressed in heavy-ion collisions. This suppression is attributed to elastic and/or radiative interactions between the parton and the QCD medium, which transport jet momentum outside the jet cone. The dependence of the energy loss on the in-medium path length provides insight into the energy loss mechanisms. This path-length dependence can be studied by measuring the jet yield with respect to the event plane.

This contribution will show results of measurements of charged jet yields in central $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76 $ TeV Pb-Pb collisions with respect to the second order event plane.

In nucleus-nucleus collisions, the more loosely bound excited states, as the $\psi(2{\rm S})$, 
are expected to melt at lower temperatures than the ground state (J/$\psi$).
In proton-nucleus collisions at LHC energies, the charmonium formation time is larger than the 
time spent by the ccbar pair traversing the nucleus. Therefore, the cold nuclear matter 
is expected to affect in a rather similar way the J/$\psi$ and $\psi(2{\rm S})$.

ALICE results on the inclusive $\psi(2{\rm S})$ production at forward rapidities ($2.5 < y < 4$), will

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Lattice QCD based equation of state at finite baryon density,"Huovinen, Pasi",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"The effects of non-zero baryon density are expected to become
important in hydrodynamic modeling of heavy collisions below the
highest energy at RHIC. Recent calculations in effective models and in
QCD using Dyson Schwinger equation suggest that the transition in QCD
remains a crossover up to baryon chemical potentials of about 800MeV [1]. 
If so, the equation of state relevant for hydrodynamic models can be
calculated on the lattice using Taylor expansion. However, except for
the coefficients of the lowest order, there are large cutoff effects
in present lattice calculations for non-zero chemical potentials.

To extend our previous parametrization of the equation of state [2] to
finite baryon density, we employ the continuum extrapolated lattice
QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients in order two [3], and
complement them with coefficients in order four and six evaluated
using p4 action [4]. To avoid large cutoff efects these coefficients
are smoothly matched to those of hadron resonance gas at low
temperature. Some preliminary results were reported in [5]. We also
show how the hydrodynamical evolution is affected by this equation of
state in the energy range relevant for SPS and the RHIC energy scan.

Poster session,poster,QCD effective potential with strong electromagnetic fields at zero and finite temperatures,"Ozaki, Sho",KEK,Japan,"Motivated by the observation that non-central heavy-ion collisions in RHIC and LHC are accompanied by extremely strong magnetic fields, much attention has been paid to the QCD dynamics in strong electromagnetic fields. In particular, the change of vacuum properties such as quark condensates has been investigated in terms of both effective models and lattice simulations. While both of these approaches predict, at zero temperature, an enhancement of quark condensates in the presence of magnetic fields (called ""magnetic catalysis""), their results do not coincide with each other at finite temperatures. Namely, at finite temperatures, lattice QCD simulations at physical point predict ""inverse"" magnetic catalysis which is never reproduced by effective models. In order to bridge the gap between effective models and lattice QCD, an analytic study of QCD in the presence of strong magnetic fields should be necessary.

As a first step towards understanding the effects of magnetic fields on QCD vacuum properties, we analytically investigate the QCD effective potential within one loops of gluon and quark including all order interactions with chromo-electromagnetic fields and $U(1)_{em}$ electromagnetic fields at zero and finite temperatures. First, we will show the results of QCD effective potential with strong magnetic fields at zero temperature [1]. The resulting effective potential is renormalization-group invariant. We found that the chromo-magnetic field prefers to be parallel to the external magnetic field, and thus the QCD vacuum with strong magnetic fields is spatially anisotropic. This result is consistent with recent lattice data [2,3]. Furthermore, the chromo-magnetic condensate increases with an increasing magnetic field, which supports the ""gluonic magnetic catalysis"" as observed in current lattice data [2]. 

Next, we will discuss the effective potential with strong electromagnetic fields at finite temperatures [4]. In particular, we focus on the influence of electromagnetic fields on the center symmetry in QCD. The pure Yang-Mills theory has the center symmetry (being spontaneously broken at high temperature), but dynamical quarks explicitly break it. We will show how the electric and magnetic fields affect the explicit symmetry breaking, by using the effective potential for the Polyakov loop. We will also discuss a relation between the property of the Polyakov loop in the presence of magnetic fields and the inverse magnetic catalysis, whose importance is pointed out from the recent lattice study [5].

We consider ensembles of gauge field configurations generated from the MV-model classical Gaussian effective action as well as solutions of the JIMWLK high-energy renormalization group equation with fixed and running coupling. The initial fields exhibit domain-like structure over distance scales of the order of the saturation scale. At later times universal scaling emerges at large distances for all ensembles, with a nontrivial critical exponent. A similar behavior has earlier been seen in calculations of the gluon transverse momentum spectrum, which becomes independent of the initial spectrum of gauge fields (i.e. the initial unintegrated gluon distribution) for momenta less than the saturation scale.

Poster session,poster,"The performance of the ALICE High Momentum Particle Identification Detector in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions","Olah, Laszlo",Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),HU,"The High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID) is specifically developed for track-by-track particle identification in ALICE. The HMPID is a ring imaging Cherenkov detector with an active area of 10.5 m$^2$ of caesium iodide photo-cathodes installed in MWPC-s filled with pure methane. It identifies $\pi^{\pm}$ and K$^{\pm}$ in the momentum range $1-3$ GeV/$c$, and p in the range $1.5-5$ GeV/$c$.

The performance of the photo-cathodes during LHC Run1 period (2010-2013) has been investigated by the analysis of data from pp and p-Pb collisions. The number of reconstructed photons shows that there was no caesium iodide quantum efficiency loss (ageing), which is consistent with the measured integrated charge dose of $0.0133$ mCcm$^{-2}$. A Monte Carlo procedure is ongoing to extract the quantum efficiencies, from the first results we found that no significant difference between the extracted quantum efficiencies and the measured ones at the production time of the photo-cathodes (2003).

The performance of statistical and track-by-track particle identification have also been investigated. The statistical PID was successfully applied to the measurement of inclusive hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The purity and contamination of particles have been extracted from Hijing Monte Carlo generated events (Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV) and used as an input for the ongoing physics studies using track-by-track PID","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Laszlo', 'last_name': 'Olah', 'fullName': 'Olah, Laszlo', 'id': '1729154', 'affiliation': 'Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU)', 'emailHash': 'c87c257dc7639c650d10016e5f3918ed', 'db_id': 1729154, 'person_id': 1868215}"

The general trend of the data exhibits a decrease in the value of $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and $\langle dE_{T}/d\eta \rangle$ at mid-rapidity normalized by the number of participant pairs as $\langle N_{part} \rangle$ decreases.  However, it has been demonstrated that identified particle flow data scales with the number of constituent quarks over a large range of collision energies, so the number of quark participants may be a more appropriate scaling variable for particle production.  The average number of quark participants, $\langle N_{qp} \rangle$, as a function of centrality is estimated using a modified Glauber model that replaces each nucleon participant with quark participants. This estimate is then used to investigate the $N_{qp}$-scaling of $\langle dN_{ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and $\langle dE_{T}/d\eta \rangle$ using PHENIX data for 200 GeV d+Au collisions and for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt(s_{NN})=$ 200, 62.4, 39, 27, 19.6, and 7.7 GeV with special emphasis on the validity of scaling with $\langle N_{qp} \rangle$ at the lower energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jeffery', 'last_name': 'Mitchell', 'fullName': 'Mitchell, Jeffery', 'id': '1729156', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '7f0306c219417909aeb908161e1353f6', 'db_id': 1729156, 'person_id': 1868216}"
QCD at high temperature and/or density,unknown,The QCD Equation of State at $\mathbf{\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^4)}$,"Hegde, Prasad",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Hydrodynamic models of heavy-ion collisions have increasingly begun to rely on lattice results for the Equation of State[1]. While the lattice has the advantage of being a first-principles approach to QCD, the notorious sign problem prevents a direct determination of the equation of state and other thermodynamic observables at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$.

In our talk, we will present results from a high-statistics calculation of all the Taylor coefficients upto sixth order in a $(\mu_B,\mu_Q,\mu_S)$-expansion of the pressure. Our calculation allows us to extrapolate, for the first time, the equation of state on the freezeout curve upto $\mathcal{O}(\mu_B^4)$ while our sixth-order results show that the truncation error is not more than a few % upto $\mu_B/T\sim1.5$. Thus our equation of state should be useful in describing both the LHC results as well as results from RHIC beam energy scan down to $\sim$20 GeV. We will also use our results to construct the isentropic equation of state for strangeness-neutral systems.

Our lattice QCD calculations make use of the gauge ensembles generated using the HISQ action[2,3]. Our lattice sizes range from $6\times24^3$ to $12\times48^3$. The pion mass ($\sim$160 MeV) is nearly equal to its physical value while the strange quark mass has been set to exactly its physical value.

Poster session,poster,Charge dependent elliptic flow from anomalous hydrodynamics,"Hongo, Masaru",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"Anomaly-induced transport effects, like the chiral magnetic effect or the chiral separation effect, have recently attracted much attention. These effects represent the existence of dissipationless vector and axial currents along the magnetic field and are expected to occur in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. It has been pointed out that the coupling between the chiral magnetic effect and the chiral separation effect provokes a novel type of gapless collective excitation in the plasma, called chiral magnetic wave (CMW). 

The experimental search for anomaly-induced transports in heavy-ion collisions is now ongoing. Since the CMW leads to an electric charge quadrupole deformation in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions, the elliptic flow parameter $v_2$ would be charge-dependent, which can be considered as a signal of anomalous transports [1]. The STAR Collaboration observed such a charge dependent elliptic flow for pions $\Delta v_2 (\pi^\pm)$ [2]. This result seems to be consistent with the prediction from a simple model [1], in which propagation of non-interacting waves under spatially and temporally uniform temperature and homogeneous magnetic field is considered. However, since the QGP created in heavy-ion collisions is drastically expanding, it is necessary to describe the space-time evolution of the QGP together with that of electromagnetic fields in order to assess the contribution from anomalous transports.

In this study, we numerically solve anomalous hydrodynamic equations and apply it to the dynamics of heavy-ion collisions [3]. We develop a numerical code which is applicable to the description of the QGP under arbitrary external electromagnetic fields. We describe the propagation of the CMW in the expanding QGP under spatially and temporally inhomogeneous external electromagnetic fields. We analyze the charge-dependent elliptic flow $v_2^\pm$ and discuss possible implications for experimental observations of anomalous transport effects.

Poster session,poster,Tri-hadron Azimuthal Correlations and the Conical Emission by Strong Color Fields without Collective Flow in p+p and p+Pb Collisions,"Ozonder, Sener","Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington",USA,"The azimuthal angular correlations (""ridge"") were well-known from the A+A collisions where the collimation of the hadrons in the azimuthal angle was ascribed to the collective flow of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The di-hadron correlations in the high multiplicity p+p and p+Pb collision events from the CMS experiment revealed a ridge structure that was very much like the ones from the A+A collisions. These results, which were not predicted by Monte Carlo based QCD simulations, attracted great interest since the formation of QGP and consequently a collective flow were not anticipated in p+p and p+Pb collisions. 

Soon after the report of the CMS collaboration, it was shown that this ridge can be explained by the multiladder QCD diagrams (""glasma diagrams"") that were enhanced at the saturation scale at small-x. By means of these diagrams, the two particle gluon production rate can be written in terms of the unintegrated gluon distribution functions (UGD) of the colliding hadrons (or hadron and nucleus). Then, the UGD that is extracted from the running coupling BK equation (rcBK) is substituted in this formula. Later these correlated two gluons can be related to the observed di-hadrons via fragmentation functions. The strength of azimuthal correlations depends on the momenta and relative azimuthal angle of the di-hadrons as well as the saturation scale. It should be emphasized that this framework does not demand any collective flow to explain the data. Despite the excellent agreement between the data and the results of the glasma diagrams, however, the analyses employing the collective flow and the application of hydrodynamics to p+p and p+Pb collisions are also successful. Hence, this puzzle demands a study of tri-hadron correlations that may possibly settle the origin of the ridge in p+p and p+Pb events. Tri-hadron correlations will also put the Color Glass Condensate and saturation physics to more stringent test. 

We calculate tri-hadron correlations from the glasma diagrams by using the rcBK UGDs for p+p ($\sqrt{s}=$7 TeV) and p+Pb ($\sqrt{s}=$5.02 TeV) collisions for several values of the momenta and relative azimuthal angle of the trigger and two associated hadrons. We repeat these calculations for different values of the saturation scale to predict the systematics of the track multiplicity of the actual measurements. Our tri-hadron azimuthal correlation results show that the glasma diagrams give rise to structures similar to the conical emission or Mach cone that have been discussed previously in the context of A+A collisions. However, we see these structures not only on the away side but also on the near side as distinguished from the Mach cone in A+A collisions which occur only on the away side. The azimuthal correlations due to the multiladder gluon production (glasma) are also clearly distinguished from the correlation structures that might be caused by other medium effects such as energy loss and jet deflection. We make quantitative predictions for the high multiplicity tri-hadron azimuthal correlations for p+p and p+Pb collisions at LHC. These tri-hadron correlations have not been measured yet by the experimental collaborations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sener', 'last_name': 'Ozonder', 'fullName': 'Ozonder, Sener', 'id': '1729219', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Nuclear Theory, University of Washington', 'emailHash': '5bb65e490aa573be460a4273115b8e0b', 'db_id': 1729219, 'person_id': 1868253}"
Poster session,poster,Complex heavy quark potential at high temperature from lattice QCD,"Burnier, Yannis",EPFL,Switzerland,"A precise definition of the $Q\bar Q$ potential at high temperature
was obtained in the framework of effective field theories. 
The potential was calculated in hard thermal loop resummed perturbation theory and happens to be complex [1]. 
In ref. [2] the definition was adapted to Euclidean lattice simulations but difficulties were encountered with the infinite real time limit required to extract the potential.
I will discuss how to disentangle precisely the short and long time physics from which the potential is defined [3] 
and present a new method to perform the analytic continuation from Euclidean to real time [4]. 
After these improvements, the procedure to extract the potential produces precise results [5] and its application to quenched lattice QCD data [4, 6] gives us an estimate of both the real and imaginary part of the nonperturbative complex $Q\bar{Q}$ potential across the phase transition. The final results are very encouraging since the precision obtained for the real part of the potential is below the percent level. Even if only a rough estimate of the imaginary part is obtained in ref [4], we show that it could also be settled by more precise Euclidean data.

Poster session,poster,Medium response in asymmetric di-jet events from full 3-D hydro,"Tachibana, Yasuki",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"We develop a fully (3+1)-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model with source terms to analyze large angle emission of low-$p_{T}$ particles in asymmetric di-jet events. In Pb-Pb collision experiments at LHC, a large number of low-$p_{T}$ hadrons at large angles from a sub-leading jet is observed in asymmetric di-jet  events by the CMS Collaboration [1]. The total transverse momentum of the leading-jet balances that of the sub-leading jet together with the low-$p_{T}$ particles spread over wide angles from sub-leading jet axis.Motivated by the experimental fact, we analyze asymmetric di-jet events to understand the transport dynamics of the transverse momentum balance in the three-dimensionally expanding QGP. 

 The space-time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) realized experimentally in heavy ion collisions at collider energies is well described by relativistic
hydrodynamics. High energy partons are also produced through initial hard scatterings and have to traverse the QGP fluid. The energy and momentum of these traversing partons are lost in the medium through strong interaction between them. Thus jet quenching phenomena provide an important clue to extract one of the substantial properties of the QGP, namely stopping power against energetic partons. The question then arises, ``Where and how do these lost energies and momenta diffuse inside the medium?"" Suppose deposited energy and momentum are quickly equilibrated, the traversing jet particles induce the collective flow in the QGP fluid. On the other hand, the background QGP fluid is by no means static, but expands itself at relativistic velocity. As a consequence, the collective flow results from the interplay of expansion of background QGP fluid and wake induced by jets.

 This is the first attempt to numerically solve relativistic hydrodynamic equations with source terms without linearization in fully (3 + 1)-dimensional  Milne coordinates. In the hydrodynamical equations, the source terms are introduced to account for the energy-momentum deposition from the energetic partons. It is shown that Mach cone-like structures are formed in the medium and distorted strongly by radial flow of the expanding background QGP fluid. As a result, we find that the low-$p_{T}$ enhancement at large angles from the quenched jet compensates exactly the di-jet $p_{T}$-imbalance, similar to that observed by the CMS. Therefore these low-$p_{T}$ particles spread over wide angle are originated from deposited energy and momentum transported by the collective expansion of the QGP.

One of the key diagnostic probes of strongly-interacting matter at extreme conditions are dileptons. Dilepton measurements performed so far in heavy-ion collisions at various energies have found that the major challenge is to subtract the combinatorial background which overwhelms the interesting signals such as the rho spectral distribution, direct radiation from the fireball at intermediate invariant masses, and charmonia.  This background is of different physical origin for dielectron and dimuons, and differs as function of invariant mass. Therefore, the systematic and statistical errors of the extracted signals will be substantially minimized by measuring both electron and muon pairs. The CBM detector is designed as a multi-purpose device which will be able to measure hadrons, electrons and muons in heavy-ion collisions.  Electrons will be measured using a Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector in combination with a Transition Radiation Detector.  For muon measurements, the RICH detector will be replaced by a large area Muon detection system consisting of alternating layers of hadron absorbers and tracking chambers.

The higher harmonics of azimuthal anisotropy $v_{n}$ of produced particles are believed to be a sensitive way to characterize the system created in the heavy-ion collision [2,3]. Moreover higher harmonics of $\phi$ meson will be the clean probe for the early dynamics since $\phi$ meson freeze-out early and it has small hadronic interaction cross section. The relation between various $v_{n}$ is sensitive to thermalization and dissipation effects in heavy-ion collision [4].

In this presentation we will present the first measurements of $\phi$-meson $v_{3}(p_{T})$ and $v_{4}(p_{T})$ at mid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 200 GeV. Centrality dependence of $v_{3}(p_{T})$ and $v_{4}(p_{T})$ will be shown and compared to corresponding $v_{2}$ values. Ratios between various harmonics will be presented and possible implication of those results will be discussed.

Methods currently used to analyze anisotropic flow (event plane

fluctuations was recognized. Our new method uses more detailed
information on how the azimuthal correlation depends on the 
pseudorapidity (and/or transverse momentum) of both particles. 
This information can be used to extract flow fluctuations directly
from experiment. 
When correlations are due to flow, all the eigenvalues are
positive. The eigenmode analysis allows to write the correlation
matrix as a sum, where each term in the sum corresponds to a different
component of flow fluctuations. 
The largest eigenvalue corresponds to the usual rms 
$v_n$, which depends little on the pseudorapidity $\eta$, while the
next-to-largest eigenvalues yield modes which typically oscillate as a
function of $\eta$, and which correspond to flow fluctuations. 
We study the effect of nonflow correlations, and statistical errors.

energies, which are accessible at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), are often
referred to as little bangs. 
Experiments at these energies probe the conditions which 
prevail at freeze-out, and often it is not possible to 
define the correct equation-of-state (EoS) and the conditions 
at the initial stages of the collision.
By employing hydrodynamic evolution of the fireball [1] created in the
collisions, we have
generated maps of the energy density ($\epsilon$) and temperature
($T$) of the system 
throughout its evolution. With the help of the maps, we obtain 
time evolution of the fluctuations in  $\epsilon$ and $T$.
We have shown for the first time that
the method of interpolation of fluctuations obtained from the maps
can provide a powerful technique in looking back at the initial stages of
the heavy-ion collisions.

In case of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR), 
temperature maps of the sky [2],
made by scanning in $\theta$-$\phi$ bins, provide vital information
regarding the age and composition of the Universe, galaxy formation, 
expansion rate, etc. This is possible by analyzing the map to
extract temperature fluctuations and making power spectrum. 

For heavy-ion collisions, we 
propose to make temperature maps in 
rapidity and azimuthal angle ($y$-$\phi$).  This is demonstrated by using the 
AMPT event generator. By making correspondence
with the evolution of fluctuations from hydrodynamics, 
vital information regarding the fireball can be obtained at very early stage
and throughout the evolution of the system [3].
We will present this new method, first results and make the proposal
for its application to experimental data at RHIC and LHC.

In the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame, a slice that is closer to a nucleus has a bigger longitudinal speed. Transverse energy is longitudinally boost invariant and therefore directly reflects the condition of the local rest frame (slice) irrespective of its longitudinal flow speed. It is sensitive to the longitudinal work between adjacent slices and thus carries information about the evolution of the hot and dense matter produced in heavy ion collisions. We show that the work distribution of an expanding extreme relativistic gas is a gamma distribution with a different shape parameter as compared with its non-relativistic counterpart. This implies that the shape of the transverse energy distribution in
relativistic heavy ion collisions depends on the particle contents during the evolution of the hot and dense matter. Therefore, transverse energy fluctuations provide additional insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in these collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bin', 'last_name': 'Zhang', 'fullName': 'Zhang, Bin', 'id': '1729243', 'affiliation': 'Arkansas State University', 'emailHash': 'e107ba51c5fd89dc508580d45195c95f', 'db_id': 1729243, 'person_id': 1868267}"
Poster session,poster,$\rm W^{\pm}$ boson production measurements in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Bossu, Francesco",iThemba Lab. for Accel. Based Sci. (ZA),ZA,"At the LHC, electroweak boson production measurements in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions are possible thanks to the availability of higher centre of mass energies as well as higher luminosities with respect to other ion accelerator facilities.

From a theoretical point of view, electroweak boson production can be considered to be well understood. $\rm Z^{0}$ and $\rm W^{\pm}$ bosons are produced in initial hard-scattering processes of partons and are not expected to interact with a strongly interacting medium. Therefore, measurements of electroweak bosons in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions represent a standard candle to check the validity of binary scaling and can provide important constraints to the nuclear parton distribution functions. In addition, such measurements could represent an ideal test-bench for luminosity measurements and detector performance studies.

ALICE is the experiment at the LHC designed to investigate the properties of strongly-interacting matter formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. At forward rapidities, ALICE is equipped with a muon spectrometer that allows measurements of dimuon decays of quarkonia, muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays and also $\rm W^{\pm}$ bosons in the muon decay channel. Recent results on the $\rm W^{\pm}$ boson measurement at forward and backward rapidities, with respect to the direction of the proton beam, in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Francesco', 'last_name': 'Bossu', 'fullName': 'Bossu, Francesco', 'id': '1729245', 'affiliation': 'iThemba Lab. for Accel.

Heavy flavor,parallel,Heavy-flavour production as a function of multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions,"Russo, Riccardo",Universita e INFN (IT),Italy,"The measurement of heavy-flavour production cross sections in pp collisions at the LHC provides a reference for heavy-ion studies and represents a test for perturbative QCD calculations. In p-Pb collisions, heavy-flavour measurements are essential to assess the effects due to the presence of a nucleus in the initial state, such as the modification of the parton densities and the $k_{\rm T}$-broadening resulting from multiple soft scatterings of the partons.
Heavy-flavour measurements as a function of the
multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision are sensitive to
the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production and,
in particular, could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions
(MPI), i.e. several hard partonic interactions occuring in a single collision
at high centre-of-mass energies.

In this talk we will focus on the measurement of open heavy-flavour production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in pp collisions at  $\sqrt {s}$ = 7 TeV  and p-Pb collisions at  $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}$=5.02 TeV recorded with the ALICE detector in 2010 and 2013, respectively.  D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$ and D$^{*+}$ are  reconstructed from their hadronic decay modes in the central rapidity region, and their  yields are measured in different multiplicity and $p_{\rm T}$ intervals.  

The per-event yield of D mesons in the different multiplicity intervals, normalized to its multiplicity-integrated value, and its evolution with $p_{\rm T}$ will be compared for pp and p-Pb collisions to study the contribution of MPI to open charm production in the two systems. 
 The nuclear modification factor of D mesons in p-Pb collisions, defined as the ratio of the D-meson yield in p-Pb and pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions $N_{\rm coll}$, will be discussed in terms of its multiplicity dependence.
Results obtained with different multiplicity estimators will be shown in order to better understand the connection between multiplicity and collision geometry, which is needed to determine $N_{\rm coll}$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Riccardo', 'last_name': 'Russo', 'fullName': 'Russo, Riccardo', 'id': '1729246', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f69527d60fddf93b0229cf87a37b966d', 'db_id': 1729246, 'person_id': 1868270}"

The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region ($|\eta| < 0.8$) for $p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.3$ GeV/$c$. The multiplicity correlation strength ($b_{\rm corr}$) was obtained using pairs of separate pseudorapidity and azimuthal windows and studied as a function of the separation distance between the windows in $\eta$ and $\varphi$, as well as of the size of the windows. A considerable increase of the correlation strength with the collision energy is found.

Two types of contributions -- the short-range (SR) and the long-range (LR) -- are observed. The energy dependence of $b_{\rm corr}$ is found to be weak for the SR component and strong for the LR component. The $b_{\rm corr}$ is also studied in different transverse momentum intervals, which have the same mean multiplicity. It is found that both SR and LR contributions to $b_{\rm corr}$ increase with increasing minimum threshold of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$.

This state of matter can be studied experimentally via heavy-ion collisions where the critical temperature and density for the phase transition to the QGP can be attained. Measurements of heavy-flavour (charm and beauty) production in these collisions are of particular interest. Heavy quarks are indeed produced in the early stages of the collision and experience therefore the whole evolution of the system. The ALICE collaboration has measured electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at mid-rapidity. A strong suppression of the yield of heavy-flavour decay electrons at high $p_{\rm T}$ is observed in $0-10\%$ most central collisions. Measurements of heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions are crucial to understand cold nuclear matter effects on the production in heavy-ion collisions. The production of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays has been measured with ALICE in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Electrons have been identified with the Time Projection Chamber and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). In addition, the EMCal provided a trigger during the p-Pb run of the LHC.   The trigger enhances the recorded sample of rare probes, such as high $p_{\rm{T}}$ photons and electrons.

a hot and dense hadron gas. Using a hybrid model of Ultrarelativistic
Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) and 3D hydrodynamics to simulate the

We report our systematic study of these observables using event-by-event simulations, and compare with available data from RHIC and LHC. The results strongly suggest a nontrivial temperature dependence of the jet-medium coupling and in particular its enhancement near the parton/hadron phase boundary. Recently emerging evidences for such a possibility from various other jet modelings, as well as efforts to understand such peculiar medium property from microscopic theories will also be discussed.

The prediction is made for the source functions in the LHC Pb+Pb collisions at √s= 2.76 TeV.  
         As for the baryon-baryon correlations, the  source functions of   pp, pΛ and p ̅Λ pairs are found in Au+Au collisions and used by means of FSI correlation technique for an extraction of the  scattering lengths in two-baryon  systems. The role of residual correlations in formation of the total baryon-baryon correlation function is analyzed.

Poster session,poster,Soft direct photon $v_{2}$ and $n_{q}$ scaling,"Campbell, Sarah",Iowa State University,USA,"In heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC, direct photons are produced in excess of their respective $T_{AA}$-scaled p+p spectra at low $p_T$ from 1-4 GeV/c.  These results suggest early-stage thermal partonic emission from the hot dense medium.  Additionally, these soft photons are produced with a large azimuthal anisotropy, an elliptic flow ($v_2$) as large as that of pions.  Hydrodynamic models struggle to quantitatively reproduce the large soft photon $v_2$ because the pressure gradients that generate these anisotropies need time to develop, suggesting later-stage hadronic emission.  The similarly-sized pion $v_2$ in this $p_T$ range is understood as resulting from the recombination of quarks near the phase transition as evidenced by quark number ($n_q$) scaling.  In this poster, I present a coalescence-like model to describe the soft photon flow as the result of increased photon production from $q-\bar{q}$ interactions as the system approaches confinement.  The published PHENIX soft photon and identified particle measurements are used to test this approach with both a $\chi^2$ analysis and comparison to model curves.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sarah', 'last_name': 'Campbell', 'fullName': 'Campbell, Sarah', 'id': '1729302', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State University', 'emailHash': '26432512b29b3f9b1097f6452f815b59', 'db_id': 1729302, 'person_id': 1868302}"

For a realistic description, we apply the relevant kinematic cuts and systematically include final state effects such as resonance decays and regenerations. The inclusion of the successive regeneration and decay of resonances turns out to be crucial for reconciling calculations of net-proton fluctuations with those of net-baryon number fluctuations and for obtaining reasonable freeze-out conditions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marcus', 'last_name': 'Bluhm', 'fullName': 'Bluhm, Marcus', 'id': '1729303', 'affiliation': 'North Carolina State University', 'emailHash': 'dc5db70727484b8566194e326570c192', 'db_id': 1729303, 'person_id': 1868303}"

We have quantified this observation by a systematic comparison between the calculations with different FF sets and data for several collision energies [1]. We show that especially the predictions with the most recent FFs clearly overshoot the high-$p_T$, high-$\sqrt{s}$ data even when the scale variations, and uncertainties in the PDFs and FFs are accounted for. We conclude that this behavior is due to the too hard gluon-to-hadron FFs, which calls for a complete re-analysis of the FFs using the high-$\sqrt{s}$ data at $p_T > 10\,\rm{GeV}$ where the theoretical uncertainties are only modest. We discuss also to what extent these discrepancies affect the interpretation of the LHC p+Pb collision data.

to investigate properties of a deconfined state of matter, Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). 
High $p_{\rm T}$ particle production is expected to be a powerful tool to study the QGP. 
The hadron yields in nucleus-nucleus collisions can be quantified by the nuclear modification factor, 
which is the ratio of the particle yield in A-A collisions normalized to the number 
of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions to the yield in pp collisions.
The $R_{\rm AA}$ at high $p_{\rm T}$ is significantly smaller than 1, which can be 
interpreted by the parton energy loss.
The ALICE experiment has a high resolution and high granularity photon spectrometer PHOS which 
deploys a specific trigger to enhance the high-$p_{\rm T}$ photon and neutral pion detection capability.

Neutral pion production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV has been studied. PHOS triggered 
data is used in this data analysis. 
With using this PHOS triggered data taken in 2012, neutral pion can be measured up to 40 GeV/c.
To evaluate the production cross-section of the neutral pions with PHOS triggered data, trigger 
response of the PHOS needs to be understood as a function of the reconstructed cluster energy. 
A way to evaluate the trigger response utilizing the minimum-bias data as a function of the cluster 
energy has been developed. Neutral pion trigger efficiency is then estimated with simulation. 
A method to evaluate the rejection factor with real data is developed. These techniques can be 
applied to other collision systems, too.

time the interpretation of the results and further detailed study of
the effect is rather difficult as the observable itself, the slope of
elliptic flow value on the observed charge asymmetry in the STAR TPC
acceptance, depends on the tracking efficiency and detector
acceptance. In this talk we show how one can first make the observable
robust (efficiency independent) and then make it suitable for many
differential studies, not possible before. We use this observable, a
three-particle correlator, in our model calculations to show the
sensitivity of the signal to several background effects, such as local
charge conservation, and propose experimental tests for further

We find that the PHSD approach provides correlations between the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity and the number of participant nucleons very close to results from the CGC and differs substantially from results calculated with Glauber initial conditions.

In this work we perform the first calculation of electromagnetic radiation using IP-Glasma initial conditions.  We include the contributions from pQCD photons arising from the initial hard scatterings at the early stages of the collision, and we go beyond the usual popular formulations of the fluid evolution by using a Israel-Stewart viscous hydrodynamical description that takes into account all second order terms, including those related to bulk viscous pressure. We also highlight the effect of initial flow, which appears naturally in the IP-Glasma profile. We investigate how such additional theoretical ingredients affect the electromagnetic spectra, as well as the azimuthal anisotropy coefficients. More specifically, we check how these features help in explaining the large values of photon elliptic and triangular flow observed by the PHENIX and ALICE collaborations. We further investigate how a simultaneous fit of hadronic and electromagnetic observables can enhance agreement with data of the latter without compromising the interpretation of hadron data.

Poster session,poster,The Binder cumulant in O(N)-models,"Springer, Paul",Technische Universität München,Unknown,"The phase structure of QCD is currently a much discussed topic in particle physics. In the context of this discussion we need precise knowledge about the nature of the chiral phase transition. A powerful tool to investigate it are lattice simulations. They are, however, still restricted to relatively large quark masses, far from the chiral limit, and to small volumes, which could affect the critical behavior. These two facts complicate the scaling analysis of lattice QCD results.
In the chiral limit, a continuous phase transition is expected in two-flavor QCD. Since continuous phase transitions are controlled by the long range fluctuations, only the dimensionality and symmetries dictate the universal behavior near the critical point. Therefore, more simple systems from the same universality class can be investigated in order to describe scaling behavior which is expected at the chiral phase transition in lattice QCD.
Because the long range fluctuations play such a prominent role at continuous phase transitions, it is self-evident that it is useful  to investigate precisely the behavior of higher-order critical fluctuations close to the transition point. For this purpose the so-called Binder cumulants seem to be very well suited. 
We analyze the fourth-order Binder cumulant in 3-dimensional O(2)- and O(4)-models in finite volumes using non-perturbative Renormalization Group methods.

Our result thus suggests that the free energy potential from lattice calculations is the appropriate heavy quark potential for analyzing the charmonium spectrum at finite temperature.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Taesoo', 'last_name': 'Song', 'fullName': 'Song, Taesoo', 'id': '1729370', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': 'b022404c4061e878631f015962651aea', 'db_id': 1729370, 'person_id': 1867839}"

Theoretical models tell that the angular emission patterns of the photons are different depending on their production mechanism.
Previous published PHENIX results indicate that the second order Fourier coefficient ($v_{2}$) is positive for $p_{T}$<4.0GeV/c, which is qualitatively explained by hydrodynamical model calculations, but not quantitatively.
The 3rd order Fourier coefficient ($v_{3}$) of photons has been proposed as a critical additional handle to understand photon emission.
Photons emitted under the presence of strong magnetic field created in the collision would have a significant influence on $v_{2}$ and very little on $v_{3}$.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,What the collective flow excitation function can tell about the quark-gluon plasma,"Auvinen, Jussi",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"The midrapidity slope d$v_1$/d$y$ of the directed flow $v_1$ has been predicted to be sensitive to the possible first-order phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon
plasma. The recent STAR data from the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) show that the net-proton d$v_1$/d$y$ changes sign twice within the collision energy range 7.7 - 39 GeV. To further investigate this phenomenon, we study the collision energy dependence of $v_1$ utilizing a Boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid model. Such a hybrid approach provides a natural framework for the transition from high collision energies, where the hydrodynamical description is essential, to smaller energies, where the hadron transport dominates. Calculation with dynamically evolved initial and final state shows no qualitative difference between an equation of state with cross-over and one with first-order phase transition [1], in contrast to the earlier pure fluid predictions.

We have also investigated the energy evolution of the elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ [2]. The $v_2$ analysis shows that pre-equilibrium transport dynamics are partially compensating for the diminished elliptic flow production in the hydrodynamical phase at lower energies, resulting to relatively weak collision energy dependence which is in qualitative agreement with STAR BES results. The medium described by transport is, however, too viscous to build up triangular flow, making $v_3$ the clearer signal for the formation of (near-)ideal fluid in relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Probing the non-equilibrium dynamics of hot and dense QCD with dileptons,"Vujanovic, Gojko",McGill University,United States,"Much work has been devoted to the determination of an effective value of the shear viscosity coefficient from analyses of the hadronic final states in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Electromagnetic radiation, however, constitutes a class of complementary and penetrating probes that are sensitive to the entire space-time history of nuclear collisions including its very early stages. We show that thermal dileptons (and photons) are affected by the transport properties of the fluid and by the non-equilibrium aspects of the initial state that are usually inaccessible to hadronic probes. For the first time, we explicitly demonstrate that electromagnetic spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy can be used not only to investigate the magnitude of the shear relaxation time and to differentiate between possible initial shear-stress tensors, but also to reveal the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient. We further show that the dependence of electromagnetic probes on these quantities comes mostly from processes occurring in the QGP phase. Our approach utilizes event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic simulations (MUSIC) [1], and the dilepton emission sources include contributions from charm decay and hadronic rates extracted from in-medium spectral functions [2].

system. First, we give two coupled transport equations for gluons and quarks (and antiquarks), which are derived within the diffusion approximation of 
the Boltzmann equation with only $2\leftrightarrow 2$ processes included in the collision term. These transport equations are solved 
numerically in order to study the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. Next, we discuss three different patterns of the thermalization of the quark-gluon system. At initial time, we assume that no quarks or antiquarks are present 
and we choose the gluon distribution in the form $f = f_0~\theta\left(1-\frac{p}{Q_s} \right) $ with $Q_s$ the saturation momentum and 
$f_0$ a constant. The subsequent evolution of systems
may, or may not, lead to the formation of a (transient) Bose condensate, depending on the value of $f_0$. The three patterns of thermalization are as follows: (a) thermalization 
without gluon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) for $f_0\leq f_{0t}$, 
(b) thermalization with transient BEC for $f_{0t} < f_0 \leq f_{0c}$ and (c) thermalization with BEC for $f_{0c} < f_0 $. Here, the values of $f_{0t} $ and $f_{0c} $ depend on $N_f$. When $f_0 \geq 1 > f_{0c}$, the formation of BEC starts at a finite time $t_c\sim\frac{1}{(\alpha_s f_0)^2}\frac{1}{Q_s}$. We also find that the equilibration time 
for $N_f = 3$ is typically about 5 to 6 times longer than that for $N_f = 0$ at the same $Q_s$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Li', 'last_name': 'Yan', 'fullName': 'Yan, Li', 'id': '1729386', 'affiliation': 'IPhT Saclay', 'emailHash': '995d08201cdc49cbb8230bea56fea991', 'db_id': 1729386, 'person_id': 1868345}"
QCD at high temperature and/or density,unknown,Hadronic resonance production measured by ALICE at the LHC,"Bellini, Francesca",Universita e INFN (IT),Unknown,"Hadronic resonances constitute a valuable probe for the properties of the medium formed in heavy-ion collisions.

The ALICE experiment has measured the production of the K(892)$^{0}$ and $\phi$(1020) resonances at mid-rapidity in different collision systems at LHC energies. Resonances are reconstructed via their hadronic decay in a wide momentum range, by exploiting the excellent particle-identification capabilities of the Time-Projection Chamber and the Time-of-Flight system.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Multiplicity fluctuation from hydrodynamic noise,"Hirano, Tetsufumi",Sophia Univ,Unknown,"We discuss multiplicity fluctuation
caused by noises during hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon fluid
created in high-energy nuclear collisions. 
In this talk, we claim the following non-trivial consequences within a framework of relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics [1]:

 - Multiplicity (being approximately proportional to entropy) fluctuates
from event to event 
due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of dissipative currents such as shear stress tensor and bulk pressure
even if the initial state is the same in a macroscopic sense.
 - *Event-averaged* entropy has to increase with time
so that the system obeys the second law of thermodynamics as it should be. 
Entropy in a certain event can, however, *decrease* with time temporarily and locally due to the hydrodynamic fluctuations. 
 - The probability of decreasing entropy during hydrodynamic evolution
is, of course, very small in general. Interestingly, the probability is quantified by the *fluctuation theorem* [2]
as known in the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

We first discuss the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [2].
The fluctuation theorem has been a milestone in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
since the linear response theory was established. Since the fluctuation theorem contains the Green-Kubo formula
at long-time limit, it is believed to capture some important properties of non-equilibrium processes
away from equilibrium.

We next solve the stochastic equation for dissipative currents
together with the temporal evolution equation for the energy density
in one-dimensionally expanding coordinate [3]
to demonstrate that the final entropy fluctuates from event to event for a given initial condition.
During the time evolution of the total entropy in a certain event,
reduction of the entropy occurs due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of
dissipative currents.  
We show that the probability of decreasing entropy just obeys the above-mentioned fluctuation theorem.

We finally discuss the physics consequences of hydrodynamic fluctuations on final observables.
Fluctuation of the final entropy is taken over by the one of multiplicity.
Thus we discuss multiplicity distribution functions from a hydrodynamic fluctuation point of view. 
We also discuss observables in small system
such as p+p or p/d+A collisions since the effect of fluctuations
are of particular importance in such smaller systems.

Heavy-flavour quarks, i.e., charm and beauty, are effective probes for studying the QGP, as their relatively large mass limits their production predominantly, if not exclusively, to hard scattering processes in the very first moments of the collisions, before the QGP formation. As the quarks propagate through the hot and dense medium created in the Pb-Pb collisions they interact with the medium and lose energy via elastic collisions and gluon radiation.

The study of the modification of the angular correlation between D mesons and charged hadrons, as well as the correlation between D mesons and electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp and p-Pb collisions can provide relevant information on the energy-loss mechanism. This applies in particular to the dependence of the correlation on the path length traversed by the charm quark in the medium, and to possible medium modifications of charm-quark fragmentation and hadronisation. In pp collisions, these measurements can be sensitive to the different production processes of heavy-flavour quarks, e.g., pair production vs. gluon splitting.

Poster session,poster,Disentangling the soft and hard components of the pp collisions using the spheri(o)city approach,"Ortiz Velasquez, Antonio",Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX),Unknown,"The complexity of the proton-proton interactions requires many theoretical models to describe the different features of the data. Typically, they are incorporated in MC event generators and their parameters are tuned to describe the average behaviour of specific quantities. However, this approach does not allow to understand in detail the impact of the different components  in the measurable observables. This task is particularly important to really understand the physics of the hadronic interactions which so far have been taken as the baseline to learn about the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions.

In this work a new method to extract meaningful information from the pp data is proposed, the aim is to use observables sensitive to e.g.  partonic stages where collective effects are possible. The approach is based on the use of the event structure variables (sphericity and spherocity). This was developed in the framework of Pythia 8.180 since its pQCD content seems very well adapted for this goal. For minimum bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=0.9$ and 7 TeV a discussion of the interconnection among event shapes, multi-parton interactions, abundances of final semi-hard quarks/gluons and color reconnection, is done. A study of the identified particle transverse momentum, $p_{\rm T}$, spectra and their ratios will be presented for isotropic (soft) and jetty-like (hard) events; and as a function of multiplicity. The results indicate that the baryon-to-meson ratio for soft events is larger than for the jetty-like ones, the latter case gives particle ratios compatible with NLO. The observations are explained in terms of the competition between gluons and quarks for the particle production at intermediate $p_{\rm T}$. The results are compared to LHC data and the similarities between the observed effects and those measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Antonio', 'last_name': 'Ortiz Velasquez', 'fullName': 'Ortiz Velasquez, Antonio', 'id': '1729437', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX)', 'emailHash': '870e972b50881a4f61b88035d15b5364', 'db_id': 1729437, 'person_id': 1868368}"

Status of Jet Reconstruction in Cu+Au collisions at 200 GeV from PHENIX

Jet reconstruction in heavy ion collisions is a vital tool to explore medium effects, including energy loss and modification of parton fragmentation functions. In 2012, making use of the unique capabilities of RHIC to collide different nuclei, the PHENIX experiment collected a large dataset of Cu+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Studying reconstructed jets in collisions of asymmetric heavy ions is crucial in understanding the interplay between collision geometry and initial and final state effects. In central Cu+Au collisions, the Cu nucleus is completely embedded within the Au nucleus. The study of Cu+Au collisions as a function of centrality can help disentangle the 'core' of the collision region, characterized by a large energy density, and the outer 'corona' region. 

We will present the status of jet reconstruction in Cu+Au and a reference sample of p+p collisions at 200 GeV using the anti-kT algorithm.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arbin', 'last_name': 'Timilsina', 'fullName': 'Timilsina, Arbin', 'id': '1729444', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State Univeristy', 'emailHash': '0e77c603082584f3dc8f0060d2125ccc', 'db_id': 1729444, 'person_id': 1868374}"
Electromagnetic probes,parallel,The QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate temperature and high baryon density: study of dimuon production in the 20-160 AGeV interval at the CERN SPS,"Usai, Gianluca",Universita e INFN (IT),Italy,"The structure of the QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate temperature and high baryon density is still almost unexplored. In this regime,  the QGP and hadronic phases should be separated by a first order transition region. On the other hand, for sufficiently low baryonic chemical potential a simple cross-over is expected. The end point of the first order transition region is the so called critical point.

Measurements of the ratio $K^+/\pi^+$ vs energy performed at the CERN SPS by the NA49 collaboration showed that the early stage produced in central Pb-Pb collisions at $E_{lab}$=30-40 AGeV may have reached the transition line - marking the onset of deconfinement.  However, this interpretation is still controversial. Dilepton measurements with a rich set of independent observables offer a completely  independent way to shed light on the onset of deconfinement and at the same time on the issue of  chiral restoration. The CERN SPS is unique for systematic investigations along these lines, due to its  wide beam energy range from 20-160 AGeV coupled to very high luminosities over the full range. 

The objective of this talk is to present a new proposal for measuring dimuon production in a comprehensive energy scan at the SPS - specifically both below and above the maximum of the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio. To advance the field with  measurements which could provide quantitative insight,  a further significant increase in  the precision and in the collected statistics  with respect to the past reference experiment NA60 is needed. To this end, we propose a novel NA60-like apparatus, with improved performance, based on the coupling of a muon spectrometer  to a a silicon pixel spectrometer in the vertex region before the absorber. 

The first key element is a high-precision measurement of the temperature $T$ of the thermal dimuon continuum in the mass range $1.1\lt M\lt2.5$ GeV (IMR) vs. beam energy. The temperature is accessible through the spectral shape of the mass spectra, and since mass is a Lorentz-invariant, $T$ is immune to  any motion of the emitting sources and thus purely  thermal,  in contrast to the slope parameters of dilepton $m_T$ spectra or photon $p_T$ spectra. At top SPS  energies, values of about 200 MeV were found, indicating dominantly partonic emission sources. For decreasing beam energies one should expect that the partonic contribution will also decrease, becoming negligible at the onset of deconfinement. Thus the onset of deconfinement might be tagged by a precision measurement of $T$ in the IMR. 

The second  element is related to the transverse momentum spectra, which encode - besides temperature - also radial flow, another key property of the fireball. At topmost SPS energies the 
effective temperature extracted from the $m_T$ spectra vs mass shows an increase up to $M\sim1$ GeV corresponding to $\rho$ production which is maximally coupled to radial  flow through pions. At 1 GeV a sudden drop occurs and the temperature is constant at 180-200 MeV - a sign of production of thermal dimuons from the partonic medium without  any flow (at the SPS). The evolution of the pattern of $T_{eff}$ vs. $M$ towards lower energies,  in  particular  the possible decrease or disappearence of the  drop, will  be most revealing: thermal radiation from multi-pion processes should exhibit a monotonic increase of $T_{eff}$ vs $M$ so that around the onset of deconfinement the drop should vanish.

The new experiment should reach a sensitivity at the MeV level  in the measurements of $T$ and $T_{eff}$ vs $M$. This will be possible  integrating luminosities at least an order of magnitude larger than in case of NA60 or so while retaining a good signal to background ratio -  well above than 1/100 in the IMR even in Pb-Pb central collisions.

For masses below 1 GeV (LMR), at high energies, hadronic many body models describe $\rho$  production and the notion that the total baryon density drives the broadening is now well accepted. At lower energies, the baryon density gets maximal, thus the effects of $\rho$ broadening can be measured with utmost precision. 
In this measurement the mass resolution is a key factor and we propose to improve it over NA60 by a factor 2-3, reaching $\sim$10 MeV at the $\omega$ mass.

The experimental apparatus must have also a good $p_T$-$y$ coverage down to the lowest beam energies. In the talk  the detector perfomance in terms of acceptances at different energies and mass resolution  will be discussed in detail.   The physics performance will be presented on the basis of simulations of Pb-Pb collisions at 20 and 40 AGeV including a background estimate and a modeling of the involved physics processes - in medium $\rho$ in the LMR, multi-pion processes and partonic radiation in the IMR. An overview of the possible detector technologies together with a cost estimate will be also presented. Finally, an experimental program consisting of measurements at different energies and/or different collision systems will be discussed in terms of  beam time needed to collect the required event statistics.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gianluca', 'last_name': 'Usai', 'fullName': 'Usai, Gianluca', 'id': '1729445', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN (IT)', 'emailHash': '241ca76612b9689badf72eb36c50c626', 'db_id': 1729445, 'person_id': 1868375}"

Poster session,poster,Applications of Chaos Many-Bode Engine for the analysis of relativistic nuclear collisions at 200 A GeV/c,"Jipa, Alexandru","Atomic and Nuclear Physics Chair, Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest, Romania",UK,"Recently, we proposed a C# code, namely Chaos Many-Body Engine [1,2], for chaos analysis of relativistic many-body systems with reactions. Preliminary tests using a simplified relativistic nuclear collisions model resulted in some encouraging results for describing global physical quantities obtained in C-C collisions at 4.5 A GeV/c in experiments performed at JINR Synchrophasotron (SKM 200 Collaboration) [3]. The code allows introduction of some additional interactions among particles in the participant region, thus improving the description of the particle production in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The code permits, also, the investigation of time evolution of the collisions, from the initial moment up to the freeze-out. The time evolution step can be below 0,1 Fm/c. Using the possibilities for code development, we try to improve the agreement between our code and existing experimental results. Two collisions will be discussed, namely Cu-Cu at maximum BNL energy, and d-Au at the same energy. The code predictions and experimental results improve the agreement when we include more collisions and particle production mechanisms in the participant region. The time evolution of the fireball is well reflected by our code (Fig.1), for an evolution time between 0,1 and 200 Fm/c.
For the time evolution, code hypotheses do not cover all aspects and some behaviors of the experimental results are not completely described. Work is in progress for improving the agreement with the experimental results.

Because of their large masses, charm and beauty quarks are mostly produced in initial hard partonic interactions and thus can be used to probe the medium created in such collisions. The $p_{\rm T}$ differential heavy-flavour yield is an observable sensitive to the energy loss of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium. In addition to the QGP, the presence of cold nuclear matter in the initial state may affect the production of heavy-flavour hadrons. To quantify these effects and confirm the role of final-state effects in Pb-Pb collisions, a reference measurement in p-Pb collisions is necessary. Electrons from semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons can be used to measure charm and beauty quark production. The measurement of heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE will be presented.

In particular, the scattering length and effective range of interaction can be extracted from fits of femtoscopic correlation functions. This technique has applications in the study of hyperon-hyperon interactions, where precise scattering measurements are still needed. However, there are non-trivial complications due to the possible residual correlations introduced by feed-down from other hyperons when studying lambda particles.

The elliptic azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV, measured by the ALICE collaboration, has been used to probe the properties of the QGP. The measurement of $v_2$ of heavy-flavour decay electrons at low transverse momentum tests whether heavy quarks take part in the collective expansion of the deconfined medium.

However, under these conditions -- especially at ultrarelativistic energies -- in the case of two non-identical particles (Lambda--anti-Lambda) a noticeable role is played by two-particle annihilation ( two-quark, i.e. quark-antiquark, and two-gluon ) sources, which lead to the difference of the correlation tensor from zero. In particular, such a situation may arise, when the system passes through the ""mixed phase"" and -- due to the appearance of free quarks and gluons in the process of deconfinement of hadronic matter -- the number of two-particle sources strongly increases .","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Valery', 'last_name': 'Lyuboshitz', 'fullName': 'Lyuboshitz, Valery', 'id': '1729489', 'affiliation': 'Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna', 'emailHash': 'efec48dae557ea840afc77518e16cbcd', 'db_id': 1729489, 'person_id': 1868264}"

The model further contains a scalar dilaton for asymptotic freedom and confinement, a scalar tachyon for chiral symmetry breaking and a charge density for chemical potential. Solving the classical gravity equations numerically leads to an identification of a chirally symmetric and chirally broken phase with a phase transition in between. The phase transition line on the $T,\mu$ plane can have both 2nd and 1st order segments. The computation can be extended down to the quantum phase transition at $T=0$.

Jets,parallel,Qualitative extraction of qhat from combined jet quenching at RHIC and LHC,"Wang, Xin-Nian",Central China Normal University/Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,USA,"On behalf the JET Collaboration

Within five different approaches to parton propagation and energy loss in dense matter, a phenomenological study of experimental data on suppression of large $p_T$ single inclusive hadrons in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC was carried out.  The evolution of bulk medium used in the study for parton propagation was given by 2+1D or 3+1D hydrodynamic models which are also constrained by experimental data on bulk hadron spectra. Values for the jet transport parameter $\hat q$ at the center of the most central heavy-ion collisions are extracted or calculated within each model, with parameters for the medium properties that are constrained by experimental data on the hadron suppression factor $R_{AA}$.   For a quark with initial energy of 10 GeV we find that $\hat q\approx 1.2 \pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm at an initial time $\tau_0=0.6$ fm/$c$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV/n and $\hat q\approx 1.9 \pm 0.7 $ GeV$^2$/fm in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76 $ TeV/n.

processes -- hadron-hadron, hadron--nucleus and nucleus--nucleus collisions -- with strangeness and charm ( beauty ) conservation, is performed . For  $K^0$ mesons, relations describing the dependence of the correlations of two short-lived and two long-lived neutral kaons and the correlations of ""mixed"" pairs $K^0_S K^0_L$ at small relative momenta upon the space-time parameters of the generation region of $K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$ mesons have been obtained. It is shown that under the strangeness conservation the correlation functions of the pairs $K^0_S K^0_S$ and $K^0_L K^0_L$, produced in the same inclusive process, coincide, and the difference between the correlation functions of the pairs $K^0_S K^0_S$ and $K^0_S K^0_L$ is conditioned exclusively by the production of the pairs of non-identical neutral kaons $K^0 \bar{K}^0$.  
For the case of $D^0$, $B^0$ and $B_s^0$ mesons, correlations have the quite analogous character and they are described by quite similar expressions: in particular, just as for $K^0$ mesons, the correlation functions for the pairs of states with the same $CP$ parity ( $R_{SS}=R_{LL}$ ) and for the pairs of states with different $CP$ parity ( $R_{SL}$ ) do not coincide, and the difference between them is conditioned exclusively by the production of the pairs $D^0 \bar{D}^0, B^0 \bar{B}^0, B_s^0 \bar{B}_s^0$. However, contrary to the case of $K^0$ mesons, here the distinction of $CP$-even and $CP$-odd states encounters difficulties -- due to the insignificant differences of their lifetimes and the relatively small

Heavy flavor,parallel,"Heavy-flavor evolution in QGP and hadron gas: suppression, flow and angular de-correlation","Cao, Shanshan",Duke University,USA,"Heavy flavor hadrons serve as valuable probes of the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We introduce a comprehensive framework that describes their full-time evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadronic phase. The heavy quark energy loss in a de-confined QCD medium is modeled with our improved Langevin approach [1] that simultaneously incorporates quasi-elastic scattering [2,3] and medium-induced gluon radiation [4]. The subsequent transport of heavy mesons in the hadron gas phase is described within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model [5]. The intermediate hadronization process from heavy quarks to their respective mesonic bound states is calculated with our hybrid fragmentation plus coalescence model [1].

We investigate the relative contribution of each of these ingredients to the final-state spectra of heavy mesons and demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate transverse momenta; and the subsequent hadronic interactions is equally crucial as the free quark evolution inside QGP for the development of heavy flavor suppression and collective flow behaviors that one observes. Within this newly developed framework, we provide a good description of D meson suppression and flow measured at both RHIC and LHC, as well as predictions for the future measurements of B mesons.

In addition, a new set of observables – heavy-flavor-tagged angular correlation functions – are explored and found to be potential candidates for distinguishing different energy loss mechanisms of heavy quarks inside a QGP medium [6]. We calculate correlation functions for D-D, D-e, D-hadron, e-hadron, etc., some of which can be compared to the existing preliminary data from LHC experiments.

Poster session,poster,QGP parameter extraction via a global analysis of event-by-event flow coefficient distributions,"Bernhard, Jonah E.",Duke University,USA,"A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), notably its
transport coefficients, such as the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$.  Since these properties are not directly measurable, one relies on a
comparison of the data to computational models of the time-evolution of the collision to connect measured observables to the properties of
the transient QGP state.  The computational model parameters are tuned such that simulated observables optimally match experimental data.

Most studies to date are severely limited by computation time:  they typically rely on averaged quantities such as the average elliptic flow
coefficient $\langle v_2 \rangle$ for a given centrality bin -- disregarding the effects of event-by-event fluctuations -- and use ad hoc
methods for optimizing model parameters.  Often, each parameter is varied independently, while best-fit values are chosen via qualitative
comparisons to single observables.  This neglects correlations among parameters and leads to nebulous results lacking quantitative
uncertainty.

We propose a systematic model-to-data comparison method for extracting QGP properties.  First, a set of salient model parameters is chosen
for calibration -- physical properties such as transport coefficients are of primary interest.  An event-by-event model is then evaluated at
many points in parameter space; this is made possible by recent advances in high-throughput computing.  Finally, a statistical surrogate
algorithm is used to interpolate the parameter space and determine the values which optimally reproduce experimental data.  This provides
rigorous constraints including quantitative uncertainty and sheds light on the relative importance of each parameter.  

The methodology is applied to a modern hybrid model with MC-Glauber and MC-KLN initial conditions, viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics, and the
hadron cascade UrQMD.  By leveraging the power of the Open Science Grid, we have run event-by-event simulations over wide ranges of several
crucial parameters, e.g. the shear viscosity and hydrodynamic thermalization time.  We calibrate the model to experimental event-by-event
flow distributions measured by the ATLAS experiment; these distributions are sensitive to initial-state fluctuations and therefore
constitute a more comprehensive probe of the QGP than event-averaged flow.

This massive-scale model-to-comparison yields new constraints on fundamental QGP properties and clarifies the essential features of a
physically accurate model.  The method is general and easily extensible to future studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jonah E.', 'last_name': 'Bernhard', 'fullName': 'Bernhard, Jonah E.', 'id': '1729542', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': 'e1e4bed92542141fb326b2e63f77f689', 'db_id': 1729542, 'person_id': 1868431}"
Poster session,poster,Domain growth and fluctuations during quenched transition to quark-gluon plasma,"Mohapatra, Ranjita",Physical Research Laboratory,Unknown,"We model the initial confinement deconfinement transition in relativistic heavy-ion collisions as a rapid quench in view of expected rapid thermalization to a quark-gluon plasma state.

loop model, with the initial field configuration (in the confining phase) covering a small neighborhood of the confining vacuum l= 0, as appropriate for
T < Tc. Quench is implemented by evolving this initial configuration
with the effective potential at a temperature T >Tc. We study the formation of Z(3) domain structure and its evolution during the transition as l rolls down in different directions from the top of the central hill in the effective
potential of l. When explicit Z(3) symmetry-breaking effects (arising from dynamical quark effects) are small, then we find well defined Z(3) domains, which coarsen in time. Remarkably, the magnitude plot of l shows
vacuum bubble like configurations arising during the quench. This first-order transition like behavior occurs even though there is no metastable vacuum separated by a barrier from the true vacuum for the parameter values used.
When the initial field configuration everywhere rolls down roughly along the same direction (as will happen with large explicit symmetry breaking) then we do not find such bubble like configurations. However, in this case
we find huge oscillations of l with large length scales.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Viscous hydrodynamics for systems undergoing strongly anisotropic expansion,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,USA,"The collective expansion in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is initially highly anisotropic. Due to viscosity, this leads to strongly deformed local momentum distributions which invalidates the standard viscous hydrodynamic expansion around a local equilibrium distribution, causing a breakdown of viscous fluid dynamics à la Israel and Stewart at early times. We have developed an improved formulation of viscous hydrodynamics [1] that is based on an expansion around a spheroidally deformed local momentum distribution. A spheroidal local momentum distribution leads to the ""anisotropic hydrodynamics"" developed earlier by Martinez and Strickland, which accounts non-perturbatively for the resulting large early-time anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse pressures. By allowing in our new treatment for additional small deviations of the local momentum distribution from spheroidal symmetry, we arrive at a complete formulation of second-order viscous hydrodynamics in which the large longitudinal-transverse momentum anisotropy is treated non-perturbatively à la Martinez and Strickland while the smaller remaining viscous stress components are treated perturbatively à la Israel and Stewart. We perform a test of the approach for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion without transverse expansion which maximizes the longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy. For this system the Boltzmann equation can be solved exactly in the relaxation-time approximation, allowing for a quantitative test of effective macroscopic hydrodynamic theories. We find that the viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic framework (""vaHydro"") significantly outperforms all other available hydrodynamic descriptions, for both small and large values of the shear viscosity $\eta/s$. We expect vaHydro to provide a superior description also after including transverse expansion and to allow for an earlier matching of pre-equilibrium dynamics to hydrodynamics, due to the superior ability of vaHydro to handle the large differences in longitudinal and transverse expansion rates at early times.

For symmetric systems, the NQP model is identical to the Additive Quark Model (AQM) 
used in the 1980's, to explain a similar disagreement of $dE_T/d\eta$ distributions with the Wounded Nucleon Model in $\alpha+\alpha$ relative to p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=31$ GeV at the CERN-ISR. However, the AQM and NQP models differ for the case of asymmetric systems such as d+Au, where the AQM, which is a color-string model, is effectively proportional only to the number quark-participants in the projectile. The present d+Au data clearly reject the AQM model in favor of the NQP, which is also in excellent agreement with the Au+Au data. The NQP model also explains why the additional contribution proportional the number of binary-collisions, $N_{\rm coll}$, added to $N_{\rm part}$ to parametrize the centrality-dependence of A+A collisions works, but does not imply a hard-scattering component in $E_T$  distributions and thus is no longer in disagreement with lessons learned from measurements of $E_T$  distributions in p+p(${\bar{\rm p}}$) collisions at the CERN SpS, ISR and SpS-Collider.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael', 'last_name': 'Tannenbaum', 'fullName': 'Tannenbaum, Michael', 'id': '1729555', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory (US)', 'emailHash': 'f5040b1a1d6827ac1f550dd2ef020e28', 'db_id': 1729555, 'person_id': 1867445}"
Poster session,poster,"Measurements of the correlation between heavy-flavour decay electrons and charged particles in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC","Pereira De Oliveira Filho, Elienos",Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR),Unknown,"The aim of relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a deconfined state of strongly-interacting matter. The characterisation of the QGP via the measurements of several observables is the main purpose of the ALICE detector at the CERN LHC.

Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are a very useful tool in this context. Due to their large masses, they are produced in initial hard parton-parton scattering processes at the very early stages of the collision. Therefore, they experience the whole medium evolution and carry information on the QGP properties.

The production of open heavy-flavour hadrons can be measured with ALICE via their hadronic and semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via their semi-muonic decays at forward rapidity. In this poster emphasis will be put on the measurements of the correlation, in azimuth ($\Delta\varphi$) and pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$), between the electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays and the charged particles produced in the collision.

The comparison of the correlation in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, at various centralities, can provide information on the medium properties. Particularly, correlations of long-range in $\Delta\eta$ were recently observed in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at the LHC energies. Furthermore, in pp collisions, the relative contributions of beauty and charm decays to the total electron yield can be evaluated by comparing the measured correlation function with the predictions from PYTHIA simulations.

Measurements of the correlation function between electrons and charged particles in pp ($\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ and $7$ TeV), Pb-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV), and p-Pb collisions ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV) will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Elienos', 'last_name': 'Pereira De Oliveira Filho', 'fullName': 'Pereira De Oliveira Filho, Elienos', 'id': '1729557', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR)', 'emailHash': '40a91f4f75d7147fb205b6a1d1cd1bd1', 'db_id': 1729557, 'person_id': 1868439}"
Poster session,poster,Measurement of anisotropic flow of electrons from the decay of heavy-flavour hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV with ALICE at the LHC,"Dubla, Andrea",University of Utrecht (NL),Unknown,"In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are mainly produced in hard scattering processes in the early stages of the collisions. Therefore they allow one to probe the properties of the deconfined state of strongly-interacting matter formed in such collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP).
A parton going through the hot and dense medium can lose energy via both elastic and inelastic collisions with the medium constituents. 
Heavy-quarks, because of their large masses, are expected to lose less energy than light quarks and gluons, providing a unique test of parton energy loss models.


In this contribution, results of the elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of electrons from the semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons  measured with ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV  are presented for different centralities.  
The elliptic flow is  the second Fourier coefficient of the azimuthal distribution of particle momenta in the transverse plane with respect to the azimuthal angle of the reaction plane.
At low $p_{\rm{T}}$, the $v_{2}$ of the electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays is sensitive to the degree of thermalization of charm and
beauty quarks in the deconfined medium. At higher $p_{\rm{T}}$, the measurement of $v_{2}$ carries information on the path length dependence of in-medium parton energy loss.
Electrons are reconstructed in the central rapidity region using different identification strategies in different $p_{\rm{T}}$ regions.
The $v_{2}$ of the heavy-flavour decay electrons is extracted subtracting from the measured inclusive electrons $v_{2}$ the contribution of the main background sources.
Different approaches are used to subtract the background contributions.
The analysis was carried out with various methods that have different sensitivity to non-flow contributions, namely the event plane, scalar product and second order Q-Cumulant methods.
Comparisons with measurements at lower collision energy at RHIC and with theoretical models will be presented as well.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Dubla', 'fullName': 'Dubla, Andrea', 'id': '1729558', 'affiliation': 'University of Utrecht (NL)', 'emailHash': '268fa575aed1a89c8d92406fef950c44', 'db_id': 1729558, 'person_id': 1868440}"

the conversion of the fluid to particles. This conversion, typically done

``democratic Grad'' ansatz typically employed in the literature where
coefficients are independent of particle dynamics. Solutions are calculated
analytically for a massless gas and numerically for both a pion-nucleon gas

Poster session,poster,Inhomogeneous chiral phase in external magnetic field,"Nishiyama, Kazuya",Kyoto U.,Unknown,"There have been theoretically and experimentally explored the QCD phase diagram in the density ($\mu$)-temperature ($T$) plane.
 Usually the phase structure is studied by assuming the spatially and temporally constant order parameter.
 Recently the possibility of inhomogeneous chiral phase has attracted much interest [1,2] in the light of progress in heavy-ion collisions or observation of compact stars. Theoretically discovering of the Hartree-Fock solutions in 1+1 dimension has also stimulated the studies.

The effect of the external magnetic field on the chiral transition or deconfinement has been also studied by the lattice QCD simulation for $\mu=0$ [3].
 It should be important, because quark matter is exposed in the strong magnetic field in compact stars or heavy-ion collisions. Theoretically the magnetic field leads to various
phenomena in QCD such as chiral magnetic effect, magnetic catalysis or magnetic
inhibition of the spontaneous symmetry breaking effect.

We study the chiral transition in the presence of the magnetic field by using the
NJL model. We focus here on the inhomogeneous chiral phase. For the analysis, the complex order parameter $\Delta := -2G\left[ \left<\overline \psi \psi \right> +i\left<\overline \psi i\gamma^5\tau^3\psi \right>\right]$ is used; dual chiral
density wave (DCDW)  $\left[ \Delta(x) =me^{iqz} \right]$ and real kink crystal (RKC) $\left[ \Delta(x) =\frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left( \frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}, \nu\right) \right]$ have been commonly used
as typical configurations. The properties of DCDW has been studied by Frolov et al.
in the presence of the magnetic field [4]. They found that DCDW phase develops in a wide
density region at $T=0$. They also found some peculiar behavior of the amplitude
and the wavevector. However, they did not take into account the possibility of RKC,
while RKC has been suggested to be favored in the absence of the magnetic field.
Here we introduce the hybrid configuration $
\left[ \Delta(x) = \frac{2m\nu}{1+\sqrt{\nu}}{\rm sn}\left( \frac{2mz}{1+\sqrt{\nu}},\nu \right)e^{iqz} \right]
$, which smoothly connects both DCDW
and RKC, and demonstrate that the magnetic field favors the phase modulation: it is
found through the analysis of the thermodynamic potential that the wavevector $q$
takes a nonzero value in the presence of the magnetic field and  DCDW and RKC
coexist in the weak magnetic field at moderate densities. In the high magnetic field
pure DCDW appears over all density region. It is also shown that there is a first order phase transition between inhomogeneous phases in the presence of magnetic field.
 Such hybrid phase may appear in compact stars.

It is also very important to study the $j_{\rm T}$ distribution at the LHC energy range in order to investigate possible modifications induced by cold nuclear matter. The cold nuclear medium produced in the p-Pb collisions could alter the initial state radiation shower evolution and thus the inter- and intra-particle correlations are expected to be broadened.

other hadronization mechanisms, like coalescence or parton recombination,

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,New universal parametrization of initial-state fluctuations and its application to event-by-event anisotropy,"Yan, Li",CNRS,Unknown,"We propose a new, universal parametrization of the probability distribution of initial anisotropies in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.  The distribution of fluctuation-driven anisotropies, such as the initial triangularity $\varepsilon_3$, is described by a one-parameter power distribution. When a mean anisotropy in the reaction plane is also present, as in the case of the the initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$ in nucleus-nucleus collision, a new parameter must be added: the power distribution is replaced by a new, elliptic power distribution. Our results are in excellent agreement with all  Monte-Carlo models of the initial state (Glauber, KLN, IP-Glasma) for all collision systems and all centralities.

We then apply our results to the interpretation of the event-by-event distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Assuming that anisotropic flow is proportional to the initial anisotropy, $v_n=C_n\varepsilon_n$,
we obtain excellent fits to these data. This procedure gives us direct information on the initial state from data. Our results are compared to several initial-state models. We are also able to extract the hydrodynamic response $C_n$ for $n=2,3$ as a function of centrality, without assuming any particular model for the initial state. These results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculations of the response.

Poster session,poster,Upsilon production in U+U collisions at the STAR experiment,"Vertesi, Robert",Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,UK,"Due to color screening, the production of quarkonia in high energy heavy ion collisions is expected to be sensitive to the energy density of the medium. Sequential suppression of different quarkonium states may therefore serve as a thermometer of the medium. Although the suppression of charmonia was anticipated as a key signature of the QGP, the observed energy dependence of $J/\psi$ suppression is rather weak. This phenomenon is explained by the recombination (coalescence) of $c\bar{c}$ pairs. Bottomonia, on the other hand, are less affected by recombination and can provide a cleaner probe of the strongly interacting medium. Recent STAR results show that in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV central Au+Au collisions the Upsilon 1S state is suppressed more than if only cold nuclear matter effects were present, and the excited state yields are consistent with a complete suppression. 

The energy density in U+U $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV central collisions is estimated to be about 20% higher than that of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV central Au+Au. Therefore U+U collisions provide a further test of the sequential suppression hypothesis. The STAR detector collected a total of 17.2 million high-tower triggered events in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=193$ GeV U+U collisions in the year 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 263.4 $\mu b^{-1}$. Upsilon yields at mid-rapidity, measured in central and mid-central collisions through the dielectron channel, as well as the nuclear modification factor with respect to the number of participants, will be reported in this presentation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robert', 'last_name': 'Vertesi', 'fullName': 'Vertesi, Robert', 'id': '1729605', 'affiliation': 'Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences', 'emailHash': '3f1f8470792c092ace0b02990996c3c0', 'db_id': 1729605, 'person_id': 1868461}"

Collective dynamics,parallel,Factorization breakdown of two-particle correlations and flow phenomena in pPb and PbPb collisions with CMS,"Devetak, Damir",University of Belgrade (RS),RS,"The technique of two-particle correlations has been widely used in studying flow via azimuthal anisotropy in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A key assumption imposed in this approach is the factorization of Fourier coefficients extracted from two-particle correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropies of trigger and associated particles. It was recently predicted by hydrodynamics that due to initial-state participant fluctuations, a transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence of the event-plane angle would be induced, leading to a breakdown of factorization, even if hydrodynamic flow is the only source of correlations. We present a systematic examination of the factorization assumption in 5.02 TeV pPb and 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions with the CMS experiment. Significant breakdown of factorization (up to 20%) is observed in a large sample of ultra-central (0--0.2%) triggered PbPb events, where initial-state fluctuations play a dominant role. Comparison of data and viscous hydrodynamics predictions, as a function of $p_T$ and centrality, allows new constraints on the modeling of initial condition and shear viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$) ratio of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the measurement is also extended to high-multiplicity pPb collisions. As the initial-state geometry of a pPb collision is expected to be entirely a consequence of fluctuations, quantitative studies of factorization breakdown will help to investigate the nature of the observed long-range correlations in pPb collisions, particularly in the context of hydrodynamic models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Damir', 'last_name': 'Devetak', 'fullName': 'Devetak, Damir', 'id': '1729629', 'affiliation': 'University of Belgrade (RS)', 'emailHash': 'b915842daa6db4b898a972eabaf33785', 'db_id': 1729629, 'person_id': 1868473}"

collisions, thermal photons mostly come from the early hot stage of the

collision. As collective hydrodynamic flow needs time to build up, the 
azimuthal anisotropy of 
thermal photons quantified with Fourier
 coefficient $v_2$ is expected to be smaller than the one for

hadrons. However, the PHENIX experiment and ALICE experiment observed 
$v_2$ values of direct-photons 
similar in magnitude to the pion
$v_2$. These unexpected observations constitute the so called

""direct-photon flow puzzle"" as they challenge the standard
 hydrodynamic picture of nucleus-nucleus 
collisions and/or the standard 
photon emissions rates in the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron
 gas.

hadrons are considered as a sensitive probe for studying medium-induced
parton energy loss and jet modification in heavy-ion collisions.
The prompt photons are produced in association with jets in pp and Pb-Pb
collisions. Such processes can be tagged experimentally via photon
isolation analysis and the correlation of such photons with hadrons in
the opposite side in azimuth. Prompt photons energy is close to the
energy of the parton at the origin of the jet in the opposite side and
thus the correlation with the hadrons allows a measurement of the jet
fragmentation. 
Neutral mesons production at high $p_{\rm T}$ is also modified in Pb-Pb
collisions due to the same parton energy loss mechanism. In addition,
the jet fragments in the meson direction, and the opposite jet in
azimuth, are also quenched in the medium. Therefore, the charged
particles yield associated with the high-$p_{\rm T}$ neutral meson is modified
in Pb-Pb collisions compared to the pp reference at the same colliding
energy.
The ALICE experiment at the LHC performs measurements of the azimuthal
correlation between neutral pions or isolated photons triggered by the

Poster session,poster,Observable consequences of tilted initial state,"Magas, Volodymyr",University of Barcelona,Unknown,"The hydrodynamic simulations of the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions are very successful in describing these reactions, as it is confirmed by the latest RHIC and LHC data. Hydrodynamic simulation does not only mean a certain algorithm of solving the equations of    relativistic hydrodynamics; it is also based on a specific initial state, specific EoS, and specific freeze out realization. In our opinion, between these elements the least controlled is the initial state. Unfortunately at the moment there is no unambiguous model describing the formation of locally thermalized initial states of energetic heavy ion collisions, and thus, all initial states in use are either completely phenomenological or contain some phenomenological elements. We will argue that, from the very general principles like linear and angular momentum conservation, we can expect to form tilted and rotating initial state. The latter is particularly important for ultra-high LHC energies. The key question we address is what are the observable consequences of such a tilted and rotating initial state? For detailed calculations we use an initial states generated by the Effective String Rope model [1] for RHIC and LHC heavy ion reactions; which we also compare with results of the other models intending to calculate such initial states.

However, at present there are several competing models to describe the jet energy loss processes in heavy ion collisions, and current heavy ion data cannot clearly discriminate between them, thus the interpretation of QGP data is very model dependent. High energy p+A collisions may provide control of various cold nuclear matter effects, and with the proper kinematics, provide a clear determination and calibration of various parton energy loss models, thereby helping to improve the calculations for A+A. Past efforts to extract the effects of parton energy loss in p+A resulted in a large uncertainty due to ambiguities from competing effects, such as parton shadowing.  

E906/SeaQuest is a new fixed-target dimuon experiment using 120 GeV proton beams from the Fermilab main injector. E906 measures J/Psi and Drell-Yan production in the dimuon channel in p+p and p+A collisions over a wide range of xF, and employs fixed targets of D, C, Fe, and W. The kinematic coverage is ideal for parton energy loss studies for 20~60 GeV “incoming” quarks, and shadowing effects are expected to be minimal. E906 had its first engineering run in early 2012 and successfully observed the J/Psi mass peak in the dimuon channel. E906 is currently taking high statistics data since the beginning of this year. We expect the new data will help clarify the nature of parton energy loss in the nuclear medium.

inequality relations in any hydrodynamic system, and within those
bounds we show that they should have a particular dependence on
multiplicity over the entire measured centrality range.  Any deviation
from this behavior would signal a breakdown of a hydrodynamic

Surprisingly, almost every experiment observed an enhancement (by a factor of $2\div 5$) above Low theorem's prediction. This is the longstanding puzzle of ""anomalous soft photon production."" The phenomenon is not observed in processes with leptonic final states, which suggests that the mechanism is due to nonperturbative QCD evolution. We study this phenomenon using an exactly soluble, massless, Abelian model in $1+1$ dimensions which shares with QCD many important properties: confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, axial anomaly and $\theta$-vacuum.

As holographic calculations cannot directly describe QCD, importantly neglecting any weak-coupling effects, it is an interesting question how well these studies fit experimental data. Here, we will focus on longitudinal dynamics, modeled by colliding shock waves in AdS.

These collisions give a surprisingly universal rapidity profile, where the shape at high collision energies is completely independent of the energy or longitudinal structure of the colliding shocks. It is somewhat complicated to compare this initial profile to the final measured rapidity profile, but we can compute the entropy and thereby make an estimate of the total multiplicity. The result indicates that our infinite coupling profile has somewhat more stopping than in real heavy-ion collisions, which is most likely because of neglecting weak-coupling effects. We finally comment on (future) consequences for real nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions.

Poster session,poster,Effective Energy Dissipation and Particle Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Sahoo, Raghunath",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"In this report, we consider an energy dissipation model for multiparticle production in heavy-ion collisions. The model considers the energy of a collision to be transformed into the produced particles as effective energy of participants, which drives the particle-production process. Within this model, we describe the dependencies of the two key observables, namely the midrapidity charged-particle density and the midrapidity transverse energy, on the center-of-mass energy and on the number of participating nucleons. These dependencies are of great importance in understanding the dynamics of multiparticle production in heavy-ion collisions. The model combines the constituent quark picture of participants (quarks or nucleons) together with the Landau relativistic hydrodynamics [1] and is found to successfully relate the particle production in hadronic and in central nuclear interactions [2]. A good agreement with the available measurements up to the LHC energies is demonstrated clarifying the underlying dynamics of the particle production process in heavy-ion collisions. A detailed study of the bulk observables in the framework of the constituent quark energy dissipation model considered is presented. Predictions are made on the charged particle multiplicity and transverse energy density for the collision energies where experimental data are not available.

Poster session,poster,Transport model studies on reconstructed jets in a hot partonic medium,"Ma, Guo-Liang","Shanghai INstitute of Applied Physics (SINAP), CAS",Unknown,"Within a multiphase transport model, several experimental observables related to reconstructed jets, including the transverse momentum imbalance for photon-jet, transverse momentum asymmetry for dijet, jet fragmentation function, jet shape, and jet flow, are investigated in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV. Because the imbalance ratio between photon and jet is sensitive to both production position and passing direction of photon, it could enable a detail tomographic study on the hot partonic medium by selecting different imbalance ratio ranges [1]. Dijet asymmetry evolution functions disclose that final dijet asymmetry is driven by both initial dijet asymmetry and partonic jet energy loss [2]. The measured jet fragmentation function in Pb+Pb collisions is decomposed into two parts from jet fragmentation and coalescence, which indicates a competition between the two jet hadronization mechanisms that dominate different $\xi$=ln(1/$z$) ranges and different centrality bins [3]. The subleading jet shape displays a larger medium modification than the leading jet shape, especially in more central Pb+Pb collisions with a larger dijet asymmetry [4]. Azimuthal anisotropies (or flows) of jets ($v_2$ and $v_3$) are sensitive to the geometry asymmetry of initial partonic distribution, which is consistent with a path-length dependence of jet energy loss in the QGP [5]. All these results support that jets lose much energy owing to the strong interactions between jets and a hot partonic medium.

With the help of the relativistic Wigner function formalism one can describe the phase-space evolution of pair production in such fields. Our model of fermion-pair production indicates that not only the time variation plays an important role and has strong influence on the transverse momentum spectra of the newly produced particles, but the space inhomogeneities could completely change the interpretation of the string picture. As a result we demonstrate that most of the new particles are not produced in the bulk, scaling with the volume, instead one finds a scaling with $\propto V ^{\frac{2}{3}}$, in accordance with the early prediction of Heisenberg.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Berenyi', 'fullName': 'Berenyi, Daniel', 'id': '1729717', 'affiliation': 'Wigner RCP of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Hungary', 'emailHash': 'f349ce633b176e8f921b2a397b862b81', 'db_id': 1729717, 'person_id': 1868524}"
Poster session,poster,Concept and performance of the Silicon Tracking System for the CBM experiment at FAIR,"Singla, Minni",GSI,Germany,"The Silicon Tracking System (STS) is the central detector system of the CBM experiment. Its task is to perform track reconstruction and momentum determination for all charged particles created in beam-target collisions at SIS 100 and SIS 300 beam energies. The technical challenges to meet are a high granularity matching the high track densities, a fast self-triggering read-out coping interaction rates up to 10 MHz, and a low mass to yield high momentum resolution. 
We introduce the concept of the STS, being comprised of eight tracking stations employing double-sided silicon microstrip sensors on modular structures that keep the read-out electronics outside the physics aperture. The detector system acceptance covers polar angles between 2.5 and 25 degrees and will be operated in the 1 T field of a super conducting dipole magnet. The performance of the STS with respect to hit finding, track reconstruction and momentum resolution are shown based on simulation studies using a realistic geometry and detector response based on the evolving engineering and prototyping effort.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Minni', 'last_name': 'Singla', 'fullName': 'Singla, Minni', 'id': '1729721', 'affiliation': 'GSI', 'emailHash': 'efe447ddacec99f28db08f7e95b0ccc6', 'db_id': 1729721, 'person_id': 1867800}"
Poster session,poster,Lattice QCD study on quark mass dependence of quarkonium properties at finite temperature,"Ono, Hiroshi",University of Tsukuba,UK,"As a consequence of the melting of quarkonia due to the color Debye screening in a hot medium, suppression of quarkonium yields is expected to be observed in the quark gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC. In fact, suppression of the $J/\Psi$ yield has already been observed both at RHIC and LHC and thus theoretical understanding of charmonium properties at high temperature is important to explain experimental results. Moreover, recently, sequential $\Upsilon$ suppression at LHC has been reported by the CMS collaboration [1], which inspires theoretical interest of in-medium bottomonium behavior. 

In this talk we report our lattice QCD study on quarkonium properties at finite temperature, which extends our previous study [2] with a couple of lattice spacings toward the continuum limit. Similarly to a previous charmonium study [3], we perform numerical simulations on large and fine isotropic lattices by using quenched gauge field configurations. To investigate differences between charmonium and bottomonium states, we vary the quark masses in the range between the charm and bottom masses. Spatial and temporal meson correlation functions are computed at temperatures in a range from 0.8$T_c$ to 1.6$T_c$ at both vanishing and finite momenta. We will discuss the temperature and quark mass dependence of the screening masses and the change and dissociation of various quarkonium states in the QGP. The spectral properties obtained in this study also provide information on a transport coefficient, the heavy quark diffusion coefficient, and its temperature and mass dependence.

In these collisions a large number of particles of different types is produced. Current understanding of such collisions suggest that the production of a QGP phase in relativistic heavy ion collisions could produce significant event-by-event correlations and fluctuations in transverse momentum, multiplicity, etc. Therefore it is important to analyze ﬂuctuations of multiplicities (net-protons, net-strangeness, total protons) for different energies and centralities and search for anomalous behaviour due to a phase transition. The multiplicity distributions of different types of particles produced in simulated Au+Au collisions using different theoretical models at energies ranging from 2 – 200 AGeV were analyzed and the moments of the distributions were calculated.

Poster session,poster,Performance study for measurement of jets and heavy flavor using sPHENIX.,"Nagashima, Kazuya",Hiroshima University,Unknown,"We will present our ongoing study of performance for measurement of jets and heavy flavors at the sPHENIX project using a Geant4 simulation. 
The sPHENIX is the planned/anticipated upgrade of the PHENIX detector at RHIC.
The physics programs of sPHENIX primarily aim at jets and heavy flavors.
The program can be much enhanced with the preshower and the EMCal that provides separation of single photons from double photons from neutral pions up to 40 GeV/c and improved electron identification.
A possible design of the preshower and a possible design change of the EMCal has been studied using a Geant4 simulation.
The preshower detector is a very thin sampling calorimeter which is hence capable to observe electromagnetic showers at their initial development.
First we caluclate the lower limit of the opening angles of double photons from 40 GeV/c neutral pions.
Setting the cell size less than the lower limit allows us to identify the double photons, hence to separate high pT single photons from high pT neutral pions. 
Second, we try to improve the rejection power against charged pions to get a clean electron sample.
In other words, electron identification is another key performance goal.
The rejection power is found to reach the order of a thousand by properly choosing the cut parameters on the energy and shower shape in the preshower and the EM calorimater.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazuya', 'last_name': 'Nagashima', 'fullName': 'Nagashima, Kazuya', 'id': '1729756', 'affiliation': 'Hiroshima University', 'emailHash': '85c5dfcd5c311a0d93641a15585824df', 'db_id': 1729756, 'person_id': 1868533}"
Poster session,poster,Search for strong magnetic field via electron-pair asymmetry measurement in Au+Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC-PHENIX,"HOSHINO, TOMOYA",Hiroshima University,Japan,"Several models predict a strong magnetic field may be created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions by light-speed moving spectators and collision participants. The field can reach as high as $10^{14}$ teslas at RHIC, and rapidly decreases in a few fm/c. Such a strong field may exhibit charge distribution asymmetry with respect to the magnetic field direction that is orthogonal to the reaction plane, which has been investigated recently.

According to theoretical calculation using vacuum polarization tensor in external magnetic field, virtual photon decay probability depends on the direction of strong field. This results in characteristic angular distributions of electron pairs with respect to the reaction plane. The effect is also dependent on centrality because the strength of the magnetic field changes over centralities.

We look for the strong magnetic field effect via virtual photon decay, by taking advantage of an excellent electron-identification capability in PHENIX. Methods for background subtraction and signal extraction to detect the field are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'TOMOYA', 'last_name': 'HOSHINO', 'fullName': 'HOSHINO, TOMOYA', 'id': '1729757', 'affiliation': 'Hiroshima University', 'emailHash': '24f8d7db2f66bed7f4106d1b281ac306', 'db_id': 1729757, 'person_id': 1868534}"
"Future experimental facilities, upgrades, and instrumentation",unknown,Heavy-ion physics studies for the Future Circular Collider,"Dainese, Andrea",INFN - Padova (IT),Unknown,"A five-year international design study called Future Circular Collider (FCC) has been launched by CERN with a kick-off meeting in February 2014. The main goal is a hadron collider with a centre-of-mass energy of the order of 100 TeV for pp collisions in a new 80-100 km tunnel in the Geneva area. The target start of operation would be 2035-40.

Operating such machine with heavy ions is an option that is being considered in the accelerator design studies. It would provide, for example, Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=39$ and 63 TeV, respectively, with monthly integrated luminosities of the order of 5-10/nb.

We will present first ideas on the physics opportunities with heavy ions at the FCC. 

The Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) state produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 39~TeV is expected to have initial temperature and energy density substantially larger than at LHC energy, a stronger flow field and freeze-out volume twice as large. The larger temperature could entail novel features, like changes in the quarkonium spectrum and abundant in-medium production of charm quarks. The latter could determine an increase in the number of degrees of freedom (from 3 to 4 quark flavours).
The larger energy and luminosities will make new, rarer, hard probes available (like top quarks and $Z+Jets$), which could give access to the time-evolution of the medium properties, e.g. of its opacity.

In the sector of small-$x$ and saturation physics, the increase in centre-of-mass energy of a factor seven with respect to the LHC will extend the kinematic coverage in $x$ and $Q^2$, providing, with pA and $\gamma$A (ultra-peripheral collisions), access to the saturation region down to $x< 10^{-6}$ with perturbative probes like heavy quarks and quarkonia.

High-density or collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and pA events could become more dramatic, with the increase of energy and high-multiplicity reach.

Opportunities for electroweak physics studies in UPC gamma-gamma collisions, as well as the impact of heavy-ion data at the FCC for ultra-high energy cosmic-ray physics, will also be summarized.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrea', 'last_name': 'Dainese', 'fullName': 'Dainese, Andrea', 'id': '1729758', 'affiliation': 'INFN - Padova (IT)', 'emailHash': '454d015e169785de696fba891c60e956', 'db_id': 1729758, 'person_id': 1868535}"

Poster session,poster,Azimuthally-anisotropic photon spectrum induced by chiral anomaly in strong magnetic fields,"Hattori, Koichi",RIKEN,Unknown,"It has been known for a long time that neutral-pions dominantly decay into two photons, 
which was subsequently understood on a robust theoretical basis after the discovery of chiral anomaly. 
A theorem shown in a seminal paper by Adler and Bardeen [1] indicates 
that a neutral pion is coupled to only two-photon states without couplings to other multi-photon states. 
When chiral anomaly is tied to extremely strong magnetic fields created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions [2], 
we find 
that transition between a neutral pion and a photon becomes possible 
with one of the two photons replaced by an external magnetic field. 
The theorem allows us to obtain the transition amplitude governed by chiral anomaly without theoretical ambiguities. 



We discuss attainable signatures of the anomaly-induced transition 
between neutral pions and photons in RHIC and LHC experiments. 
Although the magnetic fields persist for $1\, {\rm fm}/{\it c}$ or even shorter duration 
after the heavy ion collisions, 
we still find a photon source having much chance to interact with the magnetic field, 
that is, the prompt photon emitted just at the impacts of the collisions. 
While the prompt real photons propagate in the magnetic field, 
a part of the photons is converted into neutral pions, leaving an reduced amount of photons. 
Then, we show that the prompt photons to be measured in the experiments 
should have a negative $v_2$ and particular polarizations [3], 
since the transition amplitude is azimuthally anisotropic and depends on the photon polarizations 
due to a preferred orientation prescribed by the external magnetic fields. 
We propose that analyses on those observables should be performed in the future experiments, 
which makes the creation of the strong magnetic fields evident, 
while major attention has been conventionally paid to the total yield of prompt photons. 
We take into account the time dependence of the magnetic fields, 
and show the beam energy and impact parameter dependences of 
the photon's $v_2$ and polarizations. 


This work will provide impacts on elucidating formation of the prompt-photon spectrum 
as a penetrating probe from the very early stage, 
and thus shed light on an aspect of the early-time dynamics in the heavy-ion collisions.

We show, exploring the $T$ dependence of $\eta/s$, that a study of $v_n$ in a wide $p_T$ range 
allows to understand the difference behind the collective flows at LHC respect to RHIC. Furthermore 
we present novel results about the impact of $\eta/s$ on the correlations between the initial

In particular we study the effect of a temperature dependent $\eta/s$ at different beam energies 
from RHIC for $Au+Au$ at $\sqrt{s}= 62.4, 200$ GeV to LHC energies for $Pb+Pb$ at $\sqrt{s}= 2.76$ TeV. 
We find that for the different beam energies considered the suppression of the elliptic flow
