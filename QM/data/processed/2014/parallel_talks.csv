Collective dynamics,parallel,Searches for $p_{\rm T}$ dependent flow angle and flow magnitude fluctuations with the ALICE detector,"Zhou, You",NIKHEF and University of Utrecht (NL),DK,"Anisotropic azimuthal correlations are used to probe the properties and the evolution of the system created in heavy-ion collisions. 
Hydrodynamic model calculations predict that there are effects of $p_{\rm T}$ dependent fluctuations of the flow angle and flow magnitude, which might bias our previous anisotropic flow measurements.

In this talk, the two effects will be investigated in both Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions, using two-particle azimuthal correlation measurements with the ALICE detector. In addition, the factorization of the two-particle Fourier harmonics $V_{n\Delta}$ for different values of $n$ into single-particle azimuthal anisotropies $v_{n}$, will be discussed. Our measurements, together with the comparison to hydrodynamic model calculations will open a new window on the study of the initial state fluctuations and the extraction of shear viscosity of the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'You', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, You', 'id': '1728783', 'affiliation': 'NIKHEF and University of Utrecht (NL)', 'emailHash': '227dd48b81f94eba8b0641c8d63cb1f5', 'db_id': 1728783, 'person_id': 1867855}"
QCD phase diagram,parallel,Spectral functions from the functional renormalization group,"Tripolt, Ralf-Arno",TU Darmstadt,Unknown,"We present a new method to obtain real-time quantities
such as spectral functions and transport coefficients
at finite temperature and density using a
non-perturbative Functional Renormalization Group approach [1].

Our method is based on a thermodynamically consistent truncation of the
flow equations for 2-point functions with analytically continued frequency
components in the originally Euclidean external momenta.
We demonstrate the feasibility of our method by calculating the mesonic
spectral functions in the quark-meson model at different temperatures and
values of the quark chemical potential, in particular near the critical endpoint
of the corresponding phase diagram.

In particular, its shape can be studied by measuring femtoscopic radii as a function of the emission angle relative to the collision plane of symmetry.

We present the first measurements of azimuthally differential femtoscopy in Pb-Pb collisions $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC and compare our results to RHIC experiments at lower energies. We measure oscillations of the extracted radii versus the emission angle.  We find that $R_{\rm side}$ and $R_{\rm out}$ oscillate out of phase.  We show that the relative amplitude of the $R_{\rm side}$ oscillation decreases in more central collisions, but always remains positive. This indicates that the source is out-of-plane extended, which is qualitatively similar to that observations at RHIC energies.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Probing dense matter in compact star cores with radio pulsar data,"Schwenzer, Kai",W,Unknown,"Astrophysical observations of compact stars provide, in addition to collider experiments, the other big source of information on matter under extreme conditions. The largest and most precise data set about neutron stars is the timing data of radio pulsars. We show how this unique data can be used to learn about the ultra-dense matter in the compact star interior. The method relies on astro-seismology based on special global oscillation modes (r-modes) that emit gravitational waves. They would prevent pulsars from spinning with their observed high frequencies, unless the damping of these modes, determined by the microscopic properties of matter, can prevent this. We show that for each form of matter there is a distinct region in a frequency/spindown-rate diagram where r-modes can be present. We find that stars containing quark matter are consistent with both the observed radio and x-ray data, whereas for standard neutron stars so far unestablished, enhanced damping mechanisms would be required.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kai', 'last_name': 'Schwenzer', 'fullName': 'Schwenzer, Kai', 'id': '1729474', 'affiliation': 'W', 'emailHash': 'd524f430cf5508a98bea5dabc310f6f8', 'db_id': 1729474, 'person_id': 1867477}"

Previous measurements at RHIC have shown large suppression and azimuthal anisotopy of open heavy flavor hadrons. In order to further constrain medium properties using heavy flavor probes, the interaction of charm and beauty quarks must be measured separately.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Emission angle and particle mass dependence of HBT Interferometry in  Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV,"Esumi, Shinichi",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"The initial density distribution in a heavy ion collision fluctuates
due to the finite number of participating nucleons, which leads to
higher harmonic flow as recently measured at RHIC and the LHC.  Such
spatial fluctuations may be preserved until kinetic freeze-out,
depending on the strength of the initial fluctuations, the flow
profile, the expansion time, and viscosity of the created matter.

Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is a powerful tool to
study the space-time extent of a particle emitting source in heavy ion
collisions. PHENIX has measured the azimuthal angle dependence of HBT
radii with respect to the 2\textsuperscript{nd} and
3\textsuperscript{rd}-order event planes in Au$+$Au collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$~GeV.

The results for the 2\textsuperscript{nd}-order dependence indicate
that the initial eccentricity is reduced during the medium evolution,
but not reversed in the final state, which is consistent with previous
results. In contrast, the results for the 3\textsuperscript{rd}-order
dependence indicate that the initial triangular shape is signicantly
reduced and potentially reversed by the end of the medium evolution,
and that the 3\textsuperscript{rd}-order oscillations are largely
dominated by the dynamical effects from triangular flow.  The
measurement of the HBT radii from different particle correlations such
as charged kaons over the wide $m_T$ ranges give deeper insight on the
emission source dynamics.  We will report and discuss these new
comprehensive HBT measurement in Au$+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}

While it is challenging to probe this mechanism directly, there are now several observables available which allow tomographic imaging of the initial state geometry, which is expected to carry remnant information of the equilibration mechanism. On the fluid dynamics side, scaled fluctuations in the momentum space anisotropy parameters v_n image the initial eccentricity fluctuations epsilon_n almost directly with only a weak dependence on fluid dynamics. From a different direction, due to the strong non-linear dependence of their emission rates on temperature, thermal photons and their v_n are very sensitive to the initial state graininess. Finally, the v_2 and v_3 of high P_T hadrons coming from hard processes reflect the attenuation pattern of partons propagating through the inhomogeneous matter density after some fluid dynamical evolution.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Equilibration of anisotropic quark-gluon plasma produced by decays of color flux tubes,"Florkowski, Wojciech","Institute of nuclear Physics, Krakow",UK,"A set of kinetic equations is used to study equilibration of the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma produced by decays of color flux tubes possibly created at the very early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The decay rates of the initial color fields are given by the Schwinger formula, and the collision terms are treated in the relaxation-time approximation. By connecting the relaxation time with viscosity we are able to study production and thermalization processes in the plasma characterized by different values of the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density, ${\bar \eta}$. For the lowest (KSS) value of this ratio, $4\pi{\bar \eta} = 1$, and realistic initial conditions for the fields, the system approaches the viscous-hydrodynamics regime within  1--2 fm/c. On the other hand, for larger values of the viscosity, $4\pi{\bar \eta} \geq 3$, the collisions in the plasma become inefficient to destroy collective phenomena which manifest themselves as oscillations of different plasma parameters. The presence of such oscillations brings in differences between the kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions, which suggest that the viscous-hydrodynamics approach after 1--2 fm/c is not complete if $4\pi{\bar \eta} \geq 3$ and should be extended to include dissipative phenomena connected with color conductivity.

Its formation is assisted by the gauge configuration in the glasma state created right after the collisions.

Initial state physics,parallel,Decoherence between the initial and final state radiation in a dense QCD medium,"Martinez Guerrero, Mauricio",The Ohio State University,USA,"We study medium modifications to the interference pattern between initial and final state radiation. We compute single gluon production off a highly energetic parton that undergoes a hard scattering and subsequently crosses a dense QCD medium of finite size. Multiple soft scatterings with the medium are resumed within the harmonic oscillator approximation. We find the decoherence of correlated partons traversing the medium depends on two scales:  the medium length $L$ and the decorrelation time of the gluon due to the medium $\tau_f$. This interplay gives origin to two different asymptotic limits of the gluon spectrum: the coherent ($\tau_f\gg L$) and incoherent regime ($\tau_f\ll L$). We discuss the main characteristics of each regime. We show that in both cases there is a gradual onset of decoherence between the initial and final state radiation due to multiple scatterings, that opens the phase space for large angle emissions. By examining the multiplicity of produced gluons, we observe a potentially large double logarithmic enhancement for dense media and small opening angles. This result points to a possible modification of the evolution equations due to a QCD medium of finite size.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Thermal photon $v_3$ at LHC from event-by-event hydrodynamics,"Chatterjee, Rupa",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Thermal photon $v_3$ is calculated for 0--40% central collisions of Pb nuclei at LHC from event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic model [1]. The differential triangular flow parameter $v_3(p_T)$ calculated with respect to the participant plane (PP) is found to be  non-zero, positive, and shows similar qualitative nature to the elliptic flow parameter $v_2(p_T)$ [2].  At $p_T=$ 1 GeV $v_3$(PP) is found to be about half of  $v_2$(PP) however, for larger values of $p_T$ these two anisotropy parameters  become comparable.  The global geometry of the produced matter as well as the local fluctuations in the initial density distribution are responsible for  this substantial value of the triangular flow parameter for thermal photons  where $v_3$(PP)  probes the initial state geometry in an indirect way via the generation of additional transverse flow.   $v_3$ calculated with respect to the reaction plane as expected is close to zero.  $v_3$(PP) strongly depends on the value of the fluctuation size parameter $\sigma$ especially in the higher $p_T$ region where, a larger $\sigma$ results in a smaller $v_3$(PP). In addition, the $v_3$(PP) is found to increase with the initial formation time of the system.

Jets,parallel,Semi-inclusive recoil jet distribution and di-jets imbalance  measurements in central Au+Au collisions in STAR,"Putschke, Joern",Wayne State University,United States,"The measurement of fully reconstructed jets in heavy ion collisions

out accurate, data-driven jet measurements over a broad kinematic range 
at RHIC energies, we developed a novel mixed-event technique that 
describes the combinatorial jet background over several orders of

hadron trigger in central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV. 
We report the recoil jet distribution for various trigger $p_{T}$ ranges

Subtraction of the di-hadron correlation in low-multiplicity p+Pb collisions from high-multiplicity ones reveals a back-to-back double ridge structure ($\Delta\phi\approx 0$ and $\pi$). A similar double ridge is observed in high-multiplicity d+Au collisions by the PHENIX experiment in their limited acceptance. Differences between multiplicity-selected d+Au collisions (and p+p collisions) have been observed before by STAR. However, the question remains open whether the ridge in d+Au collisions is a jet-related difference between central and peripheral collisions, or a new physics phenomenon such as anisotropic flow in d+Au. STAR, with its large acceptance, can rigorously address this question.


In this talk, we report di-hadron $\Delta\eta$-$\Delta\phi$ correlations in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV. At mid-rapidity (with $|\Delta\eta|<2$), the jet-like correlation contribution in ``central$-$peripheral"" method is evaluated. At large $|\Delta\eta|\approx 3$, the comparison of di-hadron correlations in central and peripheral collisions is reported in terms of the Au and deuteron beam directions. The $\Delta\phi$ correlation functions are also analyzed via a Fourier series decomposition; the $|\Delta\eta|$ and multiplicity dependencies of the Fourier coefficients are investigated.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,QGP properties from flow and correlations,"Nonaka, Chiho",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Recently the results of  azimuthal HBT measurements with respect to 
the second and third order event plane are presented by PHENIX [1]. 
They extract $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii 
which contain information about not only the source shape at freezeout 
but also the space-time evolution of QGP matter.  
They show the relation between initial $\epsilon_{2, 3}$ which are obtained  
using a Glauber model and final $\epsilon_{2,3}$ which are extracted from 
the HBT radii. 
They find that the final $\epsilon_2$ from the HBT radii is finite and smaller 
than the initial $\epsilon_2$. 
On the other hand, the final $\epsilon_3$ is vanishing, in spite of existence of 
finite initial $\epsilon_3$. 
The interesting different response of $\epsilon_2$ and $\epsilon_3$  during 
space-time evolution gives us a clue to understand the detailed QGP properties. 

For analyses of such high statistics experimental results, we develop a 
state of the art numerical scheme of causal viscous hydrodynamics for 
relativistic heavy ion collisions, which has a shock-wave capturing scheme and less 
numerical dissipation [2]. Furthermore, using the hydrodynamic algorithm, 
we construct a hybrid model of hydrodynamic model plus UrQMD to include the realistic 
freezeout processes.  
Using the model we investigate the time evolution of spatial anisotropies $\epsilon_n$. 
We find that the sign of $\epsilon_3$ changes from positive to negative during the space-time evolution, 
which suggests a solution of the vanishing final $\epsilon_3$ from the HBT radii by PHENIX. 
From detailed analyses from flow and correlations,  we discuss the initial conditions of 
hydrodynamic model and the detailed QGP properties such as transport coefficients.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,"Energy dependence of higher moments of net-kaon, net-proton and net-charge multiplicity distribution at STAR","SARKAR, AMAL",iit-bombay,Unknown,"The main goal of the Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at RHIC is to map the
phase diagram of QCD.  A critical point (CP) is expected at large baryonic
chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$) in the $T$ vs. $\mu_{B}$ phase diagram. Its
location experimentally will provide one of the most stringent tests of
QCD calculations. In the BES program $T$ and  $\mu_{B}$  are varied by
changing the center of mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) from 200 to 7.7 GeV.
The observables chosen for CP search are the product of moments of
conserved(like net-charge) multiplicity distributions or their proxies
(such as net-kaon for net-strangeness and net-proton for net-baryons)
measured in the experiments. The various moments (mean ($M$), standard
deviation ($\sigma$), skewness ($S$) and kurtosis ($\kappa$)) are related
to correlation length ($\xi$) of the system (variance: $\sigma^{2}$ $\sim$
$\xi^{2}$; skewness: $S$ $\sim$ $\xi^{4.5}$ and kurtosis: $\kappa$ $\sim$
$\xi^{7}$) [1] and are expected to show a non-monotonic variation with
beam energy in the presence of CP.

We report new measurements of product of moments: $\sigma^{2}/M$,
$S\sigma$ and $\kappa\sigma^{2}$ of net-kaon distributions ($\Delta N_{K}$

the corresponding results from net-charge [2] and net-proton
distributions[3].   All the results are corrected for particle
reconstruction efficiency and will be compared to baseline distributions
constructed following Poisson and Negative Binomial/Binomial statistics.
They will also be compared to calculations from HIJING, AMPT and UrQMD
models, which do not include a CP. Deviations from some of the baseline
measures and model calculations are observed for net-kaon and  net-proton
distributions. The implications of the observation to CP physics will be

They validate the characteristic signature expected for the system size dependence of viscous damping at each collision energy studied. The extracted viscous coefficients, that encode the magnitude of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta/s$, are observed to decrease to an apparent minimum as the collision energy is increased from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7$ to approximately 62.4~GeV; thereafter, they show a slow 
increase with $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ up to 2.76 TeV.

Heavy flavor,parallel,Gluon radiation by heavy quarks at intermediate energies,"Gossiaux, Pol",Subatech,Unknown,"It is generally admitted that heavy quarks (c and b) created in the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions through hard processes are among the best probes of the later QGP stage. Perturbative QCD allows for the calculation of the production cross sections (in contradistinction to light quarks) and these cross sections have also been measured. Also the details of the chiral/confinement phase transition are less important than for light quarks because, due to its mass, the momentum of the heavy quark determines the momentum of the open charm hadrons. In addition, the momentum distribution at production and at the transition is very different from that expected if the heavy quarks are in thermal equilibrium with the plasma of light quarks and gluons. Therefore the modification of the initial momentum distribution by the interaction of the heavy quarks with the plasma carries information on the plasma properties.

The interaction of the heavy quark with the plasma has two parts, elastic collisions and radiative collisions. For the first a model was developed [1] in which the cross section of the elementary interactions are calculated by 
perturbative QCD with a running coupling constant and an infrared behavior adjusted so as to match hard thermal loop calculations. Embedding these cross sections in the hydrodynamical description of the expanding plasma of Heinz and Kolb it was shown that the collisional energy loss underpredicts the measured energy loss of heavy mesons at large momenta as well as their elliptic flow by roughly a factor of two.

It is the purpose of the present work to extend our pQCD calculation toward the calculation of the radiative energy loss for heavy quarks at intermediate energies. To this end we compute the gluon emission cross section of a heavy quark colliding a light parton from the plasma in pQCD at leading order [2]. We first derive the high-energy approximation that naturally extends results obtained by Gunion and Bertsch for the light quark sector to heavy quarks. We next show that it is possible to compute the complete energy dependence of the result. This allows us to assess the range of applicability in energy of the high-energy approximation. We then extend the calculation to the case of intermediate energy, for which the invariant mass $s$ in the collision does not exceed the squared heavy quark mass $m_Q^2$ in large amounts. We discuss in particular the relevance of the dead cone effect as well as the consequences of a finite heavy quark energy, which is often neglected in the literature. For this purpose, we address quantities such as the average energy loss in a bath at finite temperature as well as the nuclear modification factor as a function of the transverse momentum.

ALICE is dedicated to the study of QGP properties in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.

At the beginning of 2013, p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV have been studied at the LHC, in order to measure the effects related to cold nuclear matter, which, for charmonia, include gluon shadowing (or gluon saturation), energy loss and nuclear absorption. The study of these effects in p-Pb collisions is important in order to be able to disentangle hot and cold nuclear matter effects in Pb-Pb collisions.

Jets,parallel,NLO transverse momentum broadening and QCD evolution of qhat,"Xing, Hongxi",LANL,USA,"There have been a lot of efforts focused on qualitative and quantitative studies of the properties of the sQGP through jet quenching. However, it is not clear whether the properties of the medium such as the jet transport parameter as probed by a propagating jet is unique and intrinsic to the medium, independent of the hard processes that produce the energetic jets. This is a problem of factorization of multiple scattering in QCD and so far has eluded many theoretical efforts. In this talk, we show you the first complete NLO calculation of transverse momentum broadening in SIDIS e+A and DY p+A collisions. We demonstrate for the first time how QCD factorization holds for multiple parton scattering and the universality of the associated quark-gluon correlation function or properties of nuclear matter contained  therein as probed by a propagating parton,  independent of the hard processes that create the fast partons. Our calculation also identifies the QCD evolution equation for this quark-gluon correlation function, which determines the QCD scale and jet energy dependence  of the jet transport parameter. We further solve the QCD evolution equation of qhat numerically and determine the scale and energy dependence of the jet transport parameter  in cold and hot dense medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hongxi', 'last_name': 'Xing', 'fullName': 'Xing, Hongxi', 'id': '1728606', 'affiliation': 'LANL', 'emailHash': '205b87e3f72effb3a38bbf7b5bb23107', 'db_id': 1728606, 'person_id': 1867816}"

Heavy flavor,parallel,Towards continuum results of the heavy quark momentum diffusion coefficient,"Kaczmarek, Olaf",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"Among quantities playing a central role in the theoretical interpretation of
heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC are so-called transport
coefficients. Out of those heavy quark diffusion coefficents play an important
role e.g. for the analysis of the quenching of jets containing
$c$ or $b$ quarks ($D$ or $B$ mesons) as observed at RHIC and LHC.

We report on a lattice investigation of heavy quark momentum diffusion within
pure SU(3) plasma above the deconfinement transition, with the quarks treated
to leading order in the heavy mass expansion. We measure the relevant
""colour-electric"" Euclidean correlator and based on several lattice spacings
perform the continuum extrapolation. This extends our previous study [1,2]  progressing towards a removal of lattice artifacts and a physical
interpretation of the results.

We find that the correlation function clearly exceeds its
perturbative counterpart which suggests that at temperatures just above the
critical one, non-perturbative interactions felt by the heavy quarks are
stronger than within the weak-coupling expansion. Our results will be
compared to heavy quark diffusion coefficients [3] obtained from
charmonium vector correlation functions.

Jets,parallel,Measurement of jet $p_{\rm T}$ spectra and $R_{\rm AA}$ in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector,"Aiola, Salvatore",Yale University (US),USA,"Hard-scattered partons provide an ideal probe for the study of the Quark-Gluon Plasma because they are produced prior to the formation of the QCD medium in heavy-ion collisions. Early measurements conducted at RHIC experiments have provided compelling evidence of jet quenching. In more recent years LHC experiments have confirmed these observations at a higher collisional energy, which allows full jet reconstruction over a much wider kinematic range. Jets are reconstructed in ALICE utilizing both the central tracking system for the charged constituents and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter for the neutral constituents. One of the most important challenges of jet reconstruction in heavy-ion collisions is the large fluctuating background energy density coming from the underlying event. A data-driven method has been used to correct for it which, combined with the unfolding of the detector effects, makes it possible to compare with other experimental results and theoretical predictions. Jet spectra will be reported for Pb-Pb and for pp collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 ATeV. The pp measurement serves also as the baseline for the determination of the nuclear modification factor, which shows a strong suppression of jet production in central Pb-Pb collisions. Differential measurements relative to the event plane and centrality class, which make use of data triggered by the Electromagnetic Calorimeter, will aid further investigation of details of this suppression, e.g. regarding the path length dependence of parton energy loss.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Salvatore', 'last_name': 'Aiola', 'fullName': 'Aiola, Salvatore', 'id': '1728644', 'affiliation': 'Yale University (US)', 'emailHash': '40b2169bf8ec0a61db0ba0b586aad728', 'db_id': 1728644, 'person_id': 1867845}"

We employ this framework to study deformed U+U collisions, asymmetric Cu+Au collisions and the effect of deformation in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. A combined study of these heavy ion systems with varying initial geometries can provide a unique opportunity to determine the origin of different sources of fluctuations that affect global observables like multiplicity and flow. We study the sensitivity of multiplicity, eccentricity and their event-by-event distributions to the details of initial state geometry. Results are compared to a two component MC-Glauber model implementation that includes Negative-Binomial multiplicity fluctuations. We argue that measurements of global observables for these systems at RHIC can constrain the mechanism of multi-particle production [4].

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Gluon transport equation in the small-angle approximation and the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation,"Liao, Jinfeng",Indiana University,USA,"To understand the evolution of a dense system of gluons, such as those produced in the early stages of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions, is an important and challenging problem. We describe the approach to thermal equilibrium using the small angle approximation for gluon scattering in a Boltzmann equation that includes the effects of Bose statistics. The role of Bose statistical factors in amplifying the rapid growth of the population of the soft modes is essential. With these factors properly taken into account, one finds that elastic scattering alone provides an efficient mechanism for populating soft modes, and in fact leads to rapid infrared local thermalization. 

Furthermore recent developments suggest that high initial overpopulation plays a key role and may lead to dynamical Bose-Einstein Condensation. The kinetics of condensation is an interesting problem in itself. By solving the transport equation for initial conditions with a large enough initial phase-space density the equilibrium state contains a Bose condensate, and we present numerical evidence that such over-populated systems reach the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in a finite time. It is also found that the approach to condensation is characterized by a scaling behavior. Finally we discuss a number of extensions of the present study.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,From conserved charge fluctuations to the QCD critical point,"Schmidt, Christian",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"Higher order cumulants of fluctuations of conserved charges are an important diagnostic tool for the thermodynamic properties of strong interacting matter close to freeze out [1] at LHC energies as well as in the entire energy range covered with the beam energy scan (BES) at RHIC. We present recent progress on the calculation of conserved charge fluctuations with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ action). In particular we will focus on higher order cumulants up to 6th order of net baryon number, net electric charge and net strangeness fluctuations. We will discuss how these quantities approach the hadron resonance gas at low temperatures, the perturbative limit at high-T [2] and analyze to what extent they show sensitivity to universal scaling behavior, *i.e.* we estimate the relative strength of contributions from the regular and singular part of the free energy. Based on this analysis we discuss consequences for the QCD phase diagram and the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the QCD partition function. The latter can be used to locate the QCD critical point. Furthermore, we comment on the signature of the QCD critical point in various ratios of conserved charge fluctuations that are measured in the BES at RHIC.

However, there is no a priori reason to neglect bulk viscosity since the actual order of magnitude and temperature dependence of this transport coefficient is unknown, and could be significant. In this work, we explore the phenomenological implications of a nonzero bulk viscosity coefficient on transverse momentum spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy. We then extract the optimal values of the bulk and shear viscosity coefficients that are able to describe these observables. For ultracentral heavy ion collisions, measured by ATLAS and CMS, we perform this analysis using several initial condition models. For other centrality classes, we determine these coefficients using the IP-Glasma initial condition model. Our fluid-dynamical description is the most complete available and includes all possible second order terms that appear in Israel-Stewart theory, including those that couple bulk viscous pressure to shear stress. The transport coefficients of all terms are computed using kinetic theory. We find that the optimum values of shear viscosity extracted from data can be modified up to 50% when bulk viscosity is included.

We further discuss the effects of baryon chemical potential on the shear viscosity of bulk nuclear matter.

The addition of the fluctuations leads to corrections to the suppression predictions, which are significant for charm quarks and their decay products.  We demonstrate how further experimental measurements can provide insight into the dominant energy loss mechanisms in, and hence the physical properties of, the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'William', 'last_name': 'Horowitz', 'fullName': 'Horowitz, William', 'id': '1728750', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': '55f364f277a24e4fba7936eefe9fac04', 'db_id': 1728750, 'person_id': 1867924}"
Collective dynamics,parallel,Exploiting intrinsic triangular geometry in relativistic He3+Au collisions to disentangle medium properties,"Romatschke, Paul",U,Unknown,"Recent results in d+Au and p+Pb collisions at RHIC and the LHC provide evidence for collective expansion and flow of the created medium. We propose a control set of experiments to directly compare particle emission patterns from p+Au, d+Au, and He3+Au or t+Au collisions at the same sqrt(sNN). Using Monte Carlo Glauber we find that a He3 or triton projectile, with a realistic wavefunction description, induces a significant intrinsic triangular shape to the initial medium and that, even with viscous damping, this survives into a significant third order flow moment v3. By comparing systems with one, two, and three initial hot spots, one can disentangle the effects from the initial spatial distribution of the deposited energy and viscous damping. These are key tools to answering the question of how small a droplet of matter is necessary to form a quark-gluon plasma described by nearly inviscid hydrodynamics.

It has been attributed to mechanisms that involve initial-state effects, such as gluon saturation and colour connections forming along the longitudinal direction, and final-state effects, such as parton-induced interactions and collective effects developing in a high-density system possibly formed in these collisions. In order to understand the nature of this double-ridge structure the two-particle correlation analysis has been extended to identified particles. The observed mass dependence in p-Pb resembles qualitative expectations from hydrodynamics, and is also observed in Pb-Pb collisions. A study of correlations at forward rapidity probes the low-x regime of the nucleus, where saturation effects are expected to become stronger. The possibility of accessing this regime using the ALICE forward muon detector is explored.

The mass of a jet, as measured by jet reconstruction algorithms, is intimately connected to the jet's virtuality (or scale), which in turn has a considerable effect on such observables as the fragmentation function and jet shape observables. The leading hard parton, propagating through a dense medium tends to experience substantial virtuality (or mass) depletion along with energy loss, and thus accurate comparisons between surviving jets and jets produced in p-p collisions should take these effects into account. Using the event generator PYTHIA, we show the close relationship between the actual jet mass and that after applying a jet reconstruction algorithm. Using the in-medium event generator MATTER++, we demonstrate the clear difference between the mass of a surviving parton exiting a dense medium and a parton with a similar energy formed in a hard p-p event.

Experimental measurements of single particle and two-particle correlations in the forward direction have revealed novel nuclear suppression patterns, which might help pinpoint the small-x gluon dynamics. At the moment there are two formalisms which can both describe reasonably well the nuclear suppression observed in these experiments. One is the so-called higher-twist factorization approach, which describes the parton multiple scattering in terms of the power corrections to the differential cross section [1,2].  The other one is the so-called small-x color glass condensate (CGC) approach [3]. So far the precise connection between these two approaches has not been established. In this talk, we demonstrate how the multiple parton scattering picture and the small-x gluon saturation picture are related and show how the transition from a dilute parton system to a dense gluon saturation region occurs.  Our work unifies the two approaches in studying the nonlinear small-x parton dynamics. On the example of forward rapidity photon production in p+A collisions, we demonstrate that in the broad transition region between a dilute parton system and a deeply saturated regime the two approaches give identical results.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Early isotropization of the quark-gluon plasma,"Epelbaum, Thomas",IPhT,Unknown,"In recent years, the problem of thermalization in Heavy Ion Collision has received much attention, but has yet to be solved.

 The issue is the following: on one hand, viscous hydrodynamics simulations suggest that the matter produced in such collisions (called the Quark Gluon Plasma, or QGP) behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, and does so very shortly after the collision (around 1 fm/c). Since hydrodynamics has local thermal equilibrium in its prerequisites, this tends to show that the QGP has thermalized during the very early stages of the collision. On the other hand, theoretical models (based on microscopic theories like the Color Glass Condensate, or CGC) predict that the QGP is very far from local thermal equilibrium at the initial time (among other non-thermal features, its energy-momentum tensor is very anisotropic).

 One of the approaches developed to study this non-perturbative problem in QCD is a resummation scheme that amounts to averaging over classical fields, with random initial conditions given by a one loop calculation in the CGC framework.

We present here the results that we obtained by following this approach – the so-called classical statistical approximation or CSA, showing an early isotropization of the system compatible with viscous hydrodynamics.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Viscous corrections to photon emission in heavy-ion collisions,"Shen, Chun",Ohio State University,USA,"Photons are believed to be clean and penetrating probes of the medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The thermal photon spectrum and its anisotropy coefficients, $v_n$, are known to be very sensitive to the thermalization time, the specific shear viscosity, the equation of state of produced matter, and the initial state fluctuations [1,2]. In this talk, we will present state-of-the-art calculations of event-by-event photon emission from nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC energies including both shear and bulk viscous corrections. Momentum spectra of thermal photons and their $p_T$-differential anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n(p_T)$ ($n$ up to 5) are computed, both with and without accounting for viscous corrections to the standard thermal emission rates. Viscous corrections to the rates are found to have a larger effect on the $v_n$ coefficients than the viscous suppression of hydrodynamic flow anisotropies. Effects from non-zero initial flow and viscous pressure tensor to photon spectra and their anisotropies are also investigated by evolving fluctuating initial density profiles with free-streaming on the event-by-event basis before matching to hydrodynamics. Complementary to the majority of hadronic observables, thermal photons provide us with additional constraints on the evolution of the viscous pressure tensor as well as the early dynamics of heavy-ion collisions. Their anisotropic flows, especially higher order $v_n$, can be used as a sensitive viscometer for the quark-gluon plasma.

However, testing the prediction accuracy - and extracting useful qualitative knowledge - is often limited by constraining the predictions to only few experimental probes at a time, and by using free parameters. To address this issue, we will present comprehensive suppression predictions, which run across all available probes and different centrality regions at RHIC and LHC. To generate these predictions, we use the finite size dynamical QCD formalism that we previously developed, together with its recent extensions to finite magnetic mass [1] and running coupling [2]; this formalism is integrated into a numerical procedure that uses no free parameters in model testing. We obtain a very good agreement with the experimental results across all particle species [2,3], for different centrality regions [4], and for both RHIC and LHC. We will also discuss improved qualitative understanding of the relevant experimental data, which follows from such comprehensive comparison.

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Charge asymmetry dependency of $\pi$/K anisotropic flow in U+U and Au+Au collisions at STAR,"Shou, Qi-Ye","SINAP, BNL",USA,"Theoretical studies [1] indicate that in relativistic heavy collisions a chiral magnetic wave at finite baryon density could induce an electric quadrupole moment, which will lead to a difference in elliptic flow of hadrons with opposite charge. The magnitude of this difference is predicted to be proportional to the charge asymmetry $A_\mathrm{ch}$, defined as $A_\mathrm{ch} \equiv \langle \left (N_{+} -N_{-} \right )/\left ( N_{+} +N_{-}  \right ) \rangle$. Charge-asymmetry dependency of the pion elliptic flow has been observed in Au+Au collisions at the STAR experiment. On the other hand, it is argued that the local charge conservation at freeze-out, together with the characteristic shape of $v_{2}(\eta)$ and $v_{2}(p_\mathrm{T})$, may also contribute to elliptic flow splitting as a function of $A_\mathrm{ch}$. This can be manifested by implementing the corresponding measurement for higher flow harmonics $v_{3}$ [2].

Here, we present STAR's measurements of $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ for charged pions and kaons at low transverse momentum range (0.15 $< p_\mathrm{T} <$ 0.5 GeV/c), as a function of event charge asymmetry ($A_\mathrm{ch}$) in both U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 193 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

First, we develop a formula in which canonical partition functions are constructed
from multiplicities data

the grand partition functions as a function of the fugacity, $\exp(\mu/T)$, from which
we can investigate the system when it goes near to the QCD phase transition line.

Since heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are produced on a shorter time scale with respect to the hot fireball, they are suited to probe the interaction dynamics inside the medium.

The ALICE collaboration has measured the production of open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via the semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. The azimuthal distribution of heavy-flavour hadrons reflects the initial spatial anisotropy of the heavy-ion collision in case of sufficient re-scattering of the heavy quarks in the hot and dense matter. Therefore the heavy-flavour elliptic flow, the second harmonic in the Fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution, is an observable sensitive to the degree of thermalization of charm and beauty quarks in the medium at low $p_{\rm T}$, as well as to the path length dependence of the energy loss of heavy quarks at high $p_{\rm T}$.

The elliptic flow measurements are presented for prompt charm mesons, i.e D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, D$^{*+}$, and heavy-flavour decay electrons at mid-rapidity, as well as for heavy-flavour decay muons at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV for various centrality intervals.

In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks are regarded as 
effective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a

subsequently interact with it.
The nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$, defined as the ratio of 
the yield measured in

Indeed, due to their large mass, charm and beauty quarks are produced in initial hard scattering processes among partons of the colliding nuclei, before the formation of the QGP, and they traverse the medium and interact with its constituents.
The ALICE Collaboration measured the production of open heavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays at mid-rapidity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7, 5.02 and 2.76 TeV respectively.
A strong suppression of the open charm hadron yields at high $p_{\rm T}$ was observed in Pb-Pb collisions relative to pp interactions: this effect is attributed to a substantial in-medium energy loss of the charm quarks.
Further insight into the effects of the medium on charm and beauty quarks can be obtained by measuring the angular correlations between open heavy-flavour hadrons and charged hadrons.
The comparison of the correlation function in pp and Pb-Pb collisions can provide deeper information on the way heavy quarks lose energy in the QGP and can spot possible modifications to the charm parton shower and hadronisation in the presence of the medium. Furthermore, by studying the correlations of electrons from heavy-flavour decays and the charged hadrons in pp, it is possible to statistically separate the charm and beauty contributions to the yield of heavy-flavour decay electrons, making this analysis an excellent tool to test pQCD calculations.
The observation of double-ridge long range correlations in p-Pb collisions for light-flavour hadrons could originate from a collective behaviour of the system, as well as from gluon saturation in the initial state (color glass condensate). The same effect can be studied for heavier quarks via the correlation between heavy-flavour hadrons (or their decay electrons) and charged particles.
Results from the correlation analyses, performed using the data collected with ALICE in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, Pb-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will be presented in this contribution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sandro', 'last_name': 'Bjelogrlic', 'fullName': 'Bjelogrlic, Sandro', 'id': '1729112', 'affiliation': 'NIKHEF (NL)', 'emailHash': 'f570becd6acd7db066ea991a18e03e8d', 'db_id': 1729112, 'person_id': 1868189}"

In proton-nucleus collisions at LHC energies, the charmonium formation time is larger than the

Using the path integral formalism, all particles are allowed to undergo Brownian motion in the transverse plane and the offspring allowed to carry an arbitrary fraction of the initial energy.

highest energy at RHIC. Recent calculations in effective models and in
QCD using Dyson Schwinger equation suggest that the transition in QCD
remains a crossover up to baryon chemical potentials of about 800MeV [1]. 
If so, the equation of state relevant for hydrodynamic models can be
calculated on the lattice using Taylor expansion. However, except for
the coefficients of the lowest order, there are large cutoff effects
in present lattice calculations for non-zero chemical potentials.

To extend our previous parametrization of the equation of state [2] to
finite baryon density, we employ the continuum extrapolated lattice
QCD data on Taylor expansion coefficients in order two [3], and
complement them with coefficients in order four and six evaluated
using p4 action [4]. To avoid large cutoff efects these coefficients
are smoothly matched to those of hadron resonance gas at low
temperature. Some preliminary results were reported in [5]. We also

measurements of particle production in the low and intermediate $p_{\rm T}$
region indicate the presence of collective effects.

Since many initial state effects are expected to vary as a function of
the number of collisions suffered by the incoming projectile, it is
crucial to estimate event-by-event the centrality of the collision.

We present the centrality dependence of particle production in p-A
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment,
including the pseudo-rapidity and transverse momentum spectra, with a
special emphasis on the event classification in centrality classes and
its implications in the interpretation of the nuclear effects.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alberica', 'last_name': 'Toia', 'fullName': 'Toia, Alberica', 'id': '1729143', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Structure of chromomagnetic fields in the glasma,"Lappi, Tuomas",University of Jyvaskyla,Unknown,"The initial stage of a heavy ion collision is dominated by nonperturbatively strong chromoelectric and -magnetic fields. The properties of these fields can be calculated numerically using the CGC description of the small x degrees of freedom of the colliding nuclei. The spatial Wilson loop provides a gauge invariant observable to probe the dynamics of the longitudinal chromomagnetic field. This talk describes the results from a recent real time lattice calculation (arXiv:1401.4124) of the area-dependence of the expectation value of the spatial Wilson loop.

We consider ensembles of gauge field configurations generated from the MV-model classical Gaussian effective action as well as solutions of the JIMWLK high-energy renormalization group equation with fixed and running coupling. The initial fields exhibit domain-like structure over distance scales of the order of the saturation scale. At later times universal scaling emerges at large distances for all ensembles, with a nontrivial critical exponent. A similar behavior has earlier been seen in calculations of the gluon transverse momentum spectrum, which becomes independent of the initial spectrum of gauge fields (i.e. the initial unintegrated gluon distribution) for momenta less than the saturation scale. Finally, we compare the results for the Wilson loop to the two-point correlator of magnetic fields.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Tuomas', 'last_name': 'Lappi', 'fullName': 'Lappi, Tuomas', 'id': '1729148', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyvaskyla', 'emailHash': '87ad43a34630eedf464200cebee1c285', 'db_id': 1729148, 'person_id': 1868002}"

rapidity-even dipolar flow $v_1$ is also observed, further supporting a
collective origin of the long-range two-particle correlations. The first

the $v_2$ values are smaller in the proton-going side than those in the

Dilepton measurements performed so far in heavy-ion collisions at various energies have found that the major challenge is to subtract the combinatorial background which overwhelms the interesting signals such as the rho spectral distribution, direct radiation from the fireball at intermediate invariant masses, and charmonia.  This background is of different physical origin for dielectron and dimuons, and differs as function of invariant mass. Therefore, the systematic and statistical errors of the extracted signals will be substantially minimized by measuring both electron and muon pairs. The CBM detector is designed as a multi-purpose device which will be able to measure hadrons, electrons and muons in heavy-ion collisions.  Electrons will be measured using a Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector in combination with a Transition Radiation Detector.

Light nuclei ($d$, $\bar{d}$, $t$, $^{\small{3}}He$), produced in such collisions, are believed to be formed by coalescence of nucleons. By comparing $v_{2}$ of light nuclei with their constituents, we can understand the production mechanism of  nuclei in heavy ion collisions. At top RHIC energies, identified hadron $v_{2}$ revealed many features like the number-of-constituent quark (NCQ) scaling and mass ordering. With the combined statistics, we can test the scaling behaviors for rare multi-strange particles ($\phi$, $\Xi $ and $\Omega$).

Heavy-flavour measurements as a function of the

the interplay between hard and soft contributions to particle production and,
in particular, could give insight into the role of multi-parton interactions

Experimentally feasible correlation observables can thus discriminate between elastic and radiative processes and provide valuable information about the transport coefficients. Higher-order flow harmonics, $v_n$, quantify the degree of thermalization of heavy quarks beyond our current understanding of the built-up of elliptic flow. By selecting special classes of bulk events from the probability distribution of $v_n$ of light-flavor hadrons we discuss systematically how relating the light- and the heavy-flavor sector help us understand the interaction mechanisms and thermalization in the QGP.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marlene', 'last_name': 'Nahrgang', 'fullName': 'Nahrgang, Marlene', 'id': '1729293', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '4751b9ae0f461a7314fe14eb52013856', 'db_id': 1729293, 'person_id': 1867762}"
Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Femtoscopic pair correlations of mesons and baryons at RHIC and LHC  from hydrokinetic model,"Sinyukov, Yuri",Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics,Unknown,"The  femtoscopic scales for  identical pions and kaons are presented at different centralities for the top energy RHIC and LHC A+A collisions in comparison with ones for p+p collisions. The later results are obtained in hydrokinetic model (HKM) in view of the quantum uncertainty principle. The three-dimensional pion and kaon emission source functions are extracted from the HKM model simulations for A+A collisions. The model describes well the experimental data, previously obtained by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations using the imaging technique. In particular, the HKM reproduces the non-Gaussian heavy tails of the source function in the pair transverse momentum (out ) and beam (long) directions, observed in the pion case and practically absent for kaons. The role of the rescatterings and long-lived resonances decays in forming of the long range tails is investigated. The prediction is made for the source functions in the LHC Pb+Pb collisions at √s= 2.76 TeV.  
         As for the baryon-baryon correlations, the  source functions of   pp, pΛ and p ̅Λ pairs are found in Au+Au collisions and used by means of FSI correlation technique for an extraction of the  scattering lengths in two-baryon  systems. The role of residual correlations in formation of the total baryon-baryon correlation function is analyzed.

Recently, net-electric charge and net-proton fluctuations measured in the beam energy scan program at RHIC were reported by the STAR collaboration. In this talk, we present a new freeze-out curve, which is determined from a combined fit to these fluctuation observables within a phenomenological approach based on the hadron resonance gas model. We also point out that net-strangeness fluctuations may indicate a separate freeze-out behavior of strange hadrons. For a realistic description, we apply the relevant kinematic cuts and systematically include final state effects such as resonance decays and regenerations. The inclusion of the successive regeneration and decay of resonances turns out to be crucial for reconciling calculations of net-proton fluctuations with those of net-baryon number fluctuations and for obtaining reasonable freeze-out conditions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marcus', 'last_name': 'Bluhm', 'fullName': 'Bluhm, Marcus', 'id': '1729303', 'affiliation': 'North Carolina State University', 'emailHash': 'dc5db70727484b8566194e326570c192', 'db_id': 1729303, 'person_id': 1868303}"

the elliptic flow of positive and negative pions on the net charge
density [1]. This measurement attracted a lot of community attention,
as the signal appeared to be of the magnitude and the sign of that
predicted by the theory of the Chiral Magnetic Wave [2].  At the same
time the interpretation of the results and further detailed study of
the effect is rather difficult as the observable itself, the slope of
elliptic flow value on the observed charge asymmetry in the STAR TPC
acceptance, depends on the tracking efficiency and detector
acceptance. In this talk we show how one can first make the observable
robust (efficiency independent) and then make it suitable for many
differential studies, not possible before. We use this observable, a
three-particle correlator, in our model calculations to show the
sensitivity of the signal to several background effects, such as local
charge conservation, and propose experimental tests for further
identification of the effects responsible for the observed signal.

Radiative processes, in particular, are implemented through an improved version of the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element, which is derived from comparisons to the exact result.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,What the collective flow excitation function can tell about the quark-gluon plasma,"Auvinen, Jussi",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"The midrapidity slope d$v_1$/d$y$ of the directed flow $v_1$ has been predicted to be sensitive to the possible first-order phase transition between the hadron gas and the quark-gluon
plasma. The recent STAR data from the RHIC beam energy scan (BES) show that the net-proton d$v_1$/d$y$ changes sign twice within the collision energy range 7.7 - 39 GeV. To further investigate this phenomenon, we study the collision energy dependence of $v_1$ utilizing a Boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid model. Such a hybrid approach provides a natural framework for the transition from high collision energies, where the hydrodynamical description is essential, to smaller energies, where the hadron transport dominates. Calculation with dynamically evolved initial and final state shows no qualitative difference between an equation of state with cross-over and one with first-order phase transition [1], in contrast to the earlier pure fluid predictions.

We have also investigated the energy evolution of the elliptic flow $v_2$ and triangular flow $v_3$ [2]. The $v_2$ analysis shows that pre-equilibrium transport dynamics are partially compensating for the diminished elliptic flow production in the hydrodynamical phase at lower energies, resulting to relatively weak collision energy dependence which is in qualitative agreement with STAR BES results. The medium described by transport is, however, too viscous to build up triangular flow, making $v_3$ the clearer signal for the formation of (near-)ideal fluid in relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Probing the non-equilibrium dynamics of hot and dense QCD with dileptons,"Vujanovic, Gojko",McGill University,United States,"Much work has been devoted to the determination of an effective value of the shear viscosity coefficient from analyses of the hadronic final states in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Electromagnetic radiation, however, constitutes a class of complementary and penetrating probes that are sensitive to the entire space-time history of nuclear collisions including its very early stages. We show that thermal dileptons (and photons) are affected by the transport properties of the fluid and by the non-equilibrium aspects of the initial state that are usually inaccessible to hadronic probes. For the first time, we explicitly demonstrate that electromagnetic spectra and azimuthal momentum anisotropy can be used not only to investigate the magnitude of the shear relaxation time and to differentiate between possible initial shear-stress tensors, but also to reveal the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity coefficient. We further show that the dependence of electromagnetic probes on these quantities comes mostly from processes occurring in the QGP phase. Our approach utilizes event-by-event 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic simulations (MUSIC) [1], and the dilepton emission sources include contributions from charm decay and hadronic rates extracted from in-medium spectral functions [2].

QCD phase diagram,parallel,Multiplicity fluctuation from hydrodynamic noise,"Hirano, Tetsufumi",Sophia Univ,Unknown,"We discuss multiplicity fluctuation
caused by noises during hydrodynamic evolution of the quark-gluon fluid
created in high-energy nuclear collisions. 
In this talk, we claim the following non-trivial consequences within a framework of relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics [1]:

 - Multiplicity (being approximately proportional to entropy) fluctuates
from event to event 
due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of dissipative currents such as shear stress tensor and bulk pressure
even if the initial state is the same in a macroscopic sense.
 - *Event-averaged* entropy has to increase with time
so that the system obeys the second law of thermodynamics as it should be. 
Entropy in a certain event can, however, *decrease* with time temporarily and locally due to the hydrodynamic fluctuations. 
 - The probability of decreasing entropy during hydrodynamic evolution
is, of course, very small in general. Interestingly, the probability is quantified by the *fluctuation theorem* [2]
as known in the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

We first discuss the fluctuation theorem in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics [2].
The fluctuation theorem has been a milestone in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics
since the linear response theory was established. Since the fluctuation theorem contains the Green-Kubo formula
at long-time limit, it is believed to capture some important properties of non-equilibrium processes
away from equilibrium.

We next solve the stochastic equation for dissipative currents
together with the temporal evolution equation for the energy density
in one-dimensionally expanding coordinate [3]
to demonstrate that the final entropy fluctuates from event to event for a given initial condition.
During the time evolution of the total entropy in a certain event,
reduction of the entropy occurs due to hydrodynamic fluctuation of
dissipative currents.  
We show that the probability of decreasing entropy just obeys the above-mentioned fluctuation theorem.

We finally discuss the physics consequences of hydrodynamic fluctuations on final observables.
Fluctuation of the final entropy is taken over by the one of multiplicity.
Thus we discuss multiplicity distribution functions from a hydrodynamic fluctuation point of view. 
We also discuss observables in small system
such as p+p or p/d+A collisions since the effect of fluctuations
are of particular importance in such smaller systems.

Heavy flavor,parallel,J/$\psi$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV,"Book, Julian",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ. (DE),Germany,"The ALICE Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides unique capabilities to study
charmonium production at low transverse momentum. In the early and hottest phase of
nucleus-nucleus collisions the formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected. Several QGP
induced effects, such as the melting of charmonium states due to color screening and/or a
(re)combination of uncorrelated charm and anti-charm quarks, can play a role. A suppression with
respect to pp collisions of charmonium states such as the J$/\psi$ was indeed observed in
heavy-ion collisions, with the corresponding measurements in pp and p-Pb collisions being crucial
for the understanding of the Pb--Pb results.

At central (forward) rapidity, corresponding to the range  $|y| < 0.9$ ($ 2.5 < y < 4$) , J$/\psi$ are

Electromagnetic probes,parallel,The QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate temperature and high baryon density: study of dimuon production in the 20-160 AGeV interval at the CERN SPS,"Usai, Gianluca",Universita e INFN (IT),Italy,"The structure of the QCD phase diagram in the region of moderate temperature and high baryon density is still almost unexplored. In this regime,  the QGP and hadronic phases should be separated by a first order transition region. On the other hand, for sufficiently low baryonic chemical potential a simple cross-over is expected. The end point of the first order transition region is the so called critical point.

Measurements of the ratio $K^+/\pi^+$ vs energy performed at the CERN SPS by the NA49 collaboration showed that the early stage produced in central Pb-Pb collisions at $E_{lab}$=30-40 AGeV may have reached the transition line - marking the onset of deconfinement.  However, this interpretation is still controversial. Dilepton measurements with a rich set of independent observables offer a completely  independent way to shed light on the onset of deconfinement and at the same time on the issue of  chiral restoration. The CERN SPS is unique for systematic investigations along these lines, due to its  wide beam energy range from 20-160 AGeV coupled to very high luminosities over the full range. 

The objective of this talk is to present a new proposal for measuring dimuon production in a comprehensive energy scan at the SPS - specifically both below and above the maximum of the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio. To advance the field with  measurements which could provide quantitative insight,  a further significant increase in  the precision and in the collected statistics  with respect to the past reference experiment NA60 is needed. To this end, we propose a novel NA60-like apparatus, with improved performance, based on the coupling of a muon spectrometer  to a a silicon pixel spectrometer in the vertex region before the absorber. 

The first key element is a high-precision measurement of the temperature $T$ of the thermal dimuon continuum in the mass range $1.1\lt M\lt2.5$ GeV (IMR) vs. beam energy. The temperature is accessible through the spectral shape of the mass spectra, and since mass is a Lorentz-invariant, $T$ is immune to  any motion of the emitting sources and thus purely  thermal,  in contrast to the slope parameters of dilepton $m_T$ spectra or photon $p_T$ spectra. At top SPS  energies, values of about 200 MeV were found, indicating dominantly partonic emission sources. For decreasing beam energies one should expect that the partonic contribution will also decrease, becoming negligible at the onset of deconfinement. Thus the onset of deconfinement might be tagged by a precision measurement of $T$ in the IMR. 

The second  element is related to the transverse momentum spectra, which encode - besides temperature - also radial flow, another key property of the fireball. At topmost SPS energies the 
effective temperature extracted from the $m_T$ spectra vs mass shows an increase up to $M\sim1$ GeV corresponding to $\rho$ production which is maximally coupled to radial  flow through pions. At 1 GeV a sudden drop occurs and the temperature is constant at 180-200 MeV - a sign of production of thermal dimuons from the partonic medium without  any flow (at the SPS). The evolution of the pattern of $T_{eff}$ vs. $M$ towards lower energies,  in  particular  the possible decrease or disappearence of the  drop, will  be most revealing: thermal radiation from multi-pion processes should exhibit a monotonic increase of $T_{eff}$ vs $M$ so that around the onset of deconfinement the drop should vanish.

The new experiment should reach a sensitivity at the MeV level  in the measurements of $T$ and $T_{eff}$ vs $M$. This will be possible  integrating luminosities at least an order of magnitude larger than in case of NA60 or so while retaining a good signal to background ratio -  well above than 1/100 in the IMR even in Pb-Pb central collisions.

For masses below 1 GeV (LMR), at high energies, hadronic many body models describe $\rho$  production and the notion that the total baryon density drives the broadening is now well accepted. At lower energies, the baryon density gets maximal, thus the effects of $\rho$ broadening can be measured with utmost precision. 
In this measurement the mass resolution is a key factor and we propose to improve it over NA60 by a factor 2-3, reaching $\sim$10 MeV at the $\omega$ mass.

The experimental apparatus must have also a good $p_T$-$y$ coverage down to the lowest beam energies. In the talk  the detector perfomance in terms of acceptances at different energies and mass resolution  will be discussed in detail.

Jets,parallel,Qualitative extraction of qhat from combined jet quenching at RHIC and LHC,"Wang, Xin-Nian",Central China Normal University/Lawrence Berkeley National Lab,USA,"On behalf the JET Collaboration

Within five different approaches to parton propagation and energy loss in dense matter, a phenomenological study of experimental data on suppression of large $p_T$ single inclusive hadrons in heavy-ion collisions at both RHIC and LHC was carried out.  The evolution of bulk medium used in the study for parton propagation was given by 2+1D or 3+1D hydrodynamic models which are also constrained by experimental data on bulk hadron spectra. Values for the jet transport parameter $\hat q$ at the center of the most central heavy-ion collisions are extracted or calculated within each model, with parameters for the medium properties that are constrained by experimental data on the hadron suppression factor $R_{AA}$.   For a quark with initial energy of 10 GeV we find that $\hat q\approx 1.2 \pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm at an initial time $\tau_0=0.6$ fm/$c$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV/n and $\hat q\approx 1.9 \pm 0.7 $ GeV$^2$/fm in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=2.76 $ TeV/n.

Heavy flavor,parallel,"Heavy-flavor evolution in QGP and hadron gas: suppression, flow and angular de-correlation","Cao, Shanshan",Duke University,USA,"Heavy flavor hadrons serve as valuable probes of the transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We introduce a comprehensive framework that describes their full-time evolution in the QGP matter and the subsequent hadronic phase. The heavy quark energy loss in a de-confined QCD medium is modeled with our improved Langevin approach [1] that simultaneously incorporates quasi-elastic scattering [2,3] and medium-induced gluon radiation [4]. The subsequent transport of heavy mesons in the hadron gas phase is described within the ultra-relativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model [5]. The intermediate hadronization process from heavy quarks to their respective mesonic bound states is calculated with our hybrid fragmentation plus coalescence model [1].

We investigate the relative contribution of each of these ingredients to the final-state spectra of heavy mesons and demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering dominates heavy quark energy loss in the QGP at low energies, contributions from gluon radiation at high energies are significant; the coalescence process is found important for heavy meson production at intermediate transverse momenta; and the subsequent hadronic interactions is equally crucial as the free quark evolution inside QGP for the development of heavy flavor suppression and collective flow behaviors that one observes. Within this newly developed framework, we provide a good description of D meson suppression and flow measured at both RHIC and LHC, as well as predictions for the future measurements of B mesons.

In addition, a new set of observables – heavy-flavor-tagged angular correlation functions – are explored and found to be potential candidates for distinguishing different energy loss mechanisms of heavy quarks inside a QGP medium [6]. We calculate correlation functions for D-D, D-e, D-hadron, e-hadron, etc., some of which can be compared to the existing preliminary data from LHC experiments.

 For the bulk medium we compare the temperature and flow evolution in fireball [1]

 We deduce evidence for an enhancement of currently available hadronic and QGP

Collective dynamics,parallel,Viscous hydrodynamics for systems undergoing strongly anisotropic expansion,"Heinz, Ulrich",The Ohio State University,USA,"The collective expansion in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is initially highly anisotropic. Due to viscosity, this leads to strongly deformed local momentum distributions which invalidates the standard viscous hydrodynamic expansion around a local equilibrium distribution, causing a breakdown of viscous fluid dynamics à la Israel and Stewart at early times. We have developed an improved formulation of viscous hydrodynamics [1] that is based on an expansion around a spheroidally deformed local momentum distribution. A spheroidal local momentum distribution leads to the ""anisotropic hydrodynamics"" developed earlier by Martinez and Strickland, which accounts non-perturbatively for the resulting large early-time anisotropy between the longitudinal and transverse pressures. By allowing in our new treatment for additional small deviations of the local momentum distribution from spheroidal symmetry, we arrive at a complete formulation of second-order viscous hydrodynamics in which the large longitudinal-transverse momentum anisotropy is treated non-perturbatively à la Martinez and Strickland while the smaller remaining viscous stress components are treated perturbatively à la Israel and Stewart. We perform a test of the approach for a system undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion without transverse expansion which maximizes the longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy. For this system the Boltzmann equation can be solved exactly in the relaxation-time approximation, allowing for a quantitative test of effective macroscopic hydrodynamic theories. We find that the viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic framework (""vaHydro"") significantly outperforms all other available hydrodynamic descriptions, for both small and large values of the shear viscosity $\eta/s$. We expect vaHydro to provide a superior description also after including transverse expansion and to allow for an earlier matching of pre-equilibrium dynamics to hydrodynamics, due to the superior ability of vaHydro to handle the large differences in longitudinal and transverse expansion rates at early times.

The distribution of fluctuation-driven anisotropies, such as the initial triangularity $\varepsilon_3$, is described by a one-parameter power distribution. When a mean anisotropy in the reaction plane is also present, as in the case of the the initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$ in nucleus-nucleus collision, a new parameter must be added: the power distribution is replaced by a new, elliptic power distribution. Our results are in excellent agreement with all  Monte-Carlo models of the initial state (Glauber, KLN, IP-Glasma) for all collision systems and all centralities.

We then apply our results to the interpretation of the event-by-event distributions of $v_2$ and $v_3$ recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. Assuming that anisotropic flow is proportional to the initial anisotropy, $v_n=C_n\varepsilon_n$,
we obtain excellent fits to these data. This procedure gives us direct information on the initial state from data. Our results are compared to several initial-state models. We are also able to extract the hydrodynamic response $C_n$ for $n=2,3$ as a function of centrality, without assuming any particular model for the initial state. These results are compared with viscous hydrodynamic calculations of the response.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Factorization breakdown of two-particle correlations and flow phenomena in pPb and PbPb collisions with CMS,"Devetak, Damir",University of Belgrade (RS),RS,"The technique of two-particle correlations has been widely used in studying flow via azimuthal anisotropy in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. A key assumption imposed in this approach is the factorization of Fourier coefficients extracted from two-particle correlations into a product of single-particle anisotropies of trigger and associated particles. It was recently predicted by hydrodynamics that due to initial-state participant fluctuations, a transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependence of the event-plane angle would be induced, leading to a breakdown of factorization, even if hydrodynamic flow is the only source of correlations. We present a systematic examination of the factorization assumption in 5.02 TeV pPb and 2.76 TeV PbPb collisions with the CMS experiment. Significant breakdown of factorization (up to 20%) is observed in a large sample of ultra-central (0--0.2%) triggered PbPb events, where initial-state fluctuations play a dominant role. Comparison of data and viscous hydrodynamics predictions, as a function of $p_T$ and centrality, allows new constraints on the modeling of initial condition and shear viscosity to entropy density ($\eta/s$) ratio of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the measurement is also extended to high-multiplicity pPb collisions.

Measurements of neutral meson spectra in pp 
collisions at energies $\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9, 2.76, 7 TeV provide 
valuable 
data for pQCD calculations and allow to study scaling properties of
hadron production at the 
LHC energies.  The study of neutral meson
production in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV is of 
importance
 to confirm that the strong suppresion observed in central Pb-Pb 
collisions is a final-state 
effect of the produced dense medium.  
The 
nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm AA}$ of the $\pi^0$ production in
 Pb-Pb collisions at 
$\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV at different 
collision centralities shows a clear pattern of strong 
suppression in 
a hot QCD medium with respect to pp collisions. We shall also present
the current status 
of correlation measurements between $\pi^0$ or
isolated photons triggered by the electromagnetic calorimeter 
EMCAL, 
and charged hadrons detected in the central tracker.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ana', 'last_name': 'Marin', 'fullName': 'Marin, Ana', 'id': '1729656', 'affiliation': 'GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE)', 'emailHash': '506d58ec66f828efb3ae7110dbd7e950', 'db_id': 1729656, 'person_id': 1868484}"
Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Direct-photon spectra and flow in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC measured with the ALICE experiment,"Bock, Friederike",Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,"Unlike hadrons, direct photons are produced in all stages of a 
nucleus-nucleus collision and therefore test our understanding of the
space-time evolution of the produced medium. Of particular interest
 are 
so-called thermal photons expected to be produced in a quark-gluon
 plasma and the subsequent hadron gas. 
The transverse momentum spectrum 
of thermal photons carries information about the temperature of the

emitting medium. The effect of Doppler blueshift on photons spectra
 from later and colder stages of a 
collision, however, potentially 
complicates the extraction of the temperature. 
In this presentation, 
direct-photon spectra in the range $1 < p_T < 12$ GeV/c from Pb-Pb
collisions at 
$\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV will be shown. The results
were obtained with two independent methods: 
by measuring photons with 
the electromagnetic calorimeter PHOS and by measuring $e^+e^-$ pairs
 from 
external conversions of photons in the detector material. The
 measured direct-photon spectra will be 
compared with predictions from
 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models. In addition, direct-photon 
production 
in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be 
discussed. In the standard hydrodynamical 
modeling of nucleus-nucleus 
collisions, thermal photons mostly come from the early hot stage of the

collision. As collective hydrodynamic flow needs time to build up, the 
azimuthal anisotropy of 
thermal photons quantified with Fourier
 coefficient $v_2$ is expected to be smaller than the one for

hadrons. However, the PHENIX experiment and ALICE experiment observed 
$v_2$ values of direct-photons 
similar in magnitude to the pion
$v_2$. These unexpected observations constitute the so called

""direct-photon flow puzzle"" as they challenge the standard
 hydrodynamic picture of nucleus-nucleus 
collisions and/or the standard 
photon emissions rates in the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron
 gas. 
We will present the inclusive photon $v_2$ and $v_3$ in Pb-Pb
 collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ 
TeV in the range $1 < p_T < 5$
 GeV/c and discuss implications for the $v_2$ and $v_3$ of 
direct-photons.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Friederike', 'last_name': 'Bock', 'fullName': 'Bock, Friederike', 'id': '1729657', 'affiliation': 'Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE)', 'emailHash': '169e9eec9a35a4cbb8ea780cf3490d44', 'db_id': 1729657, 'person_id': 1868485}"
Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Signatures of collective behavior in small systems,"Kozlov, Igor",McGill University,Unknown,"We perform 3+1D viscous hydrodynamic calculations of proton-nucleus
and nucleus-nucleus collisions.  The goal is to ascertain the nature
of the striking correlations seen in recent proton-nucleus collisions.
 In particular, one would like to know:  is the observed ridge a
signature of collective behavior?  Can the highest multiplicity
collision systems be accurately described as a relativistic fluid?  If
so, at what point does hydrodynamics fail to describe the bulk
evolution?

To this end, we propose to measure the detailed transverse momentum
structure of two-particle correlations. They must satisfy rigid
inequality relations in any hydrodynamic system, and within those
bounds we show that they should have a particular dependence on
multiplicity over the entire measured centrality range.  Any deviation
from this behavior would signal a breakdown of a hydrodynamic
description.  We also show how a simultaneous description of Pb-Pb and
p-Pb data can put a significant constraint on theoretical models.

Finally, we compare our calculations to the full set of existing
measurements, demonstrating what parameters are required
for a good fit to data and commenting on what can be learned.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Igor', 'last_name': 'Kozlov', 'fullName': 'Kozlov, Igor', 'id': '1729674', 'affiliation': 'McGill University', 'emailHash': '0bc9355ba7b9b49d902a957aa010f2fc', 'db_id': 1729674, 'person_id': 1868500}"
Electromagnetic probes,parallel,Soft photon production from real-time dynamics of jet fragmentation,"Loshaj, Frasher",Stony Brook University,USA,"Soft photons produced in heavy ion collisions are an important tool in probing the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. For this purpose, it is crucial to understand the background - soft photons produced in elementary collisions. Low theorem states that soft photon production in hadron collisions is dominated by Bremsstrahlung off charged initial and final state hadrons. Surprisingly, almost every experiment observed an enhancement (by a factor of $2\div 5$) above Low theorem's prediction. This is the longstanding puzzle of ""anomalous soft photon production."" The phenomenon is not observed in processes with leptonic final states, which suggests that the mechanism is due to nonperturbative QCD evolution. We study this phenomenon using an exactly soluble, massless, Abelian model in $1+1$ dimensions which shares with QCD many important properties: confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, axial anomaly and $\theta$-vacuum. We then apply this model to the soft photon production in the fragmentation of jets produced in $Z^0$ decays and find a qualitative agreement with the data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Frasher', 'last_name': 'Loshaj', 'fullName': 'Loshaj, Frasher', 'id': '1729688', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '80754bded9ed851eb2625d6cb2f44a6c', 'db_id': 1729688, 'person_id': 1868507}"
New theoretical developments,parallel,Collisions in AdS: the road to experiments,"van der Schee, Wilke",Utrecht University,Unknown,"Holography has been used for a while as a strongly coupled approach to study the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions. As holographic calculations cannot directly describe QCD, importantly neglecting any weak-coupling effects, it is an interesting question how well these studies fit experimental data. Here, we will focus on longitudinal dynamics, modeled by colliding shock waves in AdS.

These collisions give a surprisingly universal rapidity profile, where the shape at high collision energies is completely independent of the energy or longitudinal structure of the colliding shocks. It is somewhat complicated to compare this initial profile to the final measured rapidity profile, but we can compute the entropy and thereby make an estimate of the total multiplicity. The result indicates that our infinite coupling profile has somewhat more stopping than in real heavy-ion collisions, which is most likely because of neglecting weak-coupling effects. We finally comment on (future) consequences for real nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus collisions.

Approach to equilibrium,parallel,Turbulent thermalization process in heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies,"Schlichting, Sören",Brookhaven National Lab,USA,"When and to what extent a thermalized Quark Gluon Plasma is achieved in heavy-ion collision impacts the quantitative extraction of transport properties in the QGP. We address this problem by employing the largest to date real time classical-statistical lattice simulations. Most remarkably, we find that the thermalization process is governed by a universal attractor, where the space-time evolution of the plasma becomes independent of the initial conditions [1,2]. In this classical regime, the plasma exhibits the self-similar dynamics characteristic of wave turbulence, as observed in a large variety of strongly correlated many-body systems. We interpret the consequences of our numerical lattice results for thermalization in heavy-ion experiments.
