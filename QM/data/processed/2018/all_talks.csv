Poster Session,poster,Bjorken expansion with gradual freeze out via HBT,"Borrell Martinez, Marc",Unknown,Unknown,"For Bjorken models with gradual freeze out, the resulting post freeze out momentum distribution practically does not depend on the layer thickness. Using such a model we calculate the pion correlation function produced in Pb+ Pb central collisions The correlation function is in qualitative agreement with other publications but our model allows us to perform a more detailed study of how this affects the final observables. We also find a good agreement with experimental data from ALICE and we deduce that long freeze out averaged correlation functions are more similar to experimental data than sharp freeze out.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marc', 'last_name': 'Borrell Martinez', 'fullName': 'Borrell Martinez, Marc', 'id': '3513408', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'abfefabb288b1acf08e4e437c3224995', 'db_id': 3513408, 'person_id': 3644588}"
Poster Session,poster,The Azimuthal Angle Dependence of Lambda (anti-Lambda) Polarization in Au+Au Collisions from STAR,"Tu, Biao",Central China Normal University and Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"The STAR experiment at RHIC has observed for the first time a significant alignment between the angular momentum of the medium produced in non-central collisions [1] and the spin of $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$) hyperons ($J$$=$1/2), revealing that the matter produced in heavy-ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. Such vorticity is expected to be maximal at the equator, and due to the low viscosity of the system, the vorticity may not be propagated efficiently to the poles. This may lead to a larger in-plane than out-of-plane polarization for $\Lambda$ hyperons.

In this poster, we will present the azimuthal angle (with respect to the reaction plane) dependence of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ polarization in 20-50% central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The implications of our results will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Factorization of two-particle probability distributions in  Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with ALICE,"Bourjau, Christian",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"The flow coefficients $v_n$ are commonly extracted from multi-particle distributions where the properties of one or several particles are averaged over a large range in pseudorapidity $\eta$ or transverse momentum $p_{\text{T}}$.
  Such approaches assume that the observed multi-particle distributions can be factorized into a product of single-particle distributions.
  However, it is known that this condition is violated even in ideal hydrodynamics due to initial state fluctuations or the presence of non-flow.
  Detailed studies of a possible violation of this factorization assumption can therefore be used to constrain the size of such fluctuations as well as to identify possible non-flow contributions.
  A factorization breakdown can be measured directly in multi-particle probability distributions.
  This poster presents an explicit approach to the $\eta$-dependent factorization of two-particle probability distributions within $-3.4 \leq \eta \leq 5$ in the latest $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb--Pb data measured with ALICE.
  A factorizing phase-space region is identified by varying the minimal $\Delta\eta$ separation between particles; the factorization breakdown for small separations is attributed to non-flow and detector effects.
  The analysis yields the well known $v_n$ coefficients as the result of the factorization process.
  These flow coefficients are compared to similar results measured with the Q-cumulant method.
  All findings are also compared to model calculations and previous studies at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christian', 'last_name': 'Bourjau', 'fullName': 'Bourjau, Christian', 'id': '3513399', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': 'de946d1d58a6c747e0f614ba412913ba', 'db_id': 3513399, 'person_id': 3644285}"

Poster Session,poster,D^{0}-meson Elliptic Flow Measurement in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV from STAR,"Liang, Yue",Kent State Univesrsity & Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ,USA,"A recent result from the STAR experiment shows that in 10-40% central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of the $D^0$-meson follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark scaling in the same way as it does for light flavor hadrons. This suggests that charm quarks have gained sufficiently large collectivity through their interactions with the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). It is of great interest to see whether this scaling holds in more peripheral collisions, which will shed more lights on how charm quarks interact with the QGP and gain collectivity.

In this poster, we present the centrality and transverse momentum dependences of the $D^0$-meson $v_{2}$ measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The measurement is based on the combined datasets recorded in 2014 and 2016, which yield about a factor of 3 times of the statistics compared to the previously published results. In order to better understand the non-flow contribution in peripheral collisions, the azimuthal anisotropy parameter $v_{2}$ is measured as a function of the pseudo-rapidity gap between the $D^0$-meson and tracks used for reconstructing the event plane. The results will be compared to those of light hadrons in various centrality intervals and physics implications will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yue', 'last_name': 'Liang', 'fullName': 'Liang, Yue', 'id': '3597219', 'affiliation': 'Kent State Univesrsity & Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ', 'emailHash': '690d6342aee2760306d6684f8015d4fa', 'db_id': 3597219, 'person_id': 3780986}"

The PHENIX experiment has measured substantial elliptic ($v_2$) flow coefficients for charged hadrons at midrapidity in a suite of small collision systems over a range of collision energies. We extend these results with new measurements of charged hadron $v_2(p_T)$ at forward and backward rapidities in $d+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV in order to better constrain the rapidity extent of these correlations.

Poster Session,poster,Predictions for  event-by-event flow harmonic distributions at RHIC,"Barbosa, Leonardo",Instituto de Física da Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamical models must be able to reproduce data not only in average for a given centrality class but for each event. In particular they must reproduce the scaled $v_n$ distributions obtained by ATLAS [1,2] and ALICE [3]. These distributions are independent of medium properties such as viscosity, and so directly probe the initial conditions.  

They in fact provide a strong test for initial condition models:  many models   (e.g. Glauber and MC-KLN) can be ruled out and so far only two models  lead to satisfactory results [4,5]. In this work, we show that NeXus initial conditions also provide reasonable results for scaled $v_n$ distributions at LHC energies and make predictions for RHIC top energy.

Poster Session,poster,STAR Measurements of Elliptic Flow in Small Collision Systems,"Sergeeva, Maria",UCLA,USA,"The coefficient of the second harmonic in azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) of produced particles gives insight to bulk properties of the medium being created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

These studies aim to answer the questions of how small a QGP droplet can be and what is the boundary between a confined and deconfined medium. However, non-flow correlations, especially due to jets and di-jets, can influence the observed flow and may tend to dominate in small systems. Therefore, special care has to be taken to differentiate collectivity from non-flow contributions.

Transverse sphericity is a momentum space event shape variable giving a measure of how isotropically particles and their momenta are distributed within an event. This variable allows us to differentiate events containing jets produced in hard processes from those events containing multiple soft, non-perturbative QCD processes.

In this poster, we show that the two major volume fluctuations effects, centrality bin width and centrality resolution effects, can be probed using flow fluctuation measurements. Using a Glauber model with particle production, we show that the recently observed sign-change of the $c_2\{4\}$ in ultra-central collisions by ATLAS is directly sensitive to the amount of centrality smearing. Therefore the pattern of $c_2\{4\}$ sign-change can be used to quantify the centrality resolution effect. Furthermore, we find that the volume fluctuation effects naturally evolves with rapidity, and therefore the sign-change pattern of $c_2\{4\}$ also expected to evolve with rapidity. We explore new approaches based on flow measurements to constrain the volume fluctuation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jiangyong', 'last_name': 'Jia', 'fullName': 'Jia, Jiangyong', 'id': '3513485', 'affiliation': 'Stony brook Universty (US)', 'emailHash': '3d951a186ae4e1d5ce26f3dd3683cd17', 'db_id': 3513485, 'person_id': 3642836}"

In this poster, we show a first measurement of the efficiency-corrected cumulant ratios ($C_{2}/C_{1}$, $C_{3}/C_{2}$) of net-$\Lambda$, which are subject to strangeness and baryon number conservation, for five beam energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV Au$+$Au collisions) as a function of centrality and rapidity. We compare our results to the previous STAR results [1, 2], the Poisson and negative binomial expectations, as well as the UrQMD model, the hadron resonance model, and lattice QCD predictions.

Electrons reach the detector without significant final state

sources, i.e. Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons,
semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, as well dielectrons from the

Therefore, they can be used to study the space-time evolution of the system.

While pp collisions provide an important baseline measurement in vacuum for
heavy-ion studies, p-Pb collisions can be used to disentangle cold from hot
nuclear matter effects. Moreover, recent studies in small colliding systems
(pp and p-Pb) showed intriguing collective behaviours similar to observations previously
done in heavy-ion collisions. They require further investigations in
particular as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity. Searching
for the thermal signatures through dielectrons is also important in small

This parton fragments into a jet from which the hadron arises. The main background for this measurement are photons from meson decays. This is estimated via a parameterization of the measurement of the pi0 and eta cross sections and theoretical calculations of the direct photon cross-section using JETPHOX and PeTeR.

Poster Session,poster,Test and development of the front-end electronics for the Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment,"Rodriguez, Adrian",Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) Experiment at the FAIR facility will explore the QCD phase diagram at very high baryon densities, where a first order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter as well as a chiral phase transition is expected to occur. The design goal of CBM is to cope with very high interaction rates up to 10 MHz. This will allow performing high precision measurements of extremely rare probes. To achieve the high rate capability, CBM will be equipped with fast and radiation hard detectors employing free-streaming readout electronics. The Silicon Tracking System (STS), is the essential component for tracking up to 1000 particles per event in A+A collision. Having 2.1 million readout channels, it poses the most demanding requirements in terms of bandwidth and density of all CBM detectors. The custom developed front-end device for reading out the double-sided silicon sensors is the STS-XYTER ASIC. This is a low power, self-triggering ASIC with 128 channels, which provides timing and energy information for each sensor signal. In addition, the ASIC implements a new readout protocol, developed for operation with the GBTx data aggregation ASIC. To ensure its satisfactory operation, it demands low noise levels as the system is self-triggering; it needs to be fully integrated into a very confined space and it must have a reliable performance in a highly irradiated environment and strong magnetic field. Various tests are carried out to check the ASIC functionalities, its performance in different data taking scenarios, system integration as well as radiation hardness. An overview of the experimental setup, device testing procedures and results will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adrian', 'last_name': 'Rodriguez', 'fullName': 'Rodriguez, Adrian', 'id': '3513584', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt am Main', 'emailHash': '16d10b48524d0fb98d7bf81ff748ecf7', 'db_id': 3513584, 'person_id': 3647177}"

This field, referred to as glasma, has several instabilities from the anisotropy, so small fluctuations in glasma grow exponentially.
Glasma is also known to have chaoticity, which make the field configuration complex and produces the entropy.
Instability and chaoticity of glasma rapidly drive the pressure isotropization and are expected to cause thermalization.
In this work, we compare the time scale of the entropy production and the pressure isotropization in the classical Yang-Mills field.
We regard the classical field as a coherent state, and evaluate the quantum entropy (von Neuman entropy) obtained by ignoring the off-diagonal density matrix elements, namely decoherence.
We find that the growth of fluctuations cause entropy production and pressure isotropization in the same time scale.

Poster Session,poster,Performance of Heavy-flavor Tagged Jet Identification in STAR,"Oh, Saehanseul",Yale University and Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"The measurement of heavy-flavor tagged jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions is an important tool to study the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium. While the flavor dependence of jet quenching has been attributed to several physics mechanisms, such as collisional and radiative energy losses of hard-scattered partons, previous measurements at the LHC have not shown a strong flavor dependence of jet quenching in the jet transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) range of $80$-$250$ GeV/$c$ in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental inability to distinguish prompt heavy-flavor quarks and those from gluon splitting has limited the quantitative interpretation of currently available measurements. Compared to collision energies at the LHC, the fraction of heavy-flavor quarks from gluon splitting to prompt heavy-flavor quarks is predicted to be lower at RHIC energies, making flavor-dependent measurements more accessible. In this poster, performance studies of heavy-flavortagged jet identification in the STAR experiment at RHIC are reported.

STAR's recent addition of the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) provides significantly improved resolution of secondary vertices and thus excellent identification of particles containing heavy quarks. Taking advantage of the HFT capability, we have developed a number of heavy-flavor jet tagging algorithms based on properties of reconstructed secondary vertices and properties of constituent tracks. Tagging efficiency and misidentification rate of each algorithm are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. These performance results will be used as a basis for upcoming STAR measurements on flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Saehanseul', 'last_name': 'Oh', 'fullName': 'Oh, Saehanseul', 'id': '3583438', 'affiliation': 'Yale University and Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '4a95ab687f928c562b3b86a39d80408f', 'db_id': 3583438, 'person_id': 3766186}"

Obtaining direct photons is challenging because of the myriad of background photons. Typically, a statistical subtraction method is used in A+A at RHIC. In addition to a statistical method, we have also developed a direct method to obtain isolated photons in A+A by using an isolation cut like those used in direct photon identification in p+p collisions.

A key problem has always been to accurately determine the jet energy calibration in order to establish the influence of the hot QCD medium on the observed jet properties.

The direct photon, produced in hard scatterings back-to-back with a parton, serves as a calibration of the away-side jet and thus provides less-biased insight into how the medium affects the away-side jet fragmentation. We ultimately aim to measure the modified fragmentation function f($z_{\mathrm{T}}$) and its dependencies on several quantities like the $\gamma$-trigger $p_{T}$ or associated hadron $p_{T}$ to understand the $z_{T}$ dependence.

It achieves a high level of performance at the extreme data taking conditions under high luminosity and high backgrounds. The basic structure of DTOF is composed of a Fused Silica radiator connected to fast photomultiplier (MCP-PMT or SiPM) array, readout by a dedicated front-end electronics. The challenge comes from the fact that the limited flight length for charged particles in detectors requires its timing measurement achieves the level of tens of pico seconds, summing up all uncertainties, to meet the requirement for current and future high luminosity particle colliders. For example, the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN is expected to provide instantaneous luminosities of 1034cm-2s-1 and above, which requires TOF's time resolution ~30ps to suppress pileup in collisions.

To meet these requirements, we developed a pico-second timing TOF prototype based on DTOF technology, using 1.5cm x 1.5cm x 2cm square Cherenkov radiator connected by high-resolution fast MCP-PMT(Hamamastu R3809U). And we also developed high speed readout electronics (Bandwidth 2.4GHz, Gain 6dB ~ 26.6dB): Programmable Differential Amplifier(PDA) LMH6881/2 and Dual-threshold Differential Discriminator(DDD). It applied dual thresholds to process signals: low threshold to measure signals’ arrival time, while high threshold to identify real signals and exclude noise. It is a much simpler and faster timing method than wave sampling. The beam test in H4 at CERN shows that: the intrinsic time resolution readout by DDD and PDA is <20ps. Since there is no tracking selection and the readout electronics (PDA and DDD) are preliminary designation, there is still potential to improve its performance.

Poster Session,poster,Production and azimuthal anisotropy of beauty decay electrons in Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with ALICE,"Volkl, Martin Andreas",Eberhards  Karls Universiy Tubingen (DE),GB,"The study of the interaction of heavy quarks with the constituents of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions provides important information about the characteristics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The production of heavy quarks occurs prior to the formation of the QGP, implying that they experience the entire evolution of the system. To infer the properties of the partonic interactions of charm and beauty quarks in the medium, it is useful to investigate how heavy quarks are influenced by the collective expansion of the system. A sufficiently strong interaction could lead to a themalization of the heavy quarks which then would move along with the flow of the surrounding medium constituents leading to a substantial azimuthal anisotropy in non-central collisions.
The excellent particle-identification capabilities of the ALICE detector allow for an investigation of beauty production via the measurement of beauty-hadron decay electrons. The separation from background electrons is achieved via a statistical separation based on the track impact parameter distribution. This distribution is wider for the beauty decay electrons due to the comparatively larger decay length of their parent hadrons ($c\tau\approx500\,\mathrm{\mu m}$).

Poster Session,poster,"Measurement of Ds+/D+ as a function of transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE","Grosa, Fabrizio",Politecnico di Torino (IT),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm or beauty) are powerful probes to study and characterise the properties of the deconfined medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Because of their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in initial hard-scattering processes, and they subsequently experience the whole system evolution, interacting with the medium constituents. The observation of a large suppression of the heavy-flavour hadron yields at intermediate/high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to those in pp collisions provides a strong evidence of the in-medium parton energy loss. Moreover, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadrons with strange-quark content (i.e. ${\rm D^+_{s}}$ mesons) can give insight into the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanism. If a fraction of charm quarks hadronises via coalescence, the relative abundance of ${\rm D^+_{s}}$ with respect to non-strange D mesons is expected to be larger in heavy-ion collisions compared to pp collisions, due to the enhanced production of strange quarks in the QGP. Furthermore, an enhanced production of strange and multi-strange hadrons was recently observed in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the pT-differential cross section and fragmentation function of D0-tagged jets in pp collisions with ALICE,"Aiola, Salvatore",Yale University (US),USA,"The production of heavy quarks in proton-proton (pp) is described in the framework of perturbative Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (pQCD) via the leading order process ${\rm gg\, (q\bar{q})} \rightarrow {\rm Q\bar{Q}}$. Among higher-order processes, gluon splitting ${\rm gg\, (q\bar{q})} \rightarrow {\rm gg} \rightarrow \rm gc\bar{c}$ is known to account for a large fraction of the charm produced at the LHC. Charmed hadrons coming from the fragmentation of charm quarks produced in the leading order process are expected to carry a larger fraction of the total jet momentum, as compared to those coming from gluon splitting. Therefore the measurement of the charm jet fragmentation functions (FFs)  can be used to improve our understanding of the charm production mechanisms.

Heavy-flavor jets can also provide important insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as heavy quarks are predicted to interact with the QGP constituents differently compared to light quarks and gluons. Measuring charm jets gives a better estimate of the initial parton energy when compared to single-hadron measurements, which allows a more precise test of heavy-quark transport models of the QGP in the low momentum region, where the effect of the quark mass is expected to be more prominent.

We present the measurement of the production of charm jets tagged with fully reconstructed D$^0$ mesons in minimum bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with the ALICE detector. The production of charm jets is investigated both in the $p_{\rm T}$-differential cross section and in the distribution of the jet momentum fraction ($z$) carried by the D$^0$ meson.

The quark number holonomy is defined by the quark number density and it can be an order parameter which detects the quark-deconfinement [1,2]. We find some analytical formulae of the quark number density. In the large quark mass regime, the quark number density is expressed in terms of the Polyakov loop. On the other hand, in the small quark mass region, the quark number density is expressed by the eigenmodes of the Wilson-Dirac operator on a lattice. It is found that the quark number density strongly depends on the low-lying Dirac modes. However, the quark number holonomy is not sensitive to the low-lying Dirac modes. Based on these results, we discuss the confinement-deconfinement transition [3].

In a smaller colliding system, the final freeze-out of the hot QCD matter is closer to the phase boundary so more genuine information on the phase structure, including QCD critical point, is retained compare to much larger systems. We will compare the results from Cu+Cu collision to that of Au+Au collisions as a function of both initial system size ( $N_{part}$) and the final size ($N_{mult}$) at these collision energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhenzhen', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Zhenzhen', 'id': '3597218', 'affiliation': 'CCNU/LBNL', 'emailHash': 'f2a492440175b1ede85331ea9e44c2c3', 'db_id': 3597218, 'person_id': 3780984}"
Poster Session,poster,"Off-diagonal Cumulants of Net-charge, Net-proton, and Net-kaon Multiplicity Distributions in Au+Au collisions at STAR","Chatterjee, Arghya",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"Event-by-event fluctuations of conserved quantities have been extensively used to study the thermodynamic properties around phase transition region of QCD matter. According to lattice QCD calculation, the off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge ($Q$), net-baryon ($B$) and net-strangeness ($S$) and their ratios to diagonal cumulants are sensitive to the evolution of the system and to constrain the freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram [1,2].

In this poster, we report a first measurement of $2^{nd}$-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton and net-kaon multiplicity distributions at RHIC in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. We study beam energy, centrality, and acceptance ($\eta$) window dependence of off-diagonal cumulants after implementing efficiency and other experimental corrections. The measured cumulants ratios are compared with the predictions from UrQMD and hadron resonance gas models. The results will be discussed in the context of understanding the correlated fluctuations of the conserved quantities.

Poster Session,poster,Novel lattice simulations for transport coefficients in quenched QCD,"Ziegler, Felix",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"Transport coefficients, such as the temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities, are essential QCD ingredients in the hydrodynamical description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the equation of state by now is known with high precision from lattice simulations, the extraction of the transport coefficients from Euclidean simulations is extremely challenging. In particular, the corresponding Kubo formula requires the evaluation of a spectral function at vanishing momentum, and hence a reliable spectral reconstruction from Euclidean data at low frequencies. In standard lattice simulation at finite temperature this reconstruction is based on the discrete Matsubara frequencies, and is -in practice- exponentially hard: the thermal part of the low frequency information is hidden in the thermal decay of the Euclidean data at large frequencies. 

In order to overcome this limitation, we apply the novel approach for thermal fields on the lattice [1] to gauge fields [2]. The formalism operates in a non-compact imaginary time domain that leads to continuous imaginary time frequencies. The quantum evolution is formulated as an initial value problem and the thermal initial conditions are supplied by a standard lattice simulation. 

We present results for the energy momentum tensor in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and SU(3) quenched QCD, which show excellent convergence to the standard results at finite Matsubara frequencies. From the correlation functions, we extract the relevant spectral functions using the Bayesian BR method [3] and determine the shear and bulk viscosity over entropy ratios. The imaginary time data in the present novel approach are precise enough to allow for a conclusive discussion of transport peaks in the spectral functions. Results are presented for the confined and deconfined phase.

excellent probes to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced under
extreme temperature and energy density conditions in heavy-ion collisions. Because of their large mass,
heavy quarks are produced in hard parton-scattering processes at the
beginning of the collisions and they are therefore present in the QGP
during all stages of its evolution.

At mid-rapidity ($|y|<0.8$), ALICE can reconstruct J/$\psi$ mesons via their decay
into the dielectron channel, down to zero transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$. However,
particularly at very low $p_{\rm T}$ and in central collisions, the measurement is
limited by the low signal to background ratio. Increasing the significance of the
measurement in the low $p_{\rm T}$ region is extremely important for several reasons:
First, in the study of prompt J/$\psi$ production, higher precision will
shed light on the interplay between J/$\psi$ dissociation and regeneration.
Second, 
the non-prompt J/$\psi$ analysis can give access to low $p_{\rm T}$ beauty
measurements.

Using multivariate methods helps to reduce the background and increase the
significance while keeping as much signal as possible.

Such an effect can be investigated by studying the correlations between heavy-flavour production and the total charged-particle multiplicity.

This is suggestive of coherent $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ photo-production, similar to measurements in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), where the nuclei only interact electromagnetically.

During the LHC Run-2, the measurement of the very low ${p}_\mathrm{T}$ $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ at mid-rapidity (-0.9< $y$ <0.9) in the di-electron decay channel was possible thanks to the large sample of recorded Pb-Pb collisions.

Studies involving strange and multi-strange hadrons, such as $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$, carry additional information since there is no net strangeness content in the initial colliding system. Strangeness enhancement in AA collisions with respect to pp and pA collisions has long been considered as one of the signatures for quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation. The Recent observation of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and pA collisions raise the question of whether QGP can also be formed in the smaller systems. Systematic studies of the strange particle abundance and nuclear modification factors can shed light on this issue. The CMS experiment has excellent strange-particle reconstruction capabilities over a broad kinematic range in pp and pPb collisions. The spectra of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$ hadrons have been measured in various rapidity regions as a function of $p_T$ in pp and pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Based on the measurements of these spectra, nuclear modification factors of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$ in mid-rapidity are measured. Since pPb is an asymmetric system, the nuclear modification factor of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, and $\Xi^-$ in Pb-going direction are compared to those in p-going direction. These final results for nuclear modification factors measured out to high-$p_T$ can be helpful in discussing the implications of collective behavior and energy loss. In addition, the measurement of the forward-backward rapidity yield asymmetries of $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda$ as a function of $p_T$ provide sensitivity to initial state effects, such as shadowing in the nuclear parton distributions.

The excellent particle identification, tracking and vertexing performance of the ALICE experiment allow for the search of this exotic bound state in the decay channel Λnn → πt in Pb-Pb collisions. In order to improve the detection of this state within a big combinatorial background, the extraction of the signal is performed by means of a multivariate approach with the TMVA (Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT).

In this poster, a preliminary study of the (anti-)deuteron absorption in the detector material of ALICE will be presented, exploiting the fact that, during the Run 1 data taking, few modules of the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) were not yet installed, leaving empty spaces between the Time Projection Chamber and the Time-Of-Flight Detector, in a portion of the azimuthal acceptance.

QCD at high temperature,parallel,Electric conductivity of hot and dense quark matter in a magnetic field with Landau level resummation via kinetic equations,"Fukushima, Kenji",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"This talk is based on 1711.01472 in which the longitudinal electric conductivity of hot and dense magnetized quark matter has been computed with full Landau level resummation which requires several nontrivial theoretical techniques.  In contrast to the lowest Landau level approximation, there is no singularity in the massless limit, and we find that the resultant electric conductivity is surprisingly consistent with the qualitative features observed in condensed matter (using Weyl semimetals) experiment for the signature of the chiral magnetic effect.  This means that our calculation correctly captures the essence of the topologically induced currents.  Because the mass and magnetic dependence of the conductivity is found to be mild after the Landau level resummation, we also make a quantitative comparison with the recent lattice QCD simulation results without magnetic field to confirm that our estimate is again surprisingly consistent with the lattice-QCD values.  We can apply our calculation to the finite density case, which provides us with theoretical predictions relevant for the beam energy scan program at finite density.  Since quarks are enhanced but anti-quarks are suppressed, the longitudinal electric conductivity stays rather constant, which is intuitively natural, but this is theoretically seen only after subtracting coupling to hydrodynamic zero modes correctly.  Not only the longitudinal conductivity (that is related to the chiral magnetic effect) but also the transverse conductivities will be discussed.  At finite density, in fact, one component of the transverse electric conductivities newly grows up, that is the Hall conductivity.  The Hall conductivity could result in more prospective effects observable in the heavy-ion collision experiment, which will be suggested in this talk.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenji', 'last_name': 'Fukushima', 'fullName': 'Fukushima, Kenji', 'id': '3529156', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '7a7131b5f31f91747d95603ed64ff469', 'db_id': 3529156, 'person_id': 3639021}"

The experimental results show that in nucleus-nucleus collisions, the charmonium yields are modified compared to the expectations based on the yields measured in proton proton interactions, scaled by the number of binary collisions. In proton-nucleus collisions this yield modification is due to the so-called Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects such as shadowing, gluon saturation, parton energy loss, comover absorption. This information can be obtained from p-Pb collisions.

At LHC energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV), ALICE has observed a modification of the J/$\rm{\psi}$ yields  in p-Pb collisions which can be understood assuming shadowing to be the dominant contribution. On the other hand, the $\rm{\psi}$(2S) was found to have a similar suppression as the J/$\rm{\psi}$ at forward rapidity, but it shows a much stronger suppression in the backward rapidity region.  So, this behavior cannot be explained by the shadowing or energy loss only unlike J/$\rm{\psi}$. Final state mechanisms, as the comover absorption, should be playing a role in this region.

The dynamics are in present work modelled as a superposition of parameterized hydrodynamics and a media-modulated hard state. In the simulations, observations are differentiated in terms of density, position, and production modes; in combination with a higher order analysis. The heavy ion yield appears to have been reproduced to great detail in present model. The reproduction of both elliptic-, and triangular flow speaks of a fluctuating-, and density-characterized first order geometric mode, in addition to higher order features.

Poster Session,poster,Effects of composite pions on the chiral condensate within the  PNJL model at finite temperature,"Friesen, Alexandra",Joint Institute for nuclear research,UK,"We investigate the effect of composite pions on the behaviour of the chiral condensate at finite temperature within the Polyakov-loop improved NJL model.
To this end we treat quark-antiquark correlations in the pion channel (bound states and scattering continuum) within a  Beth-Uhlenbeck approach that uses medium-dependent phase shifts.
A striking medium effect is the Mott transition which occurs when the binding energy vanishes and the discrete pion bound state merges the continuum. This transition is triggered by the lowering of the continuum edge due to the chiral restoration transition. This in turn also entails a modification of the Polyakov-loop so that the SU(3) center symmetry gets broken at finite temperature and dynamical quarks (and gluons) appear in the system taking over the role of the dominant degrees of freedom from the pions.  
At low temperatures our model reproduces the chiral perturbation theory result for the chiral condensate while at high temperatures the PNJL model result is recovered.
The new aspect of the current work is a consistent treatment of the chiral restoration transition region within the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach on the basis of mesonic phase shifts for the treatment of the correlations. Special emphasis is on the discussion of the result for the pseudocritical temperature of the chiral transition which in PNJL models at the mean field level comes out too large, in contradiction with lattice QCD results.

Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are a powerful tool to study the properties of the QGP. Indeed they are formed during the early stages of the collisions via hard scattering of high-energy partons, on a time scale generally shorter than the QGP thermalisation time. So they can traverse the QCD medium, interact with its constituents and experience the whole evolution of the medium.
The $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$\$\rm D^{0}$ ratio is sensitive to hadronisation mechanisms and it will offer a unique probe of the role of coalescence and predicted existence of diquark states in the QGP.
Measurements of charmed-baryon production in small system (pp and p-Pb) collisions are a fundamental reference for measurements in Pb-Pb collisions and allow studies of possible modifications of the production due to *cold nuclear matter* effects.  
Moreover, the study of charm production as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision can give insight into multi-parton interactions and into the interplay between hard and soft processes.

At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies, heavy quarks are produced in hard scattering processes and their production can be described using perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). The measurements of open heavy-flavour hadrons as a function of spherocity and charged-particle multiplicity could improve the theoretical understanding of the production mechanisms, and the interplay between hard and soft processes.

Charm and beauty quarks are produced in hard scattering processes on timescales shorter than the QGP formation time due to their large masses and, thus, they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents via in-medium gluon radiation and collisional processes. The measurement of D-meson azimuthal anisotropy, quantified in terms of the elliptic flow $v_2$, allows one to study whether low-momentum charm quarks, interacting with the medium constituents, participate in the collective expansion of the system. At high transverse momentum, the path length dependence of parton energy loss mechanisms can be tested. The dynamics of heavy quarks in the QGP can be further investigated through the Event Shape Engineering (ESE) analysis. Measuring the D-meson $v_2$ in classes of events defined on the basis of the average flow in a given centrality class allows to evaluate the correlation between the elliptic flow of soft hadrons and D mesons. Furthermore, it provides information about the effect of initial state fluctuations on the energy loss experienced by the heavy quark propagating in the QGP.

The measurement of the D-meson $v_2$ in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV with ALICE performing an ESE analysis based on the selection of events according to the magnitude of the so-called reduced flow vector will be presented.

Calculations of these perturbative QCD corrections are, however, limited to probabilistic approximations using parton shower approaches in event generators. Although this Monte-Carlo DGLAP description is nowadays state-of-the-art, there still exist significant differences on the quantitative level. To address these open questions, it is important to investigate final-state radiation processes experimentally by identifying sensitive observables.

In this study, a new transverse momentum correlation observable, the momentum imbalance between D and Dbar mesons, is identified as a sensitive tool to study final-state radiation. This is shown by using simulations with the EPOS3+HQ model and the event generator Pythia 6. The presented results will focus on heavy-flavour particles only because these are most likely pair-produced in the initial stages of the collision. With the upcoming detector upgrades for LHC Run-3, statistically significant correlation measurements of these heavy-flavour particles will become feasible.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of heavy-flavour production and study of heavy-flavour jets via electrons in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Sakai, Shingo",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense colour-deconfined QCD matter, so called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in initial hard partonic interactions, and they propagate through the QGP.A strong suppression of heavy-flavour hadron production has been observed in the most central heavy-ion collisions with respect to the expectation from binary-scaled pp collisions at intermediate and high $p_{\rm{T}}$. This is ascribed to energy loss of heavy flavours via radiative and collisional processes in the dense matter. In addition, the positive $v_{2}$ (elliptic flow) observed at low $p_{\rm{T}}$ in semi-central heavy-ion collisions suggests that heavy quarks participate to the collective motion of the system. These results indicate strong interaction of heavy quarks in the medium. Further information of the interaction of heavy quarks in the QGP is obtained by measuring their production in different collisions energies. Measuring heavy-flavour jets allows for a more direct access to the initial parton kinematics and therefore provides an additional information on the energy loss and hadronisation of heavy quarks in the medium. The study of jets allows also to address the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the radiative energy. 

In this poster, recent ALICE measurements of the $R_{\rm{AA}}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV is shown.

In two-particle femtoscopy the background can be estimated with the mixed-event technique, but this approach appears to be impossible to reconcile with the standard cumulant formalism for the case of more than two particles. 

We demonstrate how the mixed-event technique can be replaced with marginal distributions, which unifies multiparticle femtoscopy with the standard cumulant formalism.

Neutral mesons are reconstructed via their two photon decay channels by means of an invariant mass analysis.
Photons are detected with three different systems; using the central barrel tracking detectors of ALICE in order to reconstruct photon conversions (PCM) and the two available calorimeters in the experiment, namely the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal).
The reported measurements are carried out as well using a 'hybrid' system which reconstructs meson candidates by combining one EMCal photon with one PCM photon.
Thus, this 'hybrid' system serves as an important cross-check for the single measurements and additionally measures an almost independent set of meson candidates.
The EMCal is a sampling calorimeter with good acceptance and high reconstruction efficiency, enabling measurements of $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons up to highest transverse momenta due to its excellent triggering capabilities.
In addition to these results on neutral meson production, the corresponding $\eta/\pi^0$-ratios will be shown to test scaling laws for particle production. 
All obtained results will be compared with different Monte Carlo generators as well as recent NLO pQCD predictions.

Poster Session,poster,Corona effect in AA collisions at LHC and RHIC,"Pantuev, Vladislav","INR, RAS",Unknown,"Following our earlier finding based on RHIC data about the dominant jet production from nucleus corona region, we reconsider this effect in nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energy. Our hypothesis was based on the experimental data, which raised  the idea of a finite formation time for the produced medium.  At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time reaches about 2~fm/c. In the center of interaction region it's about 0.7 fm/c. All observed high $p_t$ particles are produced in the corona region and have a chance to escape during this 2~fm/c. After that, the formed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ should be independent on particle momentum and be flat versus $p_t$. At the same time, we can describe at RHIC the finite azimuthal anisotropy of high $p_t$ particles, $v_2$. A separate prediction held that,  at LHC energy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller, about 1~fm/c.  New data at LHC show that $R_{AA}$ is not flat and is rising with $p_t$. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton  traversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift of about 7~GeV from the original power law $p^{-6}$ production cross section in $pp$  explains well all the observed  $R_{AA}$ dependencies at all centrality. The shift of about 7~GeV is also valid at RHIC energy, where  the cross section follows a power law with about $p^{-8}$  and this shift explains a very slow rise of $R_{AA}$ seen for neutral pions with $p_t$ above  15~GeV/c. We also show that the observed at LHC dependence  of $v_2$ at high $p_t$ and our previous predictions agree. It is very attractive to call this value of 7 GeV as a parton binding energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vladislav', 'last_name': 'Pantuev', 'fullName': 'Pantuev, Vladislav', 'id': '3513640', 'affiliation': 'INR, RAS', 'emailHash': '5e1827442814e233bbbc6a8eaa4058ba', 'db_id': 3513640, 'person_id': 3643982}"

Most of the experiments have, however, used triple GEM detectors. A quadruple GEM detector specially designed for low ion back flow will be used for the readout of the upgraded TPC in ALICE experiment. We present the study of a triple and a quadruple GEM detector and compare their performances in order to understand the usefulness of increasing the number of GEM foils and obtain better operating parameters to suit the requirements of HEP experiments.

The detectors have been assembled in standalone configuration and tested  with $^{55}$Fe X-ray and $^{106}$Ru-Rh $\beta$-source using Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixtures with 90:10 and 70:30 proportions. Effective gain and energy resolution have been measured using $^{55}$Fe source. The efficiency is measured using the $^{106}$Ru-Rh $\beta$-source and a coincidence setup consisting of three scintillators. In addition, the uniformity of the gain and energy resolution of the GEM detectors have been investigated by dividing the active area in 7$\times$7 zones.

It was found that quadruple GEM detector operates at less voltage across individual GEM foil ($\Delta$V$_{GEM}$) compared to the triple GEM detector. It is also found that the energy resolution of the detector deteriorates in case of quadruple GEM detector. Time resolution of the detectors is also measured and the obtained value is $\sim$10 – 13 ns at the operating voltage.

Poster Session,poster,Electron identification and trigger performance of the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector in p–Pb collisions,"Pachmayer, Yvonne Chiara",Ruprecht Karls Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,"The Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) of the ALICE detector at the LHC provides electron identification and an online trigger on high-$p_{\rm T}$ tracks of electron candidates, to significantly enrich samples of electrons originating from open heavy-flavour and heavy quarkonia decays.
The TRD consists of 522 chambers arranged in 6 layers. Each chamber comprises a radiator and a MWPC with pad read-out. When electrons with $p$ > 1 GeV/$c$ travel through the radiator, crossing many boundaries between media with different dielectric constants, TR photons with energies in the X-ray range may be created. These photons are detected using the MWPC filled with Xe/CO$_{2}$, where they deposit their energy on top of the ionisation signals from the particle track. The ALICE TRD is uniquely designed to record the time evolution of the signal. This functionality allows electrons and pions to be better discriminated compared to a 1d-likelihood on the total integrated charge measured in a chamber, because of the preferential TR absorption at the entrance of the MWPC (corresponding to large times).
In addition, chamber-wise track segments from fast on-detector reconstruction are read out with position, angle and PID information. In the Global Tracking Unit these track segments are matched and used for the reconstruction of transverse momenta and electron identification of individual tracks. These tracks form the basis for versatile and flexible trigger conditions, such as electrons with high $p_{\rm T}$.
We present the electron identification and trigger performance in p–Pb collisions recorded during the LHC Run 2. The first is addressed with various methods, e.g. 1d- and multidimensional likelihood as well as neural networks. The second is quantified in terms of efficiency, purity and enhancement factors of physics observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yvonne Chiara', 'last_name': 'Pachmayer', 'fullName': 'Pachmayer, Yvonne Chiara', 'id': '3513585', 'affiliation': 'Ruprecht Karls Universitaet Heidelberg (DE)', 'emailHash': '653567a2a6d57c7da9e0c1fec0c04a8f', 'db_id': 3513585, 'person_id': 3643562}"

Such pairs are produced during all stages of the collision and do not interact strongly. Therefore, they carry information about the medium properties and the whole space-time evolution of the system.

Measurements of dielectron production in minimum-bias proton-proton collisions provide an important vacuum reference for any modifications observed in heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, the measurement of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs from semi-leptonic decays of correlated heavy-flavour hadrons in the intermediate-mass region (1.2 < mee < 2.9 GeV/$c^{2}$) allow further studies and understandings of the primordial heavy-flavour production. Finally, recent studies of proton-proton collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities showed interesting results similar to the observations previously done in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements of low-mass dielectrons could provide further insight into the underlying physics processes.

In this poster we present the latest results of the dielectron analysis with ALICE in pp collisions at $ \sqrt{s}=13 $ TeV.

Poster Session,poster,Benchmark of microscopic hadronic direct photon emission in thermal equilibrium,"Schäfer, Anna",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS),Unknown,"Cross sections for direct photon production in hadronic scattering processes have been calculated according to an effective chiral field theory following Turbide et al. For $\ \pi + \rho \rightarrow \pi + \gamma$ and $\ \pi + \pi \rightarrow \rho + \gamma$ processes, these cross sections have been implemented into a novel hadronic transport approach (SMASH), which is suitable for collisions at low and intermediate energies. Comparisons of the obtained thermal rates in infinite matter calculations to theoretical predictions and to the ones used in hydrodynamic calculations are shown. This constitutes a benchmark for future non-equilibrium calculations. Employing SMASH for the final state rescattering in a hybrid approach will allow to assess the importance of the hadronic stage in the generation of direct photon flow.

(DE),Germany,"Electron-positron pairs are an excellent probe to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Because they are produced at all stages of the collision and do not interact strongly with the medium, their spectra reflect the entire space-time evolution of the system. At low invariant mass ($m_{\textrm{ee}} < 1.2 \textrm{ GeV/c}^2$), the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the dense medium which is related to the predicted restoration of the chiral symmetry. In the intermediate-mass region ($1.2 < m_{\textrm{ee}} < 2.9 \textrm{ GeV/c}^{2}$), the dielectron continuum gives further insight into the heavy-quark energy loss in the QGP via the measurement of correlated electron-positron pairs from charm- and beauty- hadron decays. Finally, contributions of thermal radiation from the medium, both during the partonic and the hadronic phases, are predicted in a broad mass range and provide information on the temperature of the system.

In this poster, the status of the dielectron measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}} = 5.02 \textrm{ TeV}$ with ALICE will be presented. In order to interpret the data, the findings will be compared to the expected yield of known hadronic sources, i.e. the hadronic cocktail, as a function of the invariant mass and pair transverse momentum.

They are expected to be unmodified by final state hot nuclear matter effects while being sensitive to the initial state nuclear modification of the partonic momentum structure and the energy loss of the incoming partons participating in a hard scattering. Thus, these probes are important for serving as a standard candle against which to compare the production of strongly interacting particles, such as hadron and jet production, which are sensitive to both the initial and final state. This poster presents a new measurement of prompt photon production in the recently collected high-statistics 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb collision data.

The problem may be solved by assuming that the matter at LHC energies is produced out of chemical equilibrium. The chemical non-equilibrium model predicts that the pion abundances are characterized by the non-zero value of the chemical potential which is very close to the critical value for the Bose-Einstein condensation. The crucial point is the measurement of pions at very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ (< 200 MeV/$\textit{c}$), as the onset of pion condensation would manifest itself as an excess in the low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ pion yield while the spectra of kaons and protons remain unaltered.

The search for an enhancement of pions at very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ is carried out also in very high multiplicity pp events.

Recently new data for Pb-Pb collisions were collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment during the Pb-ion beam energy scan program at the SPS. This motivated a new analysis of the available NA49 data, based on modern flow measurement techniques that will also utilize the spectator  fragments  for  reaction  plane  determination.

The new results on directed and elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at beam energy of 40 A GeV recorded with the fixed target experiment NA49 at CERN SPS are presented. Event classification is based on the multiplicity of produced particles as well as on the energy of the projectile spectators using the procedure implemented within the Centrality Framework developed for the future CBM experiment at FAIR. To account for the azimuthal asymmetry of the fixed target setup of the NA49 experiment, a three-subevent technique is used for the determination of the reaction plane resolution. The reaction plane is estimated both from the azimuthal asymmetry of the produced particles measured with the NA49 TPCs as well as by using the transverse granularity of the NA49 forward VETO calorimeter. Corrections for the detector acceptance anisotropy in the transverse plane are applied using an extension of the Qn-Corrections  Framework  developed  originally  for  the  ALICE  experiment  at  the  LHC.

The results are compared with those previously obtained by the experiments STAR at RHIC and NA49 at the SPS. The new study is complementary to the ongoing analysis of the recently collected Pb-Pb data of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS and provide an important  reference  for  the  performance investigations  for  the  future  CBM  experiment  at  FAIR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Oleg', 'last_name': 'Golosov', 'fullName': 'Golosov, Oleg', 'id': '3513422', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (RU)', 'emailHash': 'fc95a5223071b1af49b8c4397bd2d6d7', 'db_id': 3513422, 'person_id': 3643599}"

Poster Session,poster,Practical considerations for measuring global spin alignment of vector mesons in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Tang, Aihong",Brookhaven National Lab,USA,"The study of global polarization and spin alignment can help us probe the vorticity field generated by the initial global angular momentum and understand particle production mechanisms during hadronization. For those reasons this topic is gaining increasing interest in recent years. The study of spin alignment (quantified by $\rho_{00}$) of vector mesons involves the reconstruction of the direction of global angular momentum (L), which is the normal to the reaction plane (RP). In experiments the RP is estimated with correlations among particles and has finite resolution. In this poster, we demonstrate a procedure to correct $\rho_{00}$ for the finite RP resolution. In addition, since the 1st- and 2nd-order RP are usually not the same and they have different sensitivity to L, we derive a relationship to explain the $\rho_{00}$ obtained between the two RP. Furthermore, a deviation of $\rho_{00}$ from 1/3 can be caused by finite acceptance in pseudo rapidity (e.g., the case for STAR and ALICE). We demonstrate that this effect can be corrected elegantly in a data-driven approach.

Poster Session,poster,Probing beauty and charm production in p-Pb collisions with high pT electrons measured with ALICE,"Kawana, Daichi",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculation predicts that a colour-deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed at high temperature and high energy density reached in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mostly produced by initial hard scatterings before the formation of the QGP. Therefore heavy-flavour hadrons are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter. In Pb-Pb collisions, a strong suppression of the production of heavy-flavour hadrons with high transverse momentum has been observed.
　A deeper understanding of heavy-flavour production in nucleus-nucleus collisions requires detailed studies of Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects in order to clarify the role of initial- and final-state effects on their production. CNM effects include shadowing and/or saturation of partons, energy loss in CNM and $k_{\rm{T}}$-broadening. Such effects on heavy quark production can be studied in proton-nucleus collisions by measuring electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays.
　The nuclear modification factor of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays was measured up to $p_{\rm{T}}$ = 20 GeV/$c$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 eV. The result suggests that heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions scales with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. High $p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons are particularly interesting because they mainly originate from beauty hadron decays. In this poster we will present new results on the production of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays and its nuclear modification factor up to approximately 30 GeV/$c$ in p-Pb collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 8.16 TeV collected in LHC-Run2 in 2016.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daichi', 'last_name': 'Kawana', 'fullName': 'Kawana, Daichi', 'id': '3513759', 'affiliation': 'University of Tsukuba (JP)', 'emailHash': 'e220f3e36b9fc2426a196faf818c5450', 'db_id': 3513759, 'person_id': 3641869}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of D*+-meson production in small systems with ALICE at the LHC.,"Veen, Annelies Marianne",Utrecht University (NL),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are a valuable probe to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma created in Pb--Pb collisions. In order to distinguish the hot nuclear matter effects in Pb--Pb collisions from possible Cold Nuclear Matter effects (CNM), measurements in p--Pb collisions are crucial.
Possible CNM effects, such as $k_{\rm{T}}$-broadening, shadowing and parton energy loss in the cold nuclear matter, are studied via the comparison of the $\rm{D}^{*+}$ yield measured in p--Pb and pp collisions. This comparison is quantified by the nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{pPb}}$.
Furthermore, studies of the $p_{\rm{T}}$-differential cross-section of $\rm{D}^{*+}$ mesons in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) allow us to test next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations at the TeV energy regime, while also providing a reference for p--Pb and Pb--Pb measurements. 

The $\rm{D}^{*+}$ mesons measured with ALICE at the LHC are reconstructed at mid rapidity via the hadronic channel $\rm{D}^{*+}\to\rm{D}^0\pi^+\to \rm{K}^-\pi^+\pi^+$.

The uniqueness of the forward rapidity pA program is based on the flexibility of the RHIC accelerator to run collisions of different particle species at very different center-of-mass energies. This in combination with the existing and planned STAR detector capabilities allows to disentangle nuclear effects in the initial and final state as well as leading twist shadowing from saturation effects in a kinematic regime where all these effects are predicted to be large.

The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of charged hadrons used in the analysis were measured in the kinematic range of $0.15 < p_{\rm T} < 50$ GeV/$c$ and $ |\eta|< 0.8$. The charged hadron spectra from Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions are divided in nine centrality intervals in the range of 0-80 %. As we achieved significantly smaller systematic uncertainties in the current analysis, the previously published results from p-Pb and Pb-Pb (2.76 TeV) collisions were reanalyzed.

Neutral mesons were reconstructed through their two-photons decays. The photons were measured via several complementary methods, using eighter the central tracking system identifying photons converted to $e^{+} e^{-}$ pairs in the material of the inner barrel detectors or the electromagnetic calorimeters. Thus we used the respective advantages of the detectors, i.e. the excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low transverse momenta and the high reconstruction efficiency and triggering capability of calorimeters. This approach allowed to measure the neutral meson spectra in wide range of transverse momenta.

The framework organizes the order in which different modules are called, how these can interact with each other, and how the final results are stored or written out. The physics modules provide individual energy loss schemes synchronized by the framework. 

The year-1 setup invokes TRENTO for the initial energy density distribution for nucleus-nucleus collisions, which is then used as the initial state for the MUSIC fluid dynamics event generator. The initial binary collision profile from TRENTO is sampled to call PYTHIA events, which generate hard outgoing partons. The passage of these partons through the space-time profile generated by MUSIC is simulated via four different energy loss modules: HYBRID, LBT, MARTINI and MATTER. These can be combined for multi-stage event generation. Hadronization is carried out via Cooper-Frye for the soft medium, and via PYTHIA for the hard sector.

However, non-CMW mechanisms such as Local charge conservation (LCC) and hydrodynamics with isospin effect [1], could also contribute to the experimental observations.

In this talk, we present the STAR measurements of elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, and triangular flow, $v_{3}$, of charged pions, along with $v_{2}$ of charged kaons and protons, as a function of $A_{\rm ch}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. The similarity between pion and kaon slopes suggests that the isospin effect is not the dominant mechanism. The slope parameters of $\Delta v_{2}$($A_{\rm ch}$) and $\Delta v_{3}$($A_{\rm ch}$) are reported and compared in different centrality and transverse momentum intervals to investigate the LCC background. The difference between the normalized $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{3}$ slopes, along with the measurements in small systems (p+Au and d+Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV), will be presented. Our data favor the CMW interpretation and disfavor the possibility that the observations result from LCC or hydrodynamics at RHIC energies.

By breaking boost invariance, the 3D model no longer trivially satisfies Gauss' law at the initial time, and we now enforce it locally. We compare the time evolution of the chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields in the 3D case with the boost invariant result.

As the longitudinal dynamics of heavy ion collisions are measured to greater levels of precision, it is imperative that theoretical models describe the 3-dimensional nature of the Quark Gluon Plasma.

The nonzero polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons has been recently discovered by STAR in non-central Au-Au collisions in RHIC Beam Energy Scan program [2].

 We further study the predictions of the hydrodynamic model for different components of the $\Lambda$ polarization in the framework of 3-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model with UrQMD initial state, and demonstrate that:

 1. at RHIC Beam Energy Scan energies, the global polarization $P$ of produced Lambda is directed along the total angular momentum of the fireball (perpendicular to reaction plane). $P$ decreases with collision energy from 1.7 to 0.2% [3], in agreement with STAR results [2]. The global $\Lambda$ polarization further decreases towards LHC energies,

 2. at full RHIC and LHC energies, the dominant component of polarization is the one in the beam direction. This component has a quadrupole structure in transverse momentum plane. Its amplitude $f_2$ shows a mild decrease with collision energy, and it is thus detectable at LHC enegries.

We show that different components of polarization are driven by different properties of the hydrodynamic expansion: whereas the global polarization $P$ is a result of initial shear flow in the reaction plane, $f_2$ is driven by anisotropy of the transverse expansion (which is also responsible for elliptic flow $v_2$). Polarization component in the beam direction is a generic effect present even in a simple 2-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation with longitudinal boost invariance [4].

Vector mesons, unlike hyperons which have large contributions from resonance decay, are originated predominantly from primordial production, and their alignment are generally additive. Thus, the spin alignment of vector meson is expected to be sensitive to different hadronization scenarios [1] and the vorticity of the colliding system [2-4]. 

We present STAR's measurement of the global spin alignment of φ and K* vector mesons for Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 200 GeV. The alignment is quantified by the diagonal spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ with respect to the normal of the event plane. The $\rho_{00}$ measurement based on the 1st- and 2nd-order event plane will be presented and the relationship between the two will be discussed.  The result will be shown as a function of the transverse momentum, the collision centrality and the beam energy. The implications of our results on the vorticity and the hadronization scenarios will be discussed. The dependence on the emission angle with respect to the reaction plane will be presented and compared to model calculations. The dependence on event-by-event charge asymmetry and its implication on the chiral separation effect under the initial magnetic field will also be discussed.

Initial studies by ALICE showed that the magnitude of the three particle correlator used in the search for the CME is comparable at the LHC and at RHIC. Recent results from the ALICE and CMS experiments have shown that the magnitude of these correlators are similar in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions for events with similar multiplicity, which indicates that the measured correlations are dominated by effects not related to the magnetic field and the CME.

Its space-time evolution can be studied by means of real-time lattice gauge theory simulation techniques with dynamical quarks. To find observable consequences of such nonequilibrium evolution, the understanding of quark dynamics is crucial since they couple to electromagnetic probes. We present results for nonequilibrium quark production in the longitudinally expanding QCD plasma. We find that the quark number density per unit transverse area and rapidity shows almost linear growth in time, and its growth rate is consistent with a simple kinetic theory estimate involving only two-to-two scattering processes in small-angle approximation.

In this talk we will present the first analysis of this configuration at intermediate coupling. Using holography, we resum large orders in the gradient expansion to constrain the hydrodynamization dynamics and the attractor beyond the strong coupling limit. We find that independent of the coupling, hydrodynamization occurs at early times where the pressure anisotropies are large, and that the attractor is determined by first order hydrodynamics. By comparing our results to kinetic theory, we also observe that the approach of different configurations to the attractor is faster in gravity/based computations than in an extrapolation of kinetic theory to intermediate coupling.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ben', 'last_name': 'Meiring', 'fullName': 'Meiring, Ben', 'id': '3529037', 'affiliation': 'University of Oxford', 'emailHash': '4857cc419953432a18c7876bec711ff3', 'db_id': 3529037, 'person_id': 3645577}"

The initial state is then evolved using viscous hydrodynamics, and the $\sqrt{s}$ and A dependence of low-$p_T$ hadron spectra is computed.

Our results are in an excellent agreement with the low-$p_T$ data from 2.76 and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC [1,2]. In particular, we study the centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, pT spectra, flow coefficients, probability distributions of relative elliptic flow fluctuations, and various flow correlations. A simultaneous analysis of these observables at several collision energies puts much more stringent constraints on the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity than e.g. the flow coefficients at the LHC energies alone.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Phenomenology of the nonlinear coupling of flow harmonics in heavy-ion collisions,"Giacalone, Giuliano",Université Paris-Saclay,Unknown,"Precise measurements of higher-order coefficients of anisotropic flow ($v_n$, $n>3$) are now available in Pb+Pb data collected at the Large Hadron Collider. Higher-order coefficients are interesting because they do not simply originate as a response of the medium to its initial geometry, but rather from an intricate nonlinear coupling of harmonics of lower order. Hence, they serve as a powerful tool for the investigation of those properties of the quark-gluon plasma which are independent of the (so far very uncertain) initial conditions of the hydrodynamic evolution, such as its viscosity and freeze-out conditions.

I review the state-of-the-art framework describing higher-order harmonics, and I show that it is incomplete: It does not allow for a consistent characterization of flow coefficients defined with more than one nonlinear contribution, such as hexagonal flow, $v_6$. More specifically, I show that the present determinations of the nonlinear response coefficients of hexagonal flow, reported in both theoretical and experimental analyses, have been carried out under hidden underlying assumptions, which spoil the physical interpretation of the final results.

With the aim of curing these issues, I present an improved framework which encompasses the existing one, and allows for an exact characterization of any flow coefficient defined with an arbitrary number of nonlinear contributions. I perform an explicit application of the new framework to recent experimental data: I derive exact formulas for the nonlinear response coefficients of $v_6$, which I then extract from ALICE data. Doing so, I obtain the first experimental determination of the nonlinear coefficient coupling $v_6$ to $v_2$ and $v_4$. This quantity turns out to present a very specific centrality dependence, that is not captured by existing viscous hydrodynamic calculations.

After non-flow subtraction at each beam energy, $v_2$ and $v_3$ are obtained as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. The $v_2$ signals are also extracted using four-particle azimuthal correlations, where the influence of non-flow is quantified by comparing to the standard cumulant method, as well as the two-subevent and three-subevent cumulant methods. It is found that both the influence of non-flow and the strength of the long-range $v_2$ and $v_3$ have a strong beam energy dependence. The results are compared to similar studies in peripheral Au+Au collisions and calculations from different models.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Multi-particle correlations and collectivity in $pA$ collisions from an initial state parton model,"Mace, Mark",Stony Brook University,USA,"We report on recent progress in understanding multi-particle correlations in $pA$ collisions from the initial state. We consider a proof of principle model of eikonal quarks from the projectile proton multiple-scattering off of a dense nuclear target. With this model, we find that many of the features observed in light-heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC which are often ascribed to collectivity can be qualitatively reproduced in an initial state model. These include the ordering of the two-particle azimuthal angle n-th Fourier harmonics, $v_n\{2\}$; a negative four-particle second Fourier cumulant $c_2\{4\}$, giving rise to a real $v_2\{4\}$; the energy and transverse momentum dependence of $v_2\{4\}$; the similarity in multi-particle second Fourier harmonics $v_2\{4\} \approx v_2\{6\} \approx v_2\{8\}$; and the energy dependence of the four-particle symmetric cumulants. Finally, we consider the Glasma graph approximation of our model and find that many of these features cannot be reproduced, leading to the conclusion that multiple-scattering is a key ingredient for the observed multi-particle correlations from the initial state.

In this talk I will present the microscopic model for collective effects recently implemented in the Pythia8 and DIPSY event generators. In this model collectivity is generated from interactions between Lund strings, referred to as “string shoving” and “rope hadronization”. Rope hadronization is shown to give a good description of strangeness enhancement across pp, pA and AA collisions systems, while string shoving qualitatively describes the ridge observed in pp collisions.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Centrality and impact parameter  in nucleus-nucleus collisions,"Ollitrault, Jean-Yves",CNRS,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collision experiments, the centrality of a collision is defined according to the transverse energy or number of tracks observed in a given detector. We propose a procedure to relate this experiment-defined centrality to the true centrality of the collision, defined according to impact parameter, in a way which does not need require the introduction of a Glauber model or the concept of participant nucleons. Our method allows to accurately reconstruct the probability distribution of impact parameter at a fixed value of the experiment-defined centrality, up to 5%. We argue that in central collisions, the fluctuations of impact parameter have specific signatures in the centrality dependence of the cumulants of elliptic flow, $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$, and that these effects are clearly visible in experimental data.

This talk presents a detailed study of transverse flow fluctuations using 4 and 6-particle cumulants $v_n\{4\}$ and $v_n\{6\}$ for $n=1, 2, 3$, and 4. This includes several new results: the first measurement of a negative dipolar flow $v_{1}\{4\}$; a high-precision measurement of $v_{4}\{4\}$, changing sign around 20-25$\%$ centrality; observation of an intriguing sign-change pattern of $v_2\{4\}$ and $v_2\{6\}$ in ultra-central collisions; a detailed study of the cumulant ratio $v_n\{4\}/v_n\{6\}$ which shows significant deviation of $v_2$ and $v_3$ from both Bessel-Gaussian and elliptic-power distributions. The three-subevent cumulant method is used to show that these results are unlikely to be due to non-flow effects. The talk also presents a detailed study of the longitudinal dynamics of harmonic flow using various correlators involving two, four or six particles. The flow decorrelations for $v_n$ ($n=2, 3$, and 4), as well as their center-of-mass energy dependence are studied over broad range of pseudorapidity ($|\eta|<2.5$) and transverse momentum (0.5<$p_\mathrm{T}$<5 GeV). The decorrelation signals are decomposed into contributions from the forward-backward twist and asymmetry in the flow angle and magnitude, respectively. Furthermore, the decorrelation between $v_n$ and $v_m$ in different $\eta$ is measured to disentangle the longitudinal dependence of the initial-state linear effects and final-state non-linear mode-mixing effects.  These results provide a wealth of differential information on event-by-event fluctuations of harmonic flow in both transverse and longitudinal directions, and they can be used to improve event-by-event 3+1D hydrodynamic models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mingliang', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, Mingliang', 'id': '3563325', 'affiliation': 'Stony brook Universty (US)', 'emailHash': '8b8acbdc0e759f4f31aa8ccfacd7b998', 'db_id': 3563325, 'person_id': 3642837}"

Jet broadening and photon emission takes place through radiation which is suppressed by repeated and coherent interaction with the medium. We analyze this physics in a medium that is not in thermal equilibrium. This  can provide independent means of extracting quark-gluon plasma transport coefficients, such as the shear viscosity, by using jets or photons. Another important application is jet quenching and photon production in the anisotropic plasma [2] created in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. We present an analyzis of how these probes are affected by such a momentum anisotropy; more specifically we consider the rapidity dependence of photon emission and jet suppression. Finally, we discuss how to extend our work to higher anisotropy where the exponential growth of chromomagnetic fields dominates momentum broadening during radiation.

Within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, we improve the state-of-the-art description of this observable, by deriving a cross section for the production of hadron pairs in the back-to-back limit. In this configuration, the cross section is manifestly factorized into a dilute component, the projectile proton, described by standard collinear parton distribution functions, and a dense counterpart, the saturated nuclear target, which is described by means of transverse-momentum-dependent gluon distributions, whose small-x evolution we obtain by solving the running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. This formalism has proven able to accurately capture the suppression of the away-side peak observed in RHIC data.

Starting from this approach, then, we argue that the forward two-particle correlation function measured by the LHCb Collaboration in central p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is amenable to a CGC description. In particular, we show that the away-side peak observed at LHCb can be decomposed into a double-ridge structure - whose origin is not our concern - and a di-jet structure, whose away-side peak is sensitive to parton saturation effects. We show that our formalism correctly describes the away-side peak measured at LHCb in p+Pb collisions, and we make predictions upcoming p+p data at 5 TeV.

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Probing jet splitting and energy loss via groomed jets  in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Chang, Ning-Bo",Xinyang Normal University,Unknown,"The nuclear modification of groomed jet splitting in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC energies is studied [1] based on the higher twist formalism. Assuming coherent energy loss for the two splitted subjets, a non-monotonic jet energy dependence is found for the nuclear modification of jet splitting function: strongest modification at intermediate jet energies whereas weaker modification for larger or smaller jet energies. Combined with the smaller size and lower density of the QGP medium at RHIC than at the LHC, this helps to understand the groomed jet measurements from CMS and STAR Collaborations: strong modification of the momentum sharing $z_g$ distribution at the LHC whereas no obvious modification of the $z_g$ distribution at RHIC. In contrast, the observed nuclear modification pattern of the groomed jet $z_g$ distribution cannot be explained solely by independent energy loss of the two subjets. The dependence on the angular separation $\Delta R$ between two subjets is also studied; it is found that the nuclear modification of $z_g$ distribution decreases with decreasing $\Delta R$ but the maximal nuclear modification from CMS energies is always roughly twice of that for STAR energies. Our result may be tested in future groomed jets measurements with lower jet energies at the LHC and larger jet energies at RHIC, for different angular separations between the two subjets.

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Medium response and jet shape modification in quark-gluon plasma,"Park, Chanwook",McGill University,Unknown,"In this talk, we present the MARTINI study of the modification of jet shapes in quark-gluon plasma. The focus of this study is the effect of medium response on the jet shape function in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 and 5.02TeV. As a jet parton propagates, the medium must respond to the energy and momentum
deposited by the jet parton. The medium response thus re-distributes the lost energy around the jet axis, which manifests as the change in the jet-shape function.

To realize the effect of the medium back-reaction, we start with an IP-Glasma event with the corresponding map of binary collisions. The IP-Glasma event then initializes a 3+1D MUSIC hydro event while the map is used to initiate PYTHIA jets. After the initial hydro runs, we let jets propagate in the evolving medium and record the loss of the energy-momentum along the trajectories, keeping careful track of recoiling thermal partons as well as the jet parton shower. MUSIC is then re-run with the same initial condition but with the additional energy-momentum sources representing the lost energy-momentum of the hard partons, and this time we include the UrQMD afterburner. The hadronized hard partons are then combined with the soft hadrons for the reconstruction of jets. Using this realistic event-by-event simulation, we show that the presence of the medium back-reaction including the effect of recoiling thermal partons significantly influences the jet shape function.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chanwook', 'last_name': 'Park', 'fullName': 'Park, Chanwook', 'id': '3528999', 'affiliation': 'McGill University', 'emailHash': 'd956be6b47f834628800be0eeaa15e23', 'db_id': 3528999, 'person_id': 3647418}"

In the talk, we report the theoretical calculations of Z/W+jet production in pp and Pb-Pb at the LHC, which are confronted with all available data and very nice agreements between theory and data are observed  for all four observables of Z+jet in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions.  In the model,   a very good description of Z+jet in pp is achieved by utilizing Sherpa, which combines the NLO with resummation by a matched parton shower (PS). To compute observables of Z+jet in Pb-Pb we consider the parton energy loss in hot/dense QCD medium, which is simulated by Linear Boltzmann Transport(LBT) model. Our calculations of  distributions of $\Delta\phi_{jZ}$  and $R_{jZ}$   can  give excellent descriptions of CMS measurements both in pp and Pb-Pb for the first time. Compared to pp collisions, $R_{jZ}$ is suppressed and smaller fraction of jets is lost for larger initial jet parton energy in Pb-Pb collisions. The distribution of $\Delta\phi_{jZ}$ at large azimuthal angle in Pb-Pb is suppressed relative to that in pp, because jet quenching effect will reduce the contributions of multiple-parton processes. We evaluate the transverse momentum imbalance $x_{jZ}$ simultaneously which is broadened and shifted to lower value, and we find a very good agreement with LHC data for both  $x_{jZ}$ distribution and its mean value.

In this study, we derive anomalous hydrodynamic equation based on so-called Mori's projection operator method, which provides a systematic way to derive the equation of motion for slow variables like conserved charge densities in hydrodynamics. The vital point for Mori's projection operator method is that it gives a generalization of the current algebra technique used in low-energy hadron dynamics of the QCD vacuum to the nonequilibrium situations. As a result, we find that the chiral magnetic effect is caused by the anomalous commutation relation between vector and axial charge densities which represents a manifestation of the quantum anomaly in the operator formalism.

To this end we consider scattering of a quark from high x modes of the target hadron or nucleus in addition to (all-order) scattering from the usual soft color field describing the low x modes. We derive an analytical expression for the quark propagator which includes longitudinal momentum exchange with the target and allows for large angle deflection of the projectile quark. This quark propagator is then used to compute the Leading Order DIS structure functions F2 and F_L in the general kinematics 0 < x < 1 and thus generalizes the dipole picture of structure functions at small x. We outline how this formalism can be extended to calculate particle production in high energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at all pt, and how it enables one to compute jet energy loss effects from the early stages of a heavy ion collision.

A direct consequence of this is the observed rapidity odd directed flow of charged particles. We study the $v_1$ of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons by evolving the charm quark phase space distribution within Langevin dynamics coupled to a hydrodynamic background. We demonstrate that the drag from the tilted fireball gives rise to directed flow of charm quarks that is $several$ $times$ $larger$ than that of the $v_1$ of observed charged particles[1]. The $v_1$ slope at mid-rapidity is sensitive to the magnitude of the tilt of the initial thermalized medium. Thus, its measurement will allow us to extract the tilt which also sets the scale of longitudinal correlation. Hence, rapidity odd heavy flavor $v_1$ is an ideal candidate to unravel the longitudinal profile of entropy deposition. We report on the comparison of the heavy flavor $v_1$ across beam energies as well as symmetric and asymmetric systems. Further, the electromagnetic fields of the initial stage can also give rise to rapidity odd $v_1$ but of opposite signs for $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons, unlike the tilt mechanism which provides same sign $v_1$ to both $D$ and $\bar{D}$. We study the interplay of the tilt and the electromagnetic fields on the $v_1$ of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons.

Recently, it has been predicted that the transient magnetic field generated in heavy-ion collisions can induce a larger directed flow ($v_{1}$) for heavy quarks than for light quarks. The model calculation also suggests opposite signs of $dv_{1}/dy$ for charm ($c$) and anti-charm ($\bar{c}$) quarks. This argues for heavy quarks offering a new approach to study the initial electromagnetic field. Furthermore, recent measurements at RHIC have shown that $D^{0}$ mesons in minimum bias and mid-central heavy-ion collisions exhibit significant elliptic ($v_{2}$)  and triangular flow ($v_{3}$). Their flow magnitude follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark (NCQ) scaling with light hadrons' in mid-central collisions.

The mathematical problem of solving the  Boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particle distribution function. Viewed this as a dynamical system of coupled ODEs, we can then determine with a suitable truncation, the non-equilibrium attractor solution of the Boltzmann equation from a small set of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic moments of the one-particle distribution function. The asymptotic expansion of the attractor allows us to extract numerically the values of the Lyapunov exponents and at the same time, the values of different transport coefficients like the shear viscosity.

QCD at high temperature,parallel,T-Matrix Approach to Spectral and Transport Properties of the QGP,"Liu, Shuai",Texas A&M University,USA,"Understanding the microscopic properties of the hot and dense QCD matter produced at RHIC and the LHC is a critical task for heavy-ion physics. Toward this end, we have developed a non-perturbative microscopic approach to study the bulk, transport and spectral properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1-2], treating light, heavy and static partons in a unified framework. Starting from a relativistic effective Hamiltonian with a universal color force, we employ a many-body *T*-matrix approach, solved self-consistently and constrained by lattice QCD (lQCD) data for the equation of state (EoS), heavy-quark (HQ) free energy and quarkonium correlator ratios. The predictive power resides in the emerging spectral functions and transport properties. In particular, we find a strongly coupled solution where the low-momentum low-temperature parton spectral functions dissolve due to collision widths in excess of 0.5 GeV and give a way to dynamically formed hadronic resonance/bound states which take over in the EoS. The calculations of the HQ diffusion coefficients and the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio yield values (and ratios) near the conjectured lower quantum bounds, corroborating the liquid-like structure of the QGP near Tc. An extension of the approach to finite baryon density and its implications for QCD phase structure will be discussed using benchmarks from various lQCD susceptibilities.

In the current work, a monte-carlo model, which is conceptually similar to the WQM, is presented. The main difference from the WQM is that each parton from the projectile nucleus can interact with only one parton inside the target (burning-out partons). As a result of each binary partonic interaction, a particle-emitting source is formed (usually modeled as a quark-gluon string), and this pair of partons does not participate in other partonic collisions anymore. It is shown that in this model it is possible to reproduce in a natural way the behaviour of some basic observables like the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity and nuclear modification factor, as well as several kinds of fluctuation observables in A-A and p-A collisions.

QCD at high temperature,parallel,Parity doubling of baryons in QCD thermodynamics,"Sasaki, Chihiro",FIAS & Uni of Wroclaw,Unknown,"Motivated by the recent lattice study by the FASTSUM collaboration [1], 
thermal masses of the baryon parity-doublers are explored for 
various pion masses [2]. A general trend of the octet and decuplet 
parity-doublers is consistent to the results in [1], whereas their 
hyperon masses are modified to a large extent for the physical pion mass.

We further investigate the fluctuations and correlations involving
baryon number in hot hadronic matter with modified masses of
negative-parity baryons, in the context of the hadron resonance gas
[3]. Confronting the baryon number susceptibility, baryon-charge
correlation, and baryon-strangeness correlation and their ratios
with the lattice QCD data, we show that the strong downward mass
shift in hyperons can accidentally reproduce some correlation
ratios, however it also tends to overshoot the individual
fluctuations and correlations. This indicates, that in order to
correctly account for the influence of the chiral symmetry
restoration on the fluctuation observables, a consistent framework
of in-medium effects beyond hadron mass shifts is required.

It allows one to summarize many aspects of the intricate interactions between a QQbar bound state and its surrounding medium in a single complex valued quantity. It is systematically defined from QCD [1,2] and at the same time provides an intuitive understanding of the physics of in-medium quarkonium modification. I.e. it offers the means to investigate from first principles how e.g. color screening and collisional excitations conspire to lead to quarkonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions [3,4].

Here we present the first direct computation of this potential from realistic lattice QCD simulations with near physical pion masses [5]. Current ensembles with $N_\tau=12$ from the TUMQCD collaboration offer unprecedented high statistics, those with $N_\tau=16$ unprecedented time resolution, making possible a robust extraction of its values from the spectral functions of Wilson line correlators. To this end we deploy a combination of Bayesian reconstruction methods (BR), as well as the Pade approximation, in turn diminishing individual method artifacts. 

Re[V] shows a smooth transition from a confining to a Debye screened behavior. At all temperatures its values lie close to the color singlet free energies. Based on Re[V] we estimate the Debye mass. The modification of Im[V] at very high temperatures is compared to predictions of hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory. 

Applications of the complex potential in the modeling of charmonium and bottomonium in heavy-ion collisions are briefly touched upon ([3,4,6]).

This will allow us to obtain stochastic equations (similar to Langevin or Boltzmann equations) that can be useful to obtain phenomenological predictions. We will observe that the region of validity of the Langevin-like or Boltzmann-like equations in QCD is much smaller than in the corresponding QED case. The reason for this can be understood by studying how differently the free energy evolves in these two theories.

Thus, they are ideal probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Two-particle angular correlation studies in heavy-ion collisions have provided deep insight into the the in-medium partonic energy loss and its dependence on the parton path length in the medium. The extension of these studies to the heavy-flavour sector could shed light on the interaction of the heavy quarks with the medium.

 Heavy-flavour correlation measurements in p-Pb collisions are necessary to disentangle final-state QGP-induced modifications from effects caused by cold nuclear matter. In p-Pb collisions, double-ridge long-range correlations have been observed for light particles. They could originate from a collective behaviour of the system, as well as from gluon saturation in the initial state, as addressed by the Color Glass Condensate theory. This feature can also be searched for heavy quarks. Angular correlation of D mesons with charged particles are also useful to probe the properties of charm jets and charm-production processes.

               We report on the measurement of K$^{*}(892)^0$ and $\phi(1020)$ resonances, performed in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=8.16$ TeV  in the rapidity range -0.5 < $y$ < 0. The results include the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra, integrated yields and mean transverse momentum. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectra of K$^{*0}$ and $\phi$ have also been measured as a function of multiplicity up to $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ = 20 GeV/$c$ and 16 GeV/$c$, respectively. The results will be compared with p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sandeep', 'last_name': 'Dudi', 'fullName': 'Dudi, Sandeep', 'id': '3513831', 'affiliation': 'PU, Chandigarh, India', 'emailHash': '33f17bb30e889716aeff65da7cd27f11', 'db_id': 3513831, 'person_id': 3645628}"

Poster Session,poster,Intermittency analysis of proton density as a probe for the critical point of strongly interacting matter in NA61/SHINE,"Turko, Ludwik",University of Wroclaw (PL),Poland,"The search for experimental signatures of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter is one of the main objectives of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS. In the course of the experiment, an energy (beam momentum 13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La) scan is performed. Proposed observables include non-monotonic fluctuations of integrated quantities, as well as local critical fluctuations connected to the critical behavior of the order parameter in the CP neighborhood, which scale according to universal power-laws.

Proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible order parameter of the phase transition in the neighborhood of the CP by performing an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments (SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this kind [1] revealed significant power-law fluctuations in the NA49 heavy-ion collision experiment for the Si+Si system at 158A GeV/c. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent with the theoretically expected critical value within uncertainties, a result suggesting a baryochemical potential for the critical point in the vicinity of ~250 MeV.

The intermittency analysis is extended to systems of intermediate size as studied by NA61/SHINE, the primary candidates being the Be+Be and Ar+Sc systems at 150A GeV/c. Statistical techniques are developed for the calculation of scaled factorial moments which allow to subtract non-critical background and enhance the signal in case of low statistics. The analysis is supplemented by both critical and non-critical Monte Carlo simulations, by which one can estimate non-critical background effects on the quality and magnitude of uncertainties of the intermittency power-law fit, as well as explore the possibility of non-critical effects producing an intermittency signal.

Measurement of the Underlying Event allows us to access fundamental information on the particle production. This has important consequences for lepton and photon isolation, and also for jet calibration.

Poster Session,poster,Time-based particle reconstruction and event selection in the CBM experiment.,"Valentina, Akishina",GSI,Germany,"The CBM experiment is a future fixed-target heavy-ion experiment at FAIR/GSI, targeting for very rare probe measurements. In order to obtain sufficient statistics, the experiment will operate at high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz. Moreover, most of the trigger signatures are complex and require information from several detector subsystems. Thus, CBM needs a novel data read-out and analysis concept based on free streaming front-end electronics. The CBM experiment will collect time-stamped data into a readout buffer in a form of a time-slice and deliver it to a large computer farm. In order to effectively reduce the number of events to be recorded, a First Level Event Selection (FLES) has to identify a clean event sample containing the desired physical observable. 

Grouping measurements into physical collisions in this case must be performed in software and requires reconstruction not only in space, but also in time, the so-called 4-dimensional reconstruction. The FLES reconstruction package consists of several modules: track finding, track fitting, event building, short-lived particles finding, and event selection, which allow reconstructing time-slices in parallel (between processor cores). The tracks, reconstructed with the 4D Cellular Automaton track finder, are combined into event-corresponding clusters according to the estimated production time, obtained with the 4D Kalman Filter method. The reconstructed events are given as an input to the KF Particle Finder package for short-lived particle reconstruction. The last stage of the FLES package is a selection of events according to the requested trigger signatures.

The physics program of CBM is based, among others, on the precision measurements of a wide set of observables that contains extremely rare decays like, for example, charmed particles, dileptons, multi-strange particles and their antiparticles.

Such particles can be reconstructed and investigated only through their decay products. The KF Particle finder package was developed for solving the task of their reconstruction and selection. The package searches for more than 100 decay channels covering signals from most of the physics cases of the CBM experiment: strange particles, strange resonances, hypernuclei, low mass vector mesons, charmonium, and open-charm particles. Based on the Kalman filter mathematics, KF Particle Finder allows to estimate not only the parameters, but their errors as well.

The large multiplicity of the charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions leads to the combinatorial background in the reconstructed spectra of short-lived particles. The KF Particle Finder provides the machinery to describe the background and extract the signal spectra. Collecting the efficiency plots, the package contains tools for efficiency correction of the obtained spectra and their multi-differential analysis.

For the upcoming beamtime, the HADES RICH detector is currently undergoing an upgrade, to ensure enhanced dielectron reconstruction.
For the upgrade, the current $CsI$ based MWPC will be exchanged with an arrangement of multi-anode photo multiplier tubes (HAMAMATSU H12700).
The upgrade of the photon detector is supplemented by the development of a completely new electronic readout chain, with the $32\,$ch DIRICH FPGA-TDC readout module as its core element.
The DIRICH module combines discrimination, time measurement, and data handling on a single FPGA, providing a powerful and cost-efficient solution for this kind of sensor.
The larger efficiency of the new photomultiplier sensors will significantly enhance the detection efficiency for $e^{+}$$e^{-}$ pairs with small opening angle and hence reduce combinatorial background.

The signal discrimination, time- and time-over-threshold measurement, as well as digital data handling, are all implemented on a central Lattice ECP5 FPGA, providing a very cost-efficient and powerful solution. Another important aspect is the very low power consumption (12 mW/amplifier, 50 mW per channel, including discrimination, TDC, and data handling). 
The new readout chain has been tested at the COSY accelerator, Forschungszentrum Jülich, for the first time under realistic beam conditions, using a small Cherenkov prototype detector. Cherenkov photons were produced by the 600 MeV proton beam passing a solid Cherenkov radiator made of 3 mm quartz.

Poster Session,poster,"Using machine learning for data quality assurance, particle identification, and fast simulations in ALICE","Graczykowski, Lukasz Kamil",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Machine learning (ML) is one of the most rapidly evolving fields of computer science. High-energy physics (HEP) with its complex detectors is an ideal place to utilize ML in its full extent. The ALICE experiment is a perfect environment to test the ML capabilities, which can  automatize quality assurance (QA), particle identification, as well as perform fast simulations.
 
QA in ALICE is an important task in order to avoid processing low quality or redundant data, and to classify it for analysis. Currently, human experts are involved in an offline data assessment. This process is time-consuming and it typically takes days, or weeks to assess the quality of the past data taking periods. Furthermore, since after the LHC Long Shutdown 2 upgrades ALICE plans to record data at higher rates, manual data quality checks may not be feasible. We show first attempts of using ML for this purpose.
 
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are important ingredients of HEP experiments. They are needed not only to compare experimental data with theory but also to calibrate the detector as well as the reconstruction and analysis software. One of the biggest tasks is propagating each generated particle through the detector medium in order to obtain the correct detector responses. This usually involves the use of Geant or other transport packages which is very time consuming. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can be utilized to provide reconstructed clusters basing on input MC particles with much higher computational speed. We show results of the  preliminary approach of using GANs for this purpose in ALICE.
 
ML can also be used for particle identification. In traditional analysis physicists usually select particles by applying an arbitrary specific selection criteria on certain detector signals, such as the TPC energy loss or TOF arrival time. We show the results of applying ML methods to select particles of interest with maximized efficiency.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lukasz Kamil', 'last_name': 'Graczykowski', 'fullName': 'Graczykowski, Lukasz Kamil', 'id': '3513563', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': 'f8980dc49484eb5ffee6c1e3850373b3', 'db_id': 3513563, 'person_id': 3644806}"

The analysis reveals significant differences in particle production between mesons and baryons. The correlation functions for mesons exhibit the expected peak dominated by effects of mini-jet fragmentation and are well reproduced by general purpose Monte Carlo generators. This is not the case for baryon pairs; results for baryons present a challenge to the contemporary models (PYTHIA, PHOJET) with  simulations showing significant differences in respect to experimental data. Moreover, when both particles have the same baryon number (pp, $\bar{p}\bar{p}$, p$\Lambda$, $\bar{p}\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$) a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak. This unexpected observation is further interpreted in the context of baryon production mechanisms in the fragmentation process.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Malgorzata Anna', 'last_name': 'Janik', 'fullName': 'Janik, Malgorzata Anna', 'id': '3513490', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': '586d99fbc98e13e2684c8493a82bca60', 'db_id': 3513490, 'person_id': 3640073}"
Poster Session,poster,Pathlength dependence of particle-yield modification on the near-side with ALICE at the LHC,"Kim, Hyeonjoong",Yonsei University (KR),KR,"Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC produce a hot and dense medium, which is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons. Jets are produced from hard processes in the initial stages of the collision and interact with the medium while propagating through it. Angular correlation analyses of hadron pairs are a convenient method to observe jets and their interaction with the medium without fully reconstructing the jets.
Comparing the jet peak yield in pp collisions and Pb-Pb collisions gives information about the hard parton's energy loss mechanism through the medium. The jet energy loss while propagating through the medium can be quantified in azimuthal di-hadron correlations with the observable $I_{AA}$, the ratio between the jet peak yield in Pb-Pb collisions to pp collisions. Furthermore, the in-medium jet modification can be more precisely measured by comparing jets which traverse different pathlengths through the medium. The pathlength dependence of the jet modification can be observed with $I_{AA}$ as a function of the relative angle between the trigger particle and the event plane.
In this presentation, $I_{AA}$ as a function of centrality, relative angle to the event plane, and the transverse momentum of the associated particles for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV will be shown. In addition, the results will be compared to AMPT model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Hyeonjoong', 'last_name': 'Kim', 'fullName': 'Kim, Hyeonjoong', 'id': '3513468', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University (KR)', 'emailHash': 'db694d52e9df51cff5c030bdc75e12f2', 'db_id': 3513468, 'person_id': 3644795}"

The angular distribution of decay leptons from heavy quark bound state is a key observable to test heavy quarkonia production mechanisms and bound state formation. Charmonium, in particlular, is an essential tool as it decays into di-leptons with a large branching ratio. PHENIX and STAR have observed J/$\psi$ polarization consistent to zero within uncertainties with limited statistics via measurements of polar angular distribution in decay di-electron pairs at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV at midrapidity. Recently, measurement of full (polar and azimuthal) angular distribution from J/psi decay to di-muon pairs at $\sqrt{s}$=510 GeV in the forward rapidity region has shown good agreement with predictions made by non-relativistic QCD at high pT and disagreement at low pT, posing a challenge to this theoretical approach. This poster will present the status of data analysis underway on the data taken from p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=510 GeV in 2013 at RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,Impact of magnetic field fluctuations on the CME in small systems,"Zhao, Xinli","Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Scien",Unknown,"Many great efforts have been made to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), which replies on the existence of extremely large electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the recent CMS measurements in small systems challenge the traditional CME interpretation, indicating that the dominant contribution to the CME observable of charge azimuthal correlation ($\gamma=<cos(\phi_{\alpha}+\phi_{\beta} - 2\Psi_{RP})>$) may not be related to the CME in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions.

  In this work, we investigate the properties of the electromagnetic fields in small systems by using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model [1]. We find that compared to A+A collisions, the magnitudes of absolute electric and magnetic fields in small systems are comparable. We show that **the correlation of $<cos2(\Psi_B - \Psi_{2})>$ between the magnetic field direction and the particant plane angle is strongly suppressed in high-multiplicity events, but strongly correlated in parallel in low-multiplicity events**. It indicates that the traditional CME observable $\gamma$ is not valid to study the CME in high-multiplicity events. However, the strong correlation in low-multiplicity events can reduce or even change sign of the traditional CME observable, which is qualitatively consistent with the recent event-shape engineering measurement from the CMS [2]. Therefore, we suggest searching for a possible CME signal in small systems with low multiplicities.

Poster Session,poster,A new correlator for the detection and characterization of the Chiral Magnetic Effect,"Shi, Shuzhe",Indiana University,USA,"A charge-sensitive in-event correlator ($R(\Delta S)$) is proposed and tested for its efficacy to detect and characterize charge separation associated with the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions~[1]. For CME-driven charge separation, the correlator gives a concave response relative to the second-order event plane ($\Psi_2$), and a null response relative to the third-order plane ($\Psi_3$), consistent with the correlation (de-correlation) of the $\vec{B}$-field with the $\Psi_2$ ($\Psi_3$) plane. For non-CME background, the correlator gives responses, relative to $\Psi_2$ and $\Psi_3$, which allows a distinction between CME-driven charge separation and non-CME backgrounds. We discuss the $R(\Delta S)$ correlator and present results for its detailed response and sensitivity, to both signal and background, in several reaction models. They include (but are not limited to) a 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamic model [2], the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) model [3] and the Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) [4]. The implications for the use of the $R(\Delta S)$ correlator in the upcoming Isobar Run at RHIC will also be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Response studies of the CME-sensitive sine observable to heavy ion backgrounds,"Feng, Yicheng",Purdue University,USA,"A new sine observable, $R(\Delta s)$, has been proposed [1] to measure the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions, where $\Delta s$ is  the $\langle\sin\phi\rangle$ difference between positive and negative charges ($\phi$ is the particle azimuth) and $R(\Delta s)$ is the ratio of the out-of-plane to in-plane $\Delta s$ distributions. Studies with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) models show concave R($\Delta s$) distributions for CME signals and convex ones for typical resonance backgrounds [1]. A recent hydrodynamic study, however, indicates concave shapes for backgrounds as well [2]. Preliminary STAR data, on the other hand, reveal concave $R(\Delta s)$ distributions in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.

To better understand these results, we present a systematic study of the $v_{2}$ and $p_{T}$ dependences of resonance backgrounds by toy-model simulations, based on the toy model used in our previous study [3]. The resonance $v_{2}$ introduces different numbers of decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The resonance $p_{T}$ affects the opening angle of the decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair. Low $p_{T}$ resonances decay into large opening-angle pairs, and result in more ``back-to-back'' pairs out-of-plane because of the more in-plane resonances, mimicking a CME charge separation signal perpendicular to the reaction plane, or a concave $R(\Delta s)$. High $p_{T}$ resonances, on the other hand, decay into small opening-angle pairs, and result in a background behavior of convex $R(\Delta s)$. With this toy-model insight, we further investigate the responses of the $R(\Delta s)$ observable to AMPT backgrounds and AVFD CME signals,and the possible implications of the preliminary STAR data.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of the QCD equation of state and strange hadronic resonances on multiparticle correlations in heavy ion collisions,"Mantovani Sarti, Valentina",TU Munich,Unknown,"The QCD equation of state at zero baryon chemical potential is the only element of the standard dynamical framework to describe heavy ion collisions that can be directly determined from first principles. Continuum extrapolated lattice QCD equations of state have been computed using 2+1 quark flavors (up/down and strange) as well as 2+1+1 flavors to investigate the effect of thermalized charm quarks on QCD thermodynamics. Lattice results have also indicated the presence of new strange resonances that not only contribute to the equation of state of QCD matter but also affect hadronic afterburners used to model the later stages of heavy ion collisions. We investigate how these new developments obtained from first principles calculations affect multiparticle correlations in heavy ion collisions. We compare the commonly used equation of state S95n-v1, which was constructed using what are now considered outdated lattice results and hadron states, to the current state-of-the-art lattice QCD equations of state with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to the most up-to-date hadronic resonances and their decays. New hadronic resonances lead to an enhancement in the hadronic spectra at intermediate $p_T$. Using an outdated equation of state can directly affect the extraction of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma and results for different flow observables. The effects of the QCD equation of state on multiparticle correlations of identified particles are determined for both AuAu $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and PbPb $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions. New insights into the $v_2\{2\}$ to $v_3\{2\}$ puzzle in ultracentral collisions are found. Flow observables of heavier particles exhibit more non-linear behavior regardless of the assumptions about the equation of state, which may provide a new way to constrain the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$.

Poster Session,poster,Towards first-principle hydrodynamics for heavy-ion collision phenomenology,"Dubla, Andrea",GSI,Germany,"Heavy-ion collisions are well described by a dynamical evolution with a long hydro-dynamical phase. In this phase the properties of the strongly correlated quark-gluon plasma are reflected in the equation of state (EoS) and the transport coefficients, most prominently by the shear and bulk viscosities over entropy density ratio $\eta$/s(T) and $\zeta$/s(T), respectively. 
While the EoS is by now known to a high accuracy, the transport coefficients and in particular their temperature and density dependence are not known from first-principle computations yet. To remedy this situation we deploy a complementary QCD based approaches to compute $\eta$/s(T) using functional renormalization group to compute gluon real-time spectral functions [1]. In addition we will show the work and progresses of a novel lattice simulation prescription in non-compact imaginary time [2,3], in which the conventional analytic continuation problem is significantly improved.   
In this work, these most recent QCD-based parameters are provided as input to the MUSIC framework [4]. The IP-Glasma model is used to describe the initial energy density distribution, and UrQMD the late hadronic phase. Simulations are performed for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, for different centrality intervals. The resulting kinematic distributions of the particles produced in the collisions are compared to data from the LHC, for several experimental observables. The high precision of the experimental results and the broad variety of observables considered allow to critically verify the quality of the description based on first-principle input to the hydro-dynamic evolution.

Poster Session,poster,Temperature dependence of $\eta/s$: Constraints from Xe+Xe collisions and uncertainties from the equation of state,"Auvinen, Jussi",Institute of Physics Belgrade,Unknown,"Recent advancements in multi-parameter model-to-data comparison have provided notable constraints on the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ in the matter produced in the Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Bayesian analysis with a flexible initial state parametrization [1,2] supports a linear temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ found in the earlier study using the EKRT pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics model [3]. However, some open issues yet remain. The uncertainties regarding the value of $\eta/s$ increase quickly towards higher temperatures, and it remains unexplored how much the choice of the equation of state affects the final outcome of the global analysis.

The recently performed LHC Xe+Xe run at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ TeV introduces a new nuclear mass number and a new maximum collision energy for the heavy ion collisions, and consequently adding Xe+Xe data to the analysis has potential to further constrain $\eta/s(T)$. We perform a global model-to-data comparison on Au+Au, Pb+Pb, and Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, $2.76$ TeV, $5.02$ TeV and $5.44$ TeV, respectively, using a hydrodynamics model with the EKRT initial state, and the same parametric form for $\eta/s(T)$ as in Ref. [3]. Furthermore, to quantify the amount of uncertainty incorporated in the choice of EoS, we compare analysis results based on three different equations of state: the well known s95p parametrisation [4], an updated parametrisation based on the same list of particles, but recent lattice results [5] for the partonic EoS, and an updated parametrisation based on  the Particle Data Group 2016 particle list and the recent lattice results.

Poster Session,poster,Dynamical initialization with core-corona picture in small colliding systems,"Kanakubo, Yuuka",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"We study effects of dynamical initialization with a core-corona picture in hydrodynamic description of small colliding systems at RHIC and the LHC energies. We previously proposed an idea of dynamically initializing hydrodynamic fields by utilizing source terms in hydrodynamic equations [1]: Instead of setting initial conditions at a fixed hydrodynamic initial time, we make initially produced partons propagate and deposit energy and momentum into the bulk matter via the source terms to form the quark gluon plasma (QGP) fluids gradually. Under this idea, not only initial fluctuations of geometry but also those of velocity fields are naturally generated. In the present study, we further introduce the core-corona picture to the idea by considering spatial density of the initially produced partons. Here, partons produced in the dilute region fragment into hadrons separately instead of taking part in the initial QGP fluid formation. This picture strongly affect the fluid profile in small colliding systems and must be taken into account. 

To demonstrate the above idea, we employ a QGP fluid + jet model [2] in which the QGP medium evolution is described by (3+1)-D hydrodynamic equations with source terms. As an input, we generate partons by using the latest version of PYTHIA 8.230 which involves heavy-ion collisions. As propagating after the production, these partons deposit energy and momentum into the bulk QGP fluid according to the parton density around them in the core-corona picture. From simulations with this newly developed framework, we calculate hadron spectra including contributions from both the surviving partons in the dilute regions with PYTHIA fragmentation and  the fluid part in the dense region and show that the core-corona picture plays a crucial role in small colliding systems.

Poster Session,poster,Hydrodynamic fluctuations and long time tails of a baryon charged expanding fluid,"Martinez Guerrero, Mauricio",North Caroline State University,Unknown,"Recent studies of hydrodynamic fluctuations in rapidly expanding fluids suggest the existence of a universal renormalization which characterizes the long time behaviour of the equilibrium correlators of energy and momentum and transport coefficients. These results were obtained by assuming zero densities of conserved charges. In this work we study the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations when the chemical potentials conjugated to the conserved charges are turned on. We study the small frequency behavior of different response functions using stochastic fluid dynamics. We obtain a number of model independent results, including the long-time tail of different transport coefficients, and the leading non-analyticity of the correlators of energy, momentum and particle density for a system undergoing Bjorken flow. When applying our formalism to the lattice QCD equation of state at finite chemical potential we find lower bounds on the heat conductivity, shear and bulk viscosities. These bounds are weakly dependent on assumptions regarding the range of applicability of fluid dynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Investigating applicability of fluid dynamics in heavy ion collisions,"Niemi, Harri",J. W. Goethe Universität,Unknown,"We investigate the applicability of fluid dynamics (FD) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by comparing its solutions to those of the relativistic Boltzmann equation (BE) [1]. The latter can be solved numerically [2] and its FD limit is well known [3]. We consider various (2+1)-dimensional boost-invariant scenarios, with realistic initial transverse profiles of energy and particle density. By varying the system size and the cross section we then identify regions where FD is a good approximation to the BE.

We observe that the space-time evolution of energy density and fluid velocity is well described by FD for all considered values of the cross section. However, the FD shear-stress tensor starts to deviate from its BE counterpart when the Knudsen number $\rm Kn$, defined as a mean free path times the local expansion rate, exceeds a value of one.

We furthermore study the elliptic flow generated for Glauber-type initial conditions. We consider various decoupling conditions in FD and identify the $\rm Kn$ regions where the elliptic flow is generated. Decoupling at a constant $\rm Kn \sim 2-3$ gives a good agreement with the solutions of the BE when the cross section is sufficiently large, i.e., when most of the elliptic flow is generated during the evolution where $\rm Kn < 1$. With decreasing cross section most of the flow signal is generated in regions where $\rm Kn > 1$. In this case, the FD elliptic flow starts to deviate from that generated by the BE.

The analysis is performed over a wide range in event multiplicity, especially reaching the multiplicity regime in which long-range collective correlations were observed. This extension to high multiplicity events represents an important investigation to probe the behavior of the femtoscopic radius and shed light on theoretical models. Three different experimental techniques are applied and discussed in the measurement of these quantum-statistical correlations. Each one of them adopts a different analysis approach, with variable degrees of dependence on Monte Carlo simulated events, which is employed for estimating and correcting the non-Bose-Einstein contributions (resonances and mini-jets). All of the three methods employed provide values for the resulting one-dimensional fit parameters (lengths of homogeneity and correlation intensity) that are consistent within the experimental uncertainties of the analysis. The results are presented as a function of charged particle multiplicity and of the mean transverse pair momentum, in order to study the dynamical behavior of the emitting source.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Cesar', 'last_name': 'Bernardes', 'fullName': 'Bernardes, Cesar', 'id': '3586947', 'affiliation': 'UNESP - Universidade Estadual  Paulista (BR)', 'emailHash': 'b54dcc63cd354534155dfb0d605f2bee', 'db_id': 3586947, 'person_id': 3769736}"
Poster Session,poster,Harmonic flow with self-consistent bulk viscous corrections,"Molnar, Denes",Purdue University,USA,"One of the most spectacular observations in heavy ion physics has been that  thermalization may occur in small system collisions. For example, harmonic flow coefficients vn(pT) measured in high multiplicity p+A reactions are well reproduced by viscous hydrodynamics calculations. Small system collisions in fact serve as good tests of hydrodynamics because they should be more difficult to thermalize; in other words, shear stress and bulk pressure corrections are expected to be larger than in A+A collisions.

At freezeout, shear stress and bulk pressure manifest as nonthermal $\delta f$ corrections to the particle distributions. Hydrodynamic variables cannot fix the momentum dependence of the corrections, nor how these vary with hadron species. Therefore, to compute observables, hydro calculations rely on a model for $\delta f_i$. In practice, ad hoc postulated forms are used based on Grad's quadratic ansatz, completely disregarding the microscopic dynamics of the system. On the other hand, a self-consistent set of corrections can be obtained from kinetic theory, which depend on the scattering rates between the various species.

Self-consistent shear viscous corrections can generate a characteristic meson vs baryon difference in harmonic flow coefficients, much akin to quark number scaling. The difference arises because meson-meson cross sections tend to be smaller than meson-baryon cross sections (additive quark model). It is not yet known, however, how bulk viscosity and self-consistent bulk corrections affect harmonic flow. This is especially interesting in small systems because bulk pressure can be large. Extending the work of Molnar and Wolff (PRC95, 024903) we calculate self-consistent bulk viscous corrections in a multi-species hadron gas. Then, we use the self-consistent corrections to calculate harmonic flow observables in p+Pb collisions at the LHC, and show how bulk viscosity manifests in the momentum and species dependence of the harmonic flow coefficients.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Denes', 'last_name': 'Molnar', 'fullName': 'Molnar, Denes', 'id': '3530719', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': '2499fb643638c071cf30c16e8ec80df3', 'db_id': 3530719, 'person_id': 3647658}"

We consider various initial conditions for the hydrodynamic evolution and different forms of the spin tensor to study consequences of various physical assumptions for the time evolution of the system's polarization [2]. Our findings show a characteristic decrease of the overall polarization in the system with the increasing collision energy, as recently found in the experimental measurements of the Lambda hyperons. We also find that the polarization in our approach increases with time during the hydrodynamic evolution, an effect connected with the overall angular momentum and entropy conservation laws.

The correlation function is dominated by qualitatively different mechanisms at different length scales, and quantum entanglement between two sets of quark / antiquark pairs leads to highly nontrivial correlations.

and they are actively investigated theoretically. They are known well for
pairs of common (anti-)baryons, however there is a lack of precise
data for heavier baryons, including the ones carrying strangeness. The
so-called kaonic atoms are also investigated theoretically and their
properties crucially depend on the kaon-nucleon interaction. The
two-particle correlation formalism (femtoscopy) is sensitive to the
interaction kernel for a pair of particles, which is related to the
pair interaction cross-section [1]. The formalism is extensively used
to measure two-particle correlations in heavy-ion collisions. In
particular the collisions at RHIC and LHC produce simultaneously large
number of baryons and anti-baryons and even larger number of kaons. We
show how this formalism can be used to extract the cross-sections from
the femtoscopic baryon-(anti-)baryon correlation functions [2], as
well as from proton-charged kaon functions. The analysis is 
complicated by the presence of the so-called ""residual correlations""
arising from weak decay products in the measured sample. We show how
this effect can be exploited to gain further insight into the
cross-sections of even heavier baryons. We discuss the limitations of
the measurement technique and estimate the discovery potential of

Poster Session,poster,Understanding $\gamma$-jet angular correlation and momentum imbalance with QCD resummations.,"Chen, Lin",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"$\gamma$-jet correlations and their momentum imbalance have been widely regarded as the ""Golden probe"". Based on our previous studies on dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlations in $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions [1,2,3,4], we further employ the systematic Sudakov resummation formalism to study the angular correlation between direct photon and jets as well as their transverse momentum imbalance in both $pp$ and $PbPb$ collisions. 

Our results [5] for the $\gamma$-jet angular correlation agree nicely with the ATLAS and CMS data. Since the vacuum Sudakov effects are overwhelmingly larger than QGP medium effects,  we can naturally explain the negligible difference between $pp$ and $PbPb$ data. Furthermore, based on the resummation improved pQCD approach, our calculation for the distribution of $\gamma$-jet transverse momentum imbalance in $pp$ collisions can provide  important predictions for this observable, and can be compared with all LHC data once experimental data are unfolded. In addition, using the $pp$ collision as the baseline, we can also apply BDMPS and High-Twist energy loss formalism to $PbPb$ collisions, and thus extract the jet transport coefficient in the LHC regime.

Poster Session,poster,"Dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet correlations in resummation improved pQCD approach","Zhang, Hanzhong","IOPP, CCNU",Unknown,"Dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlations as well as dijet transverse momentum asymmetry have been reckoned as important probes of the transverse momentum broadening effects in relativistic nuclear collisions [1,2]. Dijets become de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening. 

We first employ the systematic Sudakov resummation formalism to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data in $pp$ and central $AA$ collisions [1]. For a quark jet at RHIC top energy, a global $\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data renders the best fit for the medium-induced broadening $\langle p_\perp^2\rangle$ and the so-called jet transport coefficient $\hat q$ in central $AA$ collisions.

Then we develop a systematic theoretical approach to dijet asymmetries in $pp$ collisions based on pQCD expansion and Sudakov resummation formalism [2]. We find that the NLO pQCD calculation is indispensable to describe experimental data, while the resummation formalism is vital near the end points where the pQCD expansion fails to converge due to appearance of large Sudakov logarithms. Utilizing our resummation-improved pQCD approach, we extract jet transport coefficient for quark-gluon plasma in $PbPb$ collisions at 2.76A~TeV. 

We can also use this method to study the properites of cold nuclear matter and other related topics [3].

Further experimental and theoretical efforts along the direction of this work shall significantly advance the quantitative understanding of transverse momentum broadening and help us acquire precise knowledge of jet quenching parameter in heavy-ion collisions.

ahead of a big evolution jump thanks to instruments like NICER [1],
which will increase the accuracy of the measurements. The discovery of
gravitational waves originating from merging neutron stars in this year
(GW170817 [2]) is the first step to use gravitational waves as a probe
for extremely dense nuclear matter.

Despite these developments the masquarade problem still persists in
modeling cold superdense nuclear matter based on compact star
observables. Since many different models yield similar neutron star
parameters only high-precision measurements and theoretical reasons can
exclude models.

In this talk we present a realistic, Walecka-type model where the
bosonic fluctuations are included using the Functional Renormalization
Group (FRG) method in the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), based on
a our technique published previously [3,4]. The thermodynamical
quantities, equation of state (EoS), compressibility are calculated in
different approximations: mean field, 1st order and high order. Based
on these EoS, the properties of the corresponding neutron stars are
also calculated using the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkov (TOV) equations.

It is also presented, how calculating quantum corrections in different
approximations change the predicted neutron star parameters like mass,
radius and compactness. These results show, that in the light of the
new developments in astrophysical observations quantum corrections are
approaching the threshold where calculating them will be necessary for
the correct comparison between different models.

Poster Session,poster,A Quark-Gluon Plasma inspired model of the universe,"Mendes, Melissa",IFGW,Unknown,"We show that certain ideas developed in the last few years of heavy ion physics research could be used to produce key features of the standard cosmological model, in the context of a beyond the standard model pure gauge theory with a high (~TeV) equivalent of the QCD scale.
In particular, the peak in bulk viscosity argued to exist within QCD [1,2] can be used to generate inflation, while glueballs within the same theory are viable dark matter candidates.
We present solutions of the FRW equations for matter with these characteristics, in the hope of establishing weather the right number of e-foldings and dark matter abundance can be generated in such a model.

Poster Session,poster,Forward instrumentation for the ALICE Upgrade: the Fast Interaction Trigger and the FoCal proposal,"Bearden, Ian Gardner",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"Two additions to the forward instrumentation of ALICE will be described: the new Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) and the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The former will be installed during the Long Shutdown 2 (2019/2020), while the latter is proposed for Long Shutdown 3 (2024-2026).
 
The FIT detector provides a fast trigger, a precise collision time measurement for time-of-flight based particle identification, and will be the main ALICE luminometer. FIT will measure an unbiased multiplicity distribution in the forward direction needed for the determination of the centrality and of the event plane in heavy-ion collisions. FIT is composed of two Cherenkov detector arrays (T0+) with a time resolution in the 20-50 ps range and a large, sectored scintillator ring (V0+). The T0+ arrays surround the beam pipe on both sides of the IP at a distance of 82 cm on the side of the muon arm, and 330 cm on the opposite side. In total, FIT will produce 208 Cherenkov signals and 48 scintillator signals, respectively.
 
The main goal of the FoCal proposal is to measure forward ($3.5 < y < 5$) direct photons in pp, and p--Pb collisions to obtain unique experimental constraints on proton and nuclear PDFs in a new region of low $x$ ($10^{-5} - 10^{-6}$). In addition it provides measurements of neutral mesons, two particle correlations, and jets in p+p, p--Pb and (partially) in Pb--Pb. The direct photon measurement requires a new electromagnetic calorimeter with extremely high granularity. The design principle of the high-resolution SiW sandwich calorimeter will be presented and results from the ongoing R$\&$D program with test beams will be shown. The detector will be instrumented with Si-pad sensors with analog readout and a MAPS-based digital pixel readout. The test beam results include linearity and energy resolution measurement, but also three-dimensional shower distributions on the sub-millimeter scale and the corresponding excellent position resolution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ian Gardner', 'last_name': 'Bearden', 'fullName': 'Bearden, Ian Gardner', 'id': '3553810', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '73281c999b22d7ef2db9b9622dc842a9', 'db_id': 3553810, 'person_id': 3737701}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurements of D0 Production in p+Au and d+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV by the STAR Experiment,"Kramarik, Lukas",Czech Technical University (CZ),CZ,"Charm quarks possess large masses, and thus can serve as penetrating probes to study the intrinsic properties of the hot medium created in heavy-ion collisions. However, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, such as the change in the parton distribution function between a free nucleon and a nucleus, also affect the charm quark production in nuclear collisions with respect to p+p collisions. These effects can be measured in small systems such as p+A and d+A collisions, where only the CNM effects are present. Furthermore, a sizable azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) has been observed in both nucleus-nucleus collisions and small-system collisions of high multiplicities. To better understand the origin of the flow-like signal in small-system collisions, it is important to study charm quark azimuthal anisotropy in these systems.

In this presentation, we will report on the first measurements of $\text{D}^{0}$ production in p+Au collisions, and the $\text{D}^{0}$ transverse momentum spectrum and $v_2$ with the Heavy Flavor Tracker in d+Au collisions, all at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The nuclear modification factors of $\text{D}^{0}$ meson will be extracted to quantify the CNM effects, and a comparison will be made to those of electrons from open heavy flavor hadron decays in p+Au collisions. Different cuts on the pseudo-rapidity gap between $\text{D}^{0}$ candidates and tracks used for event plane reconstruction, as well as different techniques, such as event plane and two-particle correlation methods, will be explored to help understand different physics mechanisms contributing to the azimuthal anisotropy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lukas', 'last_name': 'Kramarik', 'fullName': 'Kramarik, Lukas', 'id': '3582449', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University (CZ)', 'emailHash': '470c252ce4d3978c795e157efd341239', 'db_id': 3582449, 'person_id': 3765372}"

In the case of an out-of-equilibrium homogeneous medium [2], isotropization happens before the system thermalizes and the behavior of the pressure anisotropy changes qualitatively as the chemical potential is increased towards the critical point. These results are then generalized [3] to consider the case of an expanding plasma undergoing Bjorken flow in the vicinity of the critical point, which allows us to determine for the first time how the presence of a critical point affects the emergence of hydrodynamic behavior (hydrodynamization) in a strongly coupled plasma similar to the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in the RHIC beam energy scan. The interplay between critical phenomena and non-equilibrium hydrodynamic attractor solutions in Bjorken flow [3] will be also discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Dynamical Thermalization in the Quark-Meson Model,"Shen, Linda","Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg University",Unknown,"Understanding the early out-of-equilibrium dynamics of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) remains one
of the biggest theory challenges. So far, there are no first principle calculations for the equilibration
process of the quark gluon plasma and the dynamics close to the phase transition. In particular
describing the behavior close to the conjectured critical point, where critical slowing down leads
to off-equilibrium dynamics, poses difficulties.
Here we study the initial stages of a HIC using a low-energy effective theory of QCD, the
quark-meson model, in order to gain insight into the thermalization process. This model manifests
a central and physically relevant feature of QCD: chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum and its
restoration at finite temperature and density. At the critical endpoint this model is expected to
be in the same universality class as QCD and hence a viable model to explore dynamical critical
phenomena.
We solve the non-perturbative real-time quantum equations of motions for the quark and meson
fields in the two-particle irreducible effective action framework. Similar to a HIC, our system is
prepared in a high-energy initial state and suddenly quenched out of equilibrium, evolving towards
a thermal final state in the chirally broken phase.
In a first step, we investigate the time-evolution of both bulk and spectral properties of this
system, which provides us with insight into the approach of thermalization over time and the
properties of the relevant degrees of freedom dominating the real-time dynamics. For the thermal
final state, this implies information about the mass spectrum and the thermalization temperature.
Finally, the prospects of generalizing the simulations to finite baryon density and the approach to
the critical point are discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Linda', 'last_name': 'Shen', 'fullName': 'Shen, Linda', 'id': '3530872', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Theoretical Physics, Heidelberg University', 'emailHash': 'e9bac60d51dd58ad2bd33259269e9a68', 'db_id': 3530872, 'person_id': 3644545}"

This is done by recasting the quenching weight as the solution of a rate equation with medium-induced partonic splitting functions that are sensitive to the expansion. We perform the calculations in the framework of Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff-Zakharov (BDMPSZ) formalism for multiple soft scatterings with a time-dependent transport coefficient. Furthermore, we discuss the validity of a dynamical scaling law that relates the spectrum in an expanding medium to the equivalent static case with rescaled medium parameters [1] and test the size of energy loss fluctuations in a realistic medium.

Poster Session,poster,Jet energy loss in a flowing plasma,"van der Schee, Wilke",MIT,USA,"We present new results on the energy loss of light partons traversing a highly dynamical strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma. As QGP has large gradients in both temperature and the fluid velocity, it is crucial to study energy loss without assuming a homogeneous plasma, especially as it is known that energy loss depends on the plasma evolution in a non-local way. In a holographic description, we consider several subsequent improvements of the hydrodynamic background by keeping increasing orders in the gradient expansion. Already for varying temperature and velocity profiles and ideal hydrodynamics, the energy loss is considerably modified. However, this description is limited to very small gradients and it is hence necessary to include viscous corrections. We present a numerical analysis of jet energy loss in a boost-invariant and transversely-expanding droplet of QGP. We find that depending on the direction of the fluid flow, the velocity gradients can change the distance a parton can travel by a factor of two, which would correspond to changing the coupling constant by a factor of more than fifty.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wilke', 'last_name': 'van der Schee', 'fullName': 'van der Schee, Wilke', 'id': '3530900', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': '66afd64e8cf68b02dbd409a401b873bf', 'db_id': 3530900, 'person_id': 3647316}"

The core of the model used in these analyses is based on the shift formalism which allows for an extraction of the magnitude of parton energy loss from the data with minimal assumptions on the underlying physics mechanisms. The model is capable of describing the full $p_{T}$, rapidity, and centrality dependence of the measured jet $R_{AA}$ using three effective parameters. The analysis done using this simple model can explain the shape of the modification of fragmentation functions observed in the data as well as the relation between the magnitude of the jet $R_{AA}$ and the $R_{AA}$ of charged particles. The analysis of recent data on  splitting functions and fragmentation functions allows for further constrains on the role of coherence effects in the parton energy loss. Further, the analysis of charmonia suppression using this model points to a remarkable similarity between the quenching of light-quark-initiated jets and the prompt charmonia suppression.

Poster Session,poster,Resolution Effects in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model,"Hulcher, Zachary",Cambridge University,UK,"Within a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching, plasma produced in a heavy ion collision cannot resolve the substructure of a collimated parton shower propagating through it with arbitrarily fine spatial resolution. We introduce a screening length parameter, $L_{res}$, proportional to the inverse of the local temperature in the plasma, estimating a range for the value of the proportionality constant via comparing weakly coupled QCD calculations and holographic calculations appropriate in strongly coupled plasma. When a parton in a jet splits, its two offspring are initially unresolved and suffer the energy loss of the original parton until they are separated by $L_{res}$. This delays the quenching of partons with intermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final state with $p_T$ in the several GeV range. Introducing a nonzero $L_{res}$ results in modifications to the jet shapes and jet fragmentations functions, as it makes it more probable for particles carrying a small fraction of the jet energy at larger angles from the jet axis to survive their passage through the quark-gluon plasma. These effects are small in magnitude, which we confirm via checking for effects on missing-$p_T$ observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Hulcher', 'fullName': 'Hulcher, Zachary', 'id': '3530917', 'affiliation': 'Cambridge University', 'emailHash': '6d3d0d97012a346ef520bcbc24a9ce80', 'db_id': 3530917, 'person_id': 3640339}"

Poster Session,poster,Heavy quark transport in a hybrid Boltzmann + Langevin approach,"Ke, Weiyao",Duke University,USA,"Heavy quarks produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have proven to be sensitive to the properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which they propagate. Current measurements of open charm in heavy-ion collisions show unexpectedly large momentum anisotropies and small nuclear modification factors, posing a challenge for the theoretical understanding of the nature of coupling between heavy quark and the medium.

Linearized Boltzmann transport and Langevin diffusion are two popular kinetic models for heavy quark in-medium propagation. However, both of these approaches also suffer from shortcomings, i.e. Langevin diffusion is only fully applicable for heavy quarks experiencing small momenta transfer and vice versa a linearied Boltzmann transport approach with perturbative matrix elements works best in the high momentum transfer limit. In this work, we develop a hybrid heavy quark transport model that combines the strengths of each approach: heavy quarks are evolved with Langevin diffusion using an empirical diffusion constant, while rare but important scattering processes are described using linearized Boltzmann equations with perturbative matrix elements. This Langevin component is a complementary contribution to the Boltzmann component when perturbative calculation may be inadequate to describe all the interactions. Both elastic and inelastic scatterings are included in the Boltzmann component. The Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is treated effectively via a gluon formation time and detailed balance is imposed between gluon emission and absorption. Finally, the QGP evolution is obtained by a state-of-the-art relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculation.

With this hybrid model, we study heavy flavor momentum anisotropies, nuclear modification factor, and correlation observables in A-A collisions at RHIC and  LHC energies. Comparing to available D and B meson data, we constrain the diffusion constant of the Langevin component.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Weiyao', 'last_name': 'Ke', 'fullName': 'Ke, Weiyao', 'id': '3531010', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '1240602cf275b01cbc3a4cc9b6afb783', 'db_id': 3531010, 'person_id': 3642824}"

A global analysis encompassing all available collision systems and energies as well as an improved treatment of known uncertainties for different observables would significantly improve our ability to distinguish between different theoretical models and constrain the heavy flavor diffusion coefficient in an unbiased way.


In this study, we show that describing the heavy quark energy loss with Langevin diffusion and a radiative energy loss component in a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic medium, including heavy meson hadronic interactions modeled with UrQMD allows for a simultaneous description of the $D$-meson $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ and $v_n$ at both RHIC (200 GeV) and the LHC (2.76 \& 5.02 TeV) energies.

The estimated diffusion coefficient $D_sT$ has a positive temperature dependence and a non-trivial momentum dependence. The constrained diffusion coefficient is validated by comparing $D$-meson $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ in pPb collisions along with $B$-meson measurements.

We finally discuss the different regions probed in the ($T-\mu_B$) plane by the QGP phase and the perspectives to identify a possible critical point in the phase diagram.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pierre', 'last_name': 'Moreau', 'fullName': 'Moreau, Pierre', 'id': '3531030', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': '57f5780389ab1be49d72f019b18e8f59', 'db_id': 3531030, 'person_id': 3643868}"
Poster Session,poster,The many onsets of NA61/SHINE,"Kaptur, Emil Aleksander",University of Silesia (PL),Poland,"NA61/SHINE is a fixed target experiment operating at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron (SPS). The main goal of the experiment is the study of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. This goal is pursued by performing a two-dimensional scan by varying the beam momentum (13A-158A GeV/c) and the system size (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) of the collisions.

The properties of strangeness production show nontrivial dependence on the beam momentum. This dependence is interpreted as the onset of deconfinement. The prediction of theoretical models will be compared with the measured data.

A new effect, onset of fireball, is indicated by the unexpected similarity between p+p and Be+Be data. Collisions of the light systems can be treated as a superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. However, a rapid qualitative change of the value of various observables occurs when colliding heavier systems. This may indicate another threshold behaviour of strongly interacting matter.

The theoretical models SMES and PHSD describe the onset of deconfinement in the heaviest system relatively well. However, no model describes the behaviour of the data in previously unmeasured collisions of light and intermediate size ions. The onset of fireball is not described by models at all.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emil Aleksander', 'last_name': 'Kaptur', 'fullName': 'Kaptur, Emil Aleksander', 'id': '3531040', 'affiliation': 'University of Silesia (PL)', 'emailHash': '1ff96d7b3aa3f1e527e492c7e14da0f2', 'db_id': 3531040, 'person_id': 3643551}"
Poster Session,poster,Tachyonic instability of the scalar mode prior to the QCD critical point based on the functional renormalization-group method in the two-flavor case,"Yokota, Takeru","Kyoto University, Japan",Unknown,"We investigate spectral properties of the collective excitations around the QCD critical point (CP) by applying the functional renormalization-group (FRG) method to the two-flavor quark-meson model with current quark mass $m_q$ being varied. The nature of the CP such as the soft modes is known to be affected by the value of $m_q$: We first determine the whole phase structure in the three-dimensional space $(T, μ, m_q)$ consisting of temperature $T$, quark chemical potential $\mu$ and $m_q$, with the tricritical point, $\mathrm{O}(4)$ and $\mathrm{Z}_2$ critical lines being located; they altogether make a winglike shape quite reminiscent of those known in the condensed matters with a tricritical point. We then calculate the spectral functions in the scalar and pseudoscalar channel around the critical points. We find that the sigma mesonic mode becomes tachyonic with a superluminal velocity at finite momenta before the system reaches the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ point from the lower density, even for $m_q$ smaller than the physical value. One of the possible implications of the appearance of such a tachyonic mode at finite momenta is that the assumed equilibrium state with a uniform chiral condensate is unstable toward a state with an inhomogeneous $\sigma$ condensate. No such anomalous behavior is found in the pseudoscalar channel. We find that the $\sigma$-to-$2\sigma$ coupling due to finite $m_q$ plays an essential role for the drastic modification of the spectral function.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takeru', 'last_name': 'Yokota', 'fullName': 'Yokota, Takeru', 'id': '3531051', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto University, Japan', 'emailHash': '64a935d432fea8c255beff9ea811ebec', 'db_id': 3531051, 'person_id': 3644431}"

We demonstrate that the aHydro attractor is virtually indistinguishable from the exact attractor and  show that the success of aHydro in reproducing the exact attractor solution stems from the fact that in this approach there is a resummation in both gradients (Knudsen number ${-}$ $Kn$) and inverse Reynolds number ($R_\pi^{-1}$).

Poster Session,poster,Constraining the QCD equation of state with identified particle spectra,"Monnai, Akihiko","Institut de Physique Théorique, CNRS/CEA",Unknown,"The equation of state is one of the fundamental properties of the QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. Lattice QCD simulations now provide a realistic equation of state at vanishing density, but it may differ from what we should see in the experiments because heavy-ion systems may be out of chemical equilibrium, in strong magnetic fields and affected by finite size effects. It is thus important to understand the imprints of the equation of state on the data.

We find that the mean transverse mass as a function of the multiplicity density reproduces, up to proportionality factors, the energy over entropy ratio as a function of the entropy density [1]. We perform viscous hydrodynamic simulations using a variety of equations of state and compare the results to the experimental data. The equations of state with the effective number of degrees of freedom equal to or larger than that of lattice QCD are favored. We also discuss how we can constrain the equation of state at finite baryon density.

A clear sign change is observed in excitation function of the proton v1 slope, which could be an indication of the softening of the equation of state (EoS) due to 1st order phase transition. The v1 slope for produced particles, such as charged pions and kaons are negative while the v1 slope of protons show positive values at low energies. This anti-correlation between proton and pion v1 slope has been previously studied at 1GeV beam energy [2]. 

In this talk, we will report the v1 of proton, and charged pions, kaons in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 3-20 GeV from transport model (JAM). For the first time, we explicitly and quantitatively discuss the effects of spectator shadowing on the v1 at RHIC BES energy region. We observe that the negative v1 slope for both pions and kaons BES energies are caused by their scattering with the spectator nucleons (shadowing effects), which can explain the different behavior of the directed flow for proton and other produced particles. We also find that a softening of EoS will lead to a negative proton v1 slope within JAM hadronic transport model.

In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the enhanced density fluctuations due to phase transitions (either first-order or second-order at CEP) can cause large correlations in nucleon densities at final state, which in turn affect the productions of composite particles like light nuclei. The light nuclei (e.g. deuteron) can only be formed within a restricted volume in phase space, therefore, they can probe local density fluctuation.
      
  I will demonstrate the usefulness and advantage of probing the QCD phase diagram with light nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

   Especially, from recent experimental data in central Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) energies measured by the NA49 Collaboration, we find significant non-monotonic behaviours of nucleon density correlations and fluctuations.  The results indicate that the density fluctuations become the largest in collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.8$~GeV. With the known chemical freeze-out conditions determined from the statistical model fit to experimental data, we obtain a chemical freeze-out temperature of $\sim 144~$MeV and baryon chemical potential of $\sim 385~$MeV at this collision energy, which are close to those predicted by various theoretical studies for the critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sun', 'last_name': 'Kai-Jia', 'fullName': 'Kai-Jia, Sun', 'id': '3513808', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics and Astronomy and Shanghai Key Laboratory for Particle Physics and Cosmology', 'emailHash': '2e132dd95185baf2c04021a64d830f8b', 'db_id': 3513808, 'person_id': 3666853}"

Poster Session,poster,Dielectron production in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV measured in a dedicated low magnetic-field setting with ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ. (DE),Germany,"Low-mass dielectrons are an important probe for the hot and dense medium which is created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Since leptons do not interact strongly and are produced throughout the whole collision process, they carry information from all collision stages with negligible final-state interaction.

The ALICE detector is well-suited to perform this measurement due to its excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities at low momenta. However, Dalitz decays and photon conversions lead to a high combinatorial background with a signal-to-background ratio of 1:10 to 1:1000 in Pb-Pb collisions, depending on the invariant mass. Therefore, the minimization of the background is a key aspect of this analysis.
The reconstruction efficiency of low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons can be increased by reducing the magnetic field of the ALICE central barrel solenoid from 0.5 T to 0.2 T. This allows a better rejection of the electron background and simultaneously gives the opportunity to increase the accessible phase space of the dielectron measurement. Such a configuration is planned in ALICE for part of the Pb-Pb campaigns in LHC Run 3 and 4 from 2021 on.

This poster will present the status of the dielectron measurement in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV from pilot runs taken with B=0.2 T in the ALICE central barrel.

The measurements are performed with a charge-sensitive correlator $R(\Delta S)$ [1] and the three-particle mixed harmonic correlator $\mathrm{C_{m,n,m+n} = \left< cos(m\phi_1 + n\phi_2 -(m+n)\phi_3)\right>}$ [2]. These are expected to give different responses to the CME-driven charge separation and non-CME background correlations. The $R(\Delta S)$ measurements are found to be flat relative to $\Psi_3$ in all systems and $\Psi_2$ in p(d)+Au systems, consistent with the expectation of random $\vec{B}$-field orientations relative to these event planes. In contrast, the heavy-ion measurements relative to $\Psi_2$ show concave-shaped $R(\Delta S)$ distributions, which is consistent with the presence of CME-driven charge separation characterized by an out-of-plane Fourier dipole coefficient $a_1$. We will present and discuss $R(\Delta S)$ and $\mathrm{C_{m,n,m+n}}$ measurements for a broad range of transverse momenta, pseudorapidity, and centrality intervals and compare it with model predictions [1]. The implication of these measurements for the upcoming isobar collisions at RHIC will also be discussed.

These upgrades will enable STAR to continue its unique, ground-breaking mid-rapidity science program in the period following BES-II. The key physics opportunities envisioned address three broad areas of interest within the cold QCD community in the years following the BES-II. These programs will shed light on the dynamics of low and high x partons in cold nuclear matter (CNM) and how the fragmentation and hadronization of these partons is modified through interactions within the CNM and experiments to study the 2+1d spatial and momentum structure of protons and nuclei. These measurements will provide critical new insights into the QCD structure of nucleons and nuclei in the near term, as well as the high precision data that will be essential to enable rigorous universality tests when combined with future results from the Electron Ion Collider. In A+A collisions measurements with unprecedented precision using deep penetrating probes such as leptons and photons will enable us to probe the whole evolution of the collision.

Poster Session,poster,Extraction of Bottom Production via the Semi-leptonic Decay Channel in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV by the STAR Experiment,"Zhang, Yifei",University of Science and Technology of China,China,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that heavy quarks lose less energy than light quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, recent measurements of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) for open charm mesons at RHIC show results comparable in magnitude to those of light hadrons, suggesting that charm quarks also interact strongly with the QGP medium. This could mean that the charm quark may not be heavy enough to clearly exhibit the mass dependence of parton energy loss in these measurements at RHIC. Thus it is of particular interest to study the bottom quark energy loss in the medium since bottom quarks are about three times heavier than charm quarks.

In this poster, we will present an analysis based on a data-driven method for determining the yields of electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays, respectively, in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The former is estimated from the measured charm hadron yields, and is subtracted from the inclusive heavy-flavor electrons to obtain the latter.

At the STAR experiment, utilizing high-precision secondary vertex reconstruction provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT), $D^{0}$ mesons have been comprehensively studied to investigate the charm quark transport in the QGP. Measurement of $D^{*\pm}$ production is complementary to the $D^{0}$ measurement in studying the medium modification to the open charm meson production. It also provides useful information on feed-down contributions to the $D^{0}$ yields.

In this poster, measurement of $D^{*\pm}$ production at mid-rapidity ($|y|<1$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}$ = 200 GeV is reported. $D^{*\pm}$ are reconstructed via the hadronic decay channel ($D^{*+}\rightarrow D^{0}\pi^{+}$, $D^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}$, and its charge conjugate channel) utilizing the STAR HFT detector. The invariant yields of $D^{*\pm}$ and the ratios of $D^{*\pm}/D^{0}$ yields will be shown as a function of transverse momentum in different centralities.

Poster Session,poster,Extension of the Identity Method to Measurements of Differential Correlation functions,"Pruneau, Claude Andre",Wayne State University (US),United States,"Studies of integral and differential correlation functions of elementary particles produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions provide invaluable information on the particle production dynamics, the collision system evolution,  and might also enable the determination of fundamental properties of the quark matter produced in these collisions. Extensive measurements of general balance functions, in particular, should provide detailed probes of the formation, evolution, and hadronization of the quark matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The difficulty arises, however, that such measurements are particularly statistics hungry and severe particle losses may be incurred experimentally to achieve  high species purity and contamination  free measurements of correlation functions. However, the identity method, invented by Gazdzicki, provides a technique to essentially  recover the full statistics and extend the kinematic range of measurements while providing reliable disambiguation  of particle species. The technique was first proposed for measurements of first and second moments of particle multiplicities (integral correlation functions) with two particle species but successively extended to handle an arbitrary number of species, higher moments, and measurements of moments in the presence of transverse momentum dependent efficiency losses. I present yet another extension of the method towards measurements of differential correlation functions, more specifically for differential measurements  of the normalized two-particle cumulants, $R_2$,  but the method  can be  extended to other types of two-particle correlators or towards multiple-particle correlation functions. The method is developed for an arbitrary  number of particle species  and in the presence of particle losses, as well as multiple sources of particle identification ($dE/dx$, TOF, etc).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Claude Andre', 'last_name': 'Pruneau', 'fullName': 'Pruneau, Claude Andre', 'id': '3513484', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University (US)', 'emailHash': '9fb7df76b8e8f49c5f63429cae1aad8b', 'db_id': 3513484, 'person_id': 3642597}"

Tsukuba,UK,"Recent STAR results on net-proton cumulant ratio $C_{4}/C_{2}=\kappa\sigma^{2}$ show a non-monotonic behavior as a function of beam energy [1], which has been interpreted as a signature of the QCD critical end point. However, all previous STAR results were obtained with a binomial assumption for the efficiency correction. Unfolding of net-proton distributions is necessary in order to correct for non-binomial detector effects [2]. In addition, there are still no established ways for volume fluctuation corrections. Recently another model dependent method [3] has been suggested to eliminate the participant fluctuations. In this poster, we present the results of the unfolding method that attempts to correct for the non-binomial detector efficiencies and apply the new method for volume fluctuation corrections. The differences with respect to the previous results are discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Angular Correlations Study of Identified Hadrons in the STAR Beam Energy Scan Program,"Lipiec, Andrzej",Warsaw University of Technology,Unknown,"The angular correlation function (CF) refers to the correlation of particles in the relative pseudorapidity ($\Delta\eta$) and relative azimuthal angle ($\Delta\phi$). CF is influenced by various physical phenomena such as conservation laws, collective particle flow, resonance decays, final state interactions, or particle production mechanism - e.g., correlation of particles within the single jet. By analysis of long-range correlations (of pairs with $\Delta\eta \geq$1.0) it is possible to access the early stage of the system created during heavy-ion collision and its longitudinal and azimuthal dynamics.

The STAR Beam Energy Scan data allows one to perform a detailed CF analysis to investigate the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. Recently [1] STAR reported an angular correlation measurements of $\pi$-$\pi$, K-K, and p-p pairs with $\Delta \eta \leq$1 in 0-5% central Au+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV. These results show a significant difference between CF of given particle species combinations.

In this poster, we extend this results to $\Delta \eta \leq\;$2, which allows for analysis of long-range correlations of $\pi$-$\pi$, K-K, and p-p pairs. We describe the data by fitting a multi-component function. Such an approach allows for disentanglement of various correlation sources. The study is conducted in nine centrality classes (70-80%, 60-70%, 50-60%, 40-50%, 30-40%, 20-30%, 10-20%, 5-10% and 0-5%) of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ between 7.7 and 200 GeV. The collision energy and centrality dependence of the best fit-to-data function parameters, describing short- and long-range correlations, will be presented.

As these partons traverse the QGP, they lose energy to the medium, an effect called ""jet quenching"".  To answer fundamental questions about parton energy loss and the microscopic nature of the QGP, we need to characterize both the medium induced modification of the jet fragmentation pattern and the correlation of the lost energy with the jet axis.  Observables centered around gamma-jet correlations are especially useful as the photon kinematics are more tightly correlated with the hard scattered parton.

Poster Session,poster,Interference effect between jet-induced flows in dijet events,"Tachibana, Yasuki",Wayne State University,Unknown,"We investigate the hydrodynamic medium response to jets in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) fluid in dijet events, in particular focusing on the interference effect between the flows induced by a back-to-back pair of jets. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets deposit their energy and momentum into the QGP medium fluid via the successive interactions with the medium constituents during their propagation. The deposited energy and momentum are supposed to excite the medium fluid, and induce flows following the jets as hydrodynamic medium responses. The flow induced by the highly quenched jet develops very widely in the QGP fluid, and can affect also the medium response contribution to the structure of the opposite-side jet in dijet events. 

We simulate dijet events in high-energy heavy-ion collisions by employing a coupled jet-fluid model combining jet shower transport equations and hydrodynamic equations with source terms [1]. The jet shower transport equations describe the evolution of the momentum distributions of partons in the jet showers with the medium effects, i.e., collisional energy loss, transverse momentum broadening, and medium-induced radiation. The QGP medium evolution is described by (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms which transfer the energy and momentum deposited by the jet pair to the QGP fluid. We study how the interference effect between the jet-induced flows in dijet events come out in the jet-correlated particle distributions in the final state and their dependence on the event selection and background subtraction method. For the extensive studies, we also study the energy momentum deposition and induced flows by heavy quarks or jets with virtuality-ordered splittings.

how different repulsion between ground state baryons and resonances on

Poster Session,poster,Averaged jet charge as a probe of quark gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions,"Chen, Shi-Yong",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Averaged jet charge characterizes the electric charge distribution inside jets, and provides a powerfull tool to distinguish quark jets from gluon jets. In this talk, we give the first prediction for the medium nodification of averaged jet charge in heavy-ion collision at the LHC energy, where the jet productions in $pp$ collisions are simulated by pythia6+FastJet, and parton energy loss effects in the QGP are calculated with two Monte Carlo codes of jet quenching: PYQUEN and JEWEL. In $pp$ collisions, the value of jet charge for quark jets goes up with increasing jet transverse momentum, while for gluon jets it approximates to zero in the whole range of $p_{T}$  because gluon carries no electric charge. It is shown that the distribution of averaged jet charge is significantly suppressed by initial state nuclear effects due to the participants of neutrons with zero electric charge during nuclear collisions. Considerable enhancement of averaged jet charge in central $PbPb$ collisions relative to  peripheral collisions is observed, since jet quenching effect is more pronounced  in central collisions. In the jet quenching calculations, a fast gluon will lose more energy in the QGP than a fast quark due to its large color-charge($\Delta E_{g}/\Delta E_{q}=C_{A}/C_{F}=9/4$), more quarks with electric charge may survive in central collisions as compared with that in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions. The fraction of quark jet will be increased, which results in the larger value of averaged jet charge in central collisions than that in peripheral reactions. Distinct feature of averaged jet charge between quark and gluon jets, together with the sensitivity of jet charge alternations to flavour dependence of parton energy loss, could be very useful to discriminate the energy loss pattern between quark and gluon jets in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shi-Yong', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Shi-Yong', 'id': '3530965', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '43efbb72d1e9ee7feb7cc6c3b1667211', 'db_id': 3530965, 'person_id': 3643755}"
Poster Session,poster,"Measurements of Open Bottom Hadron Production via Displaced J/psi, D0 and Electrons in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV at STAR","Chen, Xiaolong",USTC / LBNL,USA,"Recent RHIC and LHC results show that the nuclear modification factors of open charm hadrons at high transverse momenta as well as their elliptic flow are similar to those of light flavor hadrons, indicating that charm quarks also interact very strongly with the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). During interactions, charm quarks suffer from substantial energy loss and gain significant elliptic flow. It is then imperative to measure bottom production in heavy-ion collisions to study the mass dependence of parton-medium interactions in the QGP suggested by QCD.

In this talk, we will report on STAR measurements of open bottom hadron production through their displaced decay daughters ($B \rightarrow J/\Psi,~D^{0},~e$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These measurements are made possible with the high-precision vertexing and tracking provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker. With a factor of 2-5 times more data recorded in year 2016, signal precisions of these measurements are greatly improved compared to previous preliminary results. For Non-prompt $D^0$, further improvement is obtained from a successful implementation of a supervised machine learning method in offline reconstruction. Centrality dependence of nuclear modification factors for non-prompt $D^0$ and electrons from bottom hadron decays will be presented. These new results will be compared to those of open charm hadrons at RHIC and those of open charm and bottom hadrons at the LHC as well as to theoretical calculations.

Poster Session,poster,Suppression of resonance production in high multiplicity pp events due to colour reconnection effects in PYTHIA8,"Derradi De Souza, Rafael",University of Campinas UNICAMP (BR),Unknown,"The measurement of short-lived hadronic resonances in high energy collisions has always been considered an important observable to investigate the properties of the systems created in such collisions. In particular, the observed suppression of the measured yields of resonance with respect to non-resonance particles towards central heavy-ion collisions has so far been interpreted as being due to re-scattering of decay daughters in a hadronic phase of the system evolution. However, hints of suppression in the measured resonance to non-resonance particle ratios have also been recently observed for high multiplicity events in collisions of small systems, such as pp and p-Pb. In this work, we explore the effects of colour reconnection (CR) mechanisms, such as the new more QCD based scheme and the rope hadronization approach, in hadronic resonance production in high multiplicity pp collisions using the PTYHIA8 event generator. Our studies have shown that the inclusion of CR leads to a suppression of hadronic resonance production with respect to non-resonance states, observed in the evolution of the ratios of $K^{*}/K$, $\rho/\pi$ and $\eta’/\pi$ as a function of the event activity. These results bring an alternative possible explanation for the phenomenon in small systems collisions. Finally, we discuss other heavy-ion observables that may also be affected by CR, such as those associated with collectivity.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rafael', 'last_name': 'Derradi De Souza', 'fullName': 'Derradi De Souza, Rafael', 'id': '3531132', 'affiliation': 'University of Campinas UNICAMP (BR)', 'emailHash': 'b864caf253c1fe7408907d2fc4f8c274', 'db_id': 3531132, 'person_id': 3645464}"

New TOF detectors for Belle II, BESIII, LHCb, MPD, Panda, and SoLID are in various stages of development and implementation. Heavy ion detector experiments using TOF observe an anomalous early-late asymmetry in the time of flight distribution for particles of a given narrow momentum interval and mass hypothesis. A number of competing explanations have been sought, most of which focus on the pronounced late-side tail in the TOF signal. Some examples include: influence of feeddown descendants, energy losses from multiple scattering, biases from inner-to-outer detector track matching, and biases innate to TOF detector technology. Herein we examine each of these and derive from first principles the ideal TOF distribution and momentum dependent early-late asymmetry. We further conclusively explain its mysterious absence in test beam trial data. This new understanding will refine the standard fit-to-data calibration technique critical for high precision TOF detectors. Furthermore, it will improve the momentum range over which particle separation is possible, the estimates of systematic uncertainties, and detector simulations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Brennan', 'last_name': 'Schaefer', 'fullName': 'Schaefer, Brennan', 'id': '3530799', 'affiliation': 'Oak Ridge National Laboratory -  (US)', 'emailHash': 'e9d0b9826975091d1aba32a714bba74a', 'db_id': 3530799, 'person_id': 3637507}"

Poster Session,poster,Dilepton production and resonance properties within a new hadronic transport approach,"Staudenmaier, Jan","Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies",Unknown,"As electromagnetic probes dileptons open a window to the in-medium properties of vector mesons. In this talk, medium effects to vector mesons are discussed for heavy ion collisions in the low kinetic energy regime of $1 - 3A$ GeV, where the dielectron emission is accessed by the HADES experiment at GSI. A new hadronic transport approach named SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is employed to study dilepton production, which is based on vacuum resonance properties and consistently includes dilepton emissions below the hadronic threshold. The approach is validated by an excellent agreement with experimental data up to system sizes of carbon-carbon collisions. After establishing this well-understood baseline in elementary and small systems, the significance of medium effects is investigated with a coarse-graining approach based on the same hadronic evolution. Interestingly, the effect of explicit in-medium modifications to the vector meson spectral functions is already important for dilepton invariant mass spectra in ArKCl and larger systems, even though the transport approach with vacuum properties reveals similar features due the coupling to baryonic resonance and the intrinsically included collisional broadening. In addition, the validated dilepton production allows to assess the importance of a microscopic evolution of the hadronic stage by studying the non-equilibrium dilepton radiation in late, dilute stages of high-energy heavy ion collisions, i.e. in hybrid approaches.

 helicity amplitudes . For the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, it is 
 shown that -- in the case of the unpolarized electron and positron -- the final
 muons are also unpolarized but their spins are strongly correlated. For the
 final  $(\mu^+ \mu^-)$ system, the structure of triplet states is analyzed and 
 explicit expressions for the components of the spin density matrix and

 of muons have the purely quantum character, since one of the Bell-type 
 incoherence inequalities for the correlation tensor components is always violated.
 In doing so, it is established that the qualitative character of the muon spin 
 correlations does not change when involving the additional contribution of the
 weak interaction of lepton neutral currents through the virtual $Z^0$ boson.
 
   On the other hand, the theoretical investigation of spin structure for the two-photon

Poster Session,poster,Diffusion of conserved charges in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Greiner, Carsten",University of Frankfurt,Unknown,"We present the first calculations of all the diffusion transport coefficients related to the baryon, electric and strangeness charge for a hot and dense hadron resonance gas and for a simplified kinetic model of the quark-gluon plasma[ \[arXiv:1711.08680\]][1]. We demonstrate that the diffusion currents do not only depend on gradients of their corresponding charge density. Instead, there exists coupling between the different charge currents, in such a way that it is possible for density gradients of a given charge to generate dissipative currents of another charge. Within this scheme, the charge diffusion coefficient is best viewed as a matrix, in which the diagonal terms correspond to the usual charge diffusion coefficients, while the off-diagonal terms describe the coupling between the different currents. We find that the baryon diffusion current is strongly affected by baryon charge gradients, but also by its coupling to gradients in strangeness. The electric charge diffusion current is found to be strongly affected by electric and strangeness gradients, whereas strangeness currents depend mostly on strange and baryon gradients.

The calculated diffusion coefficients can be easily included in hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions, and will be particularly important for lower energy collisions such as those that are performed at the RHIC Beam energy scan and that will be performed at NICA or FAIR. We show preliminary hydrodynamic calculations that include the effects of the computed diffusion coefficients.

The cumulants (and cumulant ratios) of the multiplicity distributions for conserved charges, which are linked to susceptibilities and their ratios, are predicted to be sensitive to the growth of fluctuations near the critical point, leading to detectable non-monotonic signatures for the CEP [1]. However, the effects of Finite-Size (FS) and Finite-Time (FT) complicate the search for the CEP, because they nullify the possible non-monotonic patterns, and shift the CEP's location to a so-called pseudo-critical point, different from its genuine location. Alternatively, Finite-Size-Finite-Time scaling (FSFTS) of susceptibilities and susceptibility ratios provide a robust avenue to search for the CEP and to characterize its critical exponents. I will describe the rudiments of FSFTS and present the scaling functions for the inverse compressibility ($\kappa^{-1}$) obtained from both the cumulant ratio $C_1/C_2$) for net-protons, and two-pion HBT radii, measured over a broad range of collision centralities in Au+Au collisions spanning the energy rage $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7 - 200$ GeV.

Poster Session,poster,Recent results on cumulant ratios at nonzero temperature and density from lattice QCD,"Schmidt, Christian",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"We present recent results on the distributions of conserved charge fluctuations. In particular, we discuss ratios of the shape parameters mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the net baryon- number, electric charge and strangeness distributions. For the net baryon-number fluctuations we find – using a next-to-leading order Taylor expansion – that qualitative features of these ratios closely resemble the corresponding experimentally measured cumulants ratios of net proton-number fluctuations for beam energies down to collision energies of 19.6 GeV. We show that the observed difference in cumulant ratios for the mean net baryon-number and the normalized skewness arises naturally in QCD thermodynamics. Moreover, we establish a close relation between skewness and kurtosis ratios, at small values of the baryon chemical potential. In the case of electric charge and strangeness fluctuations we show that these ratios are sensitive to the presence of multiple charged particles.
The calculations are based on lattice QCD simulations with physical quark masses and a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action.

In general, both parton shower effects and saturation effects are responsible for the back-to-back dihadron angular de-correlations. Recent developments have allowed to incorporate the so-called parton shower effect, namely the Sudakov effect, into the small-$x$ formalism [1-3]. This, in particular, will enable us to go beyond the saturation dominant region, and conduct calculations for dihadron correlation in a much wider regime where both saturation effects and Sudakov effects are important.

In this paper [4], we carry out the first detailed numerical study in this regard, and find a very good agreement with previous RHIC $pp$ and $dAu$ data. This study can help us to establish a baseline in $pp$ collisions which contains little saturation effects, and further make predictions for dihadron angular correlations in $pAu$ collisions, which will allow to search for the signal of parton saturation.

In this study, we use the Linear Boltzmann Transport(LBT) model to simulate the propagation of the shower partons generated from pythia or sherpa Monte Carlo simulations in the hot quark gluon plasma.  We first calculate the $p_{T}$ distribution of the 2nd jet in gamma-jet events according to gamma-jet asymmetry. In the gamma-jet correlation, we find that the inclusion of the 2nd jet will lead to the suppression of the angular correlation at large angle in AA collision. For dijet correlation, we investigate the dijet azimuthal correlation in events with 2, 3, 4 energetic jets for different regions of the leading jet $p_{T}$ in both pp and AA collision. We also show the important contribution of the 3rd jet in dijet transverse momentum balance distribution.

The origin of the work lies in two observations concerning particle production at high pT (> 8 GeV/c) in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV. On one hand, within uncertainties the RAA of light and heavy flavoured particles is essentially the same. On the other hand, the identity of the rise observed in the RAA with that observed in the ratios of the multiplicity dependent spectra, in pp collisions, divided by the same pp reference spectrum. We have made a systematic study of available data, fitting the power law function to the high pT spectra in different multiplicity and centrality classes. The comparison of the spectra of pp and Pb-Pb collisions at multiplicities corresponding to the same power law exponent exhibits marked differences at low momenta, namely, an increased contribution of low momentum particles, that could be attributed to the debris of the high momentum jets in Pb-Pb collisions. The claim is supported with studies of leading particle pT production as well as its connection with the event activity and quenching properties. The connection to the respective energy densities will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guy', 'last_name': 'Paic', 'fullName': 'Paic, Guy', 'id': '3530708', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma (MX)', 'emailHash': '90bebb431e8645cf97f2491dd1ae432c', 'db_id': 3530708, 'person_id': 3641686}"
Poster Session,poster,Understanding phenomenological constraints on the bulk viscosity of QCD,"Bass, Steffen A.",Duke University,USA,"The bulk viscosity of QCD is expected to vary considerably with temperature, from very small values at high temperatures to a possible large peak in the confinement region. Heavy ion collisions present a unique opportunity to establish experimental constraints on this transport coefficient, providing guidance to better understand the response of QCD systems to deviations from equilibrium. 

In this work, we undertake a systematic analysis of hadronic observables within a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model of the quark-gluon plasma, and establish a set of measurements that can constrain the temperature dependence of bulk viscosity. We explicitly show the resilience of these constraints to experimental uncertainties. The temperature dependence of shear viscosity is investigated side-by-side with bulk viscosity for completeness.

We highlight the impact of bulk viscosity on the hadronic chemistry. We further look at different models of initial conditions of the plasma to clarify their effect on phenomenological constraints of bulk viscosity. These results are used to reconcile recent investigations of bulk viscosity in heavy ion collisions [1,2].

In particular, we present a hybrid approach with MUSIC hydrodynamics, particlization with improved treatment of resonance masses based on spectral functions, and SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) afterburner. In this work, we focus on low-$p_T$ hadronic observables --- identified hadron $p_T$ spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients. Given that the low-$p_T$ bulk dynamics in hadronic re-scattering is dominated by resonance excitations and decays, it is expected that implementation of mass sampling at the particlization and better treatment of resonances in microscopic transport play important roles in the late stage of heavy ion collisions. This motivates us to compare other hybrid approaches, such as MUSIC+UrQMD, to MUSIC+SMASH hybrid with an emphasis put on the importance of mass sampling at the particlization and effect of hadronic re-scatterings.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sangwook', 'last_name': 'Ryu', 'fullName': 'Ryu, Sangwook', 'id': '3530652', 'affiliation': 'Goethe-Universität Frankfurt (FIAS)', 'emailHash': 'a93abadee47f50aec730a68060ef795a', 'db_id': 3530652, 'person_id': 3643054}"

This dynamics is causal if the characteristic velocities are smaller than the speed of light such that the domain of dependence of a space-time point is within its past light cone. Within the second order theory of Denicol, Niemi, Molnar and Rischke, we obtain a concrete inequality from this constraint and discuss how it can be violated for certain initial conditions sometimes used in phenomenological studies.

of QCD from comparison with ALICE data of Pb+Pb √sNN = 2.76 collisions at the LHC, using our state-of-the-art (3+1)-d relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code [4]. The algorithm for solving the relativistic hydrodynamic equation is based on a Riemann solver with the two shock approximation [1,2] and stable even with small numerical viscosity [1]. We check the energy and momentum conservation in one-dimensional expansion with initial fluctuations of high-energy heavy ion collisions and the correctness of our code in the following test problems; the viscous Bjorken flow for one-dimensional expansion and the Israel-Stewart theory in Gubser flow regime for the three-dimensional calculation [3]. 

Applying the hydrodynamics code to the hybrid model, hydro+UrQMD model, 
we perform comprehensive analyses of ALICE data. Here we use the initial condition, TRENTO and lattice QCD-based equations of state. We find that flow harmonics as a function of transverse momentum Pt is not sensitive to transport coefficients, though centrality dependence of mean Pt and integrated v2 and v3 is sensitive to them. To obtain the detail information of transport coefficients, investigation of rapidity dependence of observables with (3+1)-d hydrodynamic expansion is indispensable. From our numerical computation, we obtain the following temperature dependence of transport coefficients. Finite bulk viscosity is preferable and the bulk viscosity has a peak around the critical temperature. The shear viscosity increases with decreasing temperature in the hadronic phase and takes a minimum value around the critical temperature and increases with temperature in the QGP phase.

Poster Session,poster,Relativistic hydrodynamics of Polarized Matter,"Torrieri, Giorgio","IFGW, Unicamp",Unknown,"The observation of hadronic polarization in the reaction plane in heavy ion collisions has heightened interest in the behavior of relativistic fluids where microscopic degrees of freedom carry spin.
We use Lagrangian Effective Field theory techniques to understand the ideal hydrodynamic limit for such systems.   After discussing the relation between this limit, transport theory, and ideal hydrodynamics we derive the equations of motion for a polarized fluid.  We show that this system will generally require non-dissipative dynamics at higher order in gradient than first order, leading to breakdown of stability and causality.  Thus, such a system necessitates relaxation-type dynamics already in the ideal fluid limit, unlike unpolarized hydrodynamics where the ideal limit is known to be causal.
We discuss this result in light of the conjectured lower limit of viscosity for strongly coupled fluids, and comment on phenomenological applications.

We demonstrate that this framework can be used on an event-by-event basis to propagate the energy momentum tensor from far-from-equilibrium initial state models, e.g. IP-Glasma, to the time $\tau_\text{hydro}$ when the system is well described by relativistic viscous hydrodynamics. We show that with kinetic theory pre-equilibrium, the final hadron multiplicities and radial and elliptic flows become essentially independent of the hydrodynamic initialization time $\tau_\text{hydro}$.

Poster Session,poster,Thermal dilepton radiation at low and intermediate collision energies from a coarse-graining approach,"Seck, Florian",TU Darmstadt,Unknown,"Electromagnetic radiation emanates over the entire course of a heavy-ion collision, decoupling from the matter once produced, thus providing unique information about the interacting QCD medium. Specifically, the yield of low-mass thermal dileptons was identified as a measure of the fireball lifetime, while the slope of intermediate-mass dilepton spectra can serve as a thermometer unaffected by blue-shift effects of collective expansion which distort $p_T$ spectra. Here, we couple in-medium thermal dilepton rates, which reproduce existing data at ultrarelativistic collision energies, with a coarse-graining method of hadronic transport simulations to compute dilepton spectra at lower energies, $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \leq$ 10 GeV, where hydrodynamic simulations may be less reliable. By extracting local temperature, baryon and pion densities the convolution with thermal rates can be readily carried out. Our calculations suggest that also at lower energies the $\rho$-meson melting in a near-thermal source prevails and that the emission duration closely correlates with the build-up of the transverse flow in the fireball. The resulting yields and slopes of the invariant-mass spectra extend previous excitation functions of the fireball lifetimes and temperatures to lower energies. We use this as a baseline to analyze signatures of a putative critical point on dilepton observables, to facilitate its search in future campaigns with the HADES and CBM experiments at GSI/FAIR, as well as in the RHIC beam energy scan phase II  with STAR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Florian', 'last_name': 'Seck', 'fullName': 'Seck, Florian', 'id': '3530792', 'affiliation': 'TU Darmstadt', 'emailHash': 'cb1e8c854b5cdde704e4cb9bb2637839', 'db_id': 3530792, 'person_id': 3647370}"

Poster Session,poster,Light and heavy flavor jet quenching at RHIC and the LHC energies,"Qin, Guang-You",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The study of hard jets and their interactions with the traversed medium provides a very improtant tool to probe the quark-gluon plasma produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In this work [1], we study both light and heavy flavor jet quenching on the same footing utilizing a Boltzmann transport model including both elastic and inelastic parton-medium interactions within perturbative QCD. The dynamical evolution of the QGP medium that hard jets probe is simulated with relativistic hydrodynamics that has been tuned to describe the soft hadron production at RHIC and the LHC. Our numerical results can simultaneously describe the experimental data on both light and heavy flavor hadron suppressions for different centralities at both RHIC and the LHC heavy-ion collisions. Detailed analysis show that the initial parton spectra, the details of the energy loss mechanism, and the shapes of fragmentation functions all play important role in understanding the difference between the nuclear modifications of light and heavy flavor hadrons. The temperature, flavor and energy dependences of the jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ are quantitatively extracted. We further study the correlations between light and heavy flavor hadrons.

Poster Session,poster,Divergence of the gradient and slow-roll expansions in Bjorken and Gubser flow,"Denicol, Gabriel",McGill University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics has played a key role in our understanding of the novel properties of quark-gluon plasma. However, the validity of hydrodynamical models in describing the extreme conditions produced in heavy ion collisions has still not been properly justified theoretically. Even more, the gradient expansion, commonly used to derive hydrodynamics from microscopic theory, has been recently shown to diverge for conformal fluids or relativistic gases undergoing Bjorken flow [1,2], putting under question the definition of hydrodynamics itself. Alternative derivation of the hydrodynamic series have been proposed recently, such as the slow-roll expansion [1], and can be promising candidates to define hydrodynamics.

In this contribution, we present general analytical and semi-analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic attractor of Israel-Stewart theory [2] and kinetic theory for Bjorken and Gubser expanding fluids. We show that the gradient expansion diverges in both cases. For Israel-Stewart theory, we show for the first time that even the slow-roll expansion, a commonly used approach to characterize the attractor, diverges. Finally, we construct the slow-roll expansion for a general flow scenario and find the effective shear viscosity [3] and relaxation time that are able to describe a more general hydrodynamic regime.

Poster Session,poster,Relaxation Time for the Chiral Vortical Effect and Spin Polarization in Strongly Coupled Plasma,"Li , Shiyong",University of Illinois at Chicago,USA,"Anomalous transport phenomena arising from chiral anomaly such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect have recently attracted much attention. One such phenomenon, the Chiral Vortical Effect, that is an induced current along fluid vorticity, is somewhat special because it is related to chiral anomaly on one hand, while on the other hand its microscopic origin is the spin polarization of chiral quarks in the fluid vorticity, whose physics is more general and applicable even for massive spinful particles such as Lambda baryon. In theoretical understanding of recently measured Lambda polarization in off-central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, it is vitally important to know the dynamical time scale of this spin polarization, that is, the relaxation time it takes to achieve the equilibrium with Lambda spins polarized in a finite fluid vorticity. Therefore, by studying the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect in massless chiral limit, we can get a useful proxy for this time scale for Lambda spin polarization.
We first derive the correct Kubo formula for the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect from the energy-momentum and current two point functions, pointing out that some of the previous claims for a zero relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect is due to an incorrect identification of the Kubo formula for the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect. Using our Kubo formula, we compute the correct and finite relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect for the first time in strongly coupled plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shiyong', 'last_name': 'Li ', 'fullName': 'Li , Shiyong', 'id': '3545644', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Chicago', 'emailHash': 'b005ffd278a81432b5f8fc854ef4a7a0', 'db_id': 3545644, 'person_id': 3639026}"
Poster Session,poster,An Experimental Handle on the Magnetic Field from Spectator Protons in A+A Collisions,"Huang, Huan Zhong","Key Laboratory for Nuclear Physics and Ion-Beam Applications (MOE) and Institute of Modern Physics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.",USA,"The chiral magnetic effect (CME) and the chiral magnetic wave (CMW) have been predicted to arise from the coupling of domains with quark chirality imbalances in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the strong magnetic field produced by energetic spectator protons. Searches for these quark chirality effects in nucleus-nucleus collisions have been performed at RHIC and the LHC as major scientific goals. For example, the RHIC 2018 run will be devoted to the isobaric collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr at √s$_{NN}$ = 200 GeV, where one may expect an up-to-20% difference in the experimental observables related to the magnetic-field-induced effects. 
Current data indicate that the experimental sensitivity to the chirality effects also depends on the beam energy and the colliding system size, presumably owing to variations in the magnetic field and/or the size of the QGP droplets. Therefore, another venue to enhance the experimental sensitivity could be Au+Au collisions at lower beam energies. We will demonstrate with the AMPT simulations that the number of net protons (N$_{\mathrm{net-p}}$) at mid-rapidity is anti-correlated with the number of spectator protons, and hence provides an excellent handle on the magnetic field from spectator protons in Au+Au collisions at lower RHIC beam energies. Equipped with the event-shape engineering technique [1], the search for chirality effects by varying N$_{\mathrm{net-p}}$ in Au+Au collisions at lower energies (with √s$_{NN}$ still higher than 10 GeV) will complement the isobaric collision data. The future RHIC Beam Energy Scan II program will facilitate the application of our method and discern the true contribution due to the quark chirality effects.

We have formulated a general theory of thermal fluctuations within causal second-order viscous hydrodynamic evolution of matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The fluctuation is treated perturbatively on top of boost-invariant longitudinal expansion [(0+1)-dim] as well as for realistic (1+1)-dim expansion. A numerical model simulation was developed for hydrodynamic evolution in (1+1)-dim which was tested to reproduce the analytic results for the Riemann solutions of expansion of matter in vacuum at early times, and the Landau-Khalatnikov wave propagation inside the medium for later times. Numerical simulation of thermal noise is performed for various second-order dissipative evolution equations using lattice QCD equation of state. Phenomenological effects of thermal fluctuations for the two-particle rapidity correlations showed that viscous damping of the correlation is at most ~20%.Further, significant damping was found at small rapidity separations when second-order dissipative hydrodynamics was employed instead of first-order Navier-Stokes theory. As compared to the conformal equation of state, the softer lattice QCD EOS causes reduced propagation of the fluctuations and leads to a pronounced peak in 
the rapidity correlations.

Poster Session,poster,Soft-gluon approximation in calculating radiative energy loss of high $p_T$ particles - is it well-founded?,"Blagojevic, Bojana","Institute of Physics Belgrade, University of Belgrade",Unknown,"The soft-gluon approximation, which implies that radiated gluon carries away a small fraction of initial parton's energy, is a commonly used assumption in calculating radiative energy loss of high momentum partons traversing the dense QCD medium, created in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. While soft-gluon approximation is convenient, doubts have been raised over its validity, especially since different theoretical approaches reported significant radiative energy loss of high $p_T$ partons, which implies that this approximation is not applicable in such calculations.

To address this issue, we relaxed the soft-gluon approximation within DGLV formalism [1], and discuss generalizing this relaxation in the dynamical QCD medium. Although the obtained results are quite distinct compared to the soft-gluon case, numerically both cases lead to nearly overlapping predictions for the first order in opacity fractional energy loss. The fractional number of radiated gluons is also barely affected. The effect on these two variables runs in opposite directions, which when combined results in negligible suppression change. Therefore, we unexpectedly conclude that soft-gluon approximation works surprisingly well in energy loss calculations, and that there is no need to go beyond the soft-gluon approximation in energy loss based models of parton suppression.

Poster Session,poster,Extending the Bjorken Formula to Describe Initial Energy Production at Lower Energies,"Lin, Zi-Wei","East Carolina University, Central China Normal University",Unknown,"The Bjorken formula [1] is very useful for estimating the initial energy density in relativistic heavy ion collisions, once an initial time $\tau_0$ is specified. However, it is well known that the formula is only valid at very high energies [2], where $\tau_0$ is much bigger than the time it takes for the two nuclei to cross each other. Therefore, the Bjorken formula cannot be trusted at lower energies, for example, below $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \sim 50$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions. 

Here we extend the Bjorken formula by including the finite crossing time of the two nuclei, which leads to a finite duration time for the initial energy production. We have derived analytical solutions for the energy density as a function of time for several representative duration-time profiles. We also use a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model [3], which treats more realistically the baryon stopping and has been modified to include the finite duration time (as well as the finite longitudinal width) of the initial energy production, and the AMPT results confirm the key features of our analytical solutions. At low energies in comparison with the Bjorken formula, we find [4] that the maximum energy density achieved is much lower while the width of the time evolution of the energy density is much bigger. In addition, it is good to find that the energy density is much less sensitive than the Bjorken formula to the value of the poorly-known formation time $\tau_0$. Furthermore, the extended analytical solutions reduce to the Bjorken formula at high energies. This extension thus provides a general model for the initial energy production of relativistic heavy ion collisions, especially at lower energies such as the RHIC Beam Energy Scan energies.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of field fluctuations on heavy mesons nuclear modification factor at LHC energies,"Sheikh, Ashik Ikbal",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"The aim of the ongoing relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to explore the possible hot and dense deconfined state of QCD matter produced in such high energy collisions, the so called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). High energy partons (gluons, light quarks as well as heavy quarks) are produced in initial partonic sub-processes in the collisions between two heavy nuclei. Heavy quarks are mostly produced at the early stage of the collisions from the initial fusion of the partons which makes them a good probe to characterize the QGP. Immediately after their production, these heavy quarks will travel through the dense QGP medium and will start loosing energy during their path of travel. They lose energy in two different manners,one is by elastic collisions and another is by bremsstrahlung gluon radiations. These energy loss calculations are usually obtained by considering the QGP medium in an average manner and statistical field fluctuations of the QGP medium are ignored. The QGP being a statistical system of mobile color charge particles, one could characterize it by stochastic electromagnetic field fluctuations. The effect of this field fluctuations in the QGP leads to an energy gain of the travelling heavy quarks of all momenta and significant at the lower ones. 

  We have calculated the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$ ) of heavy mesons by considering the collisional and radiative energy loss of heavy quarks along with the energy gain due to field fluctuations. Our results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured $R_{AA}$ of D and B mesons by ALICE and CMS experiments at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ashik Ikbal', 'last_name': 'Sheikh', 'fullName': 'Sheikh, Ashik Ikbal', 'id': '3545877', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': 'ea0798891abbbac4787c45ad804025f1', 'db_id': 3545877, 'person_id': 3645012}"
Poster Session,poster,Study of Quarkonia Production in proton+proton collisions at the LHC and the Role of Multiple Partonic Interaction,"Sahoo, Raghunath",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"In high multiplicity p+p collisions, the Underlying Event observable is of great interest to the scientific community. The Multiple Partonic Interaction (MPI) is one of them, where several inelastic interactions at partonic level occur in a single p+p collision. In general, MPI plays an important role to produce light quarks and gluons. But it is observed that it can also contribute to produce heavy flavor particles like charmonia, when the interaction occurs in a harder scale. This leads to a strong dependence of J/ψ production with charged particle multiplicity. ALICE experiment has observed a monotonic increase of J/ψ with charged particle multiplicity in p+p collisions at √s = 7, 13 TeV in dimuon as well as dielectron channels. But, till now the measurements are not available for all the LHC energies. This forbids one to infer about the energy dependence role of MPI on J/ψ production.

In our current study, we have made an effort to understand the role of MPI on multiplicity and energy dependence production of J/ψ using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) inspired model, PYTHIA8 at different LHC energies of √s = 0.9, 2.76, 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV. J/ψ are reconstructed via dimuon channel at forward rapidities (2.5 < y < 4.0) and the charged particle multiplicity is measured at midrapidity (|y| < 1.0). The effect of Color Reconnection (CR) on the production of J/ψ at the LHC energies at different multiplicity bins is studied. The multiplicity ratio of higher state of charmonia, to J/ψ, i.e. ψ(2S)/J/ψ will be presented as a function of multiplicity at all the LHC energies. We observe the dominance of CR and MPI effects towards high multiplicity events at the LHC energies, showing a threshold of Nch > 20. The present study will help in understanding the charmonia production in p+p collisions at the LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raghunath', 'last_name': 'Sahoo', 'fullName': 'Sahoo, Raghunath', 'id': '3545910', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '5e9ee078c0296b41a7757808274b3c42', 'db_id': 3545910, 'person_id': 3642132}"

We notice that recently $b\bar{b}$ dijet correlations in proton-proton collisions have been measured by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations at the LHC, NLO+PS p+p baseline could give a rather perfect description of the experimental data than PYTHIA. Moreover detailed mechanisms of heavy flavoured jets propagation and energy loss in dense QCD matter are not yet fully investigated.
In this talk, we present the first predictions of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet angular correlations in Pb+Pb collision. In this work, a NLO+PS event generator SHERPA has been employed to give the p+p baseline and events, A Langevin evolution is used to describe the heavy quark evolution ,and the higher-twist approach is implemented to simulate the radiative energy loss of the gluon,heavy and light quarks simultaneously,and the hard-thermal-loop calculation is used to describe the collisional energy loss of light quarks and gluon. We predict  the azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi$ , angular distance $\Delta R$ , and rapidity variables $y_B $ distributions of the normalized $b\bar{b}$ dijet production at the LHC 8.8 TeV. We find the energy loss of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet will suppress and broden the near side(small $\Delta \phi$)peak and also enhance and sharp the away side (near $\Delta \phi=\pi$ ) peak. We have also calculated the distribution of transverse momentum $p_T$ of $b\bar{b}$ dijet, the transverse momentum imbalance $X_j$ of back-to-back $b\bar{b}$ dijet pairs  and the flavour asymmetry $A_b$ of mixed-flavour dijet pairs to gain new insight into heavy flavour dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sa', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Sa', 'id': '3545756', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '2b609468aa2ac6ec877a46a4e4d89f67', 'db_id': 3545756, 'person_id': 3643766}"
Poster Session,poster,Probing the thermal state of the fireball at freezeout via isothermal compressibility and specific heat capacity,"Mukherjee, Maitreyee",Central China Normal University,China,"The thermal state of the fireball at freezeout has been inferred from the mean hadron yields previously. In this study, we go beyond the mean hadron multiplicities and access the variances from multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions that provide us the thermodynamic responses of the fireball at freezeout – namely the isothermal compressibility ($k_T$) and specific heat capacity ($c_v$) that enable us to determine the thermodynamic state of the fireball at freezeout independently of the mean hadron yields. Further, in case the freezeout lies in the critical region of the QCD phase diagram, evidence of criticality could also show up in $k_T$ and $c_V$.

We have for the first time estimated $k_{T}$ of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions for energies from 7.7 GeV to 2.76 TeV, with the help of event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. An estimate of the dynamical fluctuation has been made from the experimental data by subtracting the statistical fluctuation within the approximation of the participant model.  For $c_v$, the experimental data on the event-by-event mean transverse momentum distributions are transformed to distributions of effective temperatures and the dynamical temperature fluctuations are obtained by subtracting the widths of the corresponding mixed event distributions.  We have compared our results with model expectations based on the hadron resonance gas model as well as event generators. The estimation of $k_{T}$ and $c_{v}$ complements our previous understanding of the thermal state of the fireball at freezeout based on mean hadron yields.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maitreyee', 'last_name': 'Mukherjee', 'fullName': 'Mukherjee, Maitreyee', 'id': '3545783', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '9b012a345a24f92cd27d177df00c8e3f', 'db_id': 3545783, 'person_id': 3646670}"
Poster Session,poster,Calculations of coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC,"Zha, Wangmei",USTC/BNL,USA,"The coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions has been studied in detail at RHIC and LHC to probe the gluon distribution in nucleus and to test QED via relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These kind of interactions are traditionally thought to only exist in ultra-peripheral collisions, where there is no hadronic interactions. Recently, a significant excess of $J/\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_T < 0.3$ GeV/c) was observed by the ALICE and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions, which points to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions. Assuming that the coherent photonuclear production is response for the observed $J/\psi$ excess, the coherent two-photon process should be there and contribute to the dilepton production. According to above, STAR made measurements of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production at very low $p_{T}$, and indeed, a significant excess is observed in peripheral collisions.  The survival of photoproduced $J/\psi$ and electron pair merits theoretical investigations, which are currently absent on the market.


In this presentation we report on calculations of coherent photon-nucleus ($\gamma + A \rightarrow J/\psi + A$) and photon-photon ($\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$) interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We also address the questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in hadronic A+A collisions: if the photons is emitted from the whole nucleus, or if only the spectator fragments contribute to the photon emission. Similarly, for photon-nucleus interactions, it is not clear whether the whole nucleus or only spectator fragment act as photon target. The model used to calculate the cross section will be discussed and the expected yield will be compared with experimental results from RHIC and LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wangmei', 'last_name': 'Zha', 'fullName': 'Zha, Wangmei', 'id': '3545790', 'affiliation': 'USTC/BNL', 'emailHash': '6ddbd8df1526daddeb2a40eb0325d8bb', 'db_id': 3545790, 'person_id': 3641326}"
Poster Session,poster,Functional QCD: From Correlators to Thermodynamics,"Cyrol, Anton K.",University of Heidelberg,Unknown,"Functional continuum methods provide ab-initio access to the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics. In particular, they allow accessing non-zero temperatures and densities, making them an ideal tool to access QCD's phase diagram. The functional QCD collaboration [1] aims to map out the phase diagram in a systematic manner. Within the functional renomalization group (FRG) approach, remarkable progress has been achieved over the last few years. 

In this talk I will briefly review results on chiral symmetry breaking and confinement at vanishing and finite temperature [2-5]. A particular challenge within the functional approaches is the extraction of the equation of state from correlation functions. I will report on recent progress and present first results on the trace anomaly as well as the pressure.

In this talk we report the lattice observation of deconfinement in dense matter. The study of the deconfinement transition was conducted within lattice simulation of dense two-color QCD at zero temperature. We reach very large baryon density (up to quark chemical potential $\mu_q > 2000 \mathrm{~MeV}$). In the region $\mu_q\sim 1000 \mathrm{~MeV}$ we observe for the first time the confinement/deconfinement transition which manifests itself in a rising of the Polyakov loop and vanishing of the string tension. After the deconfinement at $\mu_q > 1000 \mathrm{~MeV}$ we observe a monotonous decrease of the spatial string tension which ends up with its vanishing at $\mu_q > 2000 \mathrm{~MeV}$. From this observation we draw the conclusion that the confinement/deconfinement transition at finite density and zero temperature is quite different from that at finite temperature and zero density. Our results indicate that in very dense matter the quark-gluon plasma is similar to a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons without magnetic screening mass in the system, sharply different from a quark-gluon plasma at large temperature. Implications of our results to properties of real QCD are briefly discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andrey', 'last_name': 'Kotov', 'fullName': 'Kotov, Andrey', 'id': '3545803', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'a99aec69f48defd3d6a7fef9cec1af58', 'db_id': 3545803, 'person_id': 3645205}"

It has been shown that a multiphase transport (AMPT) model can naturally reproduce the long-range two-particle correlation in p+Pb collisions and in a good agreement with the experimental data [1]. A new subevent cumulant method is recently developed,  which can significantly reduce the non-flow effects in long-range correlations for small systems [2]. In this study, we use subevent cumulant method to study multi-particle correlations in p+Pb collisions within the AMPT model. The 2nd and 4th order of multi-particle cumulants and multi-particle azimuthal correlations between different flow harmonics, SC(2,3) and SC(2,4), are numerically calculated. Our results show that $v_{2}\{2\}$ is consistent with the experimental data, while $v_{2}\{4\}$ is systematically smaller than the experimental data, which may indicate the collectivity is underestimated by the AMPT model. The SC(2,3) from the traditional cumulant method is negative at high multiplicity, while it is positive at low multiplicity. However, the SC(2,3) from the subevent cumulant methods is negative for all range of multiplicity. The SC(2,4) from the traditional cumulant method is larger than that from subevent cumulant methods. We will discuss the implication of these results,  which help us to understand the origin of collectivity in small systems [3].

The quark sector of the model is tuned to the $\mu_B=0$ lattice QCD data on trace anomaly.

The model predicts three phase transitions - nuclear first-order liquid-gas phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration, and deconfinement transition.
At $\mu_B=0$, good agreement with the corresponding lattice data is obtained.
The deviations from the free hadron gas baseline in the crossover temperature region at $\mu_B=0$ are mainly attributed to the leftover of the liquid-gas transition in nuclear matter, the chiral phase transition determines the baryon fluctuations at much higher $\mu_B$, and at even higher baryon densities the behavior of fluctuations is controlled by deconfinement transition.

Poster Session,poster,An Initial State with local shear and vorticity for peripheral heavy ion collisions,"Magas, Volodymyr",University of Barcelona,Unknown,"More than 15 years ago a longitudinal effective string rope model was proposed [1] to construct nucleus-nucleus collision Initial State (IS) for realistic 3+1D relativistic fluid dynamical models. This model reflected correctly not only the energy-momentum, but also angular momentum conservation, initial shear flow, and local vorticity [2]. Recent experimental and theoretical developments indicate that angular momentum, local vorticity and the subsequent particle polarization is observable and provides valuable information: a significant Λ polarization was detected and analyzed in detail in the RHIC BES program [3]. 

On the other hand, recent developments in parton kinetic and field dominance models provide a rather different initial state configuration, more compact for non-central collisions, see for example [4], what makes us revisit the early IS model [1] in that direction.

We will present a new initial state model for hydrodynamical simulation of relativistic heavy ion collisions, which is based on Bjorken-like solution applied streak by streak in the transverse plane [5]. The proposed model satisfies all the conservation laws including  conservation of a strong initial angular momentum which is present in non-central collisions. As a consequence of this large initial angular momentum we observe the fluid shear in the IS, which leads to large flow vorticity. Another advantage of the proposed model is that the initial state can be given in both [t,x,y,z] and [τ, x, y,η] coordinates.

This indicates that an important piece in our picture of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is still missing. Directed flow is thought to arise from two main mechanisms: the so-called ""tilted"" source and the dipole-like initial density asymmetry. The asymmetric Cu+Au collisions provide a unique possibility to identify the roles of theses two mechanisms.

We present the results of directed flow measurements for charged and identified particles in Cu+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV as a function of centrality, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum.

Poster Session,poster,Medium response to jet energy loss and redistribution of lost energy via the AMPT model,"Luo, Ao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Jet-medium interaction has two important aspects: jet energy loss and the medium response to the lost energy/momentum. The study of jet energy loss has been very successful in the explanation of the suppression of high $p_T$ hadron and jet productions as well as the nuclear modification of dihadron, dijet, photo-jet and hadron-jet correlations. The search for the signal of the medium response to jet transport has been a long-standing topic: how does the lost energy from the jets evolve with the dynamical medium and where does it show up in the final state particle distributions and correlations?

We study the medium response and redistribution of the lost energy from hard jets via the AMPT model. In particular, we study asymmetric dijet events in PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV. We first investigate in detail the contribution from the final charged hadrons carrying different transverse momenta and emitted from different angular directions, the projected transverse momentum $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle$ [1]. It is found that $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle $ in the leading jet direction is mainly contributed by hard hadrons in both peripheral and central PbPb collisions, while the opposite direction in central collisions is dominated by soft hadrons. Our study of the in-cone and out-of-cone contributions to $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle$ shows that these soft hadrons are mostly emitted at large angles away from the dijet axis. These results indicate that in the AMPT model, a large amount of the lost energy from hard jets occurred in the partonic stage is transported by elastic collisions to soft partons at large angles; this is qualitatively consistent with the CMS measurements. To further investigate the signals of the medium response effect and the redistribution of the lost energy at large angles, we also study the jet shape functions with a wide range of $r$ for asymmetric dijet events.

The measurements rely on track segments reconstructed with the Silicon Pixel Detector in the kinematic region $|\eta| < 1.8$. Results are presented for three different event classes: inelastic (INEL), inelastic events with at least one charged particle in the central region $|\eta| < 1$ (INEL > 0), and non-single-diffractive (NSD) events for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 5.02 TeV. The measurements are shown for different multiplicity slices, defined by a forward multiplicity estimator and a central multiplicity estimator, which manifest different physics. To better understand the role of collective effects that have been recently observed in pp collisions, the evolution of the shapes of the pseudorapidity density distributions at very high multiplicities is presented for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV using data collected with high-multiplicity triggers.

Poster Session,poster,Plasmon mass scale in classical nonequilibrium gauge theory in two and three dimensions,"Peuron, Jarkko",University of Jyväskylä,Italy,"The initial stage of a relativistic heavy ion collision is dominated by an overoccupied, strong gluon field, which can be understood in a classical approximation. The physics of equilibration and isotropization of this field is dominated by the plasmon mass scale, which is poorly understood in this very nonequilibrium system. We address this by measuring the plasmon mass scale in two and three dimensional classical Yang-Mills systems numerically. We use three different methods: a Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) expression involving the quasiparticle spectrum constructed from Coulomb gauge field correlators, an effective dispersion relation (DR) and the measurement of oscillations between electric and magnetic energies after introducing a spatially uniform  perturbation to the electric field (UE). We find that the HTL and the UE methods are in rough agreement. The DR method agrees with other methods within a factor of two. We also study the dependence on time and occupation number. We observe that a power law dependence sets in in both cases after an occupation number dependent transient time. We find that in both cases our results are insensitive to the infrared cutoff. In three dimensions we find that the UE and HTL measurements can be brought into agreement when we take the ultraviolet cutoff to zero. However, in two dimensions the results obtained using all three methods seem to increase when we take the ultraviolet cutoff to zero. At late times in three spatial dimensions, the square of the plasmon mass seems to scale as $t^{-2/7}$, which is also predicted by kinetic theory analysis and previous research. In two dimensions the square of the plasmon mass seems to decrease as $t^{-1/3}$ according to HTL method measurement.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jarkko', 'last_name': 'Peuron', 'fullName': 'Peuron, Jarkko', 'id': '3545844', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyväskylä', 'emailHash': '0225cb2dd7994698f2ac0347826bab5a', 'db_id': 3545844, 'person_id': 3640474}"

Poster Session,poster,Equilibration in finite gluon systems,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"The equilibration of a finite Bose system is modelled using a gradient expansion of the collision integral in the bosonic Boltzmann equation that leads to a nonlinear transport equation. Employing a method that had been proposed earlier for the analytical solution of the equilibration problem in a finite fermion system [1], the basic equation for bosons and in particular, gluons, is solved in closed form for constant transport coefficients through a nonlinear transformation.

With initial conditions that are appropriate for the gluon system in a relativistic heavy-ion collision such as Au+Au or Pb+Pb at energies reached at RHIC or LHC, the exact solution is derived. It agrees well with the numerical solution of the nonlinear equation. The analytical expression for the local equilibration time in the thermal tail is compared to the corresponding case for fermions. The method is also applicable to the (nonrelativistic) equilibration of a cold quantum gas.

Due to the nonlinearity of the basic equation, the sharp edges of the initial gluon distribution at Q_s ≈ 1 GeV are continously smeared out and local equilibrium of the gluon distribution with a thermal tail in the ultraviolett region is rapidly attained [2]. Although gluon condensate formation at p=0 is in principle possible, due to inelastic processes and the nonconservation of particle number in relativistic collisions this appears unlikely to occur in heavy-ion collisions.

The thermal equilibration time for gluons turns out to be nine times shorter than the equilibration time for fermions (quarks) as a consequence of the statistical properties of bosons versus fermions [2]. This result can be viewed as one of the main reasons for the very short local equilibration time in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that are dominated by gluons in their initial stage.

Poster Session,poster,An event-shape-engineering method to study charge separation in heavy-ion collisions,"Wang, Gang",UCLA,USA,"Recent measurements of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC have indicated charge-separation signals perpendicular to the reaction plane, and have been related to the chiral magnetic effect (CME) (see a review in Ref [1]). The discovery of this phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions will signify simultaneously three important physics ingredients: the strongest magnetic field ever made by mankind, the chirality imbalance caused by vacuum transition, and the chiral symmetry restoration in the deconfined nuclear matter. However, the correlation signal is contaminated with the background driven by the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of the collision system [2], and an effective approach is needed to remove the flow background from the correlation. 

In this talk, we will disclose a few shortcomings of a previous attempt of the event shape engineering (ESE) based on the ""event-by-event $v_2$"" [3]. We will further present a novel ESE technique [4] utilizing the magnitude of the flow vector to select spherical events in heavy-ion collisions, which leaves the charge separation measurements free of flow contributions. The simplified Monte Carlo simulations and a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) are employed to develop the ESE scheme to reveal the true CME signals from the experimental observation. Caveats regarding artificial effects and extreme conditions in this method will also be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,"""Classicalization"" of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma","Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"Recently there has been rapid progress in understanding in-medium dynamics of a quarkonium based on the framework of open quantum system [1-5]. The stochastic potential model [5] introduces thermal fluctuations on Debye screened potential and hence incorporates wave function decoherence. This model however lacks quantum dissipation, which has so far limited its application to early times and has prevented comparison with experimental measurements. In this contribution, we present two strategies that overcome this limitation:

1. quantum-classical matching
by investigating the localization properties of wave function and in turn of the reduced density matrix, we show, how, at intermediate time scales, one can switch from the quantum dynamics of the stochastic potential model to the classical dynamics of a Langevin equation. It involves matching the Wigner quasi-probability function of the former to the phase space distribution function of the latter. The validity of this matching procedure is discussed.

2. quantum state diffusion
by directly implementing the quantum state diffusion formalism [6] for the Lindblad master equation [1] of a quarkonium, i.e. mapping the Lindblad master equation to a non-linear stochastic Schrödinger equation (NLSSE) for the wave function. This for the first time provides a direct link between QCD and phenomenological models based on non-linear Schrödinger equations. By numerically solving the corresponding NLSSE, we can capture quantum dissipation and thus the thermalization of quarkonia in a quantum mechanical manner. For simplicity, we discuss this formalism for a single heavy quark in the QGP.

Poster Session,poster,Angular correlations between heavy and light jet-particles as a means to study in-medium heavy-quark energy loss,"Rohrmoser, Martin",Jan-Kochanowski University Kielce,Unknown,"Energetic heavy quarks passing through the hot and dense medium of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), represented by the resulting mesons, are viewed as a suitable probe for the interactions inside of the QGP,  in particular the mechanisms of energy loss, as they are less likely to thermalize within the medium and are mostly created at early stages of the medium evolution.
However, models of both, purely collisional energy loss as well as combinations of collisional and radiative energy loss are equally successful for reproducing the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ [1]. In an attempt to discriminate between the two different energy-loss mechanisms,an alternative observable, the angular correlations between two mesons were investigated. Azimuthal correlations between pairs of heavy mesons, like $D$-$\bar{D}$ pairs, allow for distinguishing the energy-loss scenarios [2]. 

We continue these studies by investigating the angular correlations between pairs of heavy and light mesons ($D$ and $\pi$), originating from a heavy quark jet. This is motivated by the fact that the emitted gluon in radiative collisions hadronizes and these hadrons are correlated to the emitting heavy quark.   

We created a Monte-Carlo code for the parton splitting in the vacuum together with an effective medium model. This program represents a consistent framework to study the influences of either collisional or radiative processes on parton propagation, and the resulting two-particle correlations. In order to learn at which stages of their space-time evolution jets are affected the most by interactions with the medium we studied contributions to angular correlations from different jet topologies.

Poster Session,poster,"Spin-offs from the rapid, volume hadronization of QGP applied at other scales for transitions in extreme hot and dense matter","Csernai, Laszlo Pal",University of Bergen,Unknown,"By now there is ample experimental and theoretical evidence that in high energy heavy ion reactions the Quark Gluon Plasma hadronizes in a very rapid transition, where most of the hadronization hypersurface or layer has a time-like normal. Thus the neighboring points of this surface are not causally connected to each other, and so collective pressure driven instabilities cannot develop.  This process is naturally described by relativistic fluid dynamics.

Rapid, simultaneous phase transitions or ignition in most of the volume of the material are important and vital problems in many fields of research and technology. Present laser and nano technology make radiation dominated, relativistic, rapid events possible at larger scales. This enables experimental and theoretical studies of rapid, volume transitions and phase transitions for extreme hot and dense matter.

One example for pico second, laser pulse induced, simultaneous ignition for pellet fusion is presented. Methods taken from nano-plasmonics, will be shown to enable us to achieve this simultaneous ignition, with moderate compression and enhanced light absorption.

We also study the effects of energy loss fluctuations on the $v_n$ cumulants using event-by-event hydrodynamics.

Poster Session,poster,Initial Energy-Momentum Conservation and its Role in Particle Emission in A+A Collisions,"Davis, Nikolaos",Polish Academy of Sciences (PL),Unknown,"Our presentation will be based on our recent paper [1].

We construct a new, simple model of the heavy ion collision, local in the impact parameter plane. This model can be regarded as a new realization of the ``fire-streak'' approach, originally applied to studies of lower energy nucleus-nucleus reactions.

Starting from local energy and momentum conservation, we provide a full description of the centrality dependence of pion rapidity spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV. In particular we also explain the broadening of this distribution when going from central to peripheral collisions.

The results of our calculations are compared to SPS experimental data. We discuss the resulting implications on the role of energy and momentum conservation for the successive stages of the A+A collision, and for the dynamics of subsequent particle production.

A specific space-time picture emerges, where the longitudinal evolution of the system strongly depends on the position in the impact parameter (${b_x}$, ${b_y}$) plane. In non-central collisions we predict the existence of ``streams'' of excited matter moving very close to the spectator system in configuration $(x,y,z)$ space.

This picture is consistent with our earlier findings on the longitudinal evolution of the system as deduced from electromagnetic effects on charged pion directed flow [2], and can provide an explanation for specific low-$p_T$ phenomena seen in the fragmentation region of Pb+Pb collisions which we also address in this talk. We present our conclusions on the link between the initial stage of the A+A collision and the final state observables connected to strong and electromagnetic phenomena.

Poster Session,poster,The thermodynamics of a geometrically confined small system,"Kolbe, Isobel",University of Cape Town (ZA),Unknown,"The emergence of evidence for collectivity and strangeness enhancement in small colliding systems has raised urgent questions surrounding the apparent absence of energy loss among the observables that are traditionally attributed to the presence of a Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions.  However, theoretical difficulties abound in the calculation of any measure of the energy loss, resulting in methods that were highly successful in the heavy ion regime coming up empty handed in the small system arena.  We present a novel approach, generalizing standard thermal field theory and thermodynamic techniques, to probe the thermodynamic behavior of a small system.  We consider first a single free scalar field theory that is geometrically confined.  We investigate the partition function along with the usual thermodynamic quantities, as well as the thermodynamic stability and statistical fluctuations of such a system.  Our results, while still approaching the Stefan-Boltzmann limit for large systems, offer new insights into the thermodynamics of smaller systems and exhibit new, Casimir-like effects, thereby also providing a natural solution to the so-called infra-red Linde problem.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Isobel', 'last_name': 'Kolbe', 'fullName': 'Kolbe, Isobel', 'id': '3545863', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town (ZA)', 'emailHash': '4ca5f7e1c2c5d27078b2c910889f9ce8', 'db_id': 3545863, 'person_id': 3645635}"

In the color string percolation phenomenology the interactions between the strings occur in the initial stage of the collisions. This frame-work naturally predicts the reduction in the charged particle multiplicity and the enhancement of the transverse momentum with respect to the value expected from the number of independent strings. The initial temperature and  energy density are obtained from the data via the color reduction factor $F(\xi)$ and the associated string density parameter $\xi$. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio($\eta/s$), trace anomaly($\Delta$) ,the squared speed of sound ($C_{S}^{2}$), entropy density, bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio($\zeta/s$) are extracted using Color String Percolation Model (CSPM) for STAR data at various RHIC energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV. Results are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations for (2+1) flavour.  The initial temperatures obtained by CSPM are compared with various hadronization and chemical freeze-out temperatures. This analysis shows that the deconfinement to confinement transition possibly takes place between $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 and 19.6 GeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Swatantra', 'last_name': 'Tiwari', 'fullName': 'Tiwari, Swatantra', 'id': '3557471', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Indore', 'emailHash': 'f9771d511482732eb44760001aa31e66', 'db_id': 3557471, 'person_id': 3642169}"

Poster Session,poster,Parameterization of deformed nuclei for Glauber modeling in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Shou, Qi-Ye",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics,Unknown,"The density distributions of large nuclei are typically modeled with a Woods-Saxon distribution characterized by a radius $R_{0}$ and skin depth $a$. Deformation parameters $\beta$ are then introduced to describe non-spherical nuclei using an expansion in spherical harmonics $R_{0}(1+\beta_2Y^0_2+\beta_4Y^0_4)$. But when a nucleus is non-spherical, the $R_{0}$ and $a$ inferred from electron scattering experiments that integrate over all nuclear orientations cannot be used directly as the parameters in the Woods-Saxon distribution. In addition, the $\beta_2$ values typically derived from the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E2)$\uparrow$ are not directly related to the ones used in the spherical harmonic expansion. 

In this talk, I present a method to calculate the $R_0$, $a$, and $\beta_2$ values that when used in a Woods-Saxon distribution, will give results consistent with electron scattering data, and then tabulate such parameters for nuclear species recently used in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, including U, Xe, Ru and Zr. The calculations of the second and third harmonic participant eccentricity ($\varepsilon$) with the new and old parameters are also presented and compared.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of Lambdac/D0 ratio in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Watanabe, Yosuke",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"The ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been optimised for the studies of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. Charm quarks are one of the probes that has been extensively used to elucidate the properties of the QGP. They are dominantly produced at the initial stage of the collisions and experience the whole evolution of the system. 

While most of the charm-hadron measurements in heavy-ion collisions are currently limited to mesons, charm-baryon measurements could provide unique insights into hadronisation processes from the QGP. The baryon-to-meson ratio is expected to be enhanced if charm quarks hadronise via recombination with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. Moreover, in such a recombination picture, the baryon-to-meson ratio could further be enhanced in the presence of diquark bound states in the QGP. Thus, the measurements of charm baryons could shed light on an unexplored aspect of the QGP. 
 
The production of charm baryons has been studied in pp and p-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector. The measurement in Pb--Pb collisions also became possible with the significantly improved statistics of LHC Run-2 compared to LHC Run-1.

Using the state-of-the-art D and B mesons modular simulation code (the so-called ""DAB-Mod""), updated recently with heavy-light quark coalescence, we perform a systematic comparision of different transport equations, including a few energy loss models - with and without energy loss fluctuations - and a relativistic Langevin model with different drag parametrisations. We present the resulting D and B mesons $R_{AA}$, $v_2$, $v_3$ and $v_4$ as well as their multiparticle cumulants, in Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV and Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV, and compare them to the latest experimental data. We also study the linearity of the resulting heavy meson and soft hadron flow correlations, as new experimental observables that could provide greater insight into flow fluctuations, and compare for the first time our predictions with ALICE preliminary measurements of D meson $v_2$ vs $q_2$ in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV [3].

In particular, dijet measurements in pPb collisions have been shown to be one of the most important tools for constraining the gluon nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large Bjorken-x. Dijet production in pp and pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of- mass energy of 5.02 TeV is reported with the data samples collected with the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet pseudorapidity distributions are measured as a function of dijet average transverse momentum in order to study the nuclear modifications of PDFs at various factorization scales. The final results from pp and pPb data samples are compared with next-to-leading- order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear PDFs. A significant modification of dijet pseudorapidity distributions in pPb collisions with respect to the measured pp reference is observed which indicates that the gluon PDF in lead ions is modified and the results are incompatible with predictions with DSSZ PDF without gluon EMC effects. Photo-nuclear jets are also measured in pp and pPb collision systems. The yield and angular correlation of low-pT jets at forward rapidity, $5.0<|\eta|<6.5$, are studied using the CASTOR calorimeter, which is sensitive to PDFs at low values of $x$ and $Q^2$. The prospects of future measurements of forward and ultra-peripheral jets in various collision systems as well as dijet production in pPb at 8.16 TeV and in Run III will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Tapia Takaki', 'fullName': 'Tapia Takaki, Daniel', 'id': '3597696', 'affiliation': 'University of Kansas', 'emailHash': '116242602be4136ec2884f90bd7999cf', 'db_id': 3597696, 'person_id': 3781493}"

For that, we have first visited the anisotropic corrections to the retarded, advanced and symmetric propagators through their self-energies in the hard-loop resummation technique and apply these results to calculate the medium corrections to the perturbative and nonperturbative term of the Cornell potential. The flavor dependence of the binding energies of the heavy quarkonia states and the dissociation temperature for isotropic as well as anisotropic case  have been obtained by employing the Debye mass for pure gluonic and full QCD case, which is computed by  employing the quasi-particle picture. Finally we observe that overall the anisotropy makes the dissociation temperatures higher, compared to isotropic medium. By using these dissociation temperatures as an input we further explore the sensitivity of prompt and sequential suppression of these states to the shear viscosity-to-entropy density ratio, η/s from perturbative QCD and AdS/CFT predictions.

Poster Session,poster,Contrasting freezeout schemes in large versus small systems,"Mohanty, Bedangadas",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN),India,"Freezeout in relativistic collisions occurs as a result of competition between interaction of the fireball constituents and fireball expansion. The magnitude of interaction of the fireball constituents is expected to go down as we go from nucleus-nucleus (A-A) to proton-nucleus (p-A) to proton-proton (pp) collisions which should show up in the thermal model fits of the hadron yields. However, on the contrary, it has been found that within the unified freezeout scheme (1CFO), the fits to hadron yields are insensitive to system size. In this talk we extend the 1CFO scheme to multiple freezeout with early freezeout of strangeness (2CFO) and analyse the system size dependence of the freezeout scheme. We find unlike 1CFO that is blind to system size, 2CFO fits clearly distinguish between large and small system sizes.

We discuss the freezeout conditions in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies by analysing the data on hadron yields and transverse momentum spectra. We have studied three different schemes of freezeout, i) 1CFO, ii) strange hadrons freeze out along with non-strange with an additional strangeness undersaturation factor $\gamma_{S}$ which accounts for the non-equilibrium production of strangeness (1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$), and iii) 2CFO. A comparison of the fit to data suggests that different freezeout schemes are preferred for different collision systems. For small systems (pp and p--Pb) and peripheral Pb--Pb, data prefer 1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$ where $\gamma_{S}$ starts from ~0.8 for pp and reaches close to unity for central p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb. For Pb-Pb, 2CFO describes data better than 1CFO and 1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bedangadas', 'last_name': 'Mohanty', 'fullName': 'Mohanty, Bedangadas', 'id': '3564082', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN)', 'emailHash': 'c29d717a3abe3e9c9082324579e1f8fe', 'db_id': 3564082, 'person_id': 3642323}"

High-intensity heavy-ion beams delivered by the SIS100 accelerator (FAIR Phase 1) will be used to explore the QCD phase diagram in the region of neutron-star core baryon-densities. Interaction rates of up to 10 MHz on a fixed target will enable measurements at an unprecedented level of precision and thereby allow access to rare probes like, e.g., multi-strange hyperons and hyper-nuclei. In-medium mass distributions of vector mesons can be measured via lepton pairs, and excitation functions of various observables will serve as sensitive probes for phase transitions. 

After an introduction into the physics program of CBM, this talk will focus on the instrumentation of the experiment. Suiting the conducted collision rates, the CBM detectors will be built in a fast and radiation-hard design. The self-triggered and free-streaming read-out concept will be presented and the online event selection on a high-performance computing cluster will be covered. As examples, detector characteristics and recent test beam results will be discussed for the Silicon Tracking System (STS), for the Muon Chambers (MuCh) and for the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD). An outlook on the status of the next major step of system integration, namely miniCBM in FAIR Phase 0, will be given.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Philipp', 'last_name': 'Kahler', 'fullName': 'Kahler, Philipp', 'id': '3528498', 'affiliation': 'Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster (DE)', 'emailHash': '2f82009ec25a3576a16c2bcea7331efb', 'db_id': 3528498, 'person_id': 3647444}"
Poster Session,poster,The Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment at FAIR,"Heuser, Johann",GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE),Germany,"In the CBM experiment at FAIR, the Silicon Tracking System is the central detector for charged-particle identification and momentum measurement. Its key performance requirements are (a) pile-up free track measurement in collision rates between 0.1 and 10 MHz, (b) momentum resolution in a 1 Tm dipole magnetic field of better than 2%, and (c) capabilities for the identification of particle decays, e.g. such with strangeness content. 

The STS comprises 8 tracking stations equipped with double-sided silicon microstrip sensors. Two million channels are read out with self-triggering electronics, matching the data streaming and on-line event analysis concept applied throughout the experiment. The detector’s functional building block is a module consisting of a sensor, microcables and two front-end electronics boards. The modules are mounted on carbon fiber support ladders and further to mechanical frames. The microstrip sensors provide double-sided segmentation at a strip pitch of 58 $\mu$m and 7.5 degree stereo angle, have integrated AC signal coupling and second-metal routing lines. Ultra-thin microcables with up to 60 cm length transfer the sensor signals to the electronics located at the periphery of the detector. The custom-developed 128-channel read-out ASIC “STS-XYTER” has a self-triggering architecture that delivers time and amplitude information per channel. The detector will be operated at below −5 $^\circ$C within a thermal enclosure of about 2 m$^3$ volume so that the sensors’ leakage currents are kept low and the detector remains operational up to an integrated particle fluence of 10$^{14}$ n/cm$^{2}$ (1 MeV equivalent). The front-end, data aggregation and powering electronics will dissipate about 40 kW which is planned to be taken out of the system with a bi-phase CO$_2$ evaporative cooling.  

The presentation will discuss the development status of the STS components and system integration and will give an outlook on the beginning detector construction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Johann', 'last_name': 'Heuser', 'fullName': 'Heuser, Johann', 'id': '3573956', 'affiliation': 'GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE)', 'emailHash': 'd421fdcfdcd3ebbaf7b047d17e487b84', 'db_id': 3573956, 'person_id': 3642691}"
Open heavy flavour,parallel,Measurements of Open Charm and Bottom Production in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV with the STAR Experiment at RHIC,"Radhakrishnan, Sooraj Krishnan",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,USA,"Heavy flavor quarks are unique tools for studying the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy nuclear collisions.

With the high statistics data collected in 2016 and the use of supervised machine learning methods for topological reconstruction of charm hadrons, the $\Lambda^{\pm}_{c}$ and $D^{\pm}_{s}$ signal significances are improved significantly. This allows us to study the $p_T$ and centrality dependences of their production. We will also report on $D^{*\pm}$, $D^{\pm}$ and $D^0$  spectra measured in various centralities and the total charm quark cross section extracted from these extensive measurements as well. In addition, we will present the nuclear modification factors for daughters from decays of bottom hadrons and compare them to those for charm hadrons as well as to theoretical calculations.

Poster Session,poster,Kinetic equations and anisotropic hydrodynamics for quark and gluon fluids,"Maksymiuk, Ewa",Jan Kochanowski University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics is one of the fundamental tools used to interpret the data measured in heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and the LHC. Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing physical observables, there exist still theoretical problems that may question validity of this approach for description of heavy-ion collisions. The main source of the problems are large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion which produce very large anisotropic pressure corrections to local equilibrium. One way to avoid this problem is the use of anisotropic hydrodynamics, a framework where large pressure corrections are taken into accound already in the leading order of the hydrodynamic expansion [1-4].

We have recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics description to the case of a non-conformal mixture of quark and gluon fluids studied in a one-dimensional and boost-invariant setup with quantum statistics effects included. We compared the predictions of the coupled kinetic equations treated in the relaxation time approximation with anisotropic hydrodynamics results, founding a very good agreement [5]. 

Our numerical results also illustrate how a non-equlibrium mixture approaches hydrodynamic regime described by the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate forms of the kinetic coefficients. The numerical studies of the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse pressures show, to a good approximation, that it depends on the ratio of the relaxation and proper times only. This behaviour is connected with the existence of an attractor for conformal systems [6].

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Charmonium photoproduction in ultraperipheral and peripheral Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Mayer, Christoph",Polish Academy of Sciences (PL),Unknown,"The electromagnetic field of relativistic heavy ions can be described by a flux of virtual photons. In ultraperipheral collisions (UPC), where the impact parameter is larger than the sum of nuclei radii, the interaction of these photons with the nucleus can provide insight into its structure and allow us to probe nuclear shadowing via photoproduction of charmonia.

Extensive efforts on this subject have been made by the ALICE collaboration and led to published measurements of J/Psi and Psi(2S) photoproduction in LHC Run 1 at forward (J/Psi) and at mid-rapidity. In addition, ALICE has reported a large excess of J/Psi at very low transverse momentum in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions, which is suggestive of coherent J/Psi photoproduction in collisions with nuclear overlap.

A substantially larger data set was recorded in LHC Run 2, allowing differential measurements in rapidity and in transverse momentum. In particular, the increased energy in Run 2 means that the Bjorken-x value probed in Pb-Pb UPC at midrapidity decreases from 10^-3 to 5*10^-4, and in collisions with nuclear overlap the measurement of the  coherent J/Psi component becomes sensitive to its polarization and to the shape of its transverse momentum spectrum. At forward rapidity, the Run-2 dataset extends the measurement of photoproduced J/Psi beyond 50% in centrality, imposing strong constraints on initial-state models.

In this talk we will present the latest results on charmonium production in UPCs, final results on the J/Psi coherent photoproduction cross-section in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with nuclear overlap at mid rapidity and new results at forward rapidity in the same system. The discussion will include comparisons to the ultraperipheral measurements and to theoretical model calculations. Perspectives for these measurements in LHC Run-3 and Run-4 will also be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christoph', 'last_name': 'Mayer', 'fullName': 'Mayer, Christoph', 'id': '3553705', 'affiliation': 'Polish Academy of Sciences (PL)', 'emailHash': 'd1ff151bf7367a945b8610a1833b2ae2', 'db_id': 3553705, 'person_id': 3737625}"

The measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) at low $p_{\rm T}$ can give insight into the participation of the heavy quarks to the collective expansion of the system and their thermalization in the medium. These two observables can also help in understanding possible modifications of heavy-quark hadronisation in the medium. In particular, the role of the recombination mechanism can be studied for charm via the comparison of D mesons without strange-quark content with D$^+_{\rm s}$ and charm baryons.
 
Measurements of charm-baryon production in pp and p-Pb collisions are also essential to establish a baseline for Pb--Pb collisions. The measurements in pp collisions provide critical tests of models of charm hadronisation in vacuum and the measurements in p-Pb collisions are useful to study cold nuclear matter effects.
 
In this talk, the latest results on $p_{\rm T}$-differential $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of D mesons measured at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE will 
be presented. New results on the D-meson $v_2$ with the Event-Shape Engineering technique in Pb-Pb collisions will be also discussed. The $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential cross section of the $\mathrm{\Xi_c^0}$ baryon in pp collisions and the $\Lambda_{c}^+$ baryon in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented. Finally, the $\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$ production in Pb-Pb collisions will be shown.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonium production in p-A collisions with ALICE,"Paul, Biswarup",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),India,"The study of quarkonium production in proton-nucleus collisions is an important tool to investigate cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects. Mechanisms such as the modification of the parton distribution functions in nuclei, the presence of a color glass condensate or coherent energy loss of the $c\overline{c}$ pair in the medium have been employed to describe J/$\psi$ production in proton-nucleus collisions at LHC energies. In addition, final state mechanisms, possibly related to the presence of a dense medium, are required to explain the stronger suppression observed for the loosely bound $\psi$(2S) state.

ALICE has measured quarkonium production in p-Pb collisions at backward ($-$4.46 $<$ $y_{\rm cms}$ $<$ $-$2.96), mid ($-$1.37 $<$ $y_{\rm cms}$ $<$ 0.43) and forward (2.03 $<$ $y_{\rm cms}$ $<$ 3.53) rapidity down to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$).

Their production cross section and geometrical profile in elementary pp collisions is precisely calculable within the framework of perturbative QCD (pQCD). Hence, any modification of its production observed in heavy-ion collisions compared to an incoherent sum of 
individual pp collisions could be attributed to in-medium effects. Such modifications, called jet quenching, have been measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions both at RHIC and at the LHC, and they were interpreted as partonic energy loss in the QGP.

In this contribution, the measurements of inclusive charged jet spectra for jet resolution R = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6 in pp and R = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. The nuclear modification factors in different centrality and R bins, and comparisons to the results at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and pQCD based Monte Carlo simulations will be presented. This allows to explore the radial energy profile of jets via measurements of jet yield ratios in different resolution parameter R in an IR-safe fashion.

The results of jet-hadron correlation measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV for charged jets and fully reconstructed jets will also be presented. The associated hadron yields of inclusive and recoil jets were measured. Jet and associated hadron correlation widths have also been measured to constrain possible modifications of the jet shape. The measurements are compared to the baseline constructed from pp data, which is embedded into Pb-Pb data. Comparison to model predictions will also be shown. To study the influence of the large combinatorial background in Pb-Pb collisions, as well the jets surface bias, the measurement has been performed

Based on a Yang-Mills flux-tube initial state and a high-resolution, (3+1)D particle-in-cell relativistic (PICR) hydrodynamics simulation, we numerically obtain the polarization vector for $\Lambda$ hyperons at NICA and FAIR energies, and find that the $y$ component of the polarization vector is dominant, while $x$ and $z$ components are anti-symmetric in the transverse momentum space, implying a vanishing contribution to the global polarization (at collider frame). Besides, we analyze the dependence of $\Lambda$ polarization effect on centrality, energy and freeze-out time, in our model. The linear dependence of $\Lambda$ polarization on impact parameter reveals that the polarization stems from the initial orbital angular momentum; the polarization effect is found to decrease with increasing energy, which is in line with the recent results from RHIC BES program, and is attributed to the more intensive thermal motion of particles at higher energies. The time evolution of the $\Lambda$ polarization in our calculation agrees with the time evolution of vorticity predicted previously, and indicates the limit of applicability of hydrodynamic model at late stages of the expansion.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Global Polarization of Lambda Hyperons in Au+Au Collisions at 200 GeV from STAR,"Niida, Takafumi",Wayne State University,United States,"The matter created in non-central heavy-ion collisions is expected to possess a significant fraction of the initial angular momentum carried by the two colliding nuclei.  This angular momentum can lead to vorticity of the system and be partially transferred to the spin of produced particles due to the spin-orbit coupling, leading to the phenomenon of global polarization. The STAR Collaboration observed finite signals in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-39 GeV, indicating non-zero vorticity of the system, where the polarization decreases with increasing energy. The energy dependence can be understood by a shear flow structure in the initial state and/or the initial tilt of the source in combination with baryon transparency. Such a tilt and vorticity are closely related to the directed flow, elliptic flow, and the chiral anomalous phenomena. According to model calculations, the vorticity is expected to have a strong dependence on the hyperon emission angle relative to the reaction plane, but the models differ in their predictions. More precise and detailed experimental results are needed for further understanding of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions. 

We present new results on the global polarization of Lambda hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Recent high-statistics data by a factor of hundred larger compared to previous results allow one to study differential dependencies of the polarization on the collision centrality, hyperon's transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and emission angle relative to the reaction plane. The polarization dependence on the event-by-event charge asymmetry is presented and its possible relation to the axial current induced by the initial magnetic field is discussed.

Finite azimuthal correlator ($\Delta\gamma$) signals have been measured in experiments, consistent with the CME, but contaminated by a major elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) induced background. The isobaric $_{44}^{96}$Ru+$_{44}^{96}$Ru and $_{40}^{96}$Zr+$_{40}^{96}$Zr collisions have been proposed and planned at RHIC in 2018 to search for the CME with their expected 15% signal difference and almost identical backgrounds. In this talk we will show, however, that these expectations may not hold as originally anticipated due to large uncertainties in the isobaric nuclear structures [1]. We demonstrate this using Woods-Saxon densities and the proton and neutron densities calculated by the density functional theory and the nuclear shell model. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to gauge background and possible CME contributions in the same system, intrinsically better than the isobaric collisions of two different systems [2]. The new method is based on the opposite behaviors in the fluctuations of the magnetic field and $v_{2}$ in a single nucleus-nucleus collision, thus bears minimal theoretical and experimental uncertainties. We illustrate the method with Monte Carlo Glauber and AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) simulations.

The invariant mass method identifies the resonance background contributions, coupled with the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), to the charge correlator CME observable ($\Delta\gamma$). At high mass ($m_{inv}>1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$) where resonance contribution is small, $\Delta\gamma$ is found to be consistent with zero within uncertainty. In the low mass region ($m_{inv}<1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$), resonance peaks are observed in $\Delta\gamma$ as function of $m_{inv}$. A two-component model fit is devised to extract the CME signal, assumed smooth in $m_{inv}$.

In the comparative method, the $\psi_{\rm RP}$ is assessed by spectator neutrons measured by the ZDC, and the $\psi_{\rm PP}$ by the 2nd harmonic event plane measured by TPC. The $v_{2}$ is stronger along $\psi_{\rm PP}$ and weaker along $\psi_{\rm RP}$; in contrast, the magnetic field, being from spectator protons, is weaker along $\psi_{\rm PP}$ and stronger along $\psi_{\rm RP}$. As a result the $\Delta\gamma$ measured with respect to $\psi_{\rm RP}$ and $\psi_{\rm PP}$ contain different amounts of CME and background, and can thus determine these two contributions. We report the results from this determination.

We show how these corrections can be obtained in a systematic way by performing a perturbative expansion around the homogeneous global equilibrium condition as long as the ratio between acceleration, vorticity and temperature are small. The relevant coefficients can be expressed in terms of Euclidean correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the Lorentz group.

We also consider massless fermions with net chirality enforcing a thermal equilibrium with a conserved axial charge. We show that parity-odd collective behavior induced by the interplay between vorticity and chirality, like for instance the Chiral Vortical effect, can be systematically derived within this thermal equilibrium approach.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,A novel invariant mass method to isolate resonance backgrounds from the chiral magnetic effect,"Wang, Fuqiang",Purdue University & Huzhou University,USA & China,"The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) refers to charge separation along a strong magnetic field, due to topological charge fluctuations in QCD. Charge correlation ($\Delta\gamma$) signals consistent with CME have been first observed almost a decade ago. It has also been known since then that the $\Delta\gamma$ was contaminated by a major background from resonance decays coupled with the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$). The invariant mass ($m_{inv}$) dependence of the $\Delta\gamma$ has, rather surprisingly, not been examined until recently [1]. 

In this talk, we propose differential $\Delta\gamma$ measurements as function of $m_{inv}$. By restricting to high $m_{inv}$, e.g. above 2 GeV/$c^{2}$, one may extract resonance-free CME signal where particle transverse momenta are still relatively low ($\sim$1.2 GeV/$c$). In the low $m_{inv}$ region, the backgrounds show resonance peaks and the CME signal is presumably smooth in $m_{inv}$. These different behaviors can be exploited by a two-component model to extract the CME signal at low $m_{inv}$. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel method by using the AMPT and toy-model Monte-Carlo simulations. The power of our method on the upcoming isobaric collisions at RHIC will also be discussed.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Non-Equilibrium Quantum Transport of Chiral Fluids from Kinetic Theory,"Yang, Di-Lun",RIKEN,Unknown,"The chiral kinetic theory (CKT) is a useful tool to investigate anomalous transport pertinent to quantum anomalies in and out of equilibrium for weyl-fermion systems, which has been widely applied to study chiral magnetic/vortical effects (CME/CVE) in heavy ion collisions (HIC). However, there exist some fundamental issues such as Lorentz covariance and systematic inclusion of collisions in CKT. Such issues have been recently addressed via phenomenological approaches. Nevertheless, a first-principle derivation based on quantum field theories (QFT) is desired. 
In this talk, we introduce the QFT derivation of CKT from the Wigner-function approach, which consistently manifests side jumps and non-scalar distribution functions associated with Lorentz covariance and incorporates both background fields and collisions. Moreover, we implement such a formalism to investigate second-order responses of chiral fluids near local equilibrium. Such non-equilibrium anomalous transport is dissipative and affected by interactions. For the study of anomalous transport in closed systems preserving energy-momentum conservation such as quark gluon plasmas, contributions from both quantum corrections in anomalous hydrodynamic equations of motion and those from the CKT and Wigner functions are considered under the relaxation-time (RT) approximation. In the inviscid case, we obtain anomalous charge Hall currents engendered by background electric fields and temperature/chemical-potential gradients. Furthermore, CME/CVE currents receive viscous corrections as non-equilibrium modifications stemming from the interplay between side jumps, magnetic-moment coupling, and chiral anomaly. Our formalism and findings could provide a practical guideline and insights for future simulations of anomalous effects in HIC.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Fluid dynamics of out of equilibrium boost invariant plasmas,"Yan, Li",McGill University,Unknown,"We establish a set of equations for moments of the distribution function. On the one hand, these equations generalize the fluid dynamics to the out-of-equilibrium evolution of boost invariant plasmas. On the other hand, they systematically generalize the theoretical framework of viscous hydrodynamics to arbitrary orders. These moments quantify details of the momentum anisotropies of out-of-eqilibrium phase space distributions. The evolution of these moments measures the evolution of systems towards thermalization to a finer level, beyond the commonly used ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressures. In the hydrodynamical regime, these moments are found to correspond to viscous corrections. In the relaxation time approximations, these moments obey a coupled set of equations that can be truncated order-by-order. Truncations at the lowest orders give rise to the exact form of the second order and third order viscous hydrodynamic equations of motion for the Bjorken flow. Solving the equations of the moments, we are able to identify an attractor solution that controls a transition from a free streaming fixed point to a hydrodynamic fixed point. In particular, this attractor solution provides a renormalization of the effective value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, η/s, taking into account off-equilibrium effects.

The high-statistics Pb+Pb sample allows for a detailed study of the azimuthal anisotropy of produced particles. This should improve the understanding of initial conditions of nuclear collisions, hydrodynamical behavior of quark-gluon plasma and parton energy loss. New ATLAS measurements of differential and global Fourier harmonics of charged particles ($v_n$) in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and 5.44 TeV Xe+Xe collisions in a wide range of transverse momenta, pseudorapidity ($|\eta|<2.5$) and collision centrality are presented. The higher order harmonics, sensitive to fluctuations in the initial state, are measured up to $n=7$ using the two-particle correlation, cumulant and scalar product methods. The dynamic properties of QGP are studied using a recently-proposed modified Pearson's correlation coefficient, $\rho(v_n^2,p_\mathrm{T})$, between the eventwise mean transverse momentum and the magnitude of the flow vector in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and $p$+Pb collisions. Several important observations are made. The elliptic and triangular flow harmonics show an interesting universal $p_\mathrm{T}$-scaling. A linear correlation between the $v_2$ and $v_3$ coefficients at low and high $p_\mathrm{T}$ ranges is observed and quantified. The Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho(v_2^2)$ is found to be negative in peripheral and positive in central Pb+Pb collisions.

We compare calculations of v_n’s from viscous fluid dynamics and from kinetic transport which start both from the same initial conditions and which implement the same matter properties. We observe that both approaches lead to parametrically different eta/s-dependencies of the elliptic anisotropy v_2, and they may thus lead to quantitatively different results for the phenomenologically inferred value of eta/s. The parametric differences can be traced to the boost-invariant longitudinal expansion of pA and AA collisions which induces in fluid dynamic results of the eta/s-dependence of v2 a dominant sensitivity on the initial conditions.

Collective dynamics,parallel,SMASH - A new hadronic transport approach,"Petersen, Hannah",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Microscopic transport approaches are the tool to describe the non-equilibrium evolution in low energy collisions as well as in the late dilute stages of high energy collisions. In this talk, a newly developed hadronic transport approach, SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is introduced. After explaining all the components of this approach, e.g. initial conditions and resonance properties, the approach is validated by a comparison to an analytic solution of the Boltzmann equation. Light and strange particle production and collective flow are compared to experimental data from elementary and nucleus-nucleus collisions in the low energy regime accessible at GSI. The implications of this new approach for dilepton production are discussed including an outlook on the non-equilibrium hadronic production of electromagnetic probes at high beam energies at RHIC and LHC. In addition, the impact of resonance properties on transport coefficients of hadronic matter is pointed out. A detailed understanding of a hadron gas with vacuum properties is required to establish the baseline for the exploration of the transition to the quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions at high net baryon densities.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,A Quasiparticle Transport Explanation for Collectivity in the Smallest of Collision Systems ($p+p$ and $e^+e^-$),"Nagle, James Lawrence",University of Colorado Boulder,USA,"Experimental evidence suggests that collectivity in asymmetric small systems ($p$, $d$, $^{3}$He+A) is directly related to the initial collision geometry. Therefore, a compelling question is whether the same argument can be extended to p+p, and even $e^+e^-$ collisions. We have modified A-Multiphase-Transport-Model (AMPT) to include the constituent quark structure of the proton.   We find with very modest parton-parton cross sections a good description of the triangular and elliptic flow coefficients measured by ATLAS and CMS in p+p collisions, as a function of multiplicity and transverse momentum. We assess the non-flow separation techniques used by these experiments, by implementing their exact methods and comparing the result with the true flow relative to initial geometry in the model. The default AMPT model imposes formation times for partons which are much shorter than their respective de Broglie wavelength, at odds with a central assumption of semi-classical kinetic theory. This challenges the idea of modeling the QGP as well-defined quasi-particles undergoing Boltzmann evolution. We explore the impact on collectivity of enforcing a minimum de Broglie wavelength criterion, and find that it is significant for these smallest of systems. Lastly, we explore the minimal requirements for collectivity within this transport framework to determine whether the multiplicity and geometry of $e^+e^-$ collisions is sufficient to generate experimentally verifiable signals.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'James Lawrence', 'last_name': 'Nagle', 'fullName': 'Nagle, James Lawrence', 'id': '3715137', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'emailHash': '9a55bbf2d0bb280782dfdac3249dfdc0', 'db_id': 3715137, 'person_id': 3890112}"

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Correlated gluonic hot spots meet symmetric cumulants data at LHC energies,"Soto Ontoso, Alba",UGR/FIAS,Unknown,"The relevance of subnucleonic degrees of freedom and their fluctuations in the description of multiple experimental observations in small collision systems (flow harmonics, diffractive phenomena, hollowness effect...) has been recently established.
A representative example is the first measurement of symmetric cumulants, SC(n,m), performed by the CMS Collaboration in the three collision systems available at the LHC (p+p,p+Pb,Pb+Pb) [1]. In particular, SC(2,3), that provides a direct access to initial state fluctuations, shows a sign change with increasing centrality in p+p resembling the behavior of p+Pb and Pb+Pb interactions. This fact constitutes a powerful and stringent constraint on any realistic initial state model. We present a systematic study on the influence of spatial correlations between the proton constituents, in our case gluonic hot spots, their size and their number on SC(2,3) within a Monte Carlo Glauber framework [2]. When modeling the proton as composed by 3 gluonic hot spots, the most common assumption in the literature, we find that the inclusion of spatial correlations is indispensable to reproduce the negative sign of SC(2,3) in the highest centrality bins as dictated by data. Further, the subtle interplay between the different scales of the problem is discussed. To conclude, the possibility of feeding a 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic simulation with our entropy profiles and the theoretical uncertainties associated to this procedure are exposed.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Event Plane Dependence of Di-hadron Correlations with Event Shape Engineering at the STAR Experiment,"Aoyama, Ryo",University of Tsukuba,UK,"In relativistic high energy collisions, hard scattered partons can fragment into two back-to-back jets. These jets can be used as hard probes to study properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma created in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Di-hadron correlations with respect to high $p_T$ trigger particles are a useful tool to study the interactions between jets and the medium in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The jet-medium interplay depends on the in-medium path length of initial partons and the system evolution.

Centrality dependence of the jet-like recoil peak magnitude opposite the trigger particle in di-hadron correlations has been widely interpreted as a signature of path-length dependence of jet modification. However, the path length differs between in-plane (the same direction as the event plane, the shorter axis of elliptic shape) and out-of-plane (the perpendicular direction to the event plane) trigger particles because of the almond-like shape of two overlapping nuclei. Therefore, one can exert a measure of control over the recoil jet's in-medium path length by selecting the trigger particle's azimuthal direction with respect to the event plane. Event shape engineering (ESE) has been proposed as a powerful tool to control the initial geometrical shape. ESE constrains the event-by-event flow fluctuations by selecting the magnitude of the flow vector $q_n$. A more detailed study for jet-medium interplay will be possible with ESE than previous event plane dependent di-hadron correlations at the STAR experiment. Here, we present di-hadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV as a function of both the trigger azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane and various ESE selections. The result of this analysis will provide new insights on the geometry and path-length dependence of jet-medium interactions as well as the effect of collective medium expansion on jet modification.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ryo', 'last_name': 'Aoyama', 'fullName': 'Aoyama, Ryo', 'id': '3580470', 'affiliation': 'University of Tsukuba', 'emailHash': '10f6e8b012b2b78a070b21aefa0da5d7', 'db_id': 3580470, 'person_id': 3763540}"
Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Correlated azimuthal anisotropies with subevent cumulants in pp and pPb collisions with the CMS experiment,"Guilbaud, Maxime",CERN,Switzerland,"Multi-particle correlations in hadronic colliding systems at both RHIC and the LHC are under detailed investigation in recent years. A wealth of experimental evidence suggests the presence of collective phenomena and the formation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) also in high-multiplicity pp and pPb collisions. In particular, multi-particle cumulant analyses have established the collective nature of these correlations. Nevertheless, despite the fact that a common paradigm seems to emerge for all hadronic systems, the exact underlying mechanism still needs to be understood. In particular, the measurement of long-range collective azimuthal correlations down to low multiplicities is still challenging experimentally due to contamination from jet-like correlations. New methods of multiparticle correlations using subevents were developed to suppress jet-like correlations at low multiplicities. Based on data collected by CMS experiment in pp and pPb collisions, correlated azimuthal anisotropies ($v_n$) between different orders are studies using the symmetric cumulants without sub-event and also using N subevents (N = 2, 3 and 4). Furthermore, the subevent cumulant method is also applied to extract $v_n$ harmonics using six- and eight-particle correlations. These results provide crucial insights on the physical origin of observed long-range correlations in small colliding systems down to very low multiplicities.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maxime', 'last_name': 'Guilbaud', 'fullName': 'Guilbaud, Maxime', 'id': '3586936', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'dfd55250d43e886ae9d3e0221b71d6a5', 'db_id': 3586936, 'person_id': 3769726}"

These results motivate a study in even smaller systems, such as produced in relativistic electron-proton collisions.

A measurement is presented of two-particle correlations in collisions of electron beams at 27.5 GeV with beams of protons at 920 GeV, which corresponds to 318 GeV centre-of-mass energy.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Importance of initial and final state effects for azimuthal correlations in p+Pb collisions,"Greif, Moritz",University of Frankfurt,Unknown,"We investigate the relative importance of initial and final state effects on azimuthal correlations in low and high multiplicity p+Pb collisions at LHC energies. By matching the classical Yang-Mills dynamics of pre-equilibrium gluon fields (IP-GLASMA) to a perturbative QCD based parton cascade for the final state evolution (BAMPS) on an event-by-event basis, we find that signatures of both the initial state correlations and final state interactions are seen in azimuthal correlation observables, such as $v_2\{2P C\}(p_T)$, with their relative strength depending on the event multiplicity and transverse momentum. Initial state correlations dominate elliptic flow in low multiplicity events for transverse momenta $p_T > 2~\mathrm{GeV}$. While final state interactions are dominant in high multiplicity events and at low momenta, we find that initial state correlations strongly affect $v_2\{2P C\}(p_T)$ for $p_T>2$ GeV as well as the pT integrated $v_2\{2P C\}$. By carrying out a systematic multiplicity scan, we can also probe the dynamics on the border of initial state dominated to final state dominated - but not yet fully developed hydrodynamic – regime. We predict at which multiplicity and transverse momentum many-body QCD effects in the initial state can be experimentally unveiled.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Measurement of long-range correlations in $pp$ collisions characterized by presence of a Z boson with the ATLAS detector,"Cole, Brian",Columbia University (US),USA,"Recent measurements of correlations between two particles separated in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angles have shown striking similarities between results obtained in $pp$, $p$+A and A+A collision systems. In the $pp$ collision system, unlike in  $p$+A and A+A collisions, the strength of the correlations, quantified by the anisotropy parameter $v_2$, shows little dependence on the observed charged-particle multiplicity. Recent theoretical models suggest that this can result from an intrinsically weak correlation between the charged-particle multiplicity and the impact parameter of the $pp$ collision.  An independent handle on the impact parameter can be obtained in principle by requiring the presence of a hard-scattering process in the collision. This talk presents the first measurement of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions with a presence of Z boson identified via its $\mu\mu$ decay channel. The analysis uses ATLAS data recorded with nominal $pp$ luminosity with high pileup. A new procedure is used to correct for the contribution of tracks arising from pileup vertices. The multiplicity and transverse momentum dependence of the inclusive charged-particle $v_2$ measured in Z-tagged events at $\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV is compared to the $v_2$ measured in minimum-bias collisions. They are found to be of a similar magnitude.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Brian', 'last_name': 'Cole', 'fullName': 'Cole, Brian', 'id': '3563323', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '5ac89c43538af2f10d3ef24f9575e165', 'db_id': 3563323, 'person_id': 3645180}"
Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Estimating nucleon substructure properties in a unified hydrodynamic model of p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions,"Moreland, Scott",Duke University,USA,"Simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on viscous hydrodynamics provide an accurate description of the bulk observables measured at RHIC and LHC beam energies, including identified particle yields, mean $p_T$ and multiparticle correlations. The success of the hydrodynamic framework, however, is naturally expected to break down in the dilute limit where discrete particle degrees of freedom dominate.

It was thus surprising when the multiparticle correlations measured in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions were found to be similar in magnitude to those observed in lead-lead collisions. The observation suggests that hydrodynamic behavior could be manifest in small droplets of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and that flow might develop at length scales smaller than a proton.

In this work, we posit the existence of hydrodynamic flow in small collision systems and evaluate the likelihood of our assertion using Bayesian inference. Specifically, we model the dynamics of proton-lead and lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV using QGP initial conditions with parametric nucleon substructure, a pre-equilibrium free-streaming stage, event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics, and a microscopic hadronic afterburner.
  
Bayesian parameter estimation is used to construct the posterior probability distribution for the model's input parameters, calibrated to fit the charged particle yields, meant $p_T$ and flow cumulants of both collision systems. We then sample preferred regions of parameter space and evaluate the performance of the model using optimally chosen parameter values. This semi-exhaustive model validation enables us to to comment on the implied viability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems subject to the approximations of the chosen framework. We conclude by presenting posterior constraints on the shape of the proton and temperature dependence of QGP transport coefficients, and discuss relevant implications for hot and dense nuclear matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Scott', 'last_name': 'Moreland', 'fullName': 'Moreland, Scott', 'id': '3528802', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '5c3dae75953dc245616e28d238363076', 'db_id': 3528802, 'person_id': 3642908}"

Good understanding of the effects attributed to well-understood physics, like multiple hard scatterings, is required to establish the origin of the new phenomena. Experimentally, those effects can be controlled using event shapes, like transverse spherocity or directivity, which allows the classification of the pp collisions either as jetty-like or isotropic events. The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of light-flavor hadrons in pp collisions measured over a broad $p_{\rm T}$ range provide important input to study particle production mechanisms in the soft and hard scattering regime of QCD. In this work, they are used to perform a comprehensive study as a function of the event multiplicity, collision energy, and event shapes.

We will present the inclusive charged particle transverse momentum distributions for pp collisions at different center-of-mass energies. The multiplicity and energy dependencies of the particle production at high transverse momentum are studied with the exponent of the power law function which describes the $p_{\rm{T}}$ spectra. For pp collisions at 
$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and for a fixed multiplicity interval, the parameters obtained from the blast wave analysis of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra are used to characterize the evolution of the spectral shapes for different event topologies. The multiplicity and spherocity dependencies of the average transverse momenta and integrated yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity are discussed.

The stress-energy tensor in an equilibrium quark-gluon plasma is isotropic, but in nuclear collisions it is likely very far from this state.  The relaxation time $\tau_\pi$ characterizes the rate of isotropization and is a transport coefficient as fundamental as the shear viscosity. We show that fluctuations emerging from the initial anisotropy survive to freeze-out, in excess of thermal fluctuations, influencing rapidity correlation patterns. We show that these correlations can be used to extract $\tau_\pi$. In [1] we describe a method for calculating the rapidity dependence of two-particle momentum correlations with a second order, causal, diffusion equation that includes Langevin noise as a source of thermal fluctuations. The causality requirement introduces the relaxation time and we link the shape of the rapidity correlation pattern to its presence. Here we examine how different equations of state and temperature dependent transport coefficients in the presence of realistic hydrodynamic flow influence the estimate of $\tau_\pi$. In comparison to RHIC data, we find that the ratio $\tau_\pi/\nu \approx 5-6$ where $\nu=\eta/sT$ is the kinematic viscosity. We further make predictions for Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.

The longitudinal and azimuthal widths of general charge balance functions for pions, kaons, and protons are used to examine the two-wave quark production model recently proposed to explain quark-antiquark production within the QGP, which predicts a large increase in up and down quark pairs relative to strange quark pairs around the time of hadronization. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the balance functions for different particle pairs provide quantitative differential information on pair production channels. In addition, a detailed study of balance functions for different identified hadrons probes the fragmentation mechanism of strings into different quark flavors. Balance functions are also analysed in small collision systems such as p-Pb and pp to study fragmentation effects and possible collective effects in high-multiplicity events.

We present a comprehensive set of measurements of general charge balance functions for pions, kaons, protons, and unidentified particle pairs in Pb-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02 TeV), p-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV) and pp ($\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02 and 7 TeV) collisions in ALICE. Theoretical expectations and Monte Carlo models are then compared with the experimental data.  In Pb-Pb collisions, we observe that the $\Delta y$ and $\Delta\varphi$ widths of the charged-pion balance function are narrower in central collisions compared to peripheral ones, while the widths of the charged-kaon balance functions do not show a centrality dependence.

In particular, we show that these thermal fluctuations influence the result of elliptic and triangular flow measurements for ultra-central collisions, such as those presented by the CMS Collaboration [2]. Consequences on the extraction of QCD transport coefficients from heavy-ion collisions will also be discussed.  

The anisotropic flow observed in heavy-ion collision experiments is mostly attributed to the hydrodynamic response to the event-by-event collision geometry and to the sub-nucleon quantum fluctuations. However, hydrodynamic fluctuations are present during the dynamical evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and are quantified by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [3]. They can leave their imprint on final-state observables.  
 
By analyzing the thermal noise mode-by-mode, we provide a consistent scheme of treating these fluctuations as the source terms for hydrodynamic fields. These source terms are then evolved together with hydrodynamic equations of motion. Such a treatment captures the non-perturbative nature of the evolution for these thermal fluctuations.

Detailed study of initial state fluctuations and their manifestations in the final-state flows and flow correlations can provide insights into the initial states and dynamical evolution of the hot and dense QGP.

The dynamical evolution of the QGP is simulated via a (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics model [4].

In this presentation, we focus on thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution (a.k.a. hydrodynamic fluctuations) of the QGP fluids in the intermediate stage and investigate the effects of them on several observables in high-energy nuclear collisions.

We employ an integrated dynamical model [2,3] which combines full three-dimensional relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with Monte-Carlo version of the Glauber model for event-by-event initialization and the hadronic cascade model in the late rescattering stage. By using this model, we first adjust initial parameters and transport coefficients to reproduce $dN_{\mathrm {ch}}/d\eta$ and centrality dependence of integrated $v_{2}$ in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy. We next analyze %$r_{n|n;1}(\eta)$ and observables for longitudinal flow correlations of the $n$-th order higher harmonics $R_{n;n|n;n}(\eta)$ [4] for separation of the flow magnitude fluctuations from the event-plane twist along the rapidity. From this analysis, we see how hydrodynamic fluctuations break up longitudinal correlations of the magnitude and the event-plane angle of anisotropic flow parameters.

Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,"Direct photon production and flow at low transverse momenta in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions","Bock, Friederike",CERN,Switzerland,"Direct photons are produced in various processes in pp, p-A and A-A collision and are sensitive to details of the space-time evolution the medium produced in heavy-ion collisions. The low $p_{\rm T}$ part of the direct photon spectrum is expected to be dominated by thermal direct photons - thermal radiation of hot matter, i.e., of the quark-gluon plasma and the hadron gas. At RHIC energies it is a challenge for hydrodynamical models to simultaneously describe the yield and the elliptic flow of direct photons in p-A and A-A collisions, which is often referred to as the direct-photon puzzle.

With ALICE, photons can be detected with either of the two electromagnetic calorimeters, EMCal and PHOS, and via reconstruction of $e^+e^-$ pairs from conversions in the ALICE detector material using the central tracking system. An additional hybrid method, combining the conversion information with that of the calorimeters has been developed. Where ever possible the results were combined to reflect our best estimate of the inclusive photon spectra and flow, $R_{\gamma}$, as well as the extraction of direct photon spectra or their upper limits and the flow.

In this talk, the first measurements on the direct photon production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ and 8 TeV, as well as in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. Below 3 GeV/$c$, $R_\gamma$ was found to be consistent with unity in these collision systems. Furthermore, the direct photon spectra are in agreement with pQCD next-to-leading order calculations within the uncertainties. In addition, the final results on the direct photon elliptic flow ($v_{2}^{\gamma dir,SP}$) at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV from the Pb-Pb run in 2010 in the $p_{\rm T}$ range of $0.9 < p_{\rm T} < 6.2$ GeV/$c$ will be presented in this talk. Comparisons to PHENIX results and to predictions of several theoretical models will be presented in order to shed light on the status of the direct photon puzzle at LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Friederike', 'last_name': 'Bock', 'fullName': 'Bock, Friederike', 'id': '3553696', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': '169e9eec9a35a4cbb8ea780cf3490d44', 'db_id': 3553696, 'person_id': 3737616}"
Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,Multi-differential pattern of low-mass e+e- excess from 2.42 GeV Au+Au collisions with HADES,"Harabasz, Szymon",Technische Universität Darmstadt,Unknown,"The matter formed in central heavy-ion collisions at a few GeV per nucleon is commonly understood as resonance matter, a gas of nucleons and excited baryon states with a substantial contribution from mesonic, mostly pionic excitations. Yet, in the initial phase of the reaction the system is compressed to beyond nuclear ground state density and hence substantial modifications of the hadron properties are expected to occur.
The spectral distribution of virtual photons measured in Au+Au collisions at 2.42 GeV center of mass energy indicates strong medium effects beyond pure superposition of individual NN collisions. We present multi-differential distributions of low-mass electron pairs measured in Au+Au collisions at 2.42 GeV center of mass energy. The data is analyzed in terms of excess radiation above a conventional cocktail of contributions from meson decay after thermal freeze-out. This strong excess radiation is remarkably well described assuming emission from a thermalized system. To gain deeper understanding of the microscopic origin of the excess radiation, we extracted it centrality dependent true (not blue-shifted) temperature, its azimuthal distribution and polarization, as well as mass dependent effective slope parameter. Virtual photon spectra will be confronted with results of other experiments as well as with available model calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Szymon', 'last_name': 'Harabasz', 'fullName': 'Harabasz, Szymon', 'id': '3729156', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'fcf52afc36974ec8918b0c672bb914c1', 'db_id': 3729156, 'person_id': 3902447}"

Our method is based on a recently developed analytic continuation procedure that allows to calculate real-time quantities like spectral functions at finite temperature and chemical potential. Results for the quark, the sigma and the pion spectral function as well as for the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio are shown using the quark-meson model [1]. These quantities are studied in different regimes of the phase diagram, in particular near the chiral critical endpoint. Moreover, recent results for in-medium vector and axial-vector meson spectral functions are presented which are based on an extended linear-sigma model including quarks [2]. It is shown how the rho and the a1 spectral functions become degenerate at high temperatures and chemical potentials due to the restoration of chiral symmetry. Future applications of these recent developments are discussed, which include the calculation of dilepton spectra and the identification of experimental signatures of the chiral phase transition in the QCD phase diagram.

Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,"Low-mass dielectron measurements in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC","Bailhache, Raphaelle",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ. (DE),Germany,"The production of low-mass dielectrons is one of the most promising tools for the understanding of the chiral symmetry restoration and of the thermodynamical properties of the Quark-Gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions. At low invariant mass, the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the medium and modifications related to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region ($1.2 < m_{\rm ee} < 2.8$GeV/$c^2$) dielectrons are dominated by correlated electron pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, which carry information on the heavy-quark energy loss and collectivity. Thermal radiation from the medium contributes to the dielectron yield over a broad mass range and give insight into the temperature of the medium.

To single out the signal characteristics of the QGP, it is crucial to understand the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum, i.e. in minimum-bias proton-proton collisions, and to disentangle hot from cold-nuclear matter effects with p-Pb collisions. Moreover, observations of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions show surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions. The underlying physics processes in such events can be further studied with the measurements of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs.  

In this talk, we will give an overview of the latest measurements of e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and 13 TeV, in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\rm{NN}}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, and in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{{\rm{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV with ALICE. Its implications for the production of heavy quarks and virtual photons will be presented, as well as the dependence of the dielectron spectra with the charged-particle multiplicity in the event, or the centrality of the collision. In Pb-Pb collisions, the comparison of the measured dielectron yield with the expectation from known hadronic sources will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raphaelle', 'last_name': 'Bailhache', 'fullName': 'Bailhache, Raphaelle', 'id': '3553688', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,Unveiling the yoctosecond structure of the QGP with top quarks,"Apolinario, Liliana",Universidade de Lisboa (PT),PT,"Top quarks have been recently measured for the first time in nuclear collisions. With most of the integrated luminosity of the LHC PbPb program to be recorded in the coming years and the impressive projections for the future HL-LHC, HE-LHC or FCC, top quark observables will be measured with good precision and become an excellent probe of the QGP. We argue here that the unique properties of the top quark provide a completely new way to study differentially the space-time evolution of the medium created in heavy ion collisions. Top quarks decay almost exclusively into a W boson and a b quark. The finite lifetimes of the top and W particles and the time-delay in the interaction of the (colour-singlet) W-boson’s decay products with the medium add up to a total time during which the top-decay system is unaffected by the QGP. The three times are correlated with the kinematics of the top quark allowing the approximate determination of the time at which the interaction with the QGP begins. We carry out a simple Monte Carlo feasibility study and find that the LHC has the potential to bring first, limited information on the time structure of the QGP. Substantially increased LHC heavy-ion luminosities or future higher-energy colliders would open opportunities for more extensive studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Liliana', 'last_name': 'Apolinario', 'fullName': 'Apolinario, Liliana', 'id': '3528861', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa (PT)', 'emailHash': 'a63f153ae87afad7e8b46a7d1e553678', 'db_id': 3528861, 'person_id': 3643849}"

The design is optimized  for high jet energy resolution, while special attention to possible biases resulting from the combination of a relatively thin hadronic calorimeter and the large fluctuations in hadronic shower composition and shower development that usually limit calorimeter performance in large systems.

"Future facilities, upgrades and instrumentation",unknown,Upgrade of the ALICE central barrel tracking detectors: ITS and TPC,"Gasik, Piotr",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"The ALICE Collaboration will undertake a major upgrade of the detector apparatus during the second LHC long shutdown (LS2, 2019-20) in view of the Runs 3 and 4 (2021 to 2029). The objective of the upgrade is two-fold: i) an improvement of the tracking precision and efficiency, in particular in the low-momentum range; ii) an improvement of the readout capabilities of the experiment, in order to fully exploit the luminosity for heavy ions envisaged after LS2.
The first goal will be achieved by replacing the Inner Tracking System (ITS) with a new tracker, composed of seven layers of silicon pixel detectors. The ITS will be made up of about 25000 Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors with fast readout, resulting in a material thickness reduced to 0.3% (inner layers) – 1% (outer layers) of the radiation length and a granularity of $28\times28$ $\mu m^2$. The resolution of the track position will improve by about a factor of three in the direction transverse to beams and by a factor of five along the beams, reaching for example 20 $\mu m$ in both directions at a transverse momentum of 1 GeV/c.
The second goal will be achieved, among other measures, by replacing the readout chambers of the 90 $m^3$ Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with Micro Pattern Gas Detectors. In particular, the new readout chambers will consist of stacks of 4 Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils combining different hole pitches. The upgraded detector will operate continuously without the use of a triggered gating grid. It will thus be able to record all Pb-Pb collisions at the anticipated LHC interaction rate of 50 kHz. New readout electronics will send the continuous data stream to a new online farm at a rate of 3 TByte/s.

These interesting features continue to the lowest energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV, and motivate the investigation to even lower energy collisions.

At very large net baryon densities and low temperatures, astrophysical observations have become more important in constraining the QCD Equation of State.

In this context I will discuss the most relevant properties and constraints which should
be satisfied by any model which attempts to predict the QCD phase structure.
Furthermore, I will present results on the baryon number susceptibilities calculated with this

The new approach is free of causality problems and is fully thermodynamically consistent, which enables us to use it for the investigation of the strongly interacting matter phase-diagram properties in a wide range of temperatures and baryon densities, including neutron stars. The considered model with a small number of parameters, fully determined according to the experimental constraints, reproduces very well all the known properties of normal nuclear matter, provides a high quality description of the proton flow constraints, hadron multiplicities created during the nuclear-nuclear collision experiments and equally is consistent with astrophysical data coming from neutron star observations.

High baryon density and astrophysics,parallel,Constraining production models with light (anti-)nuclei measurements in small systems with ALICE at the LHC,"Colocci, Manuel","Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",Unknown,"The large sample of high quality data taken in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and 13 TeV, together with smaller data sets at 900 GeV and 2.76 TeV, and in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at the LHC with the ALICE detector allows for a systematic study of the light (anti-)nuclei production in these collision systems. 

The excellent performance of the Inner Tracking System, the Time Projection Chamber and the Time-Of-Flight detector provide a clear identification and separation of primary produced light (anti-)nuclei from secondaries.

Additionally, the high energy deposit of Z=2 particles in the Transition Radiation Detector has been exploited to collect a hardware-triggered data sample in the high-interaction rate p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV. First findings from this (anti-)nuclei enriched sample will be shown.

Recent results on deuteron production as a function of multiplicity in pp and p-Pb collisions will be presented, as well as the measurement of helium-3 in p-Pb collisions. The goal is to study production mechanisms such as coalescence in small systems, and to compare them to those in heavy-ion collisions. To achieve this, the coalescence parameter $B_{A}$ is studied as function of transverse momentum in the different systems and  as a function of the event multiplicity.  In addition to this, prospects for measuring (anti-)deuteron production in jets will be presented.

These investigations have direct connections to cosmological and astrophysical studies, in particular for the search of dark matter candidates where one possible signal is the increased flux of light anti-nuclei which has an interplay with the $B_{A}$ measurementes shown here.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Manuel', 'last_name': 'Colocci', 'fullName': 'Colocci, Manuel', 'id': '3553703', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)', 'emailHash': '13387d5f2541669c46a9d98c4408082a', 'db_id': 3553703, 'person_id': 3737623}"

These include processes in which an energetic photon emitted by one nucleus resolves the partonic structure of the other and stimulates jet production. Much like deep inelastic scattering, such processes provide a clean probe of the nuclear parton distributions. This is in contrast to other observables in ion-ion and proton-ion collisions which typically involve the convolution of parton distributions in both incident particles. Thus jet photo-production represents the most direct opportunity to study nuclear parton distributions until a future electron-ion collider is constructed. This talk presents new measurements of ultra-peripheral jet photo-production in Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are selected using a combination of forward neutron and rapidity gap requirements. Final states with two or more jets are used to construct event level observables $H_{\mathrm{T}}$, $x_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, which characterize the hard scattering process. Measurements of differential cross sections in these three quantities, after unfolding for detector response, are presented.

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Forward particle production in proton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order: solving the running-coupling puzzle,"Ducloue, Bertrand",IPhT Saclay,Unknown,"Reaching next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative calculations of particle production in QCD at high energy is essential for reliable phenomenological applications. In recent years, the Color Glass Condensate effective theory (the natural framework for such calculations) has indeed been promoted to NLO accuracy. However, the first NLO calculations met with unexpected difficulties, among which a huge scheme-dependence with respect to the scale choice in the running of the coupling. The NLO correction to the cross-section for single inclusive particle production in pA collisions at forward rapidities was found to vary by up to two orders of magnitude and also to change sign, when replacing the momentum-space prescription for the running of the coupling (as natural in the calculation of the NLO impact factor) by a coordinate-space prescription (as generally used when solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation).

Recently we have found out that the origin of this puzzle lies in the interplay between the Fourier transform from coordinate space to momentum space and the asymptotic freedom of QCD [1].  We present a new coordinate space prescription which avoids this problem and leads to results consistent with the momentum-space prescription ones. The NLO corrections are negative and reduce the LO result by 40% to 50%. We argue that the scheme-dependence could be further reduced by using the momentum-space representation throughout the whole NLO calculation, that is, for both the impact factor and the solution to the BK equation.

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Energy and system size dependence of the subnucleonic fluctuations,"Mäntysaari, Heikki",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Understanding the geometric eventy-by-event distribution of gluons in protons and nuclei is a fundamentally interesting task. Moreover, their fluctuating structure  has a significant effect on the outcome of hydrodynamical simulations of e.g. proton-nucleus collisions. Thus, it is of utmost interest to determine both the average geometrical structure, and its event-by-event fluctuations, for the hadrons used in high-energy QCD experiments.

Recently, we have shown how the event-by-event fluctuations of the geometric structure of the proton can be constrained from the HERA exclusive vector meson production data [1], and that this information is crucial in order to describe the measured flow harmonics in proton-nucleus collisions [2].

In this talk, we study to what extent the large geometric fluctuations of the proton have effect in nuclear targets. In particular, we show that at large momentum transfer, the J/Psi photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is sensitive to the event-by-event fluctuations of the nucleon geometry in the LHC kinematics [3]. We also discuss the possibilities of the future Electron Ion Collider to study fluctuations also in light nuclei such as deuteron and helium, whose structure is necessary input for hydrodynamical simulations of e.g. deuteron-gold collisions studied at RHIC.

The high-energy photon-nucleus and proton-nucleus scatterings measured at the LHC make it also possible to study the energy dependence of the fluctuations. We present our ongoing work on describing the Björken-x evolution of the proton structure by solving the JIMWLK evolution equation. The non-perturbative input for the small-x evolution is obtained by fitting the HERA structure function data, which then allows us to predict the energy dependence of the fluctuating structure of the proton.

Still, hydrodynamic descriptions of heavy-ion collisions are phenomenologically very successful. To elucidate the origin of this success we explore exactly solvable situations where the microscopic dynamics is described by the Boltzmann equation, and compare the exact solution with various hydrodynamic approximations obtained from the Boltzmann equation using different expansion schemes. Specifically, we study the performance of equations derived from a third-order Chapman-Enskog expansion and in the frameworks of second-order anisotropic and viscous hydrodynamics in comparison to the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for Bjorken and Gubser flows. Systems with Bjorken flow approach an asymptotic state of local thermal equilibrium whereas in Gubser flow the expansion is so strong that the asymptotic state is free-streaming. Anisotropic hydrodynamics can be understood as a form of resummed hydrodynamics that includes terms of all orders in a gradient or Chapman-Enskog expansion. We study the evolution of the longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy, the shear stress and the rate of entropy production and show that for all three observables second-order anisotropic hydrodynamics in the $P_L$-matching scheme yields the best agreement with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation, for both types of flows. We also show that the relatively largest discrepancies between the approximate hydrodynamic and exact kinetic solutions are observed for the entropy: the rate of entropy productions appears to be more strongly affected by couplings to rapidly evolving non-hydrodynamic modes than the hydrodynamic moments of the distribution function that make up the energy-momentum tensor.

Di-hadron correlation measurements with a method to subtract all orders of flow background using data themselves will also be presented to study how the lost energy is redistributed at low to modest $p_T$. We will contextualize and discuss recent and new systematic studies of jet coincidence and correlation measurements at STAR, taking advantage of the tenfold increase in statistics from recent data taking runs.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kun', 'last_name': 'Jiang', 'fullName': 'Jiang, Kun', 'id': '3580420', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China and Purdue University', 'emailHash': 'c5cfb8bf3d5d9d9332aaf35b84383fc0', 'db_id': 3580420, 'person_id': 3763496}"
Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Adding vacuum branching to jet evolution in a dense medium,"Iancu, Edmond",Université Paris-Saclay (FR),France,"It is well known that the multiple interactions of a hard probe with a dense quark-gluon plasma result in the ""medium-induced"" radiation of soft gluons, responsible e.g. for jet energy loss. Such an emission can be computed using the BDMPS-Z formalism, which has recently been generalised to include multiple medium-induced emissions. To get a complete picture of the evolution of a jet in a dense medium, the main missing ingredient is the inclusion of both medium-induced emissions and ""vacuum-like"" emissions responsible for the parton shower from large virtualities (of the order of the hard scale) down to the hadronisation scale. 

In this talk, we adopt a new approach and show that in a (leading) double-logarithmic approximation, the time scales in the evolution of a jet factorise. The vacuum-like parton cascades develop at early times and exhibit angular ordering due to color coherence, like the standard parton showers in the vacuum. The effect of the medium can be simply formulated as a kinematic constraint which limits the phase-space for vacuum-like radiation and thus reduces the parton multiplicities. The gluons produced by these cascades lose their mutual coherence via multiple scattering and hence act as independent sources of energy loss via medium-induced radiation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete picture of jet evolution in the medium derived from perturbative QCD. It has the additional advantage of being well-suited for a Monte-Carlo implementation. In the talk, we show how this simple evolution arise and investigate its main properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Edmond', 'last_name': 'Iancu', 'fullName': 'Iancu, Edmond', 'id': '3528987', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris-Saclay (FR)', 'emailHash': '9c0503437fddc7afed17f456c9771b5c', 'db_id': 3528987, 'person_id': 3643573}"

The jet nuclear modification factor is extracted for various collision centrality selections to study the impact of jet quenching on jet yields. The measurement is compared to theoretical calculations. The radius dependence of the jet suppression is expected to be sensitive to the jet energy loss mechanism and medium response. Therefore, studies of jets in PbPb and pp are explored for unprecedented large jet radius parameter, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 with the anti-kt algorithm.

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Quantifying jet modifications with substructure,"Tywoniuk, Konrad",CERN,Switzerland,"The striking suppression and modification patterns that are observed in jet observables measured in heavy-ion collisions, with respect to the proton-proton baseline, have the potential to constrain the spatio-temporal branching process of energetic partons in a dense QCD medium. The mechanism of jet energy loss in a deconfined medium is intricately associated with medium resolution of jet substructure fluctuations [1]. This is naturally accompanied by modifications of jet substructure [2,3] and impacts the behaviour of the suppression of jets at high-pT [4]. In this work, we highlight the connection between the breakdown of colour coherence and energy loss within a first-principle calculation of a parton splitting process taking place inside the medium [1]. Furthermore, we discuss how a consistent picture between quenching effects and substructure modifications can aid in pinning down scales of the medium, focussing in particular on the advantage of applying grooming techniques to enhance the sensitivity to perturbative aspects of in-medium jet fragmentation [2].

New theoretical developments,parallel,(3+1)D Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics for Nonconformal Fluids,"McNelis, Mike",The Ohio State University,USA,"Anisotropic hydrodynamics improves upon standard dissipative fluid dynamics by treating certain large dissipative corrections non-perturbatively. Relativistic heavy-ion collisions feature two such large dissipative effects: (i) Strongly anisotropic expansion generates a large shear stress component which manifests itself in very different longitudinal and transverse pressures, especially at early times. (ii) Critical fluctuations near the quark-hadron phase transition lead to a large bulk viscous pressure on the conversion surface between hydrodynamics and a microscopic hadronic cascade description of the final collision stage.  

We present a new dissipative hydrodynamic formulation for non-conformal fluids where both of these effects are treated nonperturbatively. The evolution equations are derived from the Boltzmann equation in the 14-moment approximation, using an expansion around an anisotropic leading-order distribution function with two momentum-space deformation parameters, accounting for the longitudinal and transverse pressures. Generalized Landau matching conditions for the longitudinal and transverse pressures are then required to obtain their evolution. We describe an approximate anisotropic equation of state that relates the anisotropy parameters with the macroscopic pressures. Residual shear stresses are smaller and are treated perturbatively, as in standard second-order dissipative fluid dynamics.

The resulting optimized viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic evolution equations are derived in 3+1 dimensions and tested in a (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion, using an updated lattice equation of state. Comparisons with other viscous hydrodynamical frameworks are presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mike', 'last_name': 'McNelis', 'fullName': 'McNelis, Mike', 'id': '3529026', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': '9f691eabaf7df072aa1ec5f7efd7058f', 'db_id': 3529026, 'person_id': 3640565}"
New theoretical developments,parallel,A resummed method of moments for the relativistic hydrodynamic expansion,"Tinti, Leonardo",The Ohio State University,USA,"A modern approach to obtaining the equations of motion of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics relies on various approximations of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. There is a mounting evidence that the standard Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation has a vanishing radius of convergence. The method of moments, on the other hand, is free from such problems. The equations thus obtained can be systematically improved, and their convergence properties checked. However, if one introduces mean-field interactions, for example in the form of a medium-dependent mass or an external gauge field interacting with the plasma, this systematic expansion breaks down: Successive moments are found to couple not only to energy moments of higher, but also of lower order,which diverge in the ultra-relativistic (massless) limit, orrequire unrealistic machine precision. This problem is even worse if one starts with the Wigner quasi-probability distribution, in order to generalize the results of the expansion. In the absence of the on-shell condition, all of the moments are ill defined, with the notable exception of the conserved currents (the stress-energy tensor).
We solve the issue using resummed moments which consist of a sum of all the moments of the same tensorial rank, but different energy weights. The resulting equations are always well defined. The evolution of the hydrodynamics moments (four-velocity, energy density, pressure, pressure corrections etc.) is exactly the same as the one provided by the traditional method of moments, if such an expansion is well defined. We tested numerically the convergence properties of the resummed expansion for some known solutions of the microscopic theory, and we checked that the convergence remains intact in the simplest case in which the traditional expansion breaks down. Namely the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation for charged mass-less particles coupled to the Maxwell equations in a (0+1)-dimensional expansion.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leonardo', 'last_name': 'Tinti', 'fullName': 'Tinti, Leonardo', 'id': '3529041', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': '8dac539203aad13c6fa6ff61c5cad3fd', 'db_id': 3529041, 'person_id': 3587387}"

Using 10000 initial and final energy density and flow velocity profiles generated from 2+1-d hydrodynamics with MC-Glauber initial conditions, we train the network and use it to predict the final profiles associated with various initial conditions, including MC-Glauber, MC-KLN and AMPT and TRENTo. A comparison with the hydrodynamic calculations shows that the network predictions can nicely capture the magnitude and inhomogeneous structures of these final profiles, as well as the related eccentricity distributions $P(\varepsilon_n)$ (n=2, 3, 4). These results indicate that deep learning can capture the main feature of the non-linear evolution of hydrodynamics, which shows the potential of largely accelerate the simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics.

We further discuss the new aspects of hadronization that could be associated with the relatively broad cross-over phase transformation as predicted by lattice-QCD theory at low $μ_{B}$. That opens up the possibility that various observables of hadronization, e.g. hadron formation or susceptibilities of higher order (related to grand canonical fluctuations of conserved hadronic charges) may freeze out at different characteristic temperatures.

We formulate a Cluster Expansion Model (CEM), which provides all higher  order Fourier coefficients on the basis of the leading two coefficients [5], and allows to calculate QCD thermodynamics at non-zero chemical potentials. CEM is shown to be consistent with all the available lattice data, both at $\mu_B = 0$ and at imaginary baryochemical potential.

We show the first measurement of cumulant ratios ($C_{2}/C_{1}$, $C_{3}/C_{2}$) of net-$\Lambda$, which are each subject to strangeness and baryon number conservation. We extract the chemical freeze-out parameters ($\mu_{B}$, $T$) from these measurements under the assumption that the experimental multiplicity cumulant ratios are equivalent to the ratios of susceptibilities from the lattice.

First, we consider the case where the nuclear medium passes directly through the critical point. In this case, the modes with wave-number of order the inverse Kibble-Zurek length and smaller fall out of equilibrium during the transit, and limit the growth of critical fluctuations in a characteristic way which depends on the wave-numbers involved. This Kibble-Zurek wavenumber will be contrasted to wave numbers of order $k\sim \sqrt{ (e + p)/\eta \tau }$ which are always out of equilibrium, even away from the critical point (Akamatsu 2016).  Subsequently we generalize to the situation when the system misses the critical point by a an amount, $\Delta = n_c/s_c \delta(s/n)$. In this case there is an additional scale, and Kibble-Zurek scaling is only relevant if $\Delta$ is sufficiently small. We will define ``sufficiently small"" in the talk and analyze the intermediate case.  The scales introduced in this analysis give a qualitative picture of the QCD critical point in heavy ion collisions, which can inform all experimental searches.

it is crucial to develop quantitatively reliable dynamical descriptions. In order
to study the phase transition, both in crossover regime as well as near the 
conjectured QCD critical point, the non-perturbative nature needs to be fully
included. In this talk, we outline a novel QCD-assisted transport approach based on 
non-equilibrium chiral fluid dynamics and the effective action of low energy 
QCD. This approach makes use of the full equilibrium correlation functions and 
includes dissipation and stochastic noise. 

We test the new framework within a low energy effective mesonic theory. For 
this case, we discuss the time evolution of fluctuation observables based on 
the higher-order moments such as the skewness and kurtosis as the system 
passes through the phase boundary. In this way, we can study details of the 
equilibration of the order parameter and of higher-order correlations, as well 
as the impact of critical slowing down on the correlation length. The 
underlying theory naturally includes critical and non-critical contributions. 
We can, therefore, explicitly test the size of the critical region, where scaling 
and dynamical scaling hold. Finally, the relative effect of critical 
versus baseline contributions to the fluctuation dynamics is quantified.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nicolas', 'last_name': 'Wink', 'fullName': 'Wink, Nicolas', 'id': '3529115', 'affiliation': 'University of Heidelberg', 'emailHash': 'dba193b71737fc29bf56145c3baec5c3', 'db_id': 3529115, 'person_id': 3647245}"

QCD at high temperature,parallel,Chiral phase transition of (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Lahiri, Anirban",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Understanding the properties of strong interaction matter with its physical
spectrum of light and strange quarks near the pseudo-critical temperature
of (2+1)-flavor QCD is one of the central goals of high energy nuclear
physics. It generally is expected that the analytic crossover transition in
QCD is sensitive to properties of the true chiral PHASE transition at
vanishing quark masses [1,2]. This sensitivity is increased in higher order
cumulants of net charge fluctuations which currently are being measured
by STAR and PHENIX at RHIC and by ALICE at the LHC.
In order to connect these experimental findings to predictions arising from
QCD in the chiral limit it is mandatory to establish the properties of QCD in
this limit. While there are many indications that the chiral PHASE
transition is a second order transition in the universality class of O(4)
sigma models [3], this is by no means established in lattice QCD
calculations as in none of these cases continuum extrapolated results
exist [4].
In this talk we will present the status of our calculations for (2+1)-flavor
QCD with the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) on three different
lattice sizes ($N_\tau = 6, 8, 12$) and with 5 values of light quark masses
that are up to a factor 6 smaller than in nature. This allows us to
systematically control the chiral and continuum limit of QCD. We show
that our results are consistent with O(N) scaling in the chiral limit,
supporting the existence of a second order phase transition. We will also
present first continuum extrapolated results for the PHASE transition
temperature in the chiral limit and discuss the relevance of corrections to
scaling that need to be controlled when extrapolating to QCD with its
physical quark mass spectrum.

Thermodynamics and hadron chemistry,parallel,Addressing the hyper-triton lifetime puzzle with ALICE at the LHC,"Trogolo, Stefano",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"We present a measurement of the hyper-triton lifetime with the ALICE detector at the LHC, aiming at shedding light on the hyper-triton lifetime puzzle. During the LHC Run 2, the ALICE experiment recorded Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV that complement the Pb-Pb datasets acquired at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV from Run 1. These datasets allow for a systematic study of light (anti-)hypernuclei production in Pb-Pb collisions, in particular, for the hyper-triton lifetime determination.

The identification of the hyper-triton is based on the excellent performance in terms of energy loss measurement in the Time Projection Chamber. In addition, the Inner Tracking System is used to discriminate secondary vertices, originating from weak decays, from the primary vertex. This is of particular importance for the measurement of (anti-)(hyper-)triton that decays weakly with a decay length of several centimetres.
 
The study of (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei production at both energies will be discussed and compared to model predictions. Special emphasis will be put on new results of the hyper-triton lifetime determination in its 2- and 3-body decay modes. Indeed most calculations on the lifetime of hyper-triton give similar lifetimes, which are close to the lifetime of free $\Lambda$ decays. On the experimental side, all results in Au+Au collision at RHIC and in Li+C collisions at GSI show a significantly shorter lifetime in comparison with that of the free $\Lambda$ decay.

A detailed discussion of the experimental results and the effort needed on both the experimental and the theoretical side in this sector will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Stefano', 'last_name': 'Trogolo', 'fullName': 'Trogolo, Stefano', 'id': '3553794', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '8a23de6c26be5b82fa62cd582becd8bb', 'db_id': 3553794, 'person_id': 3737690}"
Thermodynamics and hadron chemistry,parallel,Shear viscosity and resonance lifetimes in the hadron gas,"Rose, Jean-Bernard",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Previous calculations of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio in the hadron gas have failed to reach a consensus, with $\eta/s$ predictions differing by almost an order of magnitude. This work addresses and solves this discrepancy by providing an independent extraction of this coefficient using the newly-developed SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly interacting Hadrons) transport code and the Green-Kubo formalism. We compare the results from SMASH with numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation for various systems using the Chapman-Enskog expansion as well as previous results in the literature. Substantial deviations of the coefficient are found between transport approaches mainly based on resonance propagation with finite lifetime (such as SMASH) and other (semi-analytical) approaches with energy-dependent cross-sections, where interactions do not introduce a timescale other than the inverse scattering rate. Our conclusion is that long-lived resonances strongly affect the transport properties of the system, resulting in significant differences in η/s with respect to other approaches where binary collisions dominate. We argue that the relaxation time of the system —which characterizes the shear viscosity— is determined by the interplay between the mean-free time and the lifetime of resonances. We finally show how an artificial shortening of the resonance lifetimes or the addition of a background elastic cross section nicely interpolate between the two discrepant results. To turn this around, we finally note that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ can be used to constrain the properties of the hadron gas.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jean-Bernard', 'last_name': 'Rose', 'fullName': 'Rose, Jean-Bernard', 'id': '3529223', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': '35a8f8d9136b27ee4f540551fb9f3d21', 'db_id': 3529223, 'person_id': 3644983}"

In addition, the light nuclei distributions provide an excellent tool for understanding the freeze-out conditions of system created in high-energy nuclear collisions. For example, the yield ratio of triton, $N(t)$, deuteron, $N(d)$, and proton, $N(p)$, which is defined as $N(t)N(p)/N^2(d)$ may be utilized as an alternative variable in the search of the QCD critical point.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Multi-stage jet evolution and mass hierarchy of heavy quark energy loss in heavy-ion collisions,"Cao, Shanshan",Wayne State University,Unknown,"Heavy quarks serve as valuable probes of the QGP properties as well as the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss. Experimental data at the LHC indicate significant nuclear modification of heavy flavor ($D$ & $B$) meson production that is comparable to light flavor hadrons, which seem contradictory to one’s earlier expectation of $\Delta E_g > \Delta E_q > \Delta E_c > \Delta E_b$. We extended the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model coupled to hydrodynamic medium to heavy quark jet evolution in the QGP including both elastic and inelastic scattering processes [1,2]. Within the LBT model, we obtain good descriptions of heavy flavor meson suppression, elliptic and triangular flow coefficients observed at the LHC and RHIC.

The time-ordered transport model is further combined with a virtuality-ordered parton shower scheme into a multi-stage evolution approach [3,4] that includes a rare-scattering multiple emission formalism at momentum large compared to heavy quark mass (sensitive only to the transverse diffusion coefficient), and a single scattering induced emission formalism at momentum comparable to mass (sensitive to the transverse diffusion as well as longitudinal drag and diffusion coefficients). This multi-stage approach reduces the difference of energy loss between $c$ and $b$ quarks and simultaneously describes $D$ and $B$ meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$. In addition, the mass (or velocity) dependence of jet-induced medium excitation is explored for the first time. Its effects on the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss and heavy-light hadron correlation functions are investigated.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,"Transport properties from Charm to Bottom: $p_T$ suppression, anisotropic flow $v_n$ and their correlations to the bulk dynamics","Plumari, Salvatore",University of Catania (Italy),Unknown,"We study the propagation of charm and bottom quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by means of a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach that in the large M/T limit recovers the standard Langevin dynamics. The non-perturbative interaction between heavy quarks and light quarks is described by means of a quasi-particle approach in which light partons are dressed with thermal masses. The last tuned to lattice QCD thermodynamics naturally induce a non-perturbative interaction that entails only a weak dependence on the temperature especially around the critical temperature $T_c$, which plays a fundamental role to describe simultaneously the experimental data for the nuclear suppression factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ of D mesons from RHIC to LHC energies. In the same scheme we present predictions for B mesons at 5.02 ATeV that shows a quite significant suppression and allow a determination of the space-diffusion coefficient that is practically independent on the transport scheme for HQ (Boltzmann vs Langevin). The last is seem to largely deviate from from pQCD estimate but also to be still somewhat larger than AdS/CFT and quite close to lattice QCD calculations. Finally it will be discussed the relevance of initial state fluctuations that allows to extend the analysis to high order anisotropic flows $v_3(p_T)$ and $v_4(p_T)$ as well as to investigate the role of QCD interaction in developing correlations between the light and the heavy flavor anisotropic flows. These will provide novel and powerful constraints for the transport coefficients.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Measurement of heavy flavor production and azimuthal anisotropy in small and large systems with ATLAS,"Hu, Qipeng",University of Colorado Boulder,USA,"Measurements of heavy flavor hadron production and their correlations in A+A collisions provide insight into the energy loss mechanism and transport properties of heavy quarks in the QGP. From this perspective, the same measurements in $p$+A collisions thus serve as a necessary baseline for understanding the observations in A+A collisions. Additionally, detailed studies of the azimuthal anisotropy for heavy flavor hadrons in $p$+A may help address the question of whether the observed long-range ``ridge'' correlation arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale. This talk presents ATLAS measurements of heavy flavor production, via their semi-leptonic decay to muons in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions, and via identified prompt $D$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV $p$+Pb collisions. Heavy flavor muon yields are observed to be strongly suppressed in Pb+Pb collisions compared to that in $pp$ collisions. On the other hand, the prompt $D$ meson production in $p$+Pb collisions shows no obvious modification compared to the theoretical predictions for $pp$ collisions, indicating relatively small cold nuclear matter effects for $D$ meson production. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and centrality dependence of flow harmonics $v_2$--$v_4$ associated with heavy-flavor muons in Pb+Pb are also presented. The measured $v_2$ decreases over the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range of 4--14 GeV, and shows a systematic variation with centrality that was observed in other $v_2$ measurements. The anisotropy measurements are extended to 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb collisions, where the azimuthal modulations of heavy-flavor muons, prompt $D$ mesons and J/$\psi$ are studied using two-particle correlations. The statistical significance of the presence or absence of long range correlations involving heavy flavor production in $p$+Pb events is quantified.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Qipeng', 'last_name': 'Hu', 'fullName': 'Hu, Qipeng', 'id': '3563347', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'emailHash': '9af0ff76e7af9ee0a48a24b84d41f2ec', 'db_id': 3563347, 'person_id': 3712470}"

In recent years, also the formation of a small-size Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in p-Pb collisions was advanced as a possible explanation of effects like long-range $v_{2}$-like angular correlations in high-multiplicity events or the enhancement of baryon production, typically observed in nucleus-nucleus collisions and ascribed to the collective expansion of the QGP.  The measurement of angular correlations of heavy-flavour particles with charged particles, at central and forward rapidities, provide an important extension of studies performed with light-flavoured hadrons to further characterise the $v_{\rm 2}$-like behavior, understand  its initial- or final-state nature, constrain its development in the partonic and/or hadronic stages, and better investigate its mass dependence. The study of open heavy flavour production in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions can also add important information to address the expected connection between collective-like and energy-loss-like effects. Moreover, production studies as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision can give insight into mutiple parton interactions and into the interplay between hard and soft processes

In this talk, we will present production measurements of D$^{0}$, D$^{+}$, D$^{*+}$ and D$_{s}^{+}$ mesons reconstructed with the ALICE detector via their hadronic decays at mid-rapidity in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV, collected during LHC Run-2.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quantum dynamical dissociation of quarkonia by wave function decoherence in quark-gluon plasma,"Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"In this study, we investigate the real-time evolution of quarkonium bound states
in a quark-gluon plasma in an improved QCD based stochastic potential model. This
model describes the quarkonium dynamics in terms of a Schrödinger equation with
an in-medium potential and two noise terms encoding the residual interaction
between the heavy quarks and the medium. The time evolution described by this
equation is unitary, since the effective potential term is real-valued. At a glance this is at odds with lattice results, but we explain why this it is
actually not the case.

We discuss the the time evolution of the existence probabilities of bound states in a static medium and in a boost-invariantly expanding quark-gluon plasma. We draw two conclusions from our results: One is that the outcome of the stochastic potential model is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The other is that the noise plays an important role in order to describe quarkonium dynamics in medium, in particular it causes *decoherence* of the quarkonium wave function. The effectiveness of decoherence is controlled by a new length scale, correlation length of the noise. Its effect has not been included in existing phenomenological studies, and we discuss its importance in detail.

Furthermore, if time allows, we also discuss strategies to take account of dissipation effects in addition to diffusion effects caused by the residual interactions between the heavy quarks and the medium.

Measurements of the ground and excited quarkonia states, as well as their separation into prompt and non-prompt components, provide further opportunities to study the dynamics of heavy parton energy loss in these large systems.

Quarkonia,parallel,Charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from high precision lattice QCD computations,"Shu, Hai-Tao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Understanding experimental results on nuclear modification factors of heavy quarkonia as well as open heavy mesons is complicated due to the interplay between the cold and hot medium effects. In order to disentangle these two effects it is crucial to have a good understanding of thermal behavior of quarkonia and heavy quarks in the hot medium.  The quarkonium spectral function is of the most interest, as the deformation of its resonance peak structure relates to the dissociation temperatures of quarkonia and its slope at the vanishing frequency in the vector channel is connected to the heavy quark diffusion coefficient.


We will present our recent results on quarkonia spectral functions obtained from quenched lattice QCD simulations at $T\in [0.35, 2.25]T_c$. The simulations have been performed on very large and fine lattices where both charm and bottom quarks can be treated relativistically. Using multiple random sources we have computed charmonia and bottomonia correlators being 2 times more precise compared to our previous study[1,2]. In order to gain more robust information on the quark mass dependences of the thermal modifications we also computed the hadron correlators with additionally 4 different values of heavy quark masses ranging in between those of charm and bottom quarks.


We show reconstructed spectral functions from another two stochastic methods [3] besides the Maximum Entropy Method. This allows us to study systematic uncertainties of the dissociation of quarkonium states from temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions. We also estimate heavy quark diffusion coefficients using the low-frequency behavior of vector spectral functions.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonium measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions with ALICE,"Dillenseger, Pascal",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ. (DE),Germany,"Quarkonia, i.e. bound states of $b\bar{b}$ and $c\bar{c}$ quarks, are powerful observables to study the properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. The formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is predicted by lattice calculations at high temperatures as reached at LHC energies, has a strong influence on the production and behavior of quarkonia. A suppression, due to the color screening effect, with respect to the proton-proton results scaled by the number of binary collisions is expected. However, charmonium measurements from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV revealed a smaller suppression than what was observed at lower energies at the SPS and RHIC. Concurrently, the produced J/$\psi$ present a significant elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) in semi-central collisions. These measurements point to a competition between charmonium suppression and (re)generation at LHC energies, with a participation of the charm quarks to the collectivity of the medium. Thus quarkonium measurements offer great possibilities to gain further knowledge about the QGP.

In this presentation, latest ALICE results on the bottomonium and charmonium production in nucleus-nucleus collisions will be presented. This includes measurements of $\Upsilon$(1S) and $\Upsilon$(2S) nuclear modification factors ($R_{\rm AA}$) at forward rapidity and the charmonium $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_{2}$ as a function of centrality, $p_{\rm T}$ and rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

Quarkonia,parallel,Upsilon Measurements in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV with the STAR Experiment,"Wang, Pengfei",University of Science and Technology of China and Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"Measurements of quarkonium production play an important role in understanding the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Quarkonium suppression in the medium due to the color screening effect has been proposed as a direct signature of the QGP formation. However, other effects, such as cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects and regeneration, add additional complications to the interpretation of the observed suppression. Compared to charmonia, bottomonia not only gain less contribution from regeneration due to the smaller b-quark production cross-section, but are also less affected by the CNM effects. Furthermore, different bottomonium states with different binding energies are expected to dissociate at different temperatures, thus measurement of this ""sequential melting"" can help constrain the thermodynamic properties of the medium.

In this talk, we will present the latest measurements of $\Upsilon$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\scriptsize\mbox{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV via both di-muon and di-electron channels by the STAR experiment.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonia productions in heavy ion collisions: coupled Boltzmann transport equations,"Yao, Xiaojun",Duke University,USA,"Quarkonia can be used as probes of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a hot nuclear environment produced in heavy ion collisions. Quarkonia become unbound or ""melt"" at sufficiently high temperature due to the significant screening of the color attraction. In this sense, quarkonia can be thought of as thermometers of QGP. But extracting the melting temperature from experimental measurements is much involved. To this end, we develop a set of coupled Boltzmann transport equations of heavy quarks and quarkonia. It includes elastic and inelastic scattering of heavy quarks with the medium, dissociations and recombinations (in-medium formations) of quarkonia. The dissociation and recombination processes are calculated in potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD). The effective field theory pNRQCD is valid because the heavy quark mass is large and the distance between the heavy quark antiquark pair is small inside quarkonia, compared with the thermal scales. We solve the Boltzmann equations by Monte Carlo simulations with given initial conditions and medium backgrounds. We will present how the system of heavy quarks and quarkonia approaches equilibrium in a static QGP box, which indicates that the dissociation and recombination are implemented in a consistent way. Then we will present calculations with realistic initial conditions and hydrodynamical backgrounds. The initial momenta of heavy quarks and quarkonia are generated from event generators such as Pythia with nuclear parton distribution functions while the initial positions are sampled from binary collisions.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonium Production and Polarization in an Improved Color Evaporation Model,"Vogt, Ramona",LLNL,Unknown,"An improved version of the color evaporation model (ICEM) has been introduced to describe heavy quarkonium production [1].  In contrast to the traditional color evaporation model, the constraint was imposed that the invariant mass of the intermediate heavy quark-antiquark pair must be larger than the mass of produced quarkonium.  A momentum shift between heavy quark-antiquark pair and the quarkonium was also introduced.  Calculations show that the model can describe the charmonium yields as well as ratio of $\psi^\prime$ over $J/\psi$ better than the traditional color evaporation model.

The ICEM has been extended to calculate the polarization of prompt $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$(1S) production for the first time in the color evaporation approach. The first calculations were made at leading order.  The polarization parameter $\lambda_\vartheta$ was calculated as a function of center of mass energy and rapidity in $p+p$ collisions.  The $x_F$ dependence of the polarization was also calculated and compared to experimental results in $p$+Cu and $\pi$+W collisions [2,3].  The next step of calculating the $p_T$ dependence of the polarization has been taken, with a calculation in the $k_T$-factorization approach [4].

This talk will compare the unpolarized $p_T$ distributions for the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$, as well as the $\psi'$ to $J/\psi$ ratio, in $p+p$ collisions at RHIC and the LHC for several energies.  It will also present the polarization results and make comparison to polarization data from RHIC, the Tevatron and the LHC.

Poster Session,poster,"Suppression of high $p_T$ single hadrons and dihadrons in heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}}$ = 0.2, 2.76 and 5.02 TeV","Xie, Man",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"The suppression of high $p_T$ single hadron and dihadron productions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC energies is studied within a NLO pQCD model [1, 2]. The jet quenching effect is included via the medium-modified fragmentation functions based on the higher-twist energy loss formalism [3]. The evolution of the bulk medium is simulated by a (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model which has been tuned to describe the soft hadron production at RHIC and the LHC [4].
A global $\chi^2$ fit is performed for both single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ with the experimental data taken from ALICE, CMS, PHENIX and STAR Collaborations, and the jet transport coefficient $\hat q_0$ is quantitatively extracted for central A+A collisions at both RHIC and the LHC energies. Our results show that $\hat q_0$ extracted from dihadron suppression is consistent with single hadron suppression. We obtain, for energetic quarks, $\hat q_{0}\approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC, while $\hat q_{0}\approx 1.8 \pm 0.5$ GeV$^2$/fm in central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Using the $\hat q_0$ values extracted from central A+A collisions, we obtain good description of the experimental data on single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ in non-central A+A collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 0.2 and 2.76 TeV. We also predict dihadron $I_{AA}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the $\hat{q}_0$ value extracted from single hadron $R_{AA}$.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Measurement of Longitudinal Decorrelation of Anisotropic Flow $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ in 54 and 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Nie, Maowu",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP),Unknown,"The measurement of the decorrelation of flow harmonics, $v_n$, and event plane angles, $\Psi_n$, (or flow vector, $V_n\equiv v_ne^{in\Psi_n}$) in the longitudinal direction explores the non-boost-invariant nature of the initial collision geometry and final state collective dynamics. The decorrelations were first observed at the LHC, but are predicted by several (3+1)D hydrodynamic models to be stronger for lower $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ at RHIC due to the smaller number of initial partons and shorter string length at lower $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We report the results from large minimum-bias Au+Au datasets at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV (1.2 billion events) and 54 GeV (1 billion events) with the STAR detector. The factorization ratio, $r_n(\eta)=3D\langle V_n(-\eta)V_n^*(\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}) \rangle/\langle V_n(\eta)V_n^*(\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}) \rangle$, is used to measure the decorrelation between $\eta$ and $-\eta$ relative to a common reference $\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}$. Non-flow correlations are suppressed by a large rapidity gap between $\eta$ from the TPC ($|\eta|<1$) and the $\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}$ from the Forward Meson Spectrometer ($2.5<\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}<4$). The results are obtained for $v_2$ and $v_3$ as a function of transverse momentum and centrality for the two collision energies. They are compared with results from the LHC and calculations from different models. The decorrelations do not scale trivially with the beam rapidity $y_{beam}$, i.e. $r_n(\eta/y_{beam})$ from different beam energies do not overlap. Hydrodynamic models tuned to the Pb+Pb data at 2760 GeV fail to describe the strength of the decorrelation at 54 and 200 GeV. These results will help to constrain the initial condition along longitudinal direction and help to understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maowu', 'last_name': 'Nie', 'fullName': 'Nie, Maowu', 'id': '3580451', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)', 'emailHash': '0c05d4ac4a0db61e91ab517bd4e3dade', 'db_id': 3580451, 'person_id': 3643244}"
Poster Session,poster,Angular correlations between J/$\psi$ mesons and charged hadrons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE,"Altenkamper, Lucas",University of Bergen (NO),NO,"Due to the different energy scales involved in the production of charmonium states in proton-proton collisions, they provide important testing grounds for the theory of Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). The initial charm-quark pairs are produced in large-$Q^2$ processes that allow for a perturbative treatment while the hadronization into a bound system is non-perturbative.

Different effective theories for the description of charmonium production exist, like the Color Singlet Model, the Color Evaporation Model or the non-relativistic QCD approach. However, none of them describes the production cross-sections and the polarization simultaneously. The correlations of J$/\psi$ mesons and hadrons can provide constraints on the color-singlet or color-octet nature of the pre-resonant charmonium state by measuring the amount of hadronic activity in the vicinity of the J$/\psi$.

In this poster, preliminary ALICE results on the angular correlations between inclusive J$/\psi$ mesons and charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13~\text{TeV}$ will be shown. The high multiplicity triggered data taken by ALICE in Run-2 allows for measurements in high multiplicity events, in addition to the analysis of minimum-bias data.

Poster Session,poster,Constraining heavy-flavour production mechanisms with dielectrons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE,"Dashi, Anisa",Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE),Unknown,"Correlated electron-positron pairs produced in heavy-ion collisions provide an excellent probe of the hot and dense strongly-interacting medium, i.e. the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), created in such systems. They are produced at all stages of the collision without significant final-state interactions. Moreover, thermal radiation from the medium, both during the partonic and the hadronic phase, can be investigated through its internal conversion to e+e- pairs. In the intermediate mass region (1.2 – 2.8 GeV/c2), the measurement of thermal dileptons from the QGP is nevertheless challenging due to the dominant contribution from simultaneous semileptonic decays of correlated open heavy-flavour hadrons. The continuum yield in this mass region is sensitive to the energy loss of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP and further medium effects on the heavy-flavour hadron production. In order to understand the resulting modifications of the dielectron spectrum in heavy-ion collisions, a good understanding of the relevance of the various heavy-quark production mechanisms in proton-proton collisions is mandatory.

In this poster, the latest dielectron invariant-mass spectrum measured with ALICE in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV is used to study the charm production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA event generator. It will be shown how the relative importance of these processes can lead to model dependencies of the extracted charm cross section from a fit of the data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Anisa', 'last_name': 'Dashi', 'fullName': 'Dashi, Anisa', 'id': '3513750', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': 'b14800a07e7037f8bab730954743f232', 'db_id': 3513750, 'person_id': 3658350}"
Poster Session,poster,Insight into thermal modifications of quarkonia from a comparison of continuum-extrapolated lattice results to perturbative QCD,"Kruse, Anna-Lena",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Spectral functions of quarkonia hold many information on bound states and their in-medium modifications as well as on transport properties. Determining spectral functions is subject of many calculations, in lattice QCD as well as in perturbation theory.
We compare continuum extrapolated lattice results [1] to a perturbatively determined spectral function obtained by interpolating between vacuum asymptotics at high frequencies and resummed thermal effects around the threshold [2]. Modest differences are observed, which may originate from non-perturbative mass shifts and renormalization factors. However, in the pseudoscalar channel no resonance peaks are needed for describing the quenched lattice data for charmonium at and above $T \sim  1.1T_c$. In the bottomonium case a good description of the lattice data is obtained with a spectral function containing a single thermally broadened resonance peak at $T$ up to $\sim 1.5T_c$.
The knowledge gained from the pseudoscalar channel is used to improve the studies in the vector channel [3]. In addition to information on the in-medium modification of charmonium and bottomonium bound states, this allows for continuum estimates on the temperature and quark mass dependence of heavy quark diffusion coefficients.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of initial state on thermal photons in heavy ion collisions,"Dasgupta, Pingal",Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre,Unknown,"The experimental measurement of the direct photon $v_2$ and the theoretical prediction for the same differ by a large margin both at RHIC and at the LHC energies. This is known as the ``direct photon puzzle"". We investigate the effect of initial conditions on the production and elliptic flow of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions in detail.


It is well known that the inclusion of fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial condition explains the experimental data on hadronic spectra and elliptic flow better compared to a smooth initial condition and it also increases the production and $v_2$ of photons significantly. In the same spirit, we consider another realistic constraint; initial state nucleon shadowing in the Monte-Carlo Glauber model and investigate the effect of shadowed initial condition on the production and elliptic flow of thermal photons at RHIC and LHC collision conditions [1].

In addition, we calculated the $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow of thermal photons for two different orientations of fully overlapping uranium nuclei at 193A GeV at RHIC using a hydrodynamic model [2]. We see that the elliptic flow from body-body collisions of uranium nuclei is large and comparable to the photon $v_2$ obtained from mid-central collisions of gold nuclei at 200A GeV. We show that the photon results from fully overlapping U+U collisions are complementary to the results from Au+Au collisions at RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,"AdS/CFT predictions for partonic and fragmented momentum, azimuthal, and rapidity correlations of heavy flavors in pA and AA collisions","Hambrock, Robert",University of Cape Town,Unknown,"We compute the suppression, angular, and rapidity distribution of single open heavy flavour and the momentum, angular, and rapidity correlations for pairs of open heavy flavour in pA and AA collisions at RHIC and LHC from an AdS/CFT-based energy loss model. We quantitatively compare the strongly-coupled QGP predictions for AA collisions to the weakly-coupled QGP predictions of Nahrgang et al. 

When restricted to leading order production processes, we predict similar angular correlations for open heavy flavour pairs in a strongly coupled plasma and a weakly coupled plasma, but with an order of magnitude difference in the low momentum momentum correlations. We find that the difference in momentum correlations from the AdS model compared to the pQCD model is, surprisingly, due to tighter momentum correlations in the AdS model than the pQCD model.

When initialised at next-to-leading order (aMC@NLO matched to Herwig++), we observe significant additional broadening of azimuthal correlations.  However, the momentum correlations remain even when NLO production mechanisms are included. Thus, our conclusion for differences in momentum correlations with leading order production processes should carry over to next-to-leading order production processes once comparable predictions for a weakly-coupled QGP emerge. 

We then show quantitative agreement between all measured high momentum open heavy flavour observables in AA collisions at RHIC & LHC and predictions from this new NLO production plus AdS energy loss model using a recent AdS derivation for the spectrum of momentum fluctuations.  Finally, we present first results from this model for open heavy flavour observables in p+A collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robert', 'last_name': 'Hambrock', 'fullName': 'Hambrock, Robert', 'id': '3674506', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': '18c1bdb69390796ffcf8d3b0342e8e6e', 'db_id': 3674506, 'person_id': 3644306}"
Poster Session,poster,Jet modification by MPI and determining the characteristic jet size based on multiplicity dependent jet-shape analysis,"Vertesi, Robert",Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),Unknown,"High multiplicity events of small colliding systems at high c.m.s. energies show similar collective features as those observed in events
of heavy ion collisions with comparable multiplicities, such as long-range near-side correlations and v_n coefficients [1,2]. Whether this behaviour may be attributed to the presence of a deconfined state in small systems is an open question.

Recent analyses of pp and p-Pb collisions also show an universal enhancement of heavy-flavour particles [3], that is usually attributed to multiple parton interactions (MPI) and higher gluon radiation associated with short distance production processes [4,5]. While we cannot expect to be able to apply hard probes on the medium created in the collisions of small systems, phenomena like MPI or Color reconnection (CR) may cause a modification of the jet shapes that can in principle be experimentally accessible.

We have carried out extensive studies using Monte Carlo event generators. We give predictions for multiplicity-dependent jet structures, and propose a way to validate the presence and extent of effects such as MPI or Color Reconnection, based on the detection of non-trivial jet shape modification in high multiplicity events. We also propose a definition of a characteristic jet size measure that is independent of multiplicity [6].

Poster Session,poster,Centrality dependence study of nuclear modification factor of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decay in p-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"De, Sudipan",Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI),Unknown,"The goal of relativistic heavy ion collider experiments is to explore the properties of the strongly interacting matter produced with very high temperature and energy density, conditions under which the formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is expected. Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty are sensitive probes of the QGP as they are produced in the initial stages of the collision and witness the entire evolution of the system. Measurements in p-Pb collisions help understanding Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects such as the modification of the nuclear Parton Distribution Function (nPDF) with respect to the expectation from proton PDF, parton momentum ($k_{\rm T}$) broadening from soft scattering processes and parton energy loss in nuclear matter. Studies of heavy-flavour production in different centrality intervals can provide information on the dependence of CNM effects on the collision geometry and on the density of final-state particles. In addition, these allow us to study the interplay between the hard and soft processes in heavy-flavour production. In this contribution, we will present the $p_{T}$-differential cross-section of heavy-flavour decay electrons for different centrality intervals in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at mid-rapidity ($|\eta| <$ 0.8). The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was used to identify the electrons in 2 $< p_{T} <$ 8 GeV/c and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) was used to extend the $p_{T}$ range up to 16 GeV/c. The nuclear modification factor, $Q_{pPb}$, ratio of transverse momentum spectra in p-Pb collisions and the corresponding cross section in pp collisions scaled by the nuclear overlap function, and the central-to-peripheral ratio $Q_{cp}$, ratio of transverse momentum spectra measured at central collisions to that from peripheral collisions, scaled by the corresponding nuclear overlap functions, will be presented for different centrality intervals of p-Pb events.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sudipan', 'last_name': 'De', 'fullName': 'De, Sudipan', 'id': '3513793', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI)', 'emailHash': '3bb34873415b04f98259ab0931a71542', 'db_id': 3513793, 'person_id': 3639898}"
Poster Session,poster,Event-by-event cumulants of partonic eccentricity and flow harmonic,"Ma, Long",Fudan University,Unknown,"We report a comprehensive study on the initial-state partonic eccentricity fluctuation and final-state anisotropic flow fluctuation in Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV using a multiphase transport model. Event-by-event eccentricity and flow anisotropy are characterized by multi-particle cumulants up to fourth order harmonic. Experimental results of azimuthal anisotropy fluctuation by means of cumulants are well reproduced by our model simulation [1]. Results of initial eccentricity and their fluctuations in terms of second-, fourth- and sixth-order cumulants for different order of harmonics as function of centrality,  transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) are presented. The ratio of the eccentricities $\varepsilon\left\{4\right\}/\varepsilon\left\{2\right\}$ and $\varepsilon\left\{6\right\}/\varepsilon\left\{4\right\}$ are shown in comparison with the ratio of the corresponding flow harmonics. The conversion coefficients $v_{n}$/$\varepsilon_{n}$ (n=2,3,4) are explored based on the cumulant method. We show that higher harmonic $v_{n}$/$\varepsilon_{n}$ (n$>=$3) show similar trend but exhibit quantitative difference in comparison with $v_{2}$/$\varepsilon_{2}$ [2]. We investigate further the role of partonic and hadronic scatterings in anisotropic flow and flow fluctuation development. We show that collisions between initial active partons are directly responsible for not only the development of anisotropic flow but also flow fluctuation [3]. Relevant physics on the connections between higher-order cumulant eccentricities and flow harmonics is discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Magnetohydrodynamics with chiral anomaly: phases of collective excitations and instabilities,"Hattori, Koichi",Fudan University,Unknown,"We study the relativistic hydrodynamics with chiral anomaly and dynamical electromagnetic fields. This theory is called the chiral magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [1]. It is a framework that can evolve the system of QGP fluids and electromagnetic fields consistently, and it will play an important role in quantifying anomaly-induced effects in heavy-ion collisions. We formulate the chiral MHD as a low-energy effective theory based on a derivative expansion. We demonstrate that the modification of ordinary MHD due to chiral anomaly can be obtained from the second law of thermodynamics and is tied to the chiral magnetic effect with the universal coefficient. When the chirality imbalance exceeds a critical value, a new type of collective gapless excitation emerges, as a result of the interplay among magnetic field, flow velocity, and chiral anomaly; we call it the chiral  magnetohelical mode (CMHM). These modes carry definite magnetic and fluid helicities and either grow exponentially or dissipate in time, depending on the relative sign between their helicity and axial charge density. The presence of exponentially growing CMHM indicates a hydrodynamic instability.

Poster Session,poster,Thermodynamic and magnetic properties of hot QCD medium in a strong magnetic field,"Rath, Subhalaxmi",Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Unknown,"We have investigated the equation of state of a hot QCD medium with two light flavors in a strong magnetic field, which may be produced in the non-central events at RHIC and LHC. We have cal- culated the thermodynamic observables up to one-loop perturbatively in real-time formalism, where the quark contribution is largely affected by the magnetic field whereas the gluon component is least affected except for the softening of the screening mass. For example, the presence of a strong magnetic field makes the pressure of hot QCD medium larger and the dependence of pressure on the tempera- ture becomes less steep compared to the dependence of the pressure on the magnetic field. This can be understood from the dominant scale of thermal medium in the strong magnetic field, being the magnetic field, in the same way that the temperature dominates in a thermal medium in the absence of magnetic field. the dependence of pressure on the temperature becomes less steep. Consistent with the above observations, the entropy density is found to decrease with the temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field which is again consistent with the fact that the strong magnetic field restricts the dynamics of quarks to two dimensions, hence the phase-space becomes squeezed resulting in the reduction of the number of microstates. Due to the aforesaid reasoning, the energy density of hot QCD medium is seen to decrease, hence the speed of sound of thermal is increased due to the presence of a strong magnetic field. These findings could have implications on the expansion of the medium produced at RHIC and LHC and influence the outcomes of various signatures. Finally we determine the magnetization and susceptibility for several temperatures in strong magnetic field, where the paramagnetic response increases with the temperature. Hence a portion of QGP may be squeezed perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field, which is quantified by the enhancement of elliptic flow.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Subhalaxmi', 'last_name': 'Rath', 'fullName': 'Rath, Subhalaxmi', 'id': '3707716', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee', 'emailHash': '90ee5b06e2e0bb99092a860562344800', 'db_id': 3707716, 'person_id': 3635439}"

We train a deep convolutional neutral network on jet images. The classification performance is compared with the multivariate analysis of several physically-constructed jet observables including the jet mass, the $p_T^D$, the multiplicity and the radial moments. We also compare with the systematic $N$-subjet expansion in the recently developed telescoping jet deconstruction framework to exploit the information carried by the subjets. The quark and gluon jet samples generated from the JEWEL simulation are used as an example to demonstrate this general method. We find that the classification performance goes down in the JEWEL-simulated heavy ion collisions. The information carried by the subleading subjets can be washed out by the possible subjet thermalization or randomization due to the soft event activities. Our method provides a systematically improvable framework for analyzing and comparing jet simulations and measurements in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yang-Ting', 'last_name': 'Chien', 'fullName': 'Chien, Yang-Ting', 'id': '3708802', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': 'cbb5ee8809f3b0e78b339b083ec0d3fb', 'db_id': 3708802, 'person_id': 3640577}"

The detector will be instrumented with Si-pad sensors with analog readout and on a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) based digital pixel readout.

We argue that, while one can study the impact of initial inhomogeneities by varying their size, it is important to maintain the global properties fixed.

We present a method to do this by systematically smoothening the initial conditions, and apply it to four common initial condition models. We show that many observables are insensitive to the the hot spot sizes, including integrated $v_n$, scaled distributions of $v_n$, symmetric cumulants, event-plane correlations,  and differential $v_n(p_T)$. We find however that the factorization breaking ratio $r_n$ and sub-leading component in a Principal Component Analysis are more sensitive to the initial granularity and can be used to probe short-scale features of the initial density.

We develop a (3+1)-dimensional hybrid evolution model with dynamical sources for both energy-momentum and the net baryon current. During an initial pre-equilibrium stage based on UrQMD, the four-momenta and baryon numbers carried by secondary particles created within UrQMD are fed continuously, after a short thermalization time, into a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic evolution module. This initialization provides an alternate model to those recently studied by Petersen ${\it et~al}$. [1] and Shen and Schenke [2]: It thermalizes more rapidly than Ref. [1] and yields a different initial net baryon distribution than Ref. [2]. We present and compare with these previous approaches the dynamical evolution of all thermodynamic and dissipative degrees of freedom, including net baryon diffusion. The sensitivity of experimental observables (spectra and anisotropic flows) to the details of the pre-equilibrium stage and to baryon diffusion will also be demonstrated.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Directed Flow of Quarks from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Measured by STAR,"Wang, Gang",UCLA,USA,"Directed flow ($v_1$) is a good probe of the early-stage dynamics of collision systems, and the $v_1$ slope ($dv_1/dy$) at mid-rapidity is sensitive to the system's equation of state. Previously, a coalescence picture has been used to relate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified particles to the $v_2$ of their constituent quarks [1]. In this talk, the coalescence idea is extended to study the $v_1$ of the constituent quarks - this includes quarks produced in the collision, as well as those transported from the initial-state nuclei. Rather than probe coalescence of $v_2$ versus $p_T$, we focus on $dv_1/dy$ versus $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$.

We report STAR measurements of $v_1(y)$ for ten particle species ($\pi^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\phi$, $K^\pm$ and $K^0_{S}$) in Au+Au collisions at eight beam energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV to 200 GeV. The $v_1$ slopes of $\bar{p}$, $K^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ are used to test the coalescence sum rule for produced quarks.  We hypothesize that the $v_n$ of observed mesons and baryons is the summed $v_n$ of their constituent quarks, and it is assumed that deconfined quarks have already acquired azimuthal anisotropy. Data involving produced quarks support the coalescence picture at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 11.5$ GeV to 200 GeV, and a sharp deviation from this picture is observed at 7.7 GeV [2].

The $dv_1/dy$ of transported quarks are studied via net particles (net $p$, net $K$ and net $\Lambda$). The net-particle $dv_1/dy$ data for $p$, $K$ and $\Lambda$ agree at and above $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 14.5$ GeV, but net kaons begin to diverge with decreasing beam energy. Tests of the coalescence sum rule are carried out for net particles, and implications for transported quark $v_1$ are discussed.

Collective dynamics,parallel,System size dependence of flow observables in hydrodynamic simulations,"Luzum, Matthew",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,Unknown,"Valuable information about the behavior of a heavy-ion collision system can be obtained by changing the species of colliding nuclei, and in particular using species of different size.  This change in system size can probe characteristic behavior in a way that is not possible with a single collision system.  Already, results of small collisions systems such as  p-p, p-A, d-A, and $^3$He have received much attention. Recently, the LHC performed $^{129}$Xe-$^{129}$Xe collisions, a system with a size that is intermediate between small systems like p-p and large systems like Pb-Pb, at almost the same collision energy.  

We perform hydrodynamic simulations of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions and argue that hydrodynamic behavior dictates definite relations between the results, regardless of the details of the simulations, due to scaling laws inherent to fluid dynamics.  This can be used to test the hydrodynamic framework in general and search for a breakdown of hydrodynamics with decreasing system size.  

Conversely, one can extract detailed information about system properties by studying carefully-selected observables.  For example, the relative elliptic flow of the two systems in very central collisions is sensitive to the expected prolate deformation of the Xenon nucleus.   Additionally, we describe a procedure to determine the average viscosity in a model-independent way by comparing selected ratios of flow coefficients in the two systems.

Using the Schwinger propagator in the lowest Landau level, we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of the retarded gluon self-energy in a strong magnetic field using the real-time formalism. The aforesaid self-energy computes the resummed retarded and symmetric propagators whose static limits embody the effects of the medium into the real and imaginary part of both short- and long-distance components of $Q \bar Q$ interaction in vacuum. In strong magnetic field, the large-distance interaction is affected more than the shot-distance interaction, as a result, the real part of potential becomes more attractive. On the other hand, due to the dimensional reduction, the magnitude of imaginary part becomes smaller compared to a thermal medium in absence of strong magnetic field. We have found that the average radii of the quarkonia get reduced and become more strongly bound in presence of the strong
magnetic field. However, further increase of the magnetic field results in the decrease of binding energies. In the presence of strong magnetic field, the decay width of the resonances becomes smaller and the dependence on magnetic field becomes less steep than the dependence on temperature. Having discussed the properties of quarkonia, we have estimated the magnetic field beyond which
the resonances go to the continuum due to Landau damping, where we found that $\psi^\prime$ and $\chi_c$ in a hot QCD medium are dissociated relatively at larger magnetic fields, $eB= 4~m_\pi^2$ and $5~m_\pi^2$, compared to the dissociation by the color screening mechanism only.

High-level correlations of $\rho(p_T,\phi)$ are learned by the neural network, which acts as an effective ``EoS-meter"" in distinguishing the nature of the QCD transition. The EoS-meter is robust against many simulation inputs, such as shear viscosity, freeze-out temperature, equilibration time and collision energy.

Poster Session,poster,Photon Hadron Discrimination in Photon Multiplicity Detector,"Varma, Raghava",I.I.T. Bombay,India,"A density based algorithm has been applied for clustering of cell-hits in the Photon Multiplicity Detector(PMD) installed in the ALICE experiment at CERN. This approach is shown to produce better clustering and thus better correlation among the cell-hits on the two planes of PMD and high energy primary photons. Sixteen features are ex- tracted from the clusters and three multivariate techniques, namely Boosted Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines and Bayesian Neural Networks are used to obtain a classification of hits as either photons or hadrons. The final result is shown to have both a better efficiency as well as better purity of particle identification than the cut based scheme. This has important implications in the search for the Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCC) conjectured to be formed in relativistic collisions. This is primarily because the cut based analysis relies on high energy cuts on the energy of the photons to obtain reasonable efficiency and purity.  This would eliminate low energy photons resulting from the decay of off-shell pions. The work in important as it would be a direct signature of chiral phase transition in these collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raghava', 'last_name': 'Varma', 'fullName': 'Varma, Raghava', 'id': '3731668', 'affiliation': 'I.I.T.

Poster Session,poster,Energy dependence of $\phi (1020)$ production at mid-rapidity in pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC,"Tripathy, Sushanta",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"Hadronic resonances are unique tools to investigate the interplay of re-scattering and regeneration effects in the hadronic phase of heavy-ion collisions. As the $\phi$ meson has a longer lifetime compared to other resonances, it is expected that its production will not be affected by regeneration and re-scattering processes. Measurements in small collision systems such as proton-proton (pp) collisions provide a necessary baseline for heavy-ion data and they help to tune pQCD inspired event generators. Being an $\mathrm{s\bar{s}}$ quark pair with zero net-strangeness content, measurements of $\phi$ meson production contribute to the study of strangeness production in small systems.

We report on measurements with the ALICE detector at the LHC of $\phi$ meson production in minimum bias pp collisions at different beam energies and as a function of charged particle multiplicity. The results include the transverse momentum $(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ distributions of $\phi$ as well as the $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$ values and particle yield ratios. The key question that will be addressed is whether there is a dependence of the relative $\phi$ production in pp collisions on the collision energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sushanta', 'last_name': 'Tripathy', 'fullName': 'Tripathy, Sushanta', 'id': '3528400', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '8f5b0a160c43573de5ffccfdca99a6b5', 'db_id': 3528400, 'person_id': 3638083}"

Poster Session,poster,f0(980) resonance production in pp collisions with the ALICE detector at LHC,"Lorenzo, Alessandra","Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)",Unknown,"We report on a preliminary study of the production of f$_{0}$(980)$\rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-}$  at mid-rapidity ($\vert y \vert$ < 0.5) performed with the ALICE detector at the LHC in minimum bias pp collisions at centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{\mathit{s}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The f$_{0}$(980) signal extraction is challenging due to the large background from correlated $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs from resonance decays in the invariant mass window under study, as well as due to the combinatorics from uncorrelated pairs. We present in detail the strategy followed for the signal extraction and first results in terms of $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-dependent production yields. Results are discussed and compared with production yields of other resonances and stable hadrons.
Short-lived hadronic resonances are a useful sampling tool for the late hadronic phase of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions since their lifetimes are of the same order of magnitude as the time span between the chemical and kinetic freeze-out, tipically estimated to be about 10 fm/$c$ for central collisions. Our study in pp collisions provides a feasibility check and constitutes a reference for the measurement in high-multiplicity events (p-Pb, Pb-Pb). 
The nature of the f$_0$(980) remains elusive: different interpretation of this resonance including $q\bar{q}$ states, bound states of hadrons such as $K\bar{K}$, and as tetraquark candidate are available. Studies in different collision systems are particularly interesting because they can provide information about the nature of this particle.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alessandra', 'last_name': 'Lorenzo', 'fullName': 'Lorenzo, Alessandra', 'id': '3513874', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN, Bologna (IT)', 'emailHash': 'f11a7528862ce4e9d3544bbd5a4ed035', 'db_id': 3513874, 'person_id': 3640346}"
Poster Session,poster,Dimuon Invariant Mass Spectra with the Muon Telescope Detector at STAR in p+p collisions at 200 GeV,"Brandenburg, James",Rice University,USA,"Dileptons ($l^+l^-$) are produced throughout all stages of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) through various production mechanisms. Since leptons have a small interaction cross section with the strongly interacting medium, they carry information about the medium from the early stages to the final state of the system. For this reason, dileptons provide an essential tool for studying the properties of the strongly interacting medium produced in HICs. Dileptons produced within the intermediate mass region (IMR, $M_\phi$<$M_{ll}$<$M_{J/\psi}$) result predominantly from the decay of correlated charm but also arise from thermal radiation of the hot and dense medium. The inverse slope parameter of the thermally produced dileptons in the IMR provides a measurement of the medium's temperature at early times which is free from radial flow effects [1]. The installation of the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) at STAR allows a measurement of the dimuon ($\mu^+\mu^-$) production over a large invariant mass range for the first time. Data has been collected with the full MTD from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and from p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. These two datasets allow for new opportunities to measure the dimuon invariant mass spectra at STAR.

As a first step towards measuring the thermal dimuon invariant mass spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, this talk will present the baseline dimuon measurement in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The dimuon invariant mass spectra in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV will be presented and the viability of measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Non-linear dynamical systems approach to out of equilibrium hydrodynamical attractors: the Gubser flow case,"Cruz Camacho, Nikolás",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Unknown,"Attractors for relativistic hydrodynamics have been found recently in weakly and strong coupling physical systems. The existence of hydrodynamical attractor provides a firm theoretical foundation for the applicability of hydrodynamics in far-from-equilibrium conditions. In this work we explain how the non-equilibrium attractors of systems undergoing Gubser flow within relativistic kinetic theory can be established on general grounds by using methods of nonlinear dynamical systems. Namely we find the fixed points and investigate the structure of flow diagrams of the evolution equations and characterize the basin of attraction using a Lyapunov function near the stable fixed point. We obtain the attractors of anisotropic hydrodynamics, Israel-Stewart (IS) and transient fluid (DNMR) theories and show that they are indeed non-planar and the basin of attraction is essentially three dimensional. The attractors of each hydrodynamical model are compared with the one obtained from the exact Gubser solution of the Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation. We observe that the anisotropic hydrodynamics is able to match up to high numerical accuracy the attractor of the exact solution while the second order hydrodynamical theories fail to describe it. Our findings indicate that anisotropic hydrodynamics is an effective theory for far-from-equilibrium fluid dynamics which resums the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers to all orders.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nikolás', 'last_name': 'Cruz Camacho', 'fullName': 'Cruz Camacho, Nikolás', 'id': '3530972', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia', 'emailHash': 'bb97c12b591efa783957e7f14b01681a', 'db_id': 3530972, 'person_id': 3644420}"
Poster Session,poster,Direct flow of heavy mesons as unique probes of the initial Electro-Magnetic fields in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy Ion collisions,"Coci, Gabriele",INFN - National Institute for Nuclear Physics,UK,"In Ultra-relativistic Heavy-Ion Collision (HIC) very strong initial electro-magnetic (e.m.) fields are created inducing a vorticity in the reaction plane that is odd under charge exchange, allowing to distinguish it from the large vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum conservation. Conjointly thanks to its mass, $M_{b,c}>>\Lambda_{QCD}$, there should be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics. We show that such e.m. field entails a transverse motion of both heavy quarks (HQ), bottom and charm, resulting in a splitting of directed flow $v_1$ of D(B) and anti-D (anti-B)  of few percent, i.e. much larger compared to pions. The considerable effect is due to a combination of several favorable conditions for HQ, mainly: (i) unlike light quarks formation time scale of HQ is comparable to the time scale when the e.m. field attains its maximum value and (ii) the kinetic relaxation time is similar to the QGP lifetime, which allows the HQ to retain the initial kick picked up from the electromagnetic field in the transverse direction. Hence HQs provide very crucial and independent information on the strength of the electro-magnetic field produced in HIC,
moreover the effect comes out of a delicate balance between the magnetic and the electric field supplying a novel probe of the electric conductivity of the QGP. Moreover, the impact of a Langevin vs a Boltzmann transport of HQ in the medium is also investigated.

Poster Session,poster,Equation of state for QCD with a critical point from the 3D Ising Model,"Parotto, Paolo",University of Houston,Unknown,"Currently, one of the major investigations in heavy ion physics concerns the search for the QCD high temperature critical
point associated with the chiral transition, which has stimulated tremendous effort from both theory and experiment. On the theory side, a major role in the analysis of experimental results is played by hydrodynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions, which need as an input an equation of state driving the evolution of the system. Current knowledge of the finite-density QCD equation of state from first principles is limited to a Taylor expansion in the baryonic chemical potential around $\mu_B = 0$.

By means of a scaling form for the equation of state of the 3D Ising model and a non-universal, parametrized map to QCD coordinates, we construct an equation of state matching state of the art first principle Lattice QCD calculations and including the correct critical behavior, which can be readily employed in hydrodynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions at finite density, covering most of the BES range at RHIC.

The parametrized form of this equation of state can be exploited to constrain the value of the parameters themselves by imposing thermodynamic consistency and through comparison of predictions obtained by simulations with experimental results.
