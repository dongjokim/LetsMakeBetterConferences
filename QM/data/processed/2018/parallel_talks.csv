QCD at high temperature,parallel,Electric conductivity of hot and dense quark matter in a magnetic field with Landau level resummation via kinetic equations,"Fukushima, Kenji",The University of Tokyo,Unknown,"This talk is based on 1711.01472 in which the longitudinal electric conductivity of hot and dense magnetized quark matter has been computed with full Landau level resummation which requires several nontrivial theoretical techniques.  In contrast to the lowest Landau level approximation, there is no singularity in the massless limit, and we find that the resultant electric conductivity is surprisingly consistent with the qualitative features observed in condensed matter (using Weyl semimetals) experiment for the signature of the chiral magnetic effect.  This means that our calculation correctly captures the essence of the topologically induced currents.  Because the mass and magnetic dependence of the conductivity is found to be mild after the Landau level resummation, we also make a quantitative comparison with the recent lattice QCD simulation results without magnetic field to confirm that our estimate is again surprisingly consistent with the lattice-QCD values.  We can apply our calculation to the finite density case, which provides us with theoretical predictions relevant for the beam energy scan program at finite density.  Since quarks are enhanced but anti-quarks are suppressed, the longitudinal electric conductivity stays rather constant, which is intuitively natural, but this is theoretically seen only after subtracting coupling to hydrodynamic zero modes correctly.  Not only the longitudinal conductivity (that is related to the chiral magnetic effect) but also the transverse conductivities will be discussed.  At finite density, in fact, one component of the transverse electric conductivities newly grows up, that is the Hall conductivity.  The Hall conductivity could result in more prospective effects observable in the heavy-ion collision experiment, which will be suggested in this talk.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kenji', 'last_name': 'Fukushima', 'fullName': 'Fukushima, Kenji', 'id': '3529156', 'affiliation': 'The University of Tokyo', 'emailHash': '7a7131b5f31f91747d95603ed64ff469', 'db_id': 3529156, 'person_id': 3639021}"

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,PHENIX Results on elliptic and triangular flow from the small-system  geometry scan at 200 GeV,"Morrow, Sylvia Irene",Vanderbilt University (US),USA,"Using the extraordinary versatility of RHIC in selecting different colliding 
species, the PHENIX experiment has collected data in p+Al, p+Au, d+Au, and $^{3}$He$+$Au at 200 GeV center-of-mass energy and conducted a comprehensive set of anisotropic flow measurements. These geometry-controlled experiments provide a unique testing ground for theoretical models that produce azimuthal particle correlations based on initial and/or final state effects.

New results that will be presented at this conference include a complete set of
triangular anisotropies of inclusive charged particles and final results on 
identified pion, kaon and proton $v_2(p_T)$. The $v_3$ measurements are particularly sensitive to the initial-state fluctuations and the duration of the hot matter stage; the mass-ordered splitting in $v_2(p_T)$ provides information about the role of early-stage collective flow and late-stage hadronic rescattering.

Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,PHENIX measurement of low momentum direct photon radiation  from p$+$p and p$+$A collisions,"Khachatryan, Vladimir",Stony Brook University,USA,"In recent years data from small collision systems at LHC and RHIC have revealed
evidence for collective behavior of the produced hadrons. Collective behavior in
small systems clearly points towards a strongly coupled system being formed in
these collisions. If so, the matter formed must also radiate thermal or low 
momentum direct photons. PHENIX is ideally positioned to search for any indications for thermal photon emission from small systems.

The versatility of RHIC allowed PHENIX to collect large data sets with a high 
multiplicity trigger for p+p, p+A, d+Au and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions at 200 GeV. These data sets are being analyzed with the methods already developed for the 
measurement of low momentum direct photons from Au+Au collisions. Photons are measured through their conversions to electron-positron pairs in the material of the PHENIX vertex detector, and the fraction of direct photons is determined
after tagging photons from neutral pion decays. In this talk we will present

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,PHENIX study of the initial state with forward hadron measurements in  200 GeV p(d)+A and $^{3}$He$+$Au collisions,"Bryslawskyj, Jason","City University of New York, Graduate Center, Baruch College",Unknown,"Forward hadron measurements in p(d)+A provide a signal to study nuclear 
shadowing, initial state energy loss and/or gluon saturation effects as a function of rapidity, centrality and energy. High $p_T$ identified $\pi^{0}$ measurements are also an essential first step toward measuring prompt photon production. The $\pi^{0}$ measurements are enabled by the PHENIX MPC-EX detector, a Si-W preshower detector located in front of Muon Piston Calorimeter (MPC), expanding the neutral pion reconstruction capabilities in the rapidity range $3.1< \eta <3.8$  out to high energies, $E < 80$ GeV.  Previous PHENIX measurements of punch-through charged hadrons in the muon arms in the rapidity range $1.4< \vert \eta \vert <2.2$ were significantly improved through the capability of the forward silicon vertex detector (FVTX) to determine the transverse momentum and rapidity with high precison and reject background from secondary hadrons.

PHENIX collected d+Au data with the MPC-EX in the 2016 run at

The azimuthal correlations with respect to the second- and third-order event planes are explored as a function of pseudorapidity, transverse momentum, and event multiplicity, which provides new insights into the underlying background correlations. By employing an event-shape engineering technique, a linear dependence of charge-dependent correlations on the second-order anisotropy flow (v2) is observed, and the upper limits on the v2-independent fraction, which is directly related to the CME signal, are obtained at 95% confidence level for both pPb and PbPb collisions.

The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of charged hadrons used in the analysis were measured in the kinematic range of $0.15 < p_{\rm T} < 50$ GeV/$c$ and $ |\eta|< 0.8$. The charged hadron spectra from Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions are divided in nine centrality intervals in the range of 0-80 %. As we achieved significantly smaller systematic uncertainties in the current analysis, the previously published results from p-Pb and Pb-Pb (2.76 TeV) collisions were reanalyzed.

Neutral mesons were reconstructed through their two-photons decays. The photons were measured via several complementary methods, using eighter the central tracking system identifying photons converted to $e^{+} e^{-}$ pairs in the material of the inner barrel detectors or the electromagnetic calorimeters. Thus we used the respective advantages of the detectors, i.e. the excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low transverse momenta and the high reconstruction efficiency and triggering capability of calorimeters. This approach allowed to measure the neutral meson spectra in wide range of transverse momenta.

In this talk we will  report a measurement of the nuclear modification factors of primary charged particles and of light neutral mesons in Pb--Pb (2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV), in Xe-Xe (5.44 TeV) and in p-Pb (5.02 TeV) collisions with ALICE at the LHC. We compare the nuclear modification factors obtained for different collision systems as a function of transverse momentum, collision centrality as well as charged particle multiplicity (${\rm d}N_{{\rm ch}}/\rm{d}\eta$).

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,JETSCAPE 1.0: The first software release of the JETSCAPE collaboration,"Kauder, Kolja",Wayne State University,United States,"The Jet Energy-loss Tomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope (JETSCAPE) Collaboration is developing an innovative modular event generator to be used by the wider community. In this talk we highlight the performance of the year-1 release of the JETSCAPE software, which consists of an overall framework program, and of several physics modules. The framework organizes the order in which different modules are called, how these can interact with each other, and how the final results are stored or written out. The physics modules provide individual energy loss schemes synchronized by the framework. 

The year-1 setup invokes TRENTO for the initial energy density distribution for nucleus-nucleus collisions, which is then used as the initial state for the MUSIC fluid dynamics event generator. The initial binary collision profile from TRENTO is sampled to call PYTHIA events, which generate hard outgoing partons. The passage of these partons through the space-time profile generated by MUSIC is simulated via four different energy loss modules: HYBRID, LBT, MARTINI and MATTER. These can be combined for multi-stage event generation. Hadronization is carried out via Cooper-Frye for the soft medium, and via PYTHIA for the hard sector. 

Comparison with experimental results and the resulting determination of input parameters is performed using statistical emulators using Bayesian techniques. In this presentation, we outline the experimental observables that can be successfully described using such a next-generation event generator and discuss the upcoming improvements and enhancements of the year-2 software.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kolja', 'last_name': 'Kauder', 'fullName': 'Kauder, Kolja', 'id': '3644366', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': '52c8368a4c65978926d2fba88c228dd0', 'db_id': 3644366, 'person_id': 3824417}"

It is based on the conservation laws for charge, energy, momentum, and angular momentum. The conservation laws lead to hydrodynamic equations for the charge density, local temperature, and fluid velocity, as well as for the spin polarization tensor. The resulting set of differential equations extends the standard picture of perfect-fluid hydrodynamics, with a conserved entropy current, in a minimal way.

In addition, the properties of the relativistic spin density matrices for spin-1/2 particles, which have been used recently in works on the polarization of Lambda hyperons, are discussed. Their relations to the Pauli-Lubański four-vector and different forms of the spin tensor are elucidated. 

The proposed framework forms a basis for hydrodynamic interpretation of polarization measurements in heavy-ion collisions.

The study of CME has attracted significant recent interest across many disciplines from condensed matter to nuclear physics. ***An experimental observation of CME in heavy ion collisions would further provide the tantalizing evidence for the chiral symmetry restoration as well as QCD topological fluctuations.*** Currently the most pressing theoretical challenge is the quantitative modeling of CME while also accounting for background contamination. We report a significant step forward toward this goal, by ***the development of the full-fledged Event-By-Event Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (EBE-AVFD) framework***. The EBE-AVFD starts with event-wise initial conditions for the bulk+axial charge+magnetic fields, simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the bulk fluid evolution from either VISHNU or MUSIC (both being validated with extensive soft observable data) on an event-by-event basis, to be followed by an event-wise URQMD hadron cascade stage. The millions of simulation events would then be analyzed with ***the same observables and methods as the experimental analysis***. We show systematic computation results for charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in **CuCu, AuAu and UU collisions at RHIC**, to be compared with available experimental data. After such verification step, we finally present the state-of-the-art **quantitative predictions for the CME signals in isobaric collisions (RuRu v.s.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Search for the Chiral Magnetic Wave with Anisotropic Flow of Identified Particles at RHIC-STAR,"Shou, Qiye",SINAP/BNL,USA,"The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) has been theorized to propagate in the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It could cause a finite electric quadrupole moment of the collision system, and may be observed by charge asymmetry, $A_{\rm ch}$, dependence of elliptic flow of positively and negatively charged hadrons. However, non-CMW mechanisms such as Local charge conservation (LCC) and hydrodynamics with isospin effect [1], could also contribute to the experimental observations.

In this talk, we present the STAR measurements of elliptic flow, $v_{2}$, and triangular flow, $v_{3}$, of charged pions, along with $v_{2}$ of charged kaons and protons, as a function of $A_{\rm ch}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. The similarity between pion and kaon slopes suggests that the isospin effect is not the dominant mechanism. The slope parameters of $\Delta v_{2}$($A_{\rm ch}$) and $\Delta v_{3}$($A_{\rm ch}$) are reported and compared in different centrality and transverse momentum intervals to investigate the LCC background. The difference between the normalized $\Delta v_{2}$ and $\Delta v_{3}$ slopes, along with the measurements in small systems (p+Au and d+Au at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV), will be presented. Our data favor the CMW interpretation and disfavor the possibility that the observations result from LCC or hydrodynamics at RHIC energies.

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Breaking Boost Invariance: IP-Glasma Phenomenology Beyond 2D,"McDonald, Scott",McGill University,Unknown,"We present a novel formulation of the IP-Glasma initial state model in 3+1D, where the 2D boost invariant IP-Glasma is generalized to 3D through JIMWLK rapidity evolution of the pre-collision Wilson lines [1]. By breaking boost invariance, the 3D model no longer trivially satisfies Gauss' law at the initial time, and we now enforce it locally. We compare the time evolution of the chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fields in the 3D case with the boost invariant result.

As the longitudinal dynamics of heavy ion collisions are measured to greater levels of precision, it is imperative that theoretical models describe the 3-dimensional nature of the Quark Gluon Plasma. We couple our 3D IP-Glasma model to MUSIC+UrQMD, for a fully 3-dimensional simulation of heavy ion collisions, and study the rapidity dependence of the second Fourier harmonic v2(η) and the charged hadron multiplicity dNch /dη.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Lambda polarization in heavy ion collisions: from RHIC BES to LHC energies,"Karpenko, Iurii",SUBATECH Nantes,Unknown,"In hydrodynamic picture of heavy ion collisions, local thermal vorticity of the QGP fluid leads to polarization of nonzero spin hadrons produced out of it [1]. The nonzero polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons has been recently discovered by STAR in non-central Au-Au collisions in RHIC Beam Energy Scan program [2].

 We further study the predictions of the hydrodynamic model for different components of the $\Lambda$ polarization in the framework of 3-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model with UrQMD initial state, and demonstrate that:

 1. at RHIC Beam Energy Scan energies, the global polarization $P$ of produced Lambda is directed along the total angular momentum of the fireball (perpendicular to reaction plane). $P$ decreases with collision energy from 1.7 to 0.2% [3], in agreement with STAR results [2]. The global $\Lambda$ polarization further decreases towards LHC energies,

 2. at full RHIC and LHC energies, the dominant component of polarization is the one in the beam direction. This component has a quadrupole structure in transverse momentum plane. Its amplitude $f_2$ shows a mild decrease with collision energy, and it is thus detectable at LHC enegries.

We show that different components of polarization are driven by different properties of the hydrodynamic expansion: whereas the global polarization $P$ is a result of initial shear flow in the reaction plane, $f_2$ is driven by anisotropy of the transverse expansion (which is also responsible for elliptic flow $v_2$). Polarization component in the beam direction is a generic effect present even in a simple 2-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation with longitudinal boost invariance [4].

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Phi Meson and K* Spin Alignment in High Energy Nuclear Collisions at STAR,"Zhou, Chensheng",SINAP/BNL,USA,"The large initial global angular momentum in non-central collisions, when acting together with spin-orbital coupling, can lead to global polarization of produced quarks.

Vector mesons, unlike hyperons which have large contributions from resonance decay, are originated predominantly from primordial production, and their alignment are generally additive. Thus, the spin alignment of vector meson is expected to be sensitive to different hadronization scenarios [1] and the vorticity of the colliding system [2-4]. 

We present STAR's measurement of the global spin alignment of φ and K* vector mesons for Au + Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39 and 200 GeV.

The $\rho_{00}$ measurement based on the 1st- and 2nd-order event plane will be presented and the relationship between the two will be discussed.  The result will be shown as a function of the transverse momentum, the collision centrality and the beam energy. The implications of our results on the vorticity and the hadronization scenarios will be discussed. The dependence on the emission angle with respect to the reaction plane will be presented and compared to model calculations. The dependence on event-by-event charge asymmetry and its implication on the chiral separation effect under the initial magnetic field will also be discussed.

Initial studies by ALICE showed that the magnitude of the three particle correlator used in the search for the CME is comparable at the LHC and at RHIC. Recent results from the ALICE and CMS experiments have shown that the magnitude of these correlators are similar in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions for events with similar multiplicity, which indicates that the measured correlations are dominated by effects not related to the magnetic field and the CME.

Its space-time evolution can be studied by means of real-time lattice gauge theory simulation techniques with dynamical quarks. To find observable consequences of such nonequilibrium evolution, the understanding of quark dynamics is crucial since they couple to electromagnetic probes. We present results for nonequilibrium quark production in the longitudinally expanding QCD plasma. We find that the quark number density per unit transverse area and rapidity shows almost linear growth in time, and its growth rate is consistent with a simple kinetic theory estimate involving only two-to-two scattering processes in small-angle approximation.

In this talk we will present the first analysis of this configuration at intermediate coupling. Using holography, we resum large orders in the gradient expansion to constrain the hydrodynamization dynamics and the attractor beyond the strong coupling limit. We find that independent of the coupling, hydrodynamization occurs at early times where the pressure anisotropies are large, and that the attractor is determined by first order hydrodynamics. By comparing our results to kinetic theory, we also observe that the approach of different configurations to the attractor is faster in gravity/based computations than in an extrapolation of kinetic theory to intermediate coupling.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ben', 'last_name': 'Meiring', 'fullName': 'Meiring, Ben', 'id': '3529037', 'affiliation': 'University of Oxford', 'emailHash': '4857cc419953432a18c7876bec711ff3', 'db_id': 3529037, 'person_id': 3645577}"

The initial state is then evolved using viscous hydrodynamics, and the $\sqrt{s}$ and A dependence of low-$p_T$ hadron spectra is computed.

Our results are in an excellent agreement with the low-$p_T$ data from 2.76 and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC and 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC [1,2]. In particular, we study the centrality dependence of hadronic multiplicities, pT spectra, flow coefficients, probability distributions of relative elliptic flow fluctuations, and various flow correlations. A simultaneous analysis of these observables at several collision energies puts much more stringent constraints on the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity than e.g. the flow coefficients at the LHC energies alone.

We present our latest results for various correlators, like symmetric cumulants and non-linear flow coefficients, together with their $p_T$ dependence for all the above collision systems [3].

Collective dynamics,parallel,Phenomenology of the nonlinear coupling of flow harmonics in heavy-ion collisions,"Giacalone, Giuliano",Université Paris-Saclay,Unknown,"Precise measurements of higher-order coefficients of anisotropic flow ($v_n$, $n>3$) are now available in Pb+Pb data collected at the Large Hadron Collider. Higher-order coefficients are interesting because they do not simply originate as a response of the medium to its initial geometry, but rather from an intricate nonlinear coupling of harmonics of lower order. Hence, they serve as a powerful tool for the investigation of those properties of the quark-gluon plasma which are independent of the (so far very uncertain) initial conditions of the hydrodynamic evolution, such as its viscosity and freeze-out conditions.

I review the state-of-the-art framework describing higher-order harmonics, and I show that it is incomplete: It does not allow for a consistent characterization of flow coefficients defined with more than one nonlinear contribution, such as hexagonal flow, $v_6$. More specifically, I show that the present determinations of the nonlinear response coefficients of hexagonal flow, reported in both theoretical and experimental analyses, have been carried out under hidden underlying assumptions, which spoil the physical interpretation of the final results.

With the aim of curing these issues, I present an improved framework which encompasses the existing one, and allows for an exact characterization of any flow coefficient defined with an arbitrary number of nonlinear contributions. I perform an explicit application of the new framework to recent experimental data: I derive exact formulas for the nonlinear response coefficients of $v_6$, which I then extract from ALICE data. Doing so, I obtain the first experimental determination of the nonlinear coefficient coupling $v_6$ to $v_2$ and $v_4$. This quantity turns out to present a very specific centrality dependence, that is not captured by existing viscous hydrodynamic calculations. Promising applications of the presented formalism to upcoming high statistics Run2 data will be emphasized.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Giuliano', 'last_name': 'Giacalone', 'fullName': 'Giacalone, Giuliano', 'id': '3528728', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris-Saclay', 'emailHash': '5f06ab6fc7c77fa46b4af4ee406f6144', 'db_id': 3528728, 'person_id': 3637940}"

It opens up opportunities to explore the multiparton dynamics of QCD and the limitation of fluid dynamics description of the matter created in these collisions. We report the STAR measurement of azimuthal harmonics $v_2$ and $v_3$ in the p+Au and d+Au data collected in various energies such as 19.6, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. The non-flow contributions, which are suppressed by requiring a large $\Delta\eta$ gap, are estimated in most peripheral collisions and subtracted. After non-flow subtraction at each beam energy, $v_2$ and $v_3$ are obtained as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. The $v_2$ signals are also extracted using four-particle azimuthal correlations, where the influence of non-flow is quantified by comparing to the standard cumulant method, as well as the two-subevent and three-subevent cumulant methods.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Multi-particle correlations and collectivity in $pA$ collisions from an initial state parton model,"Mace, Mark",Stony Brook University,USA,"We report on recent progress in understanding multi-particle correlations in $pA$ collisions from the initial state. We consider a proof of principle model of eikonal quarks from the projectile proton multiple-scattering off of a dense nuclear target. With this model, we find that many of the features observed in light-heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC which are often ascribed to collectivity can be qualitatively reproduced in an initial state model. These include the ordering of the two-particle azimuthal angle n-th Fourier harmonics, $v_n\{2\}$; a negative four-particle second Fourier cumulant $c_2\{4\}$, giving rise to a real $v_2\{4\}$; the energy and transverse momentum dependence of $v_2\{4\}$; the similarity in multi-particle second Fourier harmonics $v_2\{4\} \approx v_2\{6\} \approx v_2\{8\}$; and the energy dependence of the four-particle symmetric cumulants. Finally, we consider the Glasma graph approximation of our model and find that many of these features cannot be reproduced, leading to the conclusion that multiple-scattering is a key ingredient for the observed multi-particle correlations from the initial state.

In this talk I will present the microscopic model for collective effects recently implemented in the Pythia8 and DIPSY event generators. In this model collectivity is generated from interactions between Lund strings, referred to as “string shoving” and “rope hadronization”. Rope hadronization is shown to give a good description of strangeness enhancement across pp, pA and AA collisions systems, while string shoving qualitatively describes the ridge observed in pp collisions.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Centrality and impact parameter  in nucleus-nucleus collisions,"Ollitrault, Jean-Yves",CNRS,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collision experiments, the centrality of a collision is defined according to the transverse energy or number of tracks observed in a given detector. We propose a procedure to relate this experiment-defined centrality to the true centrality of the collision, defined according to impact parameter, in a way which does not need require the introduction of a Glauber model or the concept of participant nucleons. Our method allows to accurately reconstruct the probability distribution of impact parameter at a fixed value of the experiment-defined centrality, up to 5%. We argue that in central collisions, the fluctuations of impact parameter have specific signatures in the centrality dependence of the cumulants of elliptic flow, $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$, and that these effects are clearly visible in experimental data.

This talk presents a detailed study of transverse flow fluctuations using 4 and 6-particle cumulants $v_n\{4\}$ and $v_n\{6\}$ for $n=1, 2, 3$, and 4. This includes several new results: the first measurement of a negative dipolar flow $v_{1}\{4\}$; a high-precision measurement of $v_{4}\{4\}$, changing sign around 20-25$\%$ centrality; observation of an intriguing sign-change pattern of $v_2\{4\}$ and $v_2\{6\}$ in ultra-central collisions; a detailed study of the cumulant ratio $v_n\{4\}/v_n\{6\}$ which shows significant deviation of $v_2$ and $v_3$ from both Bessel-Gaussian and elliptic-power distributions. The three-subevent cumulant method is used to show that these results are unlikely to be due to non-flow effects. The talk also presents a detailed study of the longitudinal dynamics of harmonic flow using various correlators involving two, four or six particles. The flow decorrelations for $v_n$ ($n=2, 3$, and 4), as well as their center-of-mass energy dependence are studied over broad range of pseudorapidity ($|\eta|<2.5$) and transverse momentum (0.5<$p_\mathrm{T}$<5 GeV). The decorrelation signals are decomposed into contributions from the forward-backward twist and asymmetry in the flow angle and magnitude, respectively. Furthermore, the decorrelation between $v_n$ and $v_m$ in different $\eta$ is measured to disentangle the longitudinal dependence of the initial-state linear effects and final-state non-linear mode-mixing effects.  These results provide a wealth of differential information on event-by-event fluctuations of harmonic flow in both transverse and longitudinal directions, and they can be used to improve event-by-event 3+1D hydrodynamic models.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mingliang', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, Mingliang', 'id': '3563325', 'affiliation': 'Stony brook Universty (US)', 'emailHash': '8b8acbdc0e759f4f31aa8ccfacd7b998', 'db_id': 3563325, 'person_id': 3642837}"

The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) program covers a significant part of the QCD Phase Diagram using collisions of Au nuclei for eight beam energies in the range from 7.7 to 200 GeV, which baryon-rich region should be studied via baryon femtoscopy.

Jet broadening and photon emission takes place through radiation which is suppressed by repeated and coherent interaction with the medium. We analyze this physics in a medium that is not in thermal equilibrium. This  can provide independent means of extracting quark-gluon plasma transport coefficients, such as the shear viscosity, by using jets or photons. Another important application is jet quenching and photon production in the anisotropic plasma [2] created in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. We present an analyzis of how these probes are affected by such a momentum anisotropy; more specifically we consider the rapidity dependence of photon emission and jet suppression. Finally, we discuss how to extend our work to higher anisotropy where the exponential growth of chromomagnetic fields dominates momentum broadening during radiation.

In particular, the role of finite baryon chemical potential in thermal photon emission will be quantified for the first time. The interplay between different collision energy scaling behavior for prompt and thermal photons in the final direct photon observables will be analyzed.

Within the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework, we improve the state-of-the-art description of this observable, by deriving a cross section for the production of hadron pairs in the back-to-back limit. In this configuration, the cross section is manifestly factorized into a dilute component, the projectile proton, described by standard collinear parton distribution functions, and a dense counterpart, the saturated nuclear target, which is described by means of transverse-momentum-dependent gluon distributions, whose small-x evolution we obtain by solving the running-coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. This formalism has proven able to accurately capture the suppression of the away-side peak observed in RHIC data.

Starting from this approach, then, we argue that the forward two-particle correlation function measured by the LHCb Collaboration in central p+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is amenable to a CGC description. In particular, we show that the away-side peak observed at LHCb can be decomposed into a double-ridge structure - whose origin is not our concern - and a di-jet structure, whose away-side peak is sensitive to parton saturation effects. We show that our formalism correctly describes the away-side peak measured at LHCb in p+Pb collisions, and we make predictions upcoming p+p data at 5 TeV. Comparing our results in p+p to LHCb data, the observation made at RHIC is replicated: We predict a visible suppression of the away-side peak in forward p+Pb collisions at LHC energies.

Assuming coherent energy loss for the two splitted subjets, a non-monotonic jet energy dependence is found for the nuclear modification of jet splitting function: strongest modification at intermediate jet energies whereas weaker modification for larger or smaller jet energies. Combined with the smaller size and lower density of the QGP medium at RHIC than at the LHC, this helps to understand the groomed jet measurements from CMS and STAR Collaborations: strong modification of the momentum sharing $z_g$ distribution at the LHC whereas no obvious modification of the $z_g$ distribution at RHIC. In contrast, the observed nuclear modification pattern of the groomed jet $z_g$ distribution cannot be explained solely by independent energy loss of the two subjets. The dependence on the angular separation $\Delta R$ between two subjets is also studied; it is found that the nuclear modification of $z_g$ distribution decreases with decreasing $\Delta R$ but the maximal nuclear modification from CMS energies is always roughly twice of that for STAR energies. Our result may be tested in future groomed jets measurements with lower jet energies at the LHC and larger jet energies at RHIC, for different angular separations between the two subjets.

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Medium response and jet shape modification in quark-gluon plasma,"Park, Chanwook",McGill University,Unknown,"In this talk, we present the MARTINI study of the modification of jet shapes in quark-gluon plasma. The focus of this study is the effect of medium response on the jet shape function in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 and 5.02TeV. As a jet parton propagates, the medium must respond to the energy and momentum
deposited by the jet parton. The medium response thus re-distributes the lost energy around the jet axis, which manifests as the change in the jet-shape function.

To realize the effect of the medium back-reaction, we start with an IP-Glasma event with the corresponding map of binary collisions. The IP-Glasma event then initializes a 3+1D MUSIC hydro event while the map is used to initiate PYTHIA jets. After the initial hydro runs, we let jets propagate in the evolving medium and record the loss of the energy-momentum along the trajectories, keeping careful track of recoiling thermal partons as well as the jet parton shower. MUSIC is then re-run with the same initial condition but with the additional energy-momentum sources representing the lost energy-momentum of the hard partons, and this time we include the UrQMD afterburner. The hadronized hard partons are then combined with the soft hadrons for the reconstruction of jets. Using this realistic event-by-event simulation, we show that the presence of the medium back-reaction including the effect of recoiling thermal partons significantly influences the jet shape function.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Chanwook', 'last_name': 'Park', 'fullName': 'Park, Chanwook', 'id': '3528999', 'affiliation': 'McGill University', 'emailHash': 'd956be6b47f834628800be0eeaa15e23', 'db_id': 3528999, 'person_id': 3647418}"

Recently, the back-to-back azimuthal alignment $\Delta\phi_{jZ}$, $p_T$ asymmetry $x_{jZ}$ distribution and its mean value,  as well as the average number of jet partners per Z boson $R_{jZ}$ of Z associated jet production have been reported in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions by CMS. 

In the talk, we report the theoretical calculations of Z/W+jet production in pp and Pb-Pb at the LHC, which are confronted with all available data and very nice agreements between theory and data are observed  for all four observables of Z+jet in both pp and Pb-Pb collisions.  In the model,   a very good description of Z+jet in pp is achieved by utilizing Sherpa, which combines the NLO with resummation by a matched parton shower (PS). To compute observables of Z+jet in Pb-Pb we consider the parton energy loss in hot/dense QCD medium, which is simulated by Linear Boltzmann Transport(LBT) model. Our calculations of  distributions of $\Delta\phi_{jZ}$  and $R_{jZ}$   can  give excellent descriptions of CMS measurements both in pp and Pb-Pb for the first time. Compared to pp collisions, $R_{jZ}$ is suppressed and smaller fraction of jets is lost for larger initial jet parton energy in Pb-Pb collisions. The distribution of $\Delta\phi_{jZ}$ at large azimuthal angle in Pb-Pb is suppressed relative to that in pp, because jet quenching effect will reduce the contributions of multiple-parton processes. We evaluate the transverse momentum imbalance $x_{jZ}$ simultaneously which is broadened and shifted to lower value, and we find a very good agreement with LHC data for both  $x_{jZ}$ distribution and its mean value.

Although there are several derivations of anomalous hydrodynamic equation from microscopic quantum theory, it has been unclear how we can derive it based on the operator formalism of quantum theory. In this study, we derive anomalous hydrodynamic equation based on so-called Mori's projection operator method, which provides a systematic way to derive the equation of motion for slow variables like conserved charge densities in hydrodynamics. The vital point for Mori's projection operator method is that it gives a generalization of the current algebra technique used in low-energy hadron dynamics of the QCD vacuum to the nonequilibrium situations. As a result, we find that the chiral magnetic effect is caused by the anomalous commutation relation between vector and axial charge densities which represents a manifestation of the quantum anomaly in the operator formalism.

To this end we consider scattering of a quark from high x modes of the target hadron or nucleus in addition to (all-order) scattering from the usual soft color field describing the low x modes. We derive an analytical expression for the quark propagator which includes longitudinal momentum exchange with the target and allows for large angle deflection of the projectile quark. This quark propagator is then used to compute the Leading Order DIS structure functions F2 and F_L in the general kinematics 0 < x < 1 and thus generalizes the dipole picture of structure functions at small x. We outline how this formalism can be extended to calculate particle production in high energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at all pt, and how it enables one to compute jet energy loss effects from the early stages of a heavy ion collision.

To that end, I will show: i) that the model post-dictions agree with numerous data for both central and non-central collisions, including qualitatively explaining some of unexpected experimental observations, ii) show that the predictions, which were published well before the data became available, agree very well with these data, again explaining some of the unexpected experimentally observed suppression patterns, iii) predictions for the upcoming data, where some  point to qualitative expectations that can be used to distinguish between different energy loss mechanisms, and consequently guide future experiments.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Strong directed flow of heavy flavor as a probe of matter distribution in heavy-ion collisions,"Chatterjee, Sandeep","AGH University of Science and Technology, Krakow",Unknown,"The breaking of longitudinal boost invariance in non-central relativistic heavy ion collisions due to asymmetric local participant densities gives rise to a tilt in the reaction plane in the thermalized medium. A direct consequence of this is the observed rapidity odd directed flow of charged particles. We study the $v_1$ of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons by evolving the charm quark phase space distribution within Langevin dynamics coupled to a hydrodynamic background. We demonstrate that the drag from the tilted fireball gives rise to directed flow of charm quarks that is $several$ $times$ $larger$ than that of the $v_1$ of observed charged particles[1]. The $v_1$ slope at mid-rapidity is sensitive to the magnitude of the tilt of the initial thermalized medium. Thus, its measurement will allow us to extract the tilt which also sets the scale of longitudinal correlation. Hence, rapidity odd heavy flavor $v_1$ is an ideal candidate to unravel the longitudinal profile of entropy deposition. We report on the comparison of the heavy flavor $v_1$ across beam energies as well as symmetric and asymmetric systems. Further, the electromagnetic fields of the initial stage can also give rise to rapidity odd $v_1$ but of opposite signs for $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons, unlike the tilt mechanism which provides same sign $v_1$ to both $D$ and $\bar{D}$. We study the interplay of the tilt and the electromagnetic fields on the $v_1$ of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons.

Recently, it has been predicted that the transient magnetic field generated in heavy-ion collisions can induce a larger directed flow ($v_{1}$) for heavy quarks than for light quarks. The model calculation also suggests opposite signs of $dv_{1}/dy$ for charm ($c$) and anti-charm ($\bar{c}$) quarks. This argues for heavy quarks offering a new approach to study the initial electromagnetic field. Furthermore, recent measurements at RHIC have shown that $D^{0}$ mesons in minimum bias and mid-central heavy-ion collisions exhibit significant elliptic ($v_{2}$)  and triangular flow ($v_{3}$). Their flow magnitude follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark (NCQ) scaling with light hadrons' in mid-central collisions.

QCD at high temperature,parallel,T-Matrix Approach to Spectral and Transport Properties of the QGP,"Liu, Shuai",Texas A&M University,USA,"Understanding the microscopic properties of the hot and dense QCD matter produced at RHIC and the LHC is a critical task for heavy-ion physics. Toward this end, we have developed a non-perturbative microscopic approach to study the bulk, transport and spectral properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) [1-2], treating light, heavy and static partons in a unified framework. Starting from a relativistic effective Hamiltonian with a universal color force, we employ a many-body *T*-matrix approach, solved self-consistently and constrained by lattice QCD (lQCD) data for the equation of state (EoS), heavy-quark (HQ) free energy and quarkonium correlator ratios. The predictive power resides in the emerging spectral functions and transport properties. In particular, we find a strongly coupled solution where the low-momentum low-temperature parton spectral functions dissolve due to collision widths in excess of 0.5 GeV and give a way to dynamically formed hadronic resonance/bound states which take over in the EoS. The calculations of the HQ diffusion coefficients and the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio yield values (and ratios) near the conjectured lower quantum bounds, corroborating the liquid-like structure of the QGP near Tc. An extension of the approach to finite baryon density and its implications for QCD phase structure will be discussed using benchmarks from various lQCD susceptibilities.

QCD at high temperature,parallel,Parity doubling of baryons in QCD thermodynamics,"Sasaki, Chihiro",FIAS & Uni of Wroclaw,Unknown,"Motivated by the recent lattice study by the FASTSUM collaboration [1], 
thermal masses of the baryon parity-doublers are explored for 
various pion masses [2]. A general trend of the octet and decuplet 
parity-doublers is consistent to the results in [1], whereas their 
hyperon masses are modified to a large extent for the physical pion mass.

We further investigate the fluctuations and correlations involving
baryon number in hot hadronic matter with modified masses of
negative-parity baryons, in the context of the hadron resonance gas
[3]. Confronting the baryon number susceptibility, baryon-charge
correlation, and baryon-strangeness correlation and their ratios
with the lattice QCD data, we show that the strong downward mass
shift in hyperons can accidentally reproduce some correlation
ratios, however it also tends to overshoot the individual
fluctuations and correlations. This indicates, that in order to
correctly account for the influence of the chiral symmetry
restoration on the fluctuation observables, a consistent framework
of in-medium effects beyond hadron mass shifts is required.

It allows one to summarize many aspects of the intricate interactions between a QQbar bound state and its surrounding medium in a single complex valued quantity. It is systematically defined from QCD [1,2] and at the same time provides an intuitive understanding of the physics of in-medium quarkonium modification. I.e. it offers the means to investigate from first principles how e.g. color screening and collisional excitations conspire to lead to quarkonium suppression in heavy-ion collisions [3,4].

Here we present the first direct computation of this potential from realistic lattice QCD simulations with near physical pion masses [5]. Current ensembles with $N_\tau=12$ from the TUMQCD collaboration offer unprecedented high statistics, those with $N_\tau=16$ unprecedented time resolution, making possible a robust extraction of its values from the spectral functions of Wilson line correlators. To this end we deploy a combination of Bayesian reconstruction methods (BR), as well as the Pade approximation, in turn diminishing individual method artifacts. 

Re[V] shows a smooth transition from a confining to a Debye screened behavior. At all temperatures its values lie close to the color singlet free energies. Based on Re[V] we estimate the Debye mass. The modification of Im[V] at very high temperatures is compared to predictions of hard-thermal-loop perturbation theory. 

Applications of the complex potential in the modeling of charmonium and bottomonium in heavy-ion collisions are briefly touched upon ([3,4,6]).

In recent years the theoretical description of quarkonium in a medium has moved towards a more dynamical picture in which decay and recombination processes are very important. In this talk we will discuss the equations that describe the evolution of the heavy quarks reduced density matrix in different approximations, highlighting the color dynamics that is absent in the Abelian case, and we will study their semi-classical limit. This will allow us to obtain stochastic equations (similar to Langevin or Boltzmann equations) that can be useful to obtain phenomenological predictions. We will observe that the region of validity of the Langevin-like or Boltzmann-like equations in QCD is much smaller than in the corresponding QED case. The reason for this can be understood by studying how differently the free energy evolves in these two theories. This observation will allow us to propose an equation with a small computational cost that captures many of the essential features of quarkonium evolution in a QCD plasma.

The final results from pp and pPb data samples are compared with next-to-leading- order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear PDFs. A significant modification of dijet pseudorapidity distributions in pPb collisions with respect to the measured pp reference is observed which indicates that the gluon PDF in lead ions is modified and the results are incompatible with predictions with DSSZ PDF without gluon EMC effects. Photo-nuclear jets are also measured in pp and pPb collision systems. The yield and angular correlation of low-pT jets at forward rapidity, $5.0<|\eta|<6.5$, are studied using the CASTOR calorimeter, which is sensitive to PDFs at low values of $x$ and $Q^2$.

In ultraperipheral collisions (UPC), where the impact parameter is larger than the sum of nuclei radii, the interaction of these photons with the nucleus can provide insight into its structure and allow us to probe nuclear shadowing via photoproduction of charmonia.

Extensive efforts on this subject have been made by the ALICE collaboration and led to published measurements of J/Psi and Psi(2S) photoproduction in LHC Run 1 at forward (J/Psi) and at mid-rapidity. In addition, ALICE has reported a large excess of J/Psi at very low transverse momentum in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions, which is suggestive of coherent J/Psi photoproduction in collisions with nuclear overlap.

A substantially larger data set was recorded in LHC Run 2, allowing differential measurements in rapidity and in transverse momentum. In particular, the increased energy in Run 2 means that the Bjorken-x value probed in Pb-Pb UPC at midrapidity decreases from 10^-3 to 5*10^-4, and in collisions with nuclear overlap the measurement of the  coherent J/Psi component becomes sensitive to its polarization and to the shape of its transverse momentum spectrum. At forward rapidity, the Run-2 dataset extends the measurement of photoproduced J/Psi beyond 50% in centrality, imposing strong constraints on initial-state models.

The measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) at low $p_{\rm T}$ can give insight into the participation of the heavy quarks to the collective expansion of the system and their thermalization in the medium. These two observables can also help in understanding possible modifications of heavy-quark hadronisation in the medium.

Hence, any modification of its production observed in heavy-ion collisions compared to an incoherent sum of 
individual pp collisions could be attributed to in-medium effects. Such modifications, called jet quenching, have been measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions both at RHIC and at the LHC, and they were interpreted as partonic energy loss in the QGP.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Global Lambda polarization in intermediate & high energy heavy ion collisions,"Xie, Yilong",University of Bergen,Unknown,"Relativistic thermodynamics with spin provided the polarization 4-vector to characterize the spin alignment in rotating systems. Based on a Yang-Mills flux-tube initial state and a high-resolution, (3+1)D particle-in-cell relativistic (PICR) hydrodynamics simulation, we numerically obtain the polarization vector for $\Lambda$ hyperons at NICA and FAIR energies, and find that the $y$ component of the polarization vector is dominant, while $x$ and $z$ components are anti-symmetric in the transverse momentum space, implying a vanishing contribution to the global polarization (at collider frame). Besides, we analyze the dependence of $\Lambda$ polarization effect on centrality, energy and freeze-out time, in our model. The linear dependence of $\Lambda$ polarization on impact parameter reveals that the polarization stems from the initial orbital angular momentum; the polarization effect is found to decrease with increasing energy, which is in line with the recent results from RHIC BES program, and is attributed to the more intensive thermal motion of particles at higher energies. The time evolution of the $\Lambda$ polarization in our calculation agrees with the time evolution of vorticity predicted previously, and indicates the limit of applicability of hydrodynamic model at late stages of the expansion.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,Global Polarization of Lambda Hyperons in Au+Au Collisions at 200 GeV from STAR,"Niida, Takafumi",Wayne State University,United States,"The matter created in non-central heavy-ion collisions is expected to possess a significant fraction of the initial angular momentum carried by the two colliding nuclei.  This angular momentum can lead to vorticity of the system and be partially transferred to the spin of produced particles due to the spin-orbit coupling, leading to the phenomenon of global polarization. The STAR Collaboration observed finite signals in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-39 GeV, indicating non-zero vorticity of the system, where the polarization decreases with increasing energy. The energy dependence can be understood by a shear flow structure in the initial state and/or the initial tilt of the source in combination with baryon transparency. Such a tilt and vorticity are closely related to the directed flow, elliptic flow, and the chiral anomalous phenomena. According to model calculations, the vorticity is expected to have a strong dependence on the hyperon emission angle relative to the reaction plane, but the models differ in their predictions. More precise and detailed experimental results are needed for further understanding of vorticity in heavy-ion collisions. 

We present new results on the global polarization of Lambda hyperons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Recent high-statistics data by a factor of hundred larger compared to previous results allow one to study differential dependencies of the polarization on the collision centrality, hyperon's transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and emission angle relative to the reaction plane. The polarization dependence on the event-by-event charge asymmetry is presented and its possible relation to the axial current induced by the initial magnetic field is discussed. Furthermore, a possible local vortical structure along the beam direction caused by azimuthal anisotropic flow will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takafumi', 'last_name': 'Niida', 'fullName': 'Niida, Takafumi', 'id': '3580435', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': 'a6bcf2a7df71b01e46b5a5223d213055', 'db_id': 3580435, 'person_id': 3763511}"

The zeroth element of the spin density matrix element, $\rho_{00}$, is found to have values slightly below 1/3 at low transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) for K$^{*0}$ mesons, while it is consistent with 1/3 (no spin alignment) at higher $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. No spin alignment is observed for K$^{*0}$ in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV and for the spin zero hadron K$^{0}_{S}$ in 20-40$\%$ Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV.

Finite azimuthal correlator ($\Delta\gamma$) signals have been measured in experiments, consistent with the CME, but contaminated by a major elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) induced background. The isobaric $_{44}^{96}$Ru+$_{44}^{96}$Ru and $_{40}^{96}$Zr+$_{40}^{96}$Zr collisions have been proposed and planned at RHIC in 2018 to search for the CME with their expected 15% signal difference and almost identical backgrounds. In this talk we will show, however, that these expectations may not hold as originally anticipated due to large uncertainties in the isobaric nuclear structures [1]. We demonstrate this using Woods-Saxon densities and the proton and neutron densities calculated by the density functional theory and the nuclear shell model. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to gauge background and possible CME contributions in the same system, intrinsically better than the isobaric collisions of two different systems [2]. The new method is based on the opposite behaviors in the fluctuations of the magnetic field and $v_{2}$ in a single nucleus-nucleus collision, thus bears minimal theoretical and experimental uncertainties. We illustrate the method with Monte Carlo Glauber and AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) simulations.

The invariant mass method identifies the resonance background contributions, coupled with the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$), to the charge correlator CME observable ($\Delta\gamma$). At high mass ($m_{inv}>1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$) where resonance contribution is small, $\Delta\gamma$ is found to be consistent with zero within uncertainty. In the low mass region ($m_{inv}<1.5$ GeV/$c^{2}$), resonance peaks are observed in $\Delta\gamma$ as function of $m_{inv}$. A two-component model fit is devised to extract the CME signal, assumed smooth in $m_{inv}$.

In the comparative method, the $\psi_{\rm RP}$ is assessed by spectator neutrons measured by the ZDC, and the $\psi_{\rm PP}$ by the 2nd harmonic event plane measured by TPC. The $v_{2}$ is stronger along $\psi_{\rm PP}$ and weaker along $\psi_{\rm RP}$; in contrast, the magnetic field, being from spectator protons, is weaker along $\psi_{\rm PP}$ and stronger along $\psi_{\rm RP}$. As a result the $\Delta\gamma$ measured with respect to $\psi_{\rm RP}$ and $\psi_{\rm PP}$ contain different amounts of CME and background, and can thus determine these two contributions. We report the results from this determination.

In local equilibrium conditions, the standard hydrodynamic stress-energy tensor expression is expected to receive corrections proportional to the square of  acceleration and vortiicty. 

We show how these corrections can be obtained in a systematic way by performing a perturbative expansion around the homogeneous global equilibrium condition as long as the ratio between acceleration, vorticity and temperature are small. The relevant coefficients can be expressed in terms of Euclidean correlators of the stress-energy tensor operator and the generators of the Lorentz group.

We also consider massless fermions with net chirality enforcing a thermal equilibrium with a conserved axial charge. We show that parity-odd collective behavior induced by the interplay between vorticity and chirality, like for instance the Chiral Vortical effect, can be systematically derived within this thermal equilibrium approach.

All these correlators can in principle be estimated for QCD with lattice computations.

"Chirality, vorticity and polarisation effects",parallel,A novel invariant mass method to isolate resonance backgrounds from the chiral magnetic effect,"Wang, Fuqiang",Purdue University & Huzhou University,USA & China,"The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) refers to charge separation along a strong magnetic field, due to topological charge fluctuations in QCD. Charge correlation ($\Delta\gamma$) signals consistent with CME have been first observed almost a decade ago. It has also been known since then that the $\Delta\gamma$ was contaminated by a major background from resonance decays coupled with the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$). The invariant mass ($m_{inv}$) dependence of the $\Delta\gamma$ has, rather surprisingly, not been examined until recently [1]. 

In this talk, we propose differential $\Delta\gamma$ measurements as function of $m_{inv}$. By restricting to high $m_{inv}$, e.g. above 2 GeV/$c^{2}$, one may extract resonance-free CME signal where particle transverse momenta are still relatively low ($\sim$1.2 GeV/$c$). In the low $m_{inv}$ region, the backgrounds show resonance peaks and the CME signal is presumably smooth in $m_{inv}$. These different behaviors can be exploited by a two-component model to extract the CME signal at low $m_{inv}$. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel method by using the AMPT and toy-model Monte-Carlo simulations. The power of our method on the upcoming isobaric collisions at RHIC will also be discussed.

However, there exist some fundamental issues such as Lorentz covariance and systematic inclusion of collisions in CKT. Such issues have been recently addressed via phenomenological approaches. Nevertheless, a first-principle derivation based on quantum field theories (QFT) is desired. 
In this talk, we introduce the QFT derivation of CKT from the Wigner-function approach, which consistently manifests side jumps and non-scalar distribution functions associated with Lorentz covariance and incorporates both background fields and collisions. Moreover, we implement such a formalism to investigate second-order responses of chiral fluids near local equilibrium. Such non-equilibrium anomalous transport is dissipative and affected by interactions. For the study of anomalous transport in closed systems preserving energy-momentum conservation such as quark gluon plasmas, contributions from both quantum corrections in anomalous hydrodynamic equations of motion and those from the CKT and Wigner functions are considered under the relaxation-time (RT) approximation. In the inviscid case, we obtain anomalous charge Hall currents engendered by background electric fields and temperature/chemical-potential gradients. Furthermore, CME/CVE currents receive viscous corrections as non-equilibrium modifications stemming from the interplay between side jumps, magnetic-moment coupling, and chiral anomaly. Our formalism and findings could provide a practical guideline and insights for future simulations of anomalous effects in HIC.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Fluid dynamics of out of equilibrium boost invariant plasmas,"Yan, Li",McGill University,Unknown,"We establish a set of equations for moments of the distribution function. On the one hand, these equations generalize the fluid dynamics to the out-of-equilibrium evolution of boost invariant plasmas. On the other hand, they systematically generalize the theoretical framework of viscous hydrodynamics to arbitrary orders. These moments quantify details of the momentum anisotropies of out-of-eqilibrium phase space distributions. The evolution of these moments measures the evolution of systems towards thermalization to a finer level, beyond the commonly used ratio of longitudinal to transverse pressures. In the hydrodynamical regime, these moments are found to correspond to viscous corrections. In the relaxation time approximations, these moments obey a coupled set of equations that can be truncated order-by-order. Truncations at the lowest orders give rise to the exact form of the second order and third order viscous hydrodynamic equations of motion for the Bjorken flow. Solving the equations of the moments, we are able to identify an attractor solution that controls a transition from a free streaming fixed point to a hydrodynamic fixed point. In particular, this attractor solution provides a renormalization of the effective value of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, η/s, taking into account off-equilibrium effects.

We compare calculations of v_n’s from viscous fluid dynamics and from kinetic transport which start both from the same initial conditions and which implement the same matter properties. We observe that both approaches lead to parametrically different eta/s-dependencies of the elliptic anisotropy v_2, and they may thus lead to quantitatively different results for the phenomenologically inferred value of eta/s. The parametric differences can be traced to the boost-invariant longitudinal expansion of pA and AA collisions which induces in fluid dynamic results of the eta/s-dependence of v2 a dominant sensitivity on the initial conditions. Transport theory is free of this problem and it accounts for the order of magnitude of experimentally observed signal strengths v_n with sizeable mean free path.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Eero Aleksi', 'last_name': 'Kurkela', 'fullName': 'Kurkela, Eero Aleksi', 'id': '3528701', 'affiliation': 'CERN', 'emailHash': 'eb8095b42de4180e52f281f3a394f7e4', 'db_id': 3528701, 'person_id': 3640472}"
Collective dynamics,parallel,SMASH - A new hadronic transport approach,"Petersen, Hannah",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Microscopic transport approaches are the tool to describe the non-equilibrium evolution in low energy collisions as well as in the late dilute stages of high energy collisions. In this talk, a newly developed hadronic transport approach, SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is introduced. After explaining all the components of this approach, e.g. initial conditions and resonance properties, the approach is validated by a comparison to an analytic solution of the Boltzmann equation. Light and strange particle production and collective flow are compared to experimental data from elementary and nucleus-nucleus collisions in the low energy regime accessible at GSI. The implications of this new approach for dilepton production are discussed including an outlook on the non-equilibrium hadronic production of electromagnetic probes at high beam energies at RHIC and LHC. In addition, the impact of resonance properties on transport coefficients of hadronic matter is pointed out. A detailed understanding of a hadron gas with vacuum properties is required to establish the baseline for the exploration of the transition to the quark-gluon plasma in heavy ion collisions at high net baryon densities.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,A Quasiparticle Transport Explanation for Collectivity in the Smallest of Collision Systems ($p+p$ and $e^+e^-$),"Nagle, James Lawrence",University of Colorado Boulder,USA,"Experimental evidence suggests that collectivity in asymmetric small systems ($p$, $d$, $^{3}$He+A) is directly related to the initial collision geometry. Therefore, a compelling question is whether the same argument can be extended to p+p, and even $e^+e^-$ collisions. We have modified A-Multiphase-Transport-Model (AMPT) to include the constituent quark structure of the proton.   We find with very modest parton-parton cross sections a good description of the triangular and elliptic flow coefficients measured by ATLAS and CMS in p+p collisions, as a function of multiplicity and transverse momentum. We assess the non-flow separation techniques used by these experiments, by implementing their exact methods and comparing the result with the true flow relative to initial geometry in the model. The default AMPT model imposes formation times for partons which are much shorter than their respective de Broglie wavelength, at odds with a central assumption of semi-classical kinetic theory. This challenges the idea of modeling the QGP as well-defined quasi-particles undergoing Boltzmann evolution. We explore the impact on collectivity of enforcing a minimum de Broglie wavelength criterion, and find that it is significant for these smallest of systems. Lastly, we explore the minimal requirements for collectivity within this transport framework to determine whether the multiplicity and geometry of $e^+e^-$ collisions is sufficient to generate experimentally verifiable signals.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'James Lawrence', 'last_name': 'Nagle', 'fullName': 'Nagle, James Lawrence', 'id': '3715137', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'emailHash': '9a55bbf2d0bb280782dfdac3249dfdc0', 'db_id': 3715137, 'person_id': 3890112}"

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Correlated gluonic hot spots meet symmetric cumulants data at LHC energies,"Soto Ontoso, Alba",UGR/FIAS,Unknown,"The relevance of subnucleonic degrees of freedom and their fluctuations in the description of multiple experimental observations in small collision systems (flow harmonics, diffractive phenomena, hollowness effect...) has been recently established.
A representative example is the first measurement of symmetric cumulants, SC(n,m), performed by the CMS Collaboration in the three collision systems available at the LHC (p+p,p+Pb,Pb+Pb) [1]. In particular, SC(2,3), that provides a direct access to initial state fluctuations, shows a sign change with increasing centrality in p+p resembling the behavior of p+Pb and Pb+Pb interactions. This fact constitutes a powerful and stringent constraint on any realistic initial state model. We present a systematic study on the influence of spatial correlations between the proton constituents, in our case gluonic hot spots, their size and their number on SC(2,3) within a Monte Carlo Glauber framework [2]. When modeling the proton as composed by 3 gluonic hot spots, the most common assumption in the literature, we find that the inclusion of spatial correlations is indispensable to reproduce the negative sign of SC(2,3) in the highest centrality bins as dictated by data. Further, the subtle interplay between the different scales of the problem is discussed. To conclude, the possibility of feeding a 2+1D viscous hydrodynamic simulation with our entropy profiles and the theoretical uncertainties associated to this procedure are exposed.

Results from Run 2 at the top LHC energy are extended exploiting a dedicated high multiplicity trigger. This offers the unique opportunity to study, in elementary collisions, the multiplicity range covered by semi-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions.

We present the latest results on multiplicity-dependent strangeness production at LHC energies with ALICE.

We investigate the system size dependence in pp and p-Pb collisions to study how hadronic scattering processes affect measured resonance yields, as well as the interplay between canonical suppression and strangeness enhancement.

A systematic reduction of non-flow effects is observed when using the two-subevent method and the results become independent of event class definition when the three-subevent method is used. The values of $v_n\{4\}=\sqrt[4]{-c_n\{4\}}$ are found to be constant over the range 40<$N_{ch}$<200 in $pp$ collisions, providing direct evidence that multi-particle collectivity persists to low multiplicity.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Event Plane Dependence of Di-hadron Correlations with Event Shape Engineering at the STAR Experiment,"Aoyama, Ryo",University of Tsukuba,UK,"In relativistic high energy collisions, hard scattered partons can fragment into two back-to-back jets. These jets can be used as hard probes to study properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma created in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Di-hadron correlations with respect to high $p_T$ trigger particles are a useful tool to study the interactions between jets and the medium in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. The jet-medium interplay depends on the in-medium path length of initial partons and the system evolution.

Centrality dependence of the jet-like recoil peak magnitude opposite the trigger particle in di-hadron correlations has been widely interpreted as a signature of path-length dependence of jet modification. However, the path length differs between in-plane (the same direction as the event plane, the shorter axis of elliptic shape) and out-of-plane (the perpendicular direction to the event plane) trigger particles because of the almond-like shape of two overlapping nuclei. Therefore, one can exert a measure of control over the recoil jet's in-medium path length by selecting the trigger particle's azimuthal direction with respect to the event plane. Event shape engineering (ESE) has been proposed as a powerful tool to control the initial geometrical shape. ESE constrains the event-by-event flow fluctuations by selecting the magnitude of the flow vector $q_n$. A more detailed study for jet-medium interplay will be possible with ESE than previous event plane dependent di-hadron correlations at the STAR experiment. Here, we present di-hadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$200 GeV as a function of both the trigger azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane and various ESE selections.

In particular, multi-particle cumulant analyses have established the collective nature of these correlations. Nevertheless, despite the fact that a common paradigm seems to emerge for all hadronic systems, the exact underlying mechanism still needs to be understood. In particular, the measurement of long-range collective azimuthal correlations down to low multiplicities is still challenging experimentally due to contamination from jet-like correlations. New methods of multiparticle correlations using subevents were developed to suppress jet-like correlations at low multiplicities. Based on data collected by CMS experiment in pp and pPb collisions, correlated azimuthal anisotropies ($v_n$) between different orders are studies using the symmetric cumulants without sub-event and also using N subevents (N = 2, 3 and 4).

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Importance of initial and final state effects for azimuthal correlations in p+Pb collisions,"Greif, Moritz",University of Frankfurt,Unknown,"We investigate the relative importance of initial and final state effects on azimuthal correlations in low and high multiplicity p+Pb collisions at LHC energies. By matching the classical Yang-Mills dynamics of pre-equilibrium gluon fields (IP-GLASMA) to a perturbative QCD based parton cascade for the final state evolution (BAMPS) on an event-by-event basis, we find that signatures of both the initial state correlations and final state interactions are seen in azimuthal correlation observables, such as $v_2\{2P C\}(p_T)$, with their relative strength depending on the event multiplicity and transverse momentum. Initial state correlations dominate elliptic flow in low multiplicity events for transverse momenta $p_T > 2~\mathrm{GeV}$. While final state interactions are dominant in high multiplicity events and at low momenta, we find that initial state correlations strongly affect $v_2\{2P C\}(p_T)$ for $p_T>2$ GeV as well as the pT integrated $v_2\{2P C\}$. By carrying out a systematic multiplicity scan, we can also probe the dynamics on the border of initial state dominated to final state dominated - but not yet fully developed hydrodynamic – regime. We predict at which multiplicity and transverse momentum many-body QCD effects in the initial state can be experimentally unveiled.

Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Measurement of long-range correlations in $pp$ collisions characterized by presence of a Z boson with the ATLAS detector,"Cole, Brian",Columbia University (US),USA,"Recent measurements of correlations between two particles separated in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angles have shown striking similarities between results obtained in $pp$, $p$+A and A+A collision systems. In the $pp$ collision system, unlike in  $p$+A and A+A collisions, the strength of the correlations, quantified by the anisotropy parameter $v_2$, shows little dependence on the observed charged-particle multiplicity. Recent theoretical models suggest that this can result from an intrinsically weak correlation between the charged-particle multiplicity and the impact parameter of the $pp$ collision.  An independent handle on the impact parameter can be obtained in principle by requiring the presence of a hard-scattering process in the collision. This talk presents the first measurement of two-particle correlations in $pp$ collisions with a presence of Z boson identified via its $\mu\mu$ decay channel. The analysis uses ATLAS data recorded with nominal $pp$ luminosity with high pileup. A new procedure is used to correct for the contribution of tracks arising from pileup vertices. The multiplicity and transverse momentum dependence of the inclusive charged-particle $v_2$ measured in Z-tagged events at $\sqrt{s}=8$ and 13 TeV is compared to the $v_2$ measured in minimum-bias collisions. They are found to be of a similar magnitude.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Brian', 'last_name': 'Cole', 'fullName': 'Cole, Brian', 'id': '3563323', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '5ac89c43538af2f10d3ef24f9575e165', 'db_id': 3563323, 'person_id': 3645180}"
Collectivity in small systems,parallel,Estimating nucleon substructure properties in a unified hydrodynamic model of p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions,"Moreland, Scott",Duke University,USA,"Simulations of relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on viscous hydrodynamics provide an accurate description of the bulk observables measured at RHIC and LHC beam energies, including identified particle yields, mean $p_T$ and multiparticle correlations. The success of the hydrodynamic framework, however, is naturally expected to break down in the dilute limit where discrete particle degrees of freedom dominate.

It was thus surprising when the multiparticle correlations measured in high-multiplicity proton-lead collisions were found to be similar in magnitude to those observed in lead-lead collisions. The observation suggests that hydrodynamic behavior could be manifest in small droplets of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and that flow might develop at length scales smaller than a proton.

In this work, we posit the existence of hydrodynamic flow in small collision systems and evaluate the likelihood of our assertion using Bayesian inference. Specifically, we model the dynamics of proton-lead and lead-lead collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV using QGP initial conditions with parametric nucleon substructure, a pre-equilibrium free-streaming stage, event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics, and a microscopic hadronic afterburner.
  
Bayesian parameter estimation is used to construct the posterior probability distribution for the model's input parameters, calibrated to fit the charged particle yields, meant $p_T$ and flow cumulants of both collision systems. We then sample preferred regions of parameter space and evaluate the performance of the model using optimally chosen parameter values. This semi-exhaustive model validation enables us to to comment on the implied viability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems subject to the approximations of the chosen framework. We conclude by presenting posterior constraints on the shape of the proton and temperature dependence of QGP transport coefficients, and discuss relevant implications for hot and dense nuclear matter.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Scott', 'last_name': 'Moreland', 'fullName': 'Moreland, Scott', 'id': '3528802', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '5c3dae75953dc245616e28d238363076', 'db_id': 3528802, 'person_id': 3642908}"
Collectivity in small systems,parallel,"Event-shape, multiplicity-, and energy-dependent production of (un)identified particles in pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC","Bencedi, Gyula",Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),HU,"The multiplicity dependent results of identified particle production allowed the discovery of collective-like behavior in pp collisions at the LHC. Good understanding of the effects attributed to well-understood physics, like multiple hard scatterings, is required to establish the origin of the new phenomena. Experimentally, those effects can be controlled using event shapes, like transverse spherocity or directivity, which allows the classification of the pp collisions either as jetty-like or isotropic events. The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra of light-flavor hadrons in pp collisions measured over a broad $p_{\rm T}$ range provide important input to study particle production mechanisms in the soft and hard scattering regime of QCD. In this work, they are used to perform a comprehensive study as a function of the event multiplicity, collision energy, and event shapes.

We will present the inclusive charged particle transverse momentum distributions for pp collisions at different center-of-mass energies. The multiplicity and energy dependencies of the particle production at high transverse momentum are studied with the exponent of the power law function which describes the $p_{\rm{T}}$ spectra. For pp collisions at 
$\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV and for a fixed multiplicity interval, the parameters obtained from the blast wave analysis of the $p_{\rm T}$ spectra are used to characterize the evolution of the spectral shapes for different event topologies. The multiplicity and spherocity dependencies of the average transverse momenta and integrated yields as a function of charged-particle multiplicity are discussed. The proton-to-pion and kaon-to-pion particle ratios as a function of $p_{\rm T}$ are also reported. Comparisons between data and QCD-inspired models will be shown.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gyula', 'last_name': 'Bencedi', 'fullName': 'Bencedi, Gyula', 'id': '3553632', 'affiliation': 'Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU)', 'emailHash': 'bfbcb0947232ec4b8ef99df10a726799', 'db_id': 3553632, 'person_id': 3737571}"

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Measuring the rate of isotropization of quark-gluon plasma using rapidity correlations,"Moschelli, George",Lawrence Technological University,Unknown,"We propose that rapidity dependent momentum correlations can be used to extract the shear relaxation time $\tau_\pi$ of the medium formed in high energy nuclear collisions. The stress-energy tensor in an equilibrium quark-gluon plasma is isotropic, but in nuclear collisions it is likely very far from this state.  The relaxation time $\tau_\pi$ characterizes the rate of isotropization and is a transport coefficient as fundamental as the shear viscosity. We show that fluctuations emerging from the initial anisotropy survive to freeze-out, in excess of thermal fluctuations, influencing rapidity correlation patterns. We show that these correlations can be used to extract $\tau_\pi$. In [1] we describe a method for calculating the rapidity dependence of two-particle momentum correlations with a second order, causal, diffusion equation that includes Langevin noise as a source of thermal fluctuations. The causality requirement introduces the relaxation time and we link the shape of the rapidity correlation pattern to its presence. Here we examine how different equations of state and temperature dependent transport coefficients in the presence of realistic hydrodynamic flow influence the estimate of $\tau_\pi$. In comparison to RHIC data, we find that the ratio $\tau_\pi/\nu \approx 5-6$ where $\nu=\eta/sT$ is the kinematic viscosity. We further make predictions for Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,"Balance functions of identified hadrons in Pb-Pb, p-Pb and p-p collisions from ALICE","Pan, Jinjin",Wayne State University (US),United States,"In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, correlations of particles with opposite quantum numbers provide insight into charge creation mechanisms, the time scales of quark production, collective motion of the QGP, and re-scattering in the hadronic phase. The longitudinal and azimuthal widths of general charge balance functions for pions, kaons, and protons are used to examine the two-wave quark production model recently proposed to explain quark-antiquark production within the QGP, which predicts a large increase in up and down quark pairs relative to strange quark pairs around the time of hadronization. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the balance functions for different particle pairs provide quantitative differential information on pair production channels. In addition, a detailed study of balance functions for different identified hadrons probes the fragmentation mechanism of strings into different quark flavors. Balance functions are also analysed in small collision systems such as p-Pb and pp to study fragmentation effects and possible collective effects in high-multiplicity events.

We present a comprehensive set of measurements of general charge balance functions for pions, kaons, protons, and unidentified particle pairs in Pb-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02 TeV), p-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV) and pp ($\sqrt{s}=$ 5.02 and 7 TeV) collisions in ALICE. Theoretical expectations and Monte Carlo models are then compared with the experimental data.  In Pb-Pb collisions, we observe that the $\Delta y$ and $\Delta\varphi$ widths of the charged-pion balance function are narrower in central collisions compared to peripheral ones, while the widths of the charged-kaon balance functions do not show a centrality dependence.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Hydrodynamic fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Singh, Mayank",McGill University,Unknown,"We present a novel approach to the treatment of thermal fluctuations in the (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic simulation MUSIC. We investigate the phenomenological impact of thermal fluctuations on hadronic and electromagnetic observables using the state-of-the-art IP-Glasma + hydrodynamics + hadronic cascade hybrid approach [1]. In particular, we show that these thermal fluctuations influence the result of elliptic and triangular flow measurements for ultra-central collisions, such as those presented by the CMS Collaboration [2]. Consequences on the extraction of QCD transport coefficients from heavy-ion collisions will also be discussed.  

The anisotropic flow observed in heavy-ion collision experiments is mostly attributed to the hydrodynamic response to the event-by-event collision geometry and to the sub-nucleon quantum fluctuations. However, hydrodynamic fluctuations are present during the dynamical evolution of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) and are quantified by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem [3]. They can leave their imprint on final-state observables.  
 
By analyzing the thermal noise mode-by-mode, we provide a consistent scheme of treating these fluctuations as the source terms for hydrodynamic fields. These source terms are then evolved together with hydrodynamic equations of motion. Such a treatment captures the non-perturbative nature of the evolution for these thermal fluctuations.

We propose new decorrelation measures of flow magnitude and event-plane angles and apply them to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, modeled via event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations. The basic purpose is to verify a generic feature, namely, that the events with a higher flow magnitude decorrelate significantly less in the event-plane angle, compared to the events with a lower flow magnitude. We find a hierarchy between various flow decorrelation measures and confirm specific factorization relations. The model results are in qualitative agreement with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. The proposed generalization of the flow decorrelation measures, with weights involving higher powers of the flow magnitude, can be directly tested in future experimental analyses.

On the other hand, the initial states fluctuations in the longitudinal direction could lead to the fluctuations and decorrelations (factorization breaking) of anisotropy flows in the pseudorapidity direction [See e.g., 1, 2]. Detailed study of initial state fluctuations and their manifestations in the final-state flows and flow correlations can provide insights into the initial states and dynamical evolution of the hot and dense QGP.

In this work [3], we perform a detailed analysis on initial-state longitudinal fluctuations, the pseudorapidity dependence of anisotropic flows and the longitudinal decorrelations of anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The dynamical evolution of the QGP is simulated via a (3+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics model [4]. To study the dependence on initial conditions, we utilize two initial condition models: the AMPT model and a Monte-Carlo Glauber based model with longitudinal fluctuations. For longitudinal fluctuations and decorrelations, the individual contributions from flow magnitudes and flow angles are investigated.  The comparison to the ALICE, ATLAS and CMS data is also performed. We also study the correlations among anisotropic flows of different orders, such as flow angle correlations and symmetric cumulants. The pseudorapidity dependence of flow correlations is studied as well.

Correlations and fluctuations,parallel,Rapidity decorrelation from hydrodynamic fluctuations,"Sakai, Azumi",Sophia University,Unknown,"Fluctuations have been playing an important role in understanding observables in high-energy nuclear collisions. Higher harmonics of azimuthal angle distributions, for example, can be attributed to initial fluctuations of transverse profile from event to event. In this presentation, we focus on thermal fluctuations during hydrodynamic evolution (a.k.a. hydrodynamic fluctuations) of the QGP fluids in the intermediate stage and investigate the effects of them on several observables in high-energy nuclear collisions.

We employ an integrated dynamical model [2,3] which combines full three-dimensional relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics with Monte-Carlo version of the Glauber model for event-by-event initialization and the hadronic cascade model in the late rescattering stage. By using this model, we first adjust initial parameters and transport coefficients to reproduce $dN_{\mathrm {ch}}/d\eta$ and centrality dependence of integrated $v_{2}$ in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy. We next analyze %$r_{n|n;1}(\eta)$ and observables for longitudinal flow correlations of the $n$-th order higher harmonics $R_{n;n|n;n}(\eta)$ [4] for separation of the flow magnitude fluctuations from the event-plane twist along the rapidity. From this analysis, we see how hydrodynamic fluctuations break up longitudinal correlations of the magnitude and the event-plane angle of anisotropic flow parameters.

At RHIC energies it is a challenge for hydrodynamical models to simultaneously describe the yield and the elliptic flow of direct photons in p-A and A-A collisions, which is often referred to as the direct-photon puzzle.

With ALICE, photons can be detected with either of the two electromagnetic calorimeters, EMCal and PHOS, and via reconstruction of $e^+e^-$ pairs from conversions in the ALICE detector material using the central tracking system. An additional hybrid method, combining the conversion information with that of the calorimeters has been developed. Where ever possible the results were combined to reflect our best estimate of the inclusive photon spectra and flow, $R_{\gamma}$, as well as the extraction of direct photon spectra or their upper limits and the flow.

At low invariant mass, the dielectron production is sensitive to the properties of vector mesons in the medium and modifications related to the chiral symmetry restoration. In the intermediate mass region ($1.2 < m_{\rm ee} < 2.8$GeV/$c^2$) dielectrons are dominated by correlated electron pairs from heavy-flavour hadron decays, which carry information on the heavy-quark energy loss and collectivity. Thermal radiation from the medium contributes to the dielectron yield over a broad mass range and give insight into the temperature of the medium.

To single out the signal characteristics of the QGP, it is crucial to understand the primordial e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pair production in vacuum, i.e. in minimum-bias proton-proton collisions, and to disentangle hot from cold-nuclear matter effects with p-Pb collisions. Moreover, observations of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions show surprising similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions. The underlying physics processes in such events can be further studied with the measurements of correlated e$^{+}$e$^{-}$ pairs.

Electromagnetic and weak probes,parallel,Unveiling the yoctosecond structure of the QGP with top quarks,"Apolinario, Liliana",Universidade de Lisboa (PT),PT,"Top quarks have been recently measured for the first time in nuclear collisions. With most of the integrated luminosity of the LHC PbPb program to be recorded in the coming years and the impressive projections for the future HL-LHC, HE-LHC or FCC, top quark observables will be measured with good precision and become an excellent probe of the QGP. We argue here that the unique properties of the top quark provide a completely new way to study differentially the space-time evolution of the medium created in heavy ion collisions. Top quarks decay almost exclusively into a W boson and a b quark. The finite lifetimes of the top and W particles and the time-delay in the interaction of the (colour-singlet) W-boson’s decay products with the medium add up to a total time during which the top-decay system is unaffected by the QGP. The three times are correlated with the kinematics of the top quark allowing the approximate determination of the time at which the interaction with the QGP begins. We carry out a simple Monte Carlo feasibility study and find that the LHC has the potential to bring first, limited information on the time structure of the QGP. Substantially increased LHC heavy-ion luminosities or future higher-energy colliders would open opportunities for more extensive studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Liliana', 'last_name': 'Apolinario', 'fullName': 'Apolinario, Liliana', 'id': '3528861', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa (PT)', 'emailHash': 'a63f153ae87afad7e8b46a7d1e553678', 'db_id': 3528861, 'person_id': 3643849}"
High baryon density and astrophysics,parallel,Recent Results from the STAR Fixed-Target Program,"Wu, Yang",Kent State University,Unknown,"The data from RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase I (BES-I) have shown interesting results below $\sqrt{s_{NN}}<$ 19.6 GeV in identified hadron anisotropy ($v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$), kaon over pion ratios, and net-proton higher moments. These interesting features continue to the lowest energy, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV, and motivate the investigation to even lower energy collisions. The STAR fixed-target program extends the energy reach from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =7.7 GeV to $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 3.0 GeV, corresponding to baryon chemical potential 420 MeV to about 700 MeV range. The comparison of the asymmetric system (Al+Au) and symmetric system (Au+Au) at almost equal number of participating nucleons from most central to mid-central collisions provides useful information on nucleon stopping, which is key to understanding the baryon chemical potential.

We present results from Al (beam)+Au (target) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 4.9 GeV and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 4.5 GeV from the STAR fixed-target program. We will report transverse mass spectra, rapidity density distributions, particle ratios, centrality dependence and directed flow of protons, $\pi^{\pm}$, $K_{s}$ and $\Lambda$, elliptic flow of protons, $\pi^{\pm}$ and K, and HBT homogeneity lengths of pions. Pion and proton elliptic flow show mass ordering. Number of constituent quark scaling tests will be presented. For the asymmetric Al+Au system, the peak of the rapidity density distributions is shifted from the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass rapidity. The magnitude of this shift varies with centrality and is a measure of the nucleon stopping. These newly measured data will be compared with previously published results from the AGS and SPS. The implications of the results on future STAR fixed-target physics runs will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yang', 'last_name': 'Wu', 'fullName': 'Wu, Yang', 'id': '3580490', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University', 'emailHash': 'ee1d2b01e38d2191dd5c66310144ef4b', 'db_id': 3580490, 'person_id': 3763551}"
High baryon density and astrophysics,parallel,"The QCD equation of state at finite density, from the known to the unknown","Steinheimer, Jan",FIAS,Unknown,"The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is expected to have a rich phase structure at finite chemical potential and temperature. Its study is a central topic of high energy nuclear physics. Theoretical studies employing lattice QCD methods have already established that the transition from hadrons to quarks proceeds as a smooth crossover in the case of vanishing net baryon number density. At very large net baryon densities and low temperatures, astrophysical observations have become more important in constraining the QCD Equation of State. Nuclear matter ground-state properties as well as properties of compact stars and their violent mergers will serve to determine the equation of state at several times nuclear ground-state density.

In this talk I will present the first calculation
of the QCD phase strcuture and thermodynamics which is shown to be consistent with lattice QCD
results at small barychemical potential as well as nuclear matter properties
and known constraints from compact star observations[1,2].
In this context I will discuss the most relevant properties and constraints which should
be satisfied by any model which attempts to predict the QCD phase structure.
Furthermore, I will present results on the baryon number susceptibilities calculated with this 
model and discuss how nuclear interactions may strongly influence the measured 
baryon number fluctuations in nuclear collisions at low beam energies [1].
Finally, I will also address similarities and differences between the matter created in heavy ion collisions
and in mergers of compact stars and how both can be described in a unified framework [3].

The new approach is free of causality problems and is fully thermodynamically consistent, which enables us to use it for the investigation of the strongly interacting matter phase-diagram properties in a wide range of temperatures and baryon densities, including neutron stars. The considered model with a small number of parameters, fully determined according to the experimental constraints, reproduces very well all the known properties of normal nuclear matter, provides a high quality description of the proton flow constraints, hadron multiplicities created during the nuclear-nuclear collision experiments and equally is consistent with astrophysical data coming from neutron star observations.

The excellent performance of the Inner Tracking System, the Time Projection Chamber and the Time-Of-Flight detector provide a clear identification and separation of primary produced light (anti-)nuclei from secondaries.

Additionally, the high energy deposit of Z=2 particles in the Transition Radiation Detector has been exploited to collect a hardware-triggered data sample in the high-interaction rate p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV. First findings from this (anti-)nuclei enriched sample will be shown.

The goal is to study production mechanisms such as coalescence in small systems, and to compare them to those in heavy-ion collisions. To achieve this, the coalescence parameter $B_{A}$ is studied as function of transverse momentum in the different systems and  as a function of the event multiplicity.  In addition to this, prospects for measuring (anti-)deuteron production in jets will be presented.

These include processes in which an energetic photon emitted by one nucleus resolves the partonic structure of the other and stimulates jet production. Much like deep inelastic scattering, such processes provide a clean probe of the nuclear parton distributions. This is in contrast to other observables in ion-ion and proton-ion collisions which typically involve the convolution of parton distributions in both incident particles. Thus jet photo-production represents the most direct opportunity to study nuclear parton distributions until a future electron-ion collider is constructed. This talk presents new measurements of ultra-peripheral jet photo-production in Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Events are selected using a combination of forward neutron and rapidity gap requirements. Final states with two or more jets are used to construct event level observables $H_{\mathrm{T}}$, $x_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $z_{\gamma}$, which characterize the hard scattering process. Measurements of differential cross sections in these three quantities, after unfolding for detector response, are presented.

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Forward particle production in proton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order: solving the running-coupling puzzle,"Ducloue, Bertrand",IPhT Saclay,Unknown,"Reaching next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative calculations of particle production in QCD at high energy is essential for reliable phenomenological applications. In recent years, the Color Glass Condensate effective theory (the natural framework for such calculations) has indeed been promoted to NLO accuracy. However, the first NLO calculations met with unexpected difficulties, among which a huge scheme-dependence with respect to the scale choice in the running of the coupling. The NLO correction to the cross-section for single inclusive particle production in pA collisions at forward rapidities was found to vary by up to two orders of magnitude and also to change sign, when replacing the momentum-space prescription for the running of the coupling (as natural in the calculation of the NLO impact factor) by a coordinate-space prescription (as generally used when solving the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation).

Recently we have found out that the origin of this puzzle lies in the interplay between the Fourier transform from coordinate space to momentum space and the asymptotic freedom of QCD [1].  We present a new coordinate space prescription which avoids this problem and leads to results consistent with the momentum-space prescription ones. The NLO corrections are negative and reduce the LO result by 40% to 50%. We argue that the scheme-dependence could be further reduced by using the momentum-space representation throughout the whole NLO calculation, that is, for both the impact factor and the solution to the BK equation.

Initial state physics and approach to equilibrium,parallel,Energy and system size dependence of the subnucleonic fluctuations,"Mäntysaari, Heikki",University of Jyväskylä,Unknown,"Understanding the geometric eventy-by-event distribution of gluons in protons and nuclei is a fundamentally interesting task. Moreover, their fluctuating structure  has a significant effect on the outcome of hydrodynamical simulations of e.g. proton-nucleus collisions. Thus, it is of utmost interest to determine both the average geometrical structure, and its event-by-event fluctuations, for the hadrons used in high-energy QCD experiments.

Recently, we have shown how the event-by-event fluctuations of the geometric structure of the proton can be constrained from the HERA exclusive vector meson production data [1], and that this information is crucial in order to describe the measured flow harmonics in proton-nucleus collisions [2].

In this talk, we study to what extent the large geometric fluctuations of the proton have effect in nuclear targets. In particular, we show that at large momentum transfer, the J/Psi photoproduction in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is sensitive to the event-by-event fluctuations of the nucleon geometry in the LHC kinematics [3]. We also discuss the possibilities of the future Electron Ion Collider to study fluctuations also in light nuclei such as deuteron and helium, whose structure is necessary input for hydrodynamical simulations of e.g. deuteron-gold collisions studied at RHIC.

The high-energy photon-nucleus and proton-nucleus scatterings measured at the LHC make it also possible to study the energy dependence of the fluctuations. We present our ongoing work on describing the Björken-x evolution of the proton structure by solving the JIMWLK evolution equation. The non-perturbative input for the small-x evolution is obtained by fitting the HERA structure function data, which then allows us to predict the energy dependence of the fluctuating structure of the proton.

Still, hydrodynamic descriptions of heavy-ion collisions are phenomenologically very successful. To elucidate the origin of this success we explore exactly solvable situations where the microscopic dynamics is described by the Boltzmann equation, and compare the exact solution with various hydrodynamic approximations obtained from the Boltzmann equation using different expansion schemes. Specifically, we study the performance of equations derived from a third-order Chapman-Enskog expansion and in the frameworks of second-order anisotropic and viscous hydrodynamics in comparison to the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation for Bjorken and Gubser flows. Systems with Bjorken flow approach an asymptotic state of local thermal equilibrium whereas in Gubser flow the expansion is so strong that the asymptotic state is free-streaming. Anisotropic hydrodynamics can be understood as a form of resummed hydrodynamics that includes terms of all orders in a gradient or Chapman-Enskog expansion. We study the evolution of the longitudinal-transverse pressure anisotropy, the shear stress and the rate of entropy production and show that for all three observables second-order anisotropic hydrodynamics in the $P_L$-matching scheme yields the best agreement with the exact solution of the Boltzmann equation, for both types of flows. We also show that the relatively largest discrepancies between the approximate hydrodynamic and exact kinetic solutions are observed for the entropy: the rate of entropy productions appears to be more strongly affected by couplings to rapidly evolving non-hydrodynamic modes than the hydrodynamic moments of the distribution function that make up the energy-momentum tensor.

Therefore, they are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The study of angular correlations between heavy-flavour particles and charged particles allows us to characterize the heavy-quark fragmentation process and its possible modification in a hot and dense medium. The measurement of heavy-flavour jets gives more direct access to the initial parton kinematics and can provide further constraints for heavy-quark energy-loss models, in particular adding information on how the radiated energy is dissipated in the medium. 
 
Studies in pp collisions are mandatory to characterize heavy-quark production and fragmentation in vacuum, constituting the necessary reference for interpreting heavy-ion collision results. Differences between results from pp and p-Pb collisions can reflect how the heavy-quark production and hadronization into jets is affected by cold nuclear matter effects.
 
This contribution will include the latest heavy-flavour correlation and jet measurements with the ALICE detector in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions from the LHC Run-2 data. In particular, results on azimuthal correlations of D mesons with charged particles in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{{s}_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented. Measurements of multiplicity and centrality dependent azimuthal correlations of heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons with charged particles in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{{s}_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV will be shown.

Because photons do not carry color charge, they are unaffected by the medium, and thus provide information about the momentum, direction, and flavor (quark or gluon) of the associated hard-scattered parton before it begins to shower and become quenched. In particular, the presence of a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ photon can be used to select $pp$ and Pb+Pb events with the same configuration before quenching, limiting the effects of selection biases present in other jet measurements. The large statistics $pp$ and Pb+Pb data delivered by the LHC in 2015 thus allow for a detailed study of photon-tagged jet quenching effects, such as the overall parton energy loss and modified structure of the component of the shower which remains correlated with the initial parton direction (e.g. in cone).

Jet modifications and high-pT hadrons,parallel,Adding vacuum branching to jet evolution in a dense medium,"Iancu, Edmond",Université Paris-Saclay (FR),France,"It is well known that the multiple interactions of a hard probe with a dense quark-gluon plasma result in the ""medium-induced"" radiation of soft gluons, responsible e.g. for jet energy loss. Such an emission can be computed using the BDMPS-Z formalism, which has recently been generalised to include multiple medium-induced emissions. To get a complete picture of the evolution of a jet in a dense medium, the main missing ingredient is the inclusion of both medium-induced emissions and ""vacuum-like"" emissions responsible for the parton shower from large virtualities (of the order of the hard scale) down to the hadronisation scale. 

In this talk, we adopt a new approach and show that in a (leading) double-logarithmic approximation, the time scales in the evolution of a jet factorise. The vacuum-like parton cascades develop at early times and exhibit angular ordering due to color coherence, like the standard parton showers in the vacuum. The effect of the medium can be simply formulated as a kinematic constraint which limits the phase-space for vacuum-like radiation and thus reduces the parton multiplicities. The gluons produced by these cascades lose their mutual coherence via multiple scattering and hence act as independent sources of energy loss via medium-induced radiation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete picture of jet evolution in the medium derived from perturbative QCD. It has the additional advantage of being well-suited for a Monte-Carlo implementation. In the talk, we show how this simple evolution arise and investigate its main properties.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Edmond', 'last_name': 'Iancu', 'fullName': 'Iancu, Edmond', 'id': '3528987', 'affiliation': 'Université Paris-Saclay (FR)', 'emailHash': '9c0503437fddc7afed17f456c9771b5c', 'db_id': 3528987, 'person_id': 3643573}"

The mechanism of jet energy loss in a deconfined medium is intricately associated with medium resolution of jet substructure fluctuations [1]. This is naturally accompanied by modifications of jet substructure [2,3] and impacts the behaviour of the suppression of jets at high-pT [4]. In this work, we highlight the connection between the breakdown of colour coherence and energy loss within a first-principle calculation of a parton splitting process taking place inside the medium [1]. Furthermore, we discuss how a consistent picture between quenching effects and substructure modifications can aid in pinning down scales of the medium, focussing in particular on the advantage of applying grooming techniques to enhance the sensitivity to perturbative aspects of in-medium jet fragmentation [2].

Relativistic heavy-ion collisions feature two such large dissipative effects: (i) Strongly anisotropic expansion generates a large shear stress component which manifests itself in very different longitudinal and transverse pressures, especially at early times. (ii) Critical fluctuations near the quark-hadron phase transition lead to a large bulk viscous pressure on the conversion surface between hydrodynamics and a microscopic hadronic cascade description of the final collision stage.  

We present a new dissipative hydrodynamic formulation for non-conformal fluids where both of these effects are treated nonperturbatively. The evolution equations are derived from the Boltzmann equation in the 14-moment approximation, using an expansion around an anisotropic leading-order distribution function with two momentum-space deformation parameters, accounting for the longitudinal and transverse pressures. Generalized Landau matching conditions for the longitudinal and transverse pressures are then required to obtain their evolution. We describe an approximate anisotropic equation of state that relates the anisotropy parameters with the macroscopic pressures. Residual shear stresses are smaller and are treated perturbatively, as in standard second-order dissipative fluid dynamics.

The resulting optimized viscous anisotropic hydrodynamic evolution equations are derived in 3+1 dimensions and tested in a (0+1)-dimensional Bjorken expansion, using an updated lattice equation of state.

New theoretical developments,parallel,A resummed method of moments for the relativistic hydrodynamic expansion,"Tinti, Leonardo",The Ohio State University,USA,"A modern approach to obtaining the equations of motion of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics relies on various approximations of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. There is a mounting evidence that the standard Chapman-Enskog expansion of the Boltzmann equation has a vanishing radius of convergence. The method of moments, on the other hand, is free from such problems. The equations thus obtained can be systematically improved, and their convergence properties checked. However, if one introduces mean-field interactions, for example in the form of a medium-dependent mass or an external gauge field interacting with the plasma, this systematic expansion breaks down: Successive moments are found to couple not only to energy moments of higher, but also of lower order,which diverge in the ultra-relativistic (massless) limit, orrequire unrealistic machine precision. This problem is even worse if one starts with the Wigner quasi-probability distribution, in order to generalize the results of the expansion. In the absence of the on-shell condition, all of the moments are ill defined, with the notable exception of the conserved currents (the stress-energy tensor).
We solve the issue using resummed moments which consist of a sum of all the moments of the same tensorial rank, but different energy weights. The resulting equations are always well defined. The evolution of the hydrodynamics moments (four-velocity, energy density, pressure, pressure corrections etc.) is exactly the same as the one provided by the traditional method of moments, if such an expansion is well defined. We tested numerically the convergence properties of the resummed expansion for some known solutions of the microscopic theory, and we checked that the convergence remains intact in the simplest case in which the traditional expansion breaks down. Namely the Boltzmann-Vlasov equation for charged mass-less particles coupled to the Maxwell equations in a (0+1)-dimensional expansion.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Leonardo', 'last_name': 'Tinti', 'fullName': 'Tinti, Leonardo', 'id': '3529041', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University', 'emailHash': '8dac539203aad13c6fa6ff61c5cad3fd', 'db_id': 3529041, 'person_id': 3587387}"

With the STAR iTPC upgrade in place they will be able to reach proton rapidities up to $|y|\sim 0.8$ where the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ in $\sqrt{s}=20$ GeV collisions is somewhat higher than at mid-rapidity.  They may therefore be able to use the high statistics at this and nearby collision energies to vary $\mu_B$ somewhat by varying $y$, as well as by scanning down to the lowest possible collision energies. By employing Ising universality together with a phenomenologically motivated freeze-out prescription, we demonstrate that the rapidity dependence of Gaussian and non-Gaussian cumulants is sensitive to the presence of the critical point and exhibits a characteristic pattern as indicated by critical universality. If there is a critical point to be found in the regime that RHIC will explore, we propose the rapidity dependence of cumulants as a complementary route to finding signs of its presence. In particular, it seems likely that the rapidity dependence of cumulants will change qualitatively if one passes the critical point during the RHIC beam energy scan.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jasmine', 'last_name': 'Brewer', 'fullName': 'Brewer, Jasmine', 'id': '3529108', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': 'b413e511afa6bcfa0c3dbc36d9267f5e', 'db_id': 3529108, 'person_id': 3647318}"

The Wuppertal-Budapest collaboration data [1,2] for the temperature dependence of the leading four Fourier coefficients of the imaginary part of the net-baryon density at imaginary baryochemical potential is analyzed. We demonstrate how the lattice behavior of these coefficients is naturally described by the inclusion of the repulsive, excluded volume type interactions between baryons [2], in line with earlier studies regarding conserved charges fluctuations [3,4].

We formulate a Cluster Expansion Model (CEM), which provides all higher  order Fourier coefficients on the basis of the leading two coefficients [5], and allows to calculate QCD thermodynamics at non-zero chemical potentials. CEM is shown to be consistent with all the available lattice data, both at $\mu_B = 0$ and at imaginary baryochemical potential. Moreover, the radius of convergence of the Taylor expansion of the QCD pressure is found to be finite within CEM, and caused by the Roberge-Weiss like transition [6] in the complex $\mu_B / T$ plane. No evidence for the QCD phase transition at $\mu_B / T < \pi$ is found.

Finally, we present the full equation of state at finite baryon density within CEM, which can be incorporated in hydrodynamic simulations.

First, we consider the case where the nuclear medium passes directly through the critical point. In this case, the modes with wave-number of order the inverse Kibble-Zurek length and smaller fall out of equilibrium during the transit, and limit the growth of critical fluctuations in a characteristic way which depends on the wave-numbers involved. This Kibble-Zurek wavenumber will be contrasted to wave numbers of order $k\sim \sqrt{ (e + p)/\eta \tau }$ which are always out of equilibrium, even away from the critical point (Akamatsu 2016).  Subsequently we generalize to the situation when the system misses the critical point by a an amount, $\Delta = n_c/s_c \delta(s/n)$. In this case there is an additional scale, and Kibble-Zurek scaling is only relevant if $\Delta$ is sufficiently small. We will define ``sufficiently small"" in the talk and analyze the intermediate case.  The scales introduced in this analysis give a qualitative picture of the QCD critical point in heavy ion collisions, which can inform all experimental searches.

included. In this talk, we outline a novel QCD-assisted transport approach based on 
non-equilibrium chiral fluid dynamics and the effective action of low energy

includes dissipation and stochastic noise. 

We test the new framework within a low energy effective mesonic theory. For 
this case, we discuss the time evolution of fluctuation observables based on 
the higher-order moments such as the skewness and kurtosis as the system 
passes through the phase boundary. In this way, we can study details of the 
equilibration of the order parameter and of higher-order correlations, as well 
as the impact of critical slowing down on the correlation length. The 
underlying theory naturally includes critical and non-critical contributions. 
We can, therefore, explicitly test the size of the critical region, where scaling 
and dynamical scaling hold. Finally, the relative effect of critical 
versus baseline contributions to the fluctuation dynamics is quantified.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nicolas', 'last_name': 'Wink', 'fullName': 'Wink, Nicolas', 'id': '3529115', 'affiliation': 'University of Heidelberg', 'emailHash': 'dba193b71737fc29bf56145c3baec5c3', 'db_id': 3529115, 'person_id': 3647245}"

QCD at high temperature,parallel,Chiral phase transition of (2+1)-flavor QCD,"Lahiri, Anirban",Bielefeld University,Unknown,"Understanding the properties of strong interaction matter with its physical
spectrum of light and strange quarks near the pseudo-critical temperature
of (2+1)-flavor QCD is one of the central goals of high energy nuclear
physics. It generally is expected that the analytic crossover transition in
QCD is sensitive to properties of the true chiral PHASE transition at
vanishing quark masses [1,2]. This sensitivity is increased in higher order
cumulants of net charge fluctuations which currently are being measured
by STAR and PHENIX at RHIC and by ALICE at the LHC.
In order to connect these experimental findings to predictions arising from
QCD in the chiral limit it is mandatory to establish the properties of QCD in
this limit. While there are many indications that the chiral PHASE
transition is a second order transition in the universality class of O(4)
sigma models [3], this is by no means established in lattice QCD
calculations as in none of these cases continuum extrapolated results
exist [4].
In this talk we will present the status of our calculations for (2+1)-flavor
QCD with the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) on three different
lattice sizes ($N_\tau = 6, 8, 12$) and with 5 values of light quark masses
that are up to a factor 6 smaller than in nature. This allows us to
systematically control the chiral and continuum limit of QCD. We show
that our results are consistent with O(N) scaling in the chiral limit,
supporting the existence of a second order phase transition. We will also
present first continuum extrapolated results for the PHASE transition
temperature in the chiral limit and discuss the relevance of corrections to
scaling that need to be controlled when extrapolating to QCD with its

During the LHC Run 2, the ALICE experiment recorded Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV that complement the Pb-Pb datasets acquired at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV from Run 1. These datasets allow for a systematic study of light (anti-)hypernuclei production in Pb-Pb collisions, in particular, for the hyper-triton lifetime determination.

The identification of the hyper-triton is based on the excellent performance in terms of energy loss measurement in the Time Projection Chamber. In addition, the Inner Tracking System is used to discriminate secondary vertices, originating from weak decays, from the primary vertex. This is of particular importance for the measurement of (anti-)(hyper-)triton that decays weakly with a decay length of several centimetres.
 
The study of (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei production at both energies will be discussed and compared to model predictions. Special emphasis will be put on new results of the hyper-triton lifetime determination in its 2- and 3-body decay modes. Indeed most calculations on the lifetime of hyper-triton give similar lifetimes, which are close to the lifetime of free $\Lambda$ decays. On the experimental side, all results in Au+Au collision at RHIC and in Li+C collisions at GSI show a significantly shorter lifetime in comparison with that of the free $\Lambda$ decay.

This work addresses and solves this discrepancy by providing an independent extraction of this coefficient using the newly-developed SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly interacting Hadrons) transport code and the Green-Kubo formalism. We compare the results from SMASH with numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation for various systems using the Chapman-Enskog expansion as well as previous results in the literature. Substantial deviations of the coefficient are found between transport approaches mainly based on resonance propagation with finite lifetime (such as SMASH) and other (semi-analytical) approaches with energy-dependent cross-sections, where interactions do not introduce a timescale other than the inverse scattering rate. Our conclusion is that long-lived resonances strongly affect the transport properties of the system, resulting in significant differences in η/s with respect to other approaches where binary collisions dominate. We argue that the relaxation time of the system —which characterizes the shear viscosity— is determined by the interplay between the mean-free time and the lifetime of resonances. We finally show how an artificial shortening of the resonance lifetimes or the addition of a background elastic cross section nicely interpolate between the two discrepant results. To turn this around, we finally note that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ can be used to constrain the properties of the hadron gas.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jean-Bernard', 'last_name': 'Rose', 'fullName': 'Rose, Jean-Bernard', 'id': '3529223', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': '35a8f8d9136b27ee4f540551fb9f3d21', 'db_id': 3529223, 'person_id': 3644983}"

In this talk, we will present the first precise measurement of hypertriton and anti-hypertriton masses in heavy-ion collisions at STAR with the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT). Hypertritons and anti-hypertritons are reconstructed through both two-body decay channel ($^3He+\pi^-$) and three-body decay channel ($p+d+\pi^-$) using the high-statistics data collected in 2014 and 2016 Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The binding energies and lifetimes of the (anti-)hypertriton will be extracted from this precise measurement. We will also present the centrality dependence of the mid-rapidity $p_T$ spectra of triton ($t$) from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200 GeV. The collision energy and centrality dependence of the yield ratio, $N(t)N(p)/N^2(d)$, and the coalescence parameters of $d$ ($A$ = 2) and $t$ ($A$ = 3) will be also presented. Physics implications of these measurements will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peng', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Peng', 'id': '3580421', 'affiliation': 'SINAP&BNL', 'emailHash': 'af64fa3eb66985554d9a30a7bf2534cf', 'db_id': 3580421, 'person_id': 3763497}"

The enhanced production of strange and multi-strange hadrons with respect to non-strange ones was 
historically considered as one of the signatures of the formation of a partonic phase during the evolution of the system created in such collisions. Moreover, hadronic resonances are used to study the energy dependence of the hadronic interactions and jet quenching, giving us the possibility to constrain the lifetime of the hadronic phase.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Measurements of D meson nuclear modification factors and of direct and elliptic flow of D0 mesons in pPb and PbPb collisions at 5.02 with CMS,"Shi, Zhaozhong",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"the study of charm production in heavy-ion collisions is considered an excellent probe to study the properties of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements of D- meson nuclear modification, elliptic and triangular flow in PbPb collisions can provide strong constraints into the mechanisms of in-medium energy loss and charm flow in the medium. The measurement of charm flow and, in particular, of the direct flow coefficient is also expected to be sensitive to the extremely strong but short-lived magnetic field induced by the spectator protons in non- central collisions. This strong magnetic field is indeed expected to generate differences in rapidity-odd directed flow for charm and anti-charm mesons, which can be measured with high precision with the CMS apparatus. In this talk, the measurements of the $D^0$ nuclear modification factor, of the elliptic and triangular flow measured by CMS in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV will be presented together with the a new measurement of $D^0$ $R_{pPb}$ in pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV, which can provide more constrains into the relevance of cold nuclear matter effects at central rapidity down to very low tranverse momenta.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Heavy-flavour decay lepton production in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions at the LHC with ALICE,"Dubla, Andrea",GSI,Germany,"Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are formed on a shorter time scale with respect to the strongly-interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, they are sensitive probes to study the mechanisms of parton energy loss, hadronisation in the hot and dense medium, the medium evolution and its transport coefficients. The heavy-flavour nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) and the elliptic flow ($v_2$) are two of the main experimental observables that allow us to investigate the interaction strength of heavy quarks with the constituents of the expanding medium. The comparison of the $R_{\rm AA}$ of charm, beauty and light-flavour hadrons provides information about the colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of parton energy loss. At low $p_{\rm T}$ the $v_2$ is expected to give insights into the degree of thermalisation of heavy quarks in the deconfined medium, and at high $p_{\rm T}$ it carries information on the path-length dependence of in-medium parton energy loss.

In this talk, measurements of $R_{\rm AA}$ and $v_2$ of open heavy-flavour hadrons via semi-leptonic decays to electrons at mid-rapidity and muons at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies will be discussed. The progress on the analysis of the production and anisotropy of electrons from beauty-hadron decays will also be discussed. In addition, the $R_{\rm AA}$ of heavy-flavour hadron decay leptons in Xe-Xe collisions will be presented, along with the prospects for measuring the total charm cross section in this collision system.

The PHENIX Experiment measures electrons from heavy flavor decays using displaced

charm and bottom decays in the semi-electronic channel is obtained for 
$1 < p_T < 8$ GeV/c from the new 2015 $p$+$p$ reference data and a much-improved analysis of the 2014 high statistics Au+Au data. PHENIX is also able to measure $B\rightarrow $J$/\psi$ decays in the rapidity range $1.2<|y|<2.2$ for $p_T>0$.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Multi-stage jet evolution and mass hierarchy of heavy quark energy loss in heavy-ion collisions,"Cao, Shanshan",Wayne State University,Unknown,"Heavy quarks serve as valuable probes of the QGP properties as well as the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss. Experimental data at the LHC indicate significant nuclear modification of heavy flavor ($D$ & $B$) meson production that is comparable to light flavor hadrons, which seem contradictory to one’s earlier expectation of $\Delta E_g > \Delta E_q > \Delta E_c > \Delta E_b$. We extended the Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) model coupled to hydrodynamic medium to heavy quark jet evolution in the QGP including both elastic and inelastic scattering processes [1,2]. Within the LBT model, we obtain good descriptions of heavy flavor meson suppression, elliptic and triangular flow coefficients observed at the LHC and RHIC.

The time-ordered transport model is further combined with a virtuality-ordered parton shower scheme into a multi-stage evolution approach [3,4] that includes a rare-scattering multiple emission formalism at momentum large compared to heavy quark mass (sensitive only to the transverse diffusion coefficient), and a single scattering induced emission formalism at momentum comparable to mass (sensitive to the transverse diffusion as well as longitudinal drag and diffusion coefficients). This multi-stage approach reduces the difference of energy loss between $c$ and $b$ quarks and simultaneously describes $D$ and $B$ meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$. In addition, the mass (or velocity) dependence of jet-induced medium excitation is explored for the first time. Its effects on the mass hierarchy of parton energy loss and heavy-light hadron correlation functions are investigated.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,"Transport properties from Charm to Bottom: $p_T$ suppression, anisotropic flow $v_n$ and their correlations to the bulk dynamics","Plumari, Salvatore",University of Catania (Italy),Unknown,"We study the propagation of charm and bottom quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by means of a relativistic Boltzmann transport approach that in the large M/T limit recovers the standard Langevin dynamics. The non-perturbative interaction between heavy quarks and light quarks is described by means of a quasi-particle approach in which light partons are dressed with thermal masses. The last tuned to lattice QCD thermodynamics naturally induce a non-perturbative interaction that entails only a weak dependence on the temperature especially around the critical temperature $T_c$, which plays a fundamental role to describe simultaneously the experimental data for the nuclear suppression factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ of D mesons from RHIC to LHC energies. In the same scheme we present predictions for B mesons at 5.02 ATeV that shows a quite significant suppression and allow a determination of the space-diffusion coefficient that is practically independent on the transport scheme for HQ (Boltzmann vs Langevin). The last is seem to largely deviate from from pQCD estimate but also to be still somewhat larger than AdS/CFT and quite close to lattice QCD calculations. Finally it will be discussed the relevance of initial state fluctuations that allows to extend the analysis to high order anisotropic flows $v_3(p_T)$ and $v_4(p_T)$ as well as to investigate the role of QCD interaction in developing correlations between the light and the heavy flavor anisotropic flows. These will provide novel and powerful constraints for the transport coefficients.

Open heavy flavour,parallel,Measurement of heavy flavor production and azimuthal anisotropy in small and large systems with ATLAS,"Hu, Qipeng",University of Colorado Boulder,USA,"Measurements of heavy flavor hadron production and their correlations in A+A collisions provide insight into the energy loss mechanism and transport properties of heavy quarks in the QGP. From this perspective, the same measurements in $p$+A collisions thus serve as a necessary baseline for understanding the observations in A+A collisions. Additionally, detailed studies of the azimuthal anisotropy for heavy flavor hadrons in $p$+A may help address the question of whether the observed long-range ``ridge'' correlation arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale. This talk presents ATLAS measurements of heavy flavor production, via their semi-leptonic decay to muons in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV Pb+Pb and $pp$ collisions, and via identified prompt $D$ mesons in $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 8.16$ TeV $p$+Pb collisions. Heavy flavor muon yields are observed to be strongly suppressed in Pb+Pb collisions compared to that in $pp$ collisions. On the other hand, the prompt $D$ meson production in $p$+Pb collisions shows no obvious modification compared to the theoretical predictions for $pp$ collisions, indicating relatively small cold nuclear matter effects for $D$ meson production. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and centrality dependence of flow harmonics $v_2$--$v_4$ associated with heavy-flavor muons in Pb+Pb are also presented. The measured $v_2$ decreases over the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ range of 4--14 GeV, and shows a systematic variation with centrality that was observed in other $v_2$ measurements. The anisotropy measurements are extended to 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb collisions, where the azimuthal modulations of heavy-flavor muons, prompt $D$ mesons and J/$\psi$ are studied using two-particle correlations. The statistical significance of the presence or absence of long range correlations involving heavy flavor production in $p$+Pb events is quantified.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Qipeng', 'last_name': 'Hu', 'fullName': 'Hu, Qipeng', 'id': '3563347', 'affiliation': 'University of Colorado Boulder', 'emailHash': '9af0ff76e7af9ee0a48a24b84d41f2ec', 'db_id': 3563347, 'person_id': 3712470}"

In recent years, also the formation of a small-size Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in p-Pb collisions was advanced as a possible explanation of effects like long-range $v_{2}$-like angular correlations in high-multiplicity events or the enhancement of baryon production, typically observed in nucleus-nucleus collisions and ascribed to the collective expansion of the QGP.  The measurement of angular correlations of heavy-flavour particles with charged particles, at central and forward rapidities, provide an important extension of studies performed with light-flavoured hadrons to further characterise the $v_{\rm 2}$-like behavior, understand  its initial- or final-state nature, constrain its development in the partonic and/or hadronic stages, and better investigate its mass dependence. The study of open heavy flavour production in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions can also add important information to address the expected connection between collective-like and energy-loss-like effects. Moreover, production studies as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles produced in the collision can give insight into mutiple parton interactions and into the interplay between hard and soft processes

Quarkonia,parallel,Quantum dynamical dissociation of quarkonia by wave function decoherence in quark-gluon plasma,"Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"In this study, we investigate the real-time evolution of quarkonium bound states
in a quark-gluon plasma in an improved QCD based stochastic potential model. This
model describes the quarkonium dynamics in terms of a Schrödinger equation with
an in-medium potential and two noise terms encoding the residual interaction
between the heavy quarks and the medium. The time evolution described by this
equation is unitary, since the effective potential term is real-valued. At a glance this is at odds with lattice results, but we explain why this it is
actually not the case.

We discuss the the time evolution of the existence probabilities of bound states in a static medium and in a boost-invariantly expanding quark-gluon plasma. We draw two conclusions from our results: One is that the outcome of the stochastic potential model is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The other is that the noise plays an important role in order to describe quarkonium dynamics in medium, in particular it causes *decoherence* of the quarkonium wave function. The effectiveness of decoherence is controlled by a new length scale, correlation length of the noise. Its effect has not been included in existing phenomenological studies, and we discuss its importance in detail.

Furthermore, if time allows, we also discuss strategies to take account of dissipation effects in addition to diffusion effects caused by the residual interactions between the heavy quarks and the medium.

Quarkonia,parallel,Charmonium and bottomonium spectral functions from high precision lattice QCD computations,"Shu, Hai-Tao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Understanding experimental results on nuclear modification factors of heavy quarkonia as well as open heavy mesons is complicated due to the interplay between the cold and hot medium effects. In order to disentangle these two effects it is crucial to have a good understanding of thermal behavior of quarkonia and heavy quarks in the hot medium.  The quarkonium spectral function is of the most interest, as the deformation of its resonance peak structure relates to the dissociation temperatures of quarkonia and its slope at the vanishing frequency in the vector channel is connected to the heavy quark diffusion coefficient.


We will present our recent results on quarkonia spectral functions obtained from quenched lattice QCD simulations at $T\in [0.35, 2.25]T_c$. The simulations have been performed on very large and fine lattices where both charm and bottom quarks can be treated relativistically. Using multiple random sources we have computed charmonia and bottomonia correlators being 2 times more precise compared to our previous study[1,2]. In order to gain more robust information on the quark mass dependences of the thermal modifications we also computed the hadron correlators with additionally 4 different values of heavy quark masses ranging in between those of charm and bottom quarks.


We show reconstructed spectral functions from another two stochastic methods [3] besides the Maximum Entropy Method. This allows us to study systematic uncertainties of the dissociation of quarkonium states from temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions. We also estimate heavy quark diffusion coefficients using the low-frequency behavior of vector spectral functions.

The formation of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), which is predicted by lattice calculations at high temperatures as reached at LHC energies, has a strong influence on the production and behavior of quarkonia. A suppression, due to the color screening effect, with respect to the proton-proton results scaled by the number of binary collisions is expected. However, charmonium measurements from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV revealed a smaller suppression than what was observed at lower energies at the SPS and RHIC. Concurrently, the produced J/$\psi$ present a significant elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) in semi-central collisions. These measurements point to a competition between charmonium suppression and (re)generation at LHC energies, with a participation of the charm quarks to the collectivity of the medium. Thus quarkonium measurements offer great possibilities to gain further knowledge about the QGP.

Compared to charmonia, bottomonia not only gain less contribution from regeneration due to the smaller b-quark production cross-section, but are also less affected by the CNM effects. Furthermore, different bottomonium states with different binding energies are expected to dissociate at different temperatures, thus measurement of this ""sequential melting"" can help constrain the thermodynamic properties of the medium.

In this talk, we will present the latest measurements of $\Upsilon$ production in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\scriptsize\mbox{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV via both di-muon and di-electron channels by the STAR experiment. With combination of the data sets taken in 2011, 2014 and 2016, the precision of $\Upsilon$ measurements will be significantly improved compared to previous preliminary results, especially for the excited $\Upsilon$ states. The nuclear modification factors for the ground and excited $\Upsilon$ states will be shown as a function of transverse momentum and centrality, and compared to those measured at the LHC as well as to theoretical calculations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pengfei', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Pengfei', 'id': '3580468', 'affiliation': 'University of Science and Technology of China and Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '1505c157741096c37fa018632e7e8e7c', 'db_id': 3580468, 'person_id': 3763538}"
Quarkonia,parallel,Results for RHIC and LHC in a unified framework for Heavy Flavor and Quarkonium production in high multiplicity p+p and p+A collisions,"Watanabe, Kazuhiro",ODU/JLab,Unknown,"Heavy quark pair production in minimum bias p+p and p+A collisions has been studied extensively in the CGC framework and compared successfully to both the RHIC and LHC data on $J/\psi$ production [1, 2], $\psi(2S)$ production [3] and $D$-meson production [4]. We first present an update in this framework based on comparisons to the latest LHC and RHIC data on p+p and light-heavy ion collisions. We will then present novel results [5] on extensions of these studies of Heavy Flavor and Quarkonia to rare events; this work, in completion, demonstrates that this framework captures the systematics of both Heavy-Flavor and Quarkonium production as a function of $N_{\rm charge}$ at both RHIC and the LHC. Finally, we will discuss the importance of Sudakov resummations in this framework to describe $\Upsilon$ production [6, 7].

Quarkonia,parallel,Testing charm quark thermalisation within the statistical hadronisation model,"Kohler, Markus",Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,A wealth of data on charmonium production from the major LHC experiments has provided strong evidence for (re-)generation as a dominant production mechanism at low transverse momentum. To make further progress in the understanding of the underlying physics we present an important extension of the statistical hadronisation model to describe J/$\psi$ transverse momentum distributions based on input parameters from hydrodynamical simulations. Comparison to the data allows the testing of the degree of thermalisation of charm quarks in the quark-gluon plasma.  To this end we will report analyses of the centrality dependence of J/$\psi$ transverse momentum spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ and $5$ TeV.

Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonia productions in heavy ion collisions: coupled Boltzmann transport equations,"Yao, Xiaojun",Duke University,USA,"Quarkonia can be used as probes of quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a hot nuclear environment produced in heavy ion collisions. Quarkonia become unbound or ""melt"" at sufficiently high temperature due to the significant screening of the color attraction. In this sense, quarkonia can be thought of as thermometers of QGP. But extracting the melting temperature from experimental measurements is much involved. To this end, we develop a set of coupled Boltzmann transport equations of heavy quarks and quarkonia. It includes elastic and inelastic scattering of heavy quarks with the medium, dissociations and recombinations (in-medium formations) of quarkonia. The dissociation and recombination processes are calculated in potential non-relativistic QCD (pNRQCD). The effective field theory pNRQCD is valid because the heavy quark mass is large and the distance between the heavy quark antiquark pair is small inside quarkonia, compared with the thermal scales. We solve the Boltzmann equations by Monte Carlo simulations with given initial conditions and medium backgrounds. We will present how the system of heavy quarks and quarkonia approaches equilibrium in a static QGP box, which indicates that the dissociation and recombination are implemented in a consistent way. Then we will present calculations with realistic initial conditions and hydrodynamical backgrounds. The initial momenta of heavy quarks and quarkonia are generated from event generators such as Pythia with nuclear parton distribution functions while the initial positions are sampled from binary collisions. We will also compare the calculations with experimental measurements. Finally, we will discuss future plans towards a more complete understanding of quarkonia production mechanisms in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaojun', 'last_name': 'Yao', 'fullName': 'Yao, Xiaojun', 'id': '3529203', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '48b8c36abd8c27edd366e973357f1347', 'db_id': 3529203, 'person_id': 3641729}"
Quarkonia,parallel,Quarkonium Production and Polarization in an Improved Color Evaporation Model,"Vogt, Ramona",LLNL,Unknown,"An improved version of the color evaporation model (ICEM) has been introduced to describe heavy quarkonium production [1].  In contrast to the traditional color evaporation model, the constraint was imposed that the invariant mass of the intermediate heavy quark-antiquark pair must be larger than the mass of produced quarkonium.  A momentum shift between heavy quark-antiquark pair and the quarkonium was also introduced.  Calculations show that the model can describe the charmonium yields as well as ratio of $\psi^\prime$ over $J/\psi$ better than the traditional color evaporation model.

The ICEM has been extended to calculate the polarization of prompt $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$(1S) production for the first time in the color evaporation approach. The first calculations were made at leading order.  The polarization parameter $\lambda_\vartheta$ was calculated as a function of center of mass energy and rapidity in $p+p$ collisions.  The $x_F$ dependence of the polarization was also calculated and compared to experimental results in $p$+Cu and $\pi$+W collisions [2,3].  The next step of calculating the $p_T$ dependence of the polarization has been taken, with a calculation in the $k_T$-factorization approach [4].

This talk will compare the unpolarized $p_T$ distributions for the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$, as well as the $\psi'$ to $J/\psi$ ratio, in $p+p$ collisions at RHIC and the LHC for several energies.  It will also present the polarization results and make comparison to polarization data from RHIC, the Tevatron and the LHC.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Measurement of Longitudinal Decorrelation of Anisotropic Flow $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ in 54 and 200 GeV Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Nie, Maowu",Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP),Unknown,"The measurement of the decorrelation of flow harmonics, $v_n$, and event plane angles, $\Psi_n$, (or flow vector, $V_n\equiv v_ne^{in\Psi_n}$) in the longitudinal direction explores the non-boost-invariant nature of the initial collision geometry and final state collective dynamics. The decorrelations were first observed at the LHC, but are predicted by several (3+1)D hydrodynamic models to be stronger for lower $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ at RHIC due to the smaller number of initial partons and shorter string length at lower $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We report the results from large minimum-bias Au+Au datasets at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV (1.2 billion events) and 54 GeV (1 billion events) with the STAR detector. The factorization ratio, $r_n(\eta)=3D\langle V_n(-\eta)V_n^*(\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}) \rangle/\langle V_n(\eta)V_n^*(\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}) \rangle$, is used to measure the decorrelation between $\eta$ and $-\eta$ relative to a common reference $\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}$. Non-flow correlations are suppressed by a large rapidity gap between $\eta$ from the TPC ($|\eta|<1$) and the $\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}$ from the Forward Meson Spectrometer ($2.5<\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}<4$). The results are obtained for $v_2$ and $v_3$ as a function of transverse momentum and centrality for the two collision energies. They are compared with results from the LHC and calculations from different models. The decorrelations do not scale trivially with the beam rapidity $y_{beam}$, i.e. $r_n(\eta/y_{beam})$ from different beam energies do not overlap. Hydrodynamic models tuned to the Pb+Pb data at 2760 GeV fail to describe the strength of the decorrelation at 54 and 200 GeV. These results will help to constrain the initial condition along longitudinal direction and help to understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maowu', 'last_name': 'Nie', 'fullName': 'Nie, Maowu', 'id': '3580451', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP)', 'emailHash': '0c05d4ac4a0db61e91ab517bd4e3dade', 'db_id': 3580451, 'person_id': 3643244}"

We train a deep convolutional neutral network on jet images. The classification performance is compared with the multivariate analysis of several physically-constructed jet observables including the jet mass, the $p_T^D$, the multiplicity and the radial moments. We also compare with the systematic $N$-subjet expansion in the recently developed telescoping jet deconstruction framework to exploit the information carried by the subjets. The quark and gluon jet samples generated from the JEWEL simulation are used as an example to demonstrate this general method. We find that the classification performance goes down in the JEWEL-simulated heavy ion collisions. The information carried by the subleading subjets can be washed out by the possible subjet thermalization or randomization due to the soft event activities. Our method provides a systematically improvable framework for analyzing and comparing jet simulations and measurements in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yang-Ting', 'last_name': 'Chien', 'fullName': 'Chien, Yang-Ting', 'id': '3708802', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'emailHash': 'cbb5ee8809f3b0e78b339b083ec0d3fb', 'db_id': 3708802, 'person_id': 3640577}"
Collective dynamics,parallel,Probing the transverse size of initial inhomogeneities with flow observables,"Grassi, Frederique",Instituto de Física - Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"Disentangling the effect of initial conditions and medium properties is an open question in the field of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We argue that, while one can study the impact of initial inhomogeneities by varying their size, it is important to maintain the global properties fixed.

We present a method to do this by systematically smoothening the initial conditions, and apply it to four common initial condition models. We show that many observables are insensitive to the the hot spot sizes, including integrated $v_n$, scaled distributions of $v_n$, symmetric cumulants, event-plane correlations,  and differential $v_n(p_T)$. We find however that the factorization breaking ratio $r_n$ and sub-leading component in a Principal Component Analysis are more sensitive to the initial granularity and can be used to probe short-scale features of the initial density.

Collective dynamics,parallel,(3+1)D hybrid model of heavy-ion collisions at BES energies with dynamical sources,"Du, Lipei",The Ohio State University,USA,"At Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies, the dynamics of the pre-equilibrium stage and the effects resulting from a nonzero net baryon current become critical components of the dynamical evolution of the collision fireball. We develop a (3+1)-dimensional hybrid evolution model with dynamical sources for both energy-momentum and the net baryon current. During an initial pre-equilibrium stage based on UrQMD, the four-momenta and baryon numbers carried by secondary particles created within UrQMD are fed continuously, after a short thermalization time, into a (3+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic evolution module. This initialization provides an alternate model to those recently studied by Petersen ${\it et~al}$. [1] and Shen and Schenke [2]: It thermalizes more rapidly than Ref. [1] and yields a different initial net baryon distribution than Ref. [2]. We present and compare with these previous approaches the dynamical evolution of all thermodynamic and dissipative degrees of freedom, including net baryon diffusion. The sensitivity of experimental observables (spectra and anisotropic flows) to the details of the pre-equilibrium stage and to baryon diffusion will also be demonstrated.

Collective dynamics,parallel,Directed Flow of Quarks from the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Measured by STAR,"Wang, Gang",UCLA,USA,"Directed flow ($v_1$) is a good probe of the early-stage dynamics of collision systems, and the $v_1$ slope ($dv_1/dy$) at mid-rapidity is sensitive to the system's equation of state. Previously, a coalescence picture has been used to relate the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of identified particles to the $v_2$ of their constituent quarks [1]. In this talk, the coalescence idea is extended to study the $v_1$ of the constituent quarks - this includes quarks produced in the collision, as well as those transported from the initial-state nuclei. Rather than probe coalescence of $v_2$ versus $p_T$, we focus on $dv_1/dy$ versus $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$.

We report STAR measurements of $v_1(y)$ for ten particle species ($\pi^\pm$, $p$, $\bar{p}$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\phi$, $K^\pm$ and $K^0_{S}$) in Au+Au collisions at eight beam energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ GeV to 200 GeV. The $v_1$ slopes of $\bar{p}$, $K^-$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ are used to test the coalescence sum rule for produced quarks.  We hypothesize that the $v_n$ of observed mesons and baryons is the summed $v_n$ of their constituent quarks, and it is assumed that deconfined quarks have already acquired azimuthal anisotropy. Data involving produced quarks support the coalescence picture at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 11.5$ GeV to 200 GeV, and a sharp deviation from this picture is observed at 7.7 GeV [2].

The $dv_1/dy$ of transported quarks are studied via net particles (net $p$, net $K$ and net $\Lambda$). The net-particle $dv_1/dy$ data for $p$, $K$ and $\Lambda$ agree at and above $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 14.5$ GeV, but net kaons begin to diverge with decreasing beam energy. Tests of the coalescence sum rule are carried out for net particles, and implications for transported quark $v_1$ are discussed.

Collective dynamics,parallel,System size dependence of flow observables in hydrodynamic simulations,"Luzum, Matthew",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,Unknown,"Valuable information about the behavior of a heavy-ion collision system can be obtained by changing the species of colliding nuclei, and in particular using species of different size.  This change in system size can probe characteristic behavior in a way that is not possible with a single collision system.  Already, results of small collisions systems such as  p-p, p-A, d-A, and $^3$He have received much attention. Recently, the LHC performed $^{129}$Xe-$^{129}$Xe collisions, a system with a size that is intermediate between small systems like p-p and large systems like Pb-Pb, at almost the same collision energy.  

We perform hydrodynamic simulations of Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions and argue that hydrodynamic behavior dictates definite relations between the results, regardless of the details of the simulations, due to scaling laws inherent to fluid dynamics.  This can be used to test the hydrodynamic framework in general and search for a breakdown of hydrodynamics with decreasing system size.  

Conversely, one can extract detailed information about system properties by studying carefully-selected observables.  For example, the relative elliptic flow of the two systems in very central collisions is sensitive to the expected prolate deformation of the Xenon nucleus.   Additionally, we describe a procedure to determine the average viscosity in a model-independent way by comparing selected ratios of flow coefficients in the two systems.
