Poster Session,poster,Bjorken expansion with gradual freeze out via HBT,"Borrell Martinez, Marc",Unknown,Unknown,"For Bjorken models with gradual freeze out, the resulting post freeze out momentum distribution practically does not depend on the layer thickness. Using such a model we calculate the pion correlation function produced in Pb+ Pb central collisions The correlation function is in qualitative agreement with other publications but our model allows us to perform a more detailed study of how this affects the final observables. We also find a good agreement with experimental data from ALICE and we deduce that long freeze out averaged correlation functions are more similar to experimental data than sharp freeze out.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Marc', 'last_name': 'Borrell Martinez', 'fullName': 'Borrell Martinez, Marc', 'id': '3513408', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'abfefabb288b1acf08e4e437c3224995', 'db_id': 3513408, 'person_id': 3644588}"
Poster Session,poster,The Azimuthal Angle Dependence of Lambda (anti-Lambda) Polarization in Au+Au Collisions from STAR,"Tu, Biao",Central China Normal University and Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"The STAR experiment at RHIC has observed for the first time a significant alignment between the angular momentum of the medium produced in non-central collisions [1] and the spin of $\Lambda$($\overline{\Lambda}$) hyperons ($J$$=$1/2), revealing that the matter produced in heavy-ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. Such vorticity is expected to be maximal at the equator, and due to the low viscosity of the system, the vorticity may not be propagated efficiently to the poles. This may lead to a larger in-plane than out-of-plane polarization for $\Lambda$ hyperons.

In this poster, we will present the azimuthal angle (with respect to the reaction plane) dependence of $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ polarization in 20-50% central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The implications of our results will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Factorization of two-particle probability distributions in  Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with ALICE,"Bourjau, Christian",University of Copenhagen (DK),DK,"The flow coefficients $v_n$ are commonly extracted from multi-particle distributions where the properties of one or several particles are averaged over a large range in pseudorapidity $\eta$ or transverse momentum $p_{\text{T}}$.
  Such approaches assume that the observed multi-particle distributions can be factorized into a product of single-particle distributions.
  However, it is known that this condition is violated even in ideal hydrodynamics due to initial state fluctuations or the presence of non-flow.
  Detailed studies of a possible violation of this factorization assumption can therefore be used to constrain the size of such fluctuations as well as to identify possible non-flow contributions.
  A factorization breakdown can be measured directly in multi-particle probability distributions.
  This poster presents an explicit approach to the $\eta$-dependent factorization of two-particle probability distributions within $-3.4 \leq \eta \leq 5$ in the latest $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV Pb--Pb data measured with ALICE.
  A factorizing phase-space region is identified by varying the minimal $\Delta\eta$ separation between particles; the factorization breakdown for small separations is attributed to non-flow and detector effects.
  The analysis yields the well known $v_n$ coefficients as the result of the factorization process.
  These flow coefficients are compared to similar results measured with the Q-cumulant method.
  All findings are also compared to model calculations and previous studies at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christian', 'last_name': 'Bourjau', 'fullName': 'Bourjau, Christian', 'id': '3513399', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': 'de946d1d58a6c747e0f614ba412913ba', 'db_id': 3513399, 'person_id': 3644285}"

Poster Session,poster,D^{0}-meson Elliptic Flow Measurement in Au+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV from STAR,"Liang, Yue",Kent State Univesrsity & Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ,USA,"A recent result from the STAR experiment shows that in 10-40% central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of the $D^0$-meson follows the Number-of-Constituent-Quark scaling in the same way as it does for light flavor hadrons. This suggests that charm quarks have gained sufficiently large collectivity through their interactions with the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). It is of great interest to see whether this scaling holds in more peripheral collisions, which will shed more lights on how charm quarks interact with the QGP and gain collectivity.

In this poster, we present the centrality and transverse momentum dependences of the $D^0$-meson $v_{2}$ measured in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. The measurement is based on the combined datasets recorded in 2014 and 2016, which yield about a factor of 3 times of the statistics compared to the previously published results. In order to better understand the non-flow contribution in peripheral collisions, the azimuthal anisotropy parameter $v_{2}$ is measured as a function of the pseudo-rapidity gap between the $D^0$-meson and tracks used for reconstructing the event plane. The results will be compared to those of light hadrons in various centrality intervals and physics implications will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yue', 'last_name': 'Liang', 'fullName': 'Liang, Yue', 'id': '3597219', 'affiliation': 'Kent State Univesrsity & Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ', 'emailHash': '690d6342aee2760306d6684f8015d4fa', 'db_id': 3597219, 'person_id': 3780986}"

The PHENIX experiment has measured substantial elliptic ($v_2$) flow coefficients for charged hadrons at midrapidity in a suite of small collision systems over a range of collision energies. We extend these results with new measurements of charged hadron $v_2(p_T)$ at forward and backward rapidities in $d+$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV in order to better constrain the rapidity extent of these correlations.

Poster Session,poster,Predictions for  event-by-event flow harmonic distributions at RHIC,"Barbosa, Leonardo",Instituto de Física da Universidade de São Paulo,Unknown,"Hydrodynamical models must be able to reproduce data not only in average for a given centrality class but for each event. In particular they must reproduce the scaled $v_n$ distributions obtained by ATLAS [1,2] and ALICE [3]. These distributions are independent of medium properties such as viscosity, and so directly probe the initial conditions.  

They in fact provide a strong test for initial condition models:  many models   (e.g. Glauber and MC-KLN) can be ruled out and so far only two models  lead to satisfactory results [4,5]. In this work, we show that NeXus initial conditions also provide reasonable results for scaled $v_n$ distributions at LHC energies and make predictions for RHIC top energy.

Poster Session,poster,STAR Measurements of Elliptic Flow in Small Collision Systems,"Sergeeva, Maria",UCLA,USA,"The coefficient of the second harmonic in azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) of produced particles gives insight to bulk properties of the medium being created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.

These studies aim to answer the questions of how small a QGP droplet can be and what is the boundary between a confined and deconfined medium. However, non-flow correlations, especially due to jets and di-jets, can influence the observed flow and may tend to dominate in small systems. Therefore, special care has to be taken to differentiate collectivity from non-flow contributions.

Transverse sphericity is a momentum space event shape variable giving a measure of how isotropically particles and their momenta are distributed within an event. This variable allows us to differentiate events containing jets produced in hard processes from those events containing multiple soft, non-perturbative QCD processes.

In this poster, we show that the two major volume fluctuations effects, centrality bin width and centrality resolution effects, can be probed using flow fluctuation measurements. Using a Glauber model with particle production, we show that the recently observed sign-change of the $c_2\{4\}$ in ultra-central collisions by ATLAS is directly sensitive to the amount of centrality smearing. Therefore the pattern of $c_2\{4\}$ sign-change can be used to quantify the centrality resolution effect. Furthermore, we find that the volume fluctuation effects naturally evolves with rapidity, and therefore the sign-change pattern of $c_2\{4\}$ also expected to evolve with rapidity. We explore new approaches based on flow measurements to constrain the volume fluctuation.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jiangyong', 'last_name': 'Jia', 'fullName': 'Jia, Jiangyong', 'id': '3513485', 'affiliation': 'Stony brook Universty (US)', 'emailHash': '3d951a186ae4e1d5ce26f3dd3683cd17', 'db_id': 3513485, 'person_id': 3642836}"

In this poster, we show a first measurement of the efficiency-corrected cumulant ratios ($C_{2}/C_{1}$, $C_{3}/C_{2}$) of net-$\Lambda$, which are subject to strangeness and baryon number conservation, for five beam energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $ 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV Au$+$Au collisions) as a function of centrality and rapidity. We compare our results to the previous STAR results [1, 2], the Poisson and negative binomial expectations, as well as the UrQMD model, the hadron resonance model, and lattice QCD predictions.

Electrons reach the detector without significant final state

sources, i.e. Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons,
semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, as well dielectrons from the

Therefore, they can be used to study the space-time evolution of the system.

While pp collisions provide an important baseline measurement in vacuum for
heavy-ion studies, p-Pb collisions can be used to disentangle cold from hot
nuclear matter effects. Moreover, recent studies in small colliding systems
(pp and p-Pb) showed intriguing collective behaviours similar to observations previously
done in heavy-ion collisions. They require further investigations in
particular as a function of the event charged-particle multiplicity. Searching
for the thermal signatures through dielectrons is also important in small

This parton fragments into a jet from which the hadron arises. The main background for this measurement are photons from meson decays. This is estimated via a parameterization of the measurement of the pi0 and eta cross sections and theoretical calculations of the direct photon cross-section using JETPHOX and PeTeR.

Poster Session,poster,Test and development of the front-end electronics for the Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment,"Rodriguez, Adrian",Goethe University Frankfurt am Main,Unknown,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) Experiment at the FAIR facility will explore the QCD phase diagram at very high baryon densities, where a first order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter as well as a chiral phase transition is expected to occur. The design goal of CBM is to cope with very high interaction rates up to 10 MHz. This will allow performing high precision measurements of extremely rare probes. To achieve the high rate capability, CBM will be equipped with fast and radiation hard detectors employing free-streaming readout electronics. The Silicon Tracking System (STS), is the essential component for tracking up to 1000 particles per event in A+A collision. Having 2.1 million readout channels, it poses the most demanding requirements in terms of bandwidth and density of all CBM detectors. The custom developed front-end device for reading out the double-sided silicon sensors is the STS-XYTER ASIC. This is a low power, self-triggering ASIC with 128 channels, which provides timing and energy information for each sensor signal. In addition, the ASIC implements a new readout protocol, developed for operation with the GBTx data aggregation ASIC. To ensure its satisfactory operation, it demands low noise levels as the system is self-triggering; it needs to be fully integrated into a very confined space and it must have a reliable performance in a highly irradiated environment and strong magnetic field. Various tests are carried out to check the ASIC functionalities, its performance in different data taking scenarios, system integration as well as radiation hardness. An overview of the experimental setup, device testing procedures and results will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adrian', 'last_name': 'Rodriguez', 'fullName': 'Rodriguez, Adrian', 'id': '3513584', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt am Main', 'emailHash': '16d10b48524d0fb98d7bf81ff748ecf7', 'db_id': 3513584, 'person_id': 3647177}"

This field, referred to as glasma, has several instabilities from the anisotropy, so small fluctuations in glasma grow exponentially.
Glasma is also known to have chaoticity, which make the field configuration complex and produces the entropy.
Instability and chaoticity of glasma rapidly drive the pressure isotropization and are expected to cause thermalization.
In this work, we compare the time scale of the entropy production and the pressure isotropization in the classical Yang-Mills field.
We regard the classical field as a coherent state, and evaluate the quantum entropy (von Neuman entropy) obtained by ignoring the off-diagonal density matrix elements, namely decoherence.
We find that the growth of fluctuations cause entropy production and pressure isotropization in the same time scale.

Poster Session,poster,Performance of Heavy-flavor Tagged Jet Identification in STAR,"Oh, Saehanseul",Yale University and Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"The measurement of heavy-flavor tagged jets in relativistic heavy ion collisions is an important tool to study the properties of the hot and dense QCD medium. While the flavor dependence of jet quenching has been attributed to several physics mechanisms, such as collisional and radiative energy losses of hard-scattered partons, previous measurements at the LHC have not shown a strong flavor dependence of jet quenching in the jet transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) range of $80$-$250$ GeV/$c$ in heavy ion collisions. However, experimental inability to distinguish prompt heavy-flavor quarks and those from gluon splitting has limited the quantitative interpretation of currently available measurements. Compared to collision energies at the LHC, the fraction of heavy-flavor quarks from gluon splitting to prompt heavy-flavor quarks is predicted to be lower at RHIC energies, making flavor-dependent measurements more accessible. In this poster, performance studies of heavy-flavortagged jet identification in the STAR experiment at RHIC are reported.

STAR's recent addition of the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) provides significantly improved resolution of secondary vertices and thus excellent identification of particles containing heavy quarks. Taking advantage of the HFT capability, we have developed a number of heavy-flavor jet tagging algorithms based on properties of reconstructed secondary vertices and properties of constituent tracks. Tagging efficiency and misidentification rate of each algorithm are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. These performance results will be used as a basis for upcoming STAR measurements on flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Saehanseul', 'last_name': 'Oh', 'fullName': 'Oh, Saehanseul', 'id': '3583438', 'affiliation': 'Yale University and Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '4a95ab687f928c562b3b86a39d80408f', 'db_id': 3583438, 'person_id': 3766186}"

Obtaining direct photons is challenging because of the myriad of background photons. Typically, a statistical subtraction method is used in A+A at RHIC. In addition to a statistical method, we have also developed a direct method to obtain isolated photons in A+A by using an isolation cut like those used in direct photon identification in p+p collisions.

A key problem has always been to accurately determine the jet energy calibration in order to establish the influence of the hot QCD medium on the observed jet properties.

The direct photon, produced in hard scatterings back-to-back with a parton, serves as a calibration of the away-side jet and thus provides less-biased insight into how the medium affects the away-side jet fragmentation. We ultimately aim to measure the modified fragmentation function f($z_{\mathrm{T}}$) and its dependencies on several quantities like the $\gamma$-trigger $p_{T}$ or associated hadron $p_{T}$ to understand the $z_{T}$ dependence.

It achieves a high level of performance at the extreme data taking conditions under high luminosity and high backgrounds. The basic structure of DTOF is composed of a Fused Silica radiator connected to fast photomultiplier (MCP-PMT or SiPM) array, readout by a dedicated front-end electronics. The challenge comes from the fact that the limited flight length for charged particles in detectors requires its timing measurement achieves the level of tens of pico seconds, summing up all uncertainties, to meet the requirement for current and future high luminosity particle colliders. For example, the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN is expected to provide instantaneous luminosities of 1034cm-2s-1 and above, which requires TOF's time resolution ~30ps to suppress pileup in collisions.

To meet these requirements, we developed a pico-second timing TOF prototype based on DTOF technology, using 1.5cm x 1.5cm x 2cm square Cherenkov radiator connected by high-resolution fast MCP-PMT(Hamamastu R3809U). And we also developed high speed readout electronics (Bandwidth 2.4GHz, Gain 6dB ~ 26.6dB): Programmable Differential Amplifier(PDA) LMH6881/2 and Dual-threshold Differential Discriminator(DDD). It applied dual thresholds to process signals: low threshold to measure signals’ arrival time, while high threshold to identify real signals and exclude noise. It is a much simpler and faster timing method than wave sampling. The beam test in H4 at CERN shows that: the intrinsic time resolution readout by DDD and PDA is <20ps. Since there is no tracking selection and the readout electronics (PDA and DDD) are preliminary designation, there is still potential to improve its performance.

Poster Session,poster,Production and azimuthal anisotropy of beauty decay electrons in Pb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV with ALICE,"Volkl, Martin Andreas",Eberhards  Karls Universiy Tubingen (DE),GB,"The study of the interaction of heavy quarks with the constituents of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions provides important information about the characteristics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The production of heavy quarks occurs prior to the formation of the QGP, implying that they experience the entire evolution of the system. To infer the properties of the partonic interactions of charm and beauty quarks in the medium, it is useful to investigate how heavy quarks are influenced by the collective expansion of the system. A sufficiently strong interaction could lead to a themalization of the heavy quarks which then would move along with the flow of the surrounding medium constituents leading to a substantial azimuthal anisotropy in non-central collisions.
The excellent particle-identification capabilities of the ALICE detector allow for an investigation of beauty production via the measurement of beauty-hadron decay electrons. The separation from background electrons is achieved via a statistical separation based on the track impact parameter distribution. This distribution is wider for the beauty decay electrons due to the comparatively larger decay length of their parent hadrons ($c\tau\approx500\,\mathrm{\mu m}$).

Poster Session,poster,"Measurement of Ds+/D+ as a function of transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE","Grosa, Fabrizio",Politecnico di Torino (IT),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm or beauty) are powerful probes to study and characterise the properties of the deconfined medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Because of their large masses, heavy quarks are produced in initial hard-scattering processes, and they subsequently experience the whole system evolution, interacting with the medium constituents. The observation of a large suppression of the heavy-flavour hadron yields at intermediate/high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in central Pb-Pb collisions with respect to those in pp collisions provides a strong evidence of the in-medium parton energy loss. Moreover, the measurement of heavy-flavour hadrons with strange-quark content (i.e. ${\rm D^+_{s}}$ mesons) can give insight into the heavy-quark hadronisation mechanism. If a fraction of charm quarks hadronises via coalescence, the relative abundance of ${\rm D^+_{s}}$ with respect to non-strange D mesons is expected to be larger in heavy-ion collisions compared to pp collisions, due to the enhanced production of strange quarks in the QGP. Furthermore, an enhanced production of strange and multi-strange hadrons was recently observed in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the pT-differential cross section and fragmentation function of D0-tagged jets in pp collisions with ALICE,"Aiola, Salvatore",Yale University (US),USA,"The production of heavy quarks in proton-proton (pp) is described in the framework of perturbative Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (pQCD) via the leading order process ${\rm gg\, (q\bar{q})} \rightarrow {\rm Q\bar{Q}}$. Among higher-order processes, gluon splitting ${\rm gg\, (q\bar{q})} \rightarrow {\rm gg} \rightarrow \rm gc\bar{c}$ is known to account for a large fraction of the charm produced at the LHC. Charmed hadrons coming from the fragmentation of charm quarks produced in the leading order process are expected to carry a larger fraction of the total jet momentum, as compared to those coming from gluon splitting. Therefore the measurement of the charm jet fragmentation functions (FFs)  can be used to improve our understanding of the charm production mechanisms.

Heavy-flavor jets can also provide important insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as heavy quarks are predicted to interact with the QGP constituents differently compared to light quarks and gluons. Measuring charm jets gives a better estimate of the initial parton energy when compared to single-hadron measurements, which allows a more precise test of heavy-quark transport models of the QGP in the low momentum region, where the effect of the quark mass is expected to be more prominent.

We present the measurement of the production of charm jets tagged with fully reconstructed D$^0$ mesons in minimum bias pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV with the ALICE detector. The production of charm jets is investigated both in the $p_{\rm T}$-differential cross section and in the distribution of the jet momentum fraction ($z$) carried by the D$^0$ meson.

The quark number holonomy is defined by the quark number density and it can be an order parameter which detects the quark-deconfinement [1,2]. We find some analytical formulae of the quark number density. In the large quark mass regime, the quark number density is expressed in terms of the Polyakov loop. On the other hand, in the small quark mass region, the quark number density is expressed by the eigenmodes of the Wilson-Dirac operator on a lattice. It is found that the quark number density strongly depends on the low-lying Dirac modes. However, the quark number holonomy is not sensitive to the low-lying Dirac modes. Based on these results, we discuss the confinement-deconfinement transition [3].

In a smaller colliding system, the final freeze-out of the hot QCD matter is closer to the phase boundary so more genuine information on the phase structure, including QCD critical point, is retained compare to much larger systems. We will compare the results from Cu+Cu collision to that of Au+Au collisions as a function of both initial system size ( $N_{part}$) and the final size ($N_{mult}$) at these collision energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zhenzhen', 'last_name': 'Yang', 'fullName': 'Yang, Zhenzhen', 'id': '3597218', 'affiliation': 'CCNU/LBNL', 'emailHash': 'f2a492440175b1ede85331ea9e44c2c3', 'db_id': 3597218, 'person_id': 3780984}"

According to lattice QCD calculation, the off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge ($Q$), net-baryon ($B$) and net-strangeness ($S$) and their ratios to diagonal cumulants are sensitive to the evolution of the system and to constrain the freeze-out parameters in the QCD phase diagram [1,2].

In this poster, we report a first measurement of $2^{nd}$-order off-diagonal cumulants of net-charge, net-proton and net-kaon multiplicity distributions at RHIC in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4 and 200 GeV. We study beam energy, centrality, and acceptance ($\eta$) window dependence of off-diagonal cumulants after implementing efficiency and other experimental corrections. The measured cumulants ratios are compared with the predictions from UrQMD and hadron resonance gas models. The results will be discussed in the context of understanding the correlated fluctuations of the conserved quantities.

They are good candidates to probe the interplay of particle re-scattering and regeneration in the hadronic phase. In particular, the K$^{*}(892)^{\pm}$ resonances are important because of their very short lifetimes ($\sim$ 4 fm/$\it c$) which are comparable to that of the fireball. The K$^{*\pm}$  is reconstructed via a two-step decay process: the resonance undergoes a strong decay to K$^{0}_{S}$ + $\pi^{\pm}$ and then the K$^{0}_{S}$ decays weakly to $\pi^{+}$ + $\pi^{-}$. Measurements in pp collisions constitute a reference for the measurements in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the same center-of-mass energy and contribute to the study of the energy and multiplicity dependence of particle production in pp collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Novel lattice simulations for transport coefficients in quenched QCD,"Ziegler, Felix",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"Transport coefficients, such as the temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities, are essential QCD ingredients in the hydrodynamical description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. While the equation of state by now is known with high precision from lattice simulations, the extraction of the transport coefficients from Euclidean simulations is extremely challenging. In particular, the corresponding Kubo formula requires the evaluation of a spectral function at vanishing momentum, and hence a reliable spectral reconstruction from Euclidean data at low frequencies. In standard lattice simulation at finite temperature this reconstruction is based on the discrete Matsubara frequencies, and is -in practice- exponentially hard: the thermal part of the low frequency information is hidden in the thermal decay of the Euclidean data at large frequencies. 

In order to overcome this limitation, we apply the novel approach for thermal fields on the lattice [1] to gauge fields [2]. The formalism operates in a non-compact imaginary time domain that leads to continuous imaginary time frequencies. The quantum evolution is formulated as an initial value problem and the thermal initial conditions are supplied by a standard lattice simulation. 

We present results for the energy momentum tensor in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and SU(3) quenched QCD, which show excellent convergence to the standard results at finite Matsubara frequencies. From the correlation functions, we extract the relevant spectral functions using the Bayesian BR method [3] and determine the shear and bulk viscosity over entropy ratios. The imaginary time data in the present novel approach are precise enough to allow for a conclusive discussion of transport peaks in the spectral functions. Results are presented for the confined and deconfined phase.

excellent probes to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced under
extreme temperature and energy density conditions in heavy-ion collisions. Because of their large mass,
heavy quarks are produced in hard parton-scattering processes at the
beginning of the collisions and they are therefore present in the QGP
during all stages of its evolution.

At mid-rapidity ($|y|<0.8$), ALICE can reconstruct J/$\psi$ mesons via their decay
into the dielectron channel, down to zero transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}$. However,
particularly at very low $p_{\rm T}$ and in central collisions, the measurement is
limited by the low signal to background ratio. Increasing the significance of the
measurement in the low $p_{\rm T}$ region is extremely important for several reasons:
First, in the study of prompt J/$\psi$ production, higher precision will
shed light on the interplay between J/$\psi$ dissociation and regeneration.
Second, 
the non-prompt J/$\psi$ analysis can give access to low $p_{\rm T}$ beauty
measurements.

Using multivariate methods helps to reduce the background and increase the
significance while keeping as much signal as possible.

Such an effect can be investigated by studying the correlations between heavy-flavour production and the total charged-particle multiplicity.

This is suggestive of coherent $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ photo-production, similar to measurements in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC), where the nuclei only interact electromagnetically.

During the LHC Run-2, the measurement of the very low ${p}_\mathrm{T}$ $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ at mid-rapidity (-0.9< $y$ <0.9) in the di-electron decay channel was possible thanks to the large sample of recorded Pb-Pb collisions.

Studies involving strange and multi-strange hadrons, such as $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$, carry additional information since there is no net strangeness content in the initial colliding system. Strangeness enhancement in AA collisions with respect to pp and pA collisions has long been considered as one of the signatures for quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation. The Recent observation of collective effects in high-multiplicity pp and pA collisions raise the question of whether QGP can also be formed in the smaller systems. Systematic studies of the strange particle abundance and nuclear modification factors can shed light on this issue. The CMS experiment has excellent strange-particle reconstruction capabilities over a broad kinematic range in pp and pPb collisions. The spectra of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$ hadrons have been measured in various rapidity regions as a function of $p_T$ in pp and pPb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Based on the measurements of these spectra, nuclear modification factors of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^-$, and $\Omega^-$ in mid-rapidity are measured. Since pPb is an asymmetric system, the nuclear modification factor of $K^0_S$, $\Lambda$, and $\Xi^-$ in Pb-going direction are compared to those in p-going direction. These final results for nuclear modification factors measured out to high-$p_T$ can be helpful in discussing the implications of collective behavior and energy loss. In addition, the measurement of the forward-backward rapidity yield asymmetries of $K^0_S$ and $\Lambda$ as a function of $p_T$ provide sensitivity to initial state effects, such as shadowing in the nuclear parton distributions.

The excellent particle identification, tracking and vertexing performance of the ALICE experiment allow for the search of this exotic bound state in the decay channel Λnn → πt in Pb-Pb collisions. In order to improve the detection of this state within a big combinatorial background, the extraction of the signal is performed by means of a multivariate approach with the TMVA (Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis with ROOT).

This dibaryon was recently observed at WASA-at-COSY. A narrow resonance with I($J^{P}$) = 0($3^{+}$) - named now $d^{*}(2380)$ - has been observed in all relevant two-pion decay channels as well as in np-scattering.  Quark model calculations predict this state to be a compact hexaquark structure of size 0.8 fm, whereas Faddeev calculations with hadronic interactions favour a molecular structure.

A detailed Monte Carlo study of the expected correlated and uncorrelated background sources in the $d^{*}(2380)$ relevant invariant mass region will be presented in order to have an estimation of the statistical significance of the measurement.
The confirmation of the existence of the $d^{*}(2380)$ state would provide a new candidate for an exotic degree of freedom in the nuclear equation of state at high densities (e.g. neutron stars) and will open the hunt for other possible non-trivial exotic states produced in heavy ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pietro', 'last_name': 'Fecchio', 'fullName': 'Fecchio, Pietro', 'id': '3513886', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': 'ec14610465aef43bc0ba749e39af3866', 'db_id': 3513886, 'person_id': 3642211}"

The experimental results show that in nucleus-nucleus collisions, the charmonium yields are modified compared to the expectations based on the yields measured in proton proton interactions, scaled by the number of binary collisions. In proton-nucleus collisions this yield modification is due to the so-called Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects such as shadowing, gluon saturation, parton energy loss, comover absorption. This information can be obtained from p-Pb collisions.

At LHC energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 and 8.16 TeV), ALICE has observed a modification of the J/$\rm{\psi}$ yields  in p-Pb collisions which can be understood assuming shadowing to be the dominant contribution. On the other hand, the $\rm{\psi}$(2S) was found to have a similar suppression as the J/$\rm{\psi}$ at forward rapidity, but it shows a much stronger suppression in the backward rapidity region.  So, this behavior cannot be explained by the shadowing or energy loss only unlike J/$\rm{\psi}$. Final state mechanisms, as the comover absorption, should be playing a role in this region.

In the simulations, observations are differentiated in terms of density, position, and production modes; in combination with a higher order analysis. The heavy ion yield appears to have been reproduced to great detail in present model. The reproduction of both elliptic-, and triangular flow speaks of a fluctuating-, and density-characterized first order geometric mode, in addition to higher order features.

To this end we treat quark-antiquark correlations in the pion channel (bound states and scattering continuum) within a  Beth-Uhlenbeck approach that uses medium-dependent phase shifts.
A striking medium effect is the Mott transition which occurs when the binding energy vanishes and the discrete pion bound state merges the continuum. This transition is triggered by the lowering of the continuum edge due to the chiral restoration transition. This in turn also entails a modification of the Polyakov-loop so that the SU(3) center symmetry gets broken at finite temperature and dynamical quarks (and gluons) appear in the system taking over the role of the dominant degrees of freedom from the pions.  
At low temperatures our model reproduces the chiral perturbation theory result for the chiral condensate while at high temperatures the PNJL model result is recovered.
The new aspect of the current work is a consistent treatment of the chiral restoration transition region within the Beth-Uhlenbeck approach on the basis of mesonic phase shifts for the treatment of the correlations. Special emphasis is on the discussion of the result for the pseudocritical temperature of the chiral transition which in PNJL models at the mean field level comes out too large, in contradiction with lattice QCD results.

Charm production measurements in p--Pb collisions allow us to disentangle the influence on particle production of cold nuclear matter effects from those related to the formation of a QGP in Pb--Pb collisions.
In ALICE, charm production is studied through the reconstruction of D-meson hadronic decays at midrapidity. In this contribution, we will present the measurement of the production cross section of D^{+} -mesons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 5.02, 7, 8 and 13 TeV with the ALICE detector. The D^{+} meson nuclear modification factor measured in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV will also be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Renu', 'last_name': 'Bala', 'fullName': 'Bala, Renu', 'id': '3513790', 'affiliation': 'University of Jammu (IN)', 'emailHash': 'fafc14e52e7a9bb755c5bed038e613b7', 'db_id': 3513790, 'person_id': 3636330}"
Poster Session,poster,Influence of final-state radiation on heavy-flavour observables in pp collisions,"Vermunt, Luuk",Utrecht University (NL),Unknown,"Initial- and final-state radiation are important processes for the physical interpretation of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Calculations of these perturbative QCD corrections are, however, limited to probabilistic approximations using parton shower approaches in event generators. Although this Monte-Carlo DGLAP description is nowadays state-of-the-art, there still exist significant differences on the quantitative level. To address these open questions, it is important to investigate final-state radiation processes experimentally by identifying sensitive observables.

In this study, a new transverse momentum correlation observable, the momentum imbalance between D and Dbar mesons, is identified as a sensitive tool to study final-state radiation. This is shown by using simulations with the EPOS3+HQ model and the event generator Pythia 6. The presented results will focus on heavy-flavour particles only because these are most likely pair-produced in the initial stages of the collision. With the upcoming detector upgrades for LHC Run-3, statistically significant correlation measurements of these heavy-flavour particles will become feasible. In the end, this method can be extended to pA and AA data to study several aspects of energy loss in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Luuk', 'last_name': 'Vermunt', 'fullName': 'Vermunt, Luuk', 'id': '3513786', 'affiliation': 'Utrecht University (NL)', 'emailHash': '2426ecb9ade24c17b55c08681540a9b9', 'db_id': 3513786, 'person_id': 3642258}"

Moreover, the multiplicity dependence of the heavy flavour yield in pp collisions is sensitive to the large amounts of gluon radiation and the contribution of Multiple Parton Interactions (MPI) in the collisions. 

In this contribution, we present the measurement of the yield of heavy-flavour hadron decay electrons at mid-rapidity ($|\eta| <$ 0.8) as a function of transverse momentum and charged particle multiplicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV. Electron identification is done within 0.5 $< p_\mathrm{T}<$ 4.5 GeV/$c$ with the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Time of Flight (TOF) detectors of the ALICE apparatus. The measurement of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decay is expressed in terms of the ratio of the yield in a particular multiplicity interval to the multiplicity integrated yield (self-normalized yield).

This process has typical time scales shorter than the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation time, therefore by studying the kinematic properties of heavy-flavour particles, the medium can be investigated. In particular, it is important to understand how these quarks lose energy by traversing the medium and to test shadowing, hadronization and flow mechanisms. 

In this poster the status and progresses on the results concerning open heavy-flavour detection through semi-electronic decay channels in Pb-Pb collisions at the centre of mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02\text{ TeV}$ registered by ALICE will be shown.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of heavy-flavour production and study of heavy-flavour jets via electrons in heavy-ion collisions with ALICE,"Sakai, Shingo",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense colour-deconfined QCD matter, so called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in initial hard partonic interactions, and they propagate through the QGP.A strong suppression of heavy-flavour hadron production has been observed in the most central heavy-ion collisions with respect to the expectation from binary-scaled pp collisions at intermediate and high $p_{\rm{T}}$. This is ascribed to energy loss of heavy flavours via radiative and collisional processes in the dense matter. In addition, the positive $v_{2}$ (elliptic flow) observed at low $p_{\rm{T}}$ in semi-central heavy-ion collisions suggests that heavy quarks participate to the collective motion of the system. These results indicate strong interaction of heavy quarks in the medium. Further information of the interaction of heavy quarks in the QGP is obtained by measuring their production in different collisions energies. Measuring heavy-flavour jets allows for a more direct access to the initial parton kinematics and therefore provides an additional information on the energy loss and hadronisation of heavy quarks in the medium. The study of jets allows also to address the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the radiative energy. 

In this poster, recent ALICE measurements of the $R_{\rm{AA}}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV is shown. The result is compared with the $R_{\rm{AA}}$ measured at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV for discussing the energy dependence of the suppression and with theoretical predictions.

In two-particle femtoscopy the background can be estimated with the mixed-event technique, but this approach appears to be impossible to reconcile with the standard cumulant formalism for the case of more than two particles. 

We demonstrate how the mixed-event technique can be replaced with marginal distributions, which unifies multiparticle femtoscopy with the standard cumulant formalism.

Neutral mesons are reconstructed via their two photon decay channels by means of an invariant mass analysis.
Photons are detected with three different systems; using the central barrel tracking detectors of ALICE in order to reconstruct photon conversions (PCM) and the two available calorimeters in the experiment, namely the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS) and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal).
The reported measurements are carried out as well using a 'hybrid' system which reconstructs meson candidates by combining one EMCal photon with one PCM photon.
Thus, this 'hybrid' system serves as an important cross-check for the single measurements and additionally measures an almost independent set of meson candidates.
The EMCal is a sampling calorimeter with good acceptance and high reconstruction efficiency, enabling measurements of $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons up to highest transverse momenta due to its excellent triggering capabilities.
In addition to these results on neutral meson production, the corresponding $\eta/\pi^0$-ratios will be shown to test scaling laws for particle production. 
All obtained results will be compared with different Monte Carlo generators as well as recent NLO pQCD predictions.

Based on the obtained results, inclusive direct photon measurements are being carried out, for which the most recent status will be presented.
A novel method using the 'hybrid' PCM-EMCal system is followed in addition to tag $\pi^{0}$ candidates and extract the direct photon signal, which will be shortly illustrated.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel Michael', 'last_name': 'Muhlheim', 'fullName': 'Muhlheim, Daniel Michael', 'id': '3513651', 'affiliation': 'Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster (DE)', 'emailHash': 'a559500e706ba5579c2379e7229e82bc', 'db_id': 3513651, 'person_id': 3638921}"

Poster Session,poster,Corona effect in AA collisions at LHC and RHIC,"Pantuev, Vladislav","INR, RAS",Unknown,"Following our earlier finding based on RHIC data about the dominant jet production from nucleus corona region, we reconsider this effect in nucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energy. Our hypothesis was based on the experimental data, which raised  the idea of a finite formation time for the produced medium.  At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time reaches about 2~fm/c. In the center of interaction region it's about 0.7 fm/c. All observed high $p_t$ particles are produced in the corona region and have a chance to escape during this 2~fm/c. After that, the formed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ should be independent on particle momentum and be flat versus $p_t$. At the same time, we can describe at RHIC the finite azimuthal anisotropy of high $p_t$ particles, $v_2$. A separate prediction held that,  at LHC energy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller, about 1~fm/c.  New data at LHC show that $R_{AA}$ is not flat and is rising with $p_t$. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton  traversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift of about 7~GeV from the original power law $p^{-6}$ production cross section in $pp$  explains well all the observed  $R_{AA}$ dependencies at all centrality. The shift of about 7~GeV is also valid at RHIC energy, where  the cross section follows a power law with about $p^{-8}$  and this shift explains a very slow rise of $R_{AA}$ seen for neutral pions with $p_t$ above  15~GeV/c. We also show that the observed at LHC dependence  of $v_2$ at high $p_t$ and our previous predictions agree. It is very attractive to call this value of 7 GeV as a parton binding energy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vladislav', 'last_name': 'Pantuev', 'fullName': 'Pantuev, Vladislav', 'id': '3513640', 'affiliation': 'INR, RAS', 'emailHash': '5e1827442814e233bbbc6a8eaa4058ba', 'db_id': 3513640, 'person_id': 3643982}"

A quadruple GEM detector specially designed for low ion back flow will be used for the readout of the upgraded TPC in ALICE experiment. We present the study of a triple and a quadruple GEM detector and compare their performances in order to understand the usefulness of increasing the number of GEM foils and obtain better operating parameters to suit the requirements of HEP experiments.

The detectors have been assembled in standalone configuration and tested  with $^{55}$Fe X-ray and $^{106}$Ru-Rh $\beta$-source using Ar/CO$_2$ gas mixtures with 90:10 and 70:30 proportions. Effective gain and energy resolution have been measured using $^{55}$Fe source. The efficiency is measured using the $^{106}$Ru-Rh $\beta$-source and a coincidence setup consisting of three scintillators. In addition, the uniformity of the gain and energy resolution of the GEM detectors have been investigated by dividing the active area in 7$\times$7 zones.

It was found that quadruple GEM detector operates at less voltage across individual GEM foil ($\Delta$V$_{GEM}$) compared to the triple GEM detector. It is also found that the energy resolution of the detector deteriorates in case of quadruple GEM detector. Time resolution of the detectors is also measured and the obtained value is $\sim$10 – 13 ns at the operating voltage.

Poster Session,poster,Electron identification and trigger performance of the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector in p–Pb collisions,"Pachmayer, Yvonne Chiara",Ruprecht Karls Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),Germany,"The Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) of the ALICE detector at the LHC provides electron identification and an online trigger on high-$p_{\rm T}$ tracks of electron candidates, to significantly enrich samples of electrons originating from open heavy-flavour and heavy quarkonia decays.
The TRD consists of 522 chambers arranged in 6 layers. Each chamber comprises a radiator and a MWPC with pad read-out. When electrons with $p$ > 1 GeV/$c$ travel through the radiator, crossing many boundaries between media with different dielectric constants, TR photons with energies in the X-ray range may be created. These photons are detected using the MWPC filled with Xe/CO$_{2}$, where they deposit their energy on top of the ionisation signals from the particle track. The ALICE TRD is uniquely designed to record the time evolution of the signal. This functionality allows electrons and pions to be better discriminated compared to a 1d-likelihood on the total integrated charge measured in a chamber, because of the preferential TR absorption at the entrance of the MWPC (corresponding to large times).
In addition, chamber-wise track segments from fast on-detector reconstruction are read out with position, angle and PID information. In the Global Tracking Unit these track segments are matched and used for the reconstruction of transverse momenta and electron identification of individual tracks. These tracks form the basis for versatile and flexible trigger conditions, such as electrons with high $p_{\rm T}$.
We present the electron identification and trigger performance in p–Pb collisions recorded during the LHC Run 2.

Comparisons of the obtained thermal rates in infinite matter calculations to theoretical predictions and to the ones used in hydrodynamic calculations are shown.

In the intermediate-mass region ($1.2 < m_{\textrm{ee}} < 2.9 \textrm{ GeV/c}^{2}$), the dielectron continuum gives further insight into the heavy-quark energy loss in the QGP via the measurement of correlated electron-positron pairs from charm- and beauty- hadron decays. Finally, contributions of thermal radiation from the medium, both during the partonic and the hadronic phases, are predicted in a broad mass range and provide information on the temperature of the system.

In this poster, the status of the dielectron measurements in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\textrm{NN}}} = 5.02 \textrm{ TeV}$ with ALICE will be presented. In order to interpret the data, the findings will be compared to the expected yield of known hadronic sources, i.e. the hadronic cocktail, as a function of the invariant mass and pair transverse momentum. Finally, the status of the measurement of virtual direct photons and modifications of the dielectron yield in Pb-Pb collisions will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Carsten', 'last_name': 'Klein', 'fullName': 'Klein, Carsten', 'id': '3513530', 'affiliation': 'Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Poster Session,poster,Prompt photon production in $p$+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector,"Hill, Kurt Keys",University of Colorado Boulder (US),USA,"Electroweak bosons produced in heavy ion collisions are excellent tools to probe a variety of initial state effects on hard processes involving nuclei. They are expected to be unmodified by final state hot nuclear matter effects while being sensitive to the initial state nuclear modification of the partonic momentum structure and the energy loss of the incoming partons participating in a hard scattering. Thus, these probes are important for serving as a standard candle against which to compare the production of strongly interacting particles, such as hadron and jet production, which are sensitive to both the initial and final state. This poster presents a new measurement of prompt photon production in the recently collected high-statistics 8.16 TeV $p$+Pb collision data. Photon yields are reported over a broad kinematic range, $25 < p_\mathrm{T}^{\gamma} < 500$ GeV and $\left|\eta^\mathrm{lab}\right|<2.37$, and the production rates are compared to an extrapolated $pp$ reference based on existing $\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collision data.

A measurement of the thermal radiation from the QGP in the dielectron intermediate-mass region gives information on the medium temperature. In this region the main component of the dielectron continuum is coming from correlated semi-leptonic decays of charm and beauty hadrons, which may be affected by the  energy loss and collectivity of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the primordial heavy-flavour production in vacuum and find a way to separate this contribution from the thermal signal of the QGP.

The problem may be solved by assuming that the matter at LHC energies is produced out of chemical equilibrium. The chemical non-equilibrium model predicts that the pion abundances are characterized by the non-zero value of the chemical potential which is very close to the critical value for the Bose-Einstein condensation. The crucial point is the measurement of pions at very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ (< 200 MeV/$\textit{c}$), as the onset of pion condensation would manifest itself as an excess in the low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ pion yield while the spectra of kaons and protons remain unaltered.
In October 2017, the ALICE Collaboration at the CERN Large Hadron Collider collected for the first time data in Xe-Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.44 TeV with low magnetic field (B = 0.2 T). Thanks to this, the pion spectra can be measured down to 100 MeV/$\textit{c}$ and below with the Inner Tracking System (ITS), allowing the search for pion condensation effects.
The search for an enhancement of pions at very low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ is carried out also in very high multiplicity pp events.

Poster Session,poster,Anisotropic flow measured in Pb-Pb collisions with the NA49 experiment at the CERN SPS,"Golosov, Oleg",National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (RU),UK,"Anisotropic flow at SPS energies was measured by the NA49 Collaboration more than 10 years ago. Recently new data for Pb-Pb collisions were collected by the NA61/SHINE experiment during the Pb-ion beam energy scan program at the SPS. This motivated a new analysis of the available NA49 data, based on modern flow measurement techniques that will also utilize the spectator  fragments  for  reaction  plane  determination.

The new results on directed and elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at beam energy of 40 A GeV recorded with the fixed target experiment NA49 at CERN SPS are presented. Event classification is based on the multiplicity of produced particles as well as on the energy of the projectile spectators using the procedure implemented within the Centrality Framework developed for the future CBM experiment at FAIR. To account for the azimuthal asymmetry of the fixed target setup of the NA49 experiment, a three-subevent technique is used for the determination of the reaction plane resolution. The reaction plane is estimated both from the azimuthal asymmetry of the produced particles measured with the NA49 TPCs as well as by using the transverse granularity of the NA49 forward VETO calorimeter. Corrections for the detector acceptance anisotropy in the transverse plane are applied using an extension of the Qn-Corrections  Framework  developed  originally  for  the  ALICE  experiment  at  the  LHC.

The results are compared with those previously obtained by the experiments STAR at RHIC and NA49 at the SPS. The new study is complementary to the ongoing analysis of the recently collected Pb-Pb data of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS and provide an important  reference  for  the  performance investigations  for  the  future  CBM  experiment  at  FAIR.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Oleg', 'last_name': 'Golosov', 'fullName': 'Golosov, Oleg', 'id': '3513422', 'affiliation': 'National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (RU)', 'emailHash': 'fc95a5223071b1af49b8c4397bd2d6d7', 'db_id': 3513422, 'person_id': 3643599}"

For those reasons this topic is gaining increasing interest in recent years. The study of spin alignment (quantified by $\rho_{00}$) of vector mesons involves the reconstruction of the direction of global angular momentum (L), which is the normal to the reaction plane (RP). In experiments the RP is estimated with correlations among particles and has finite resolution. In this poster, we demonstrate a procedure to correct $\rho_{00}$ for the finite RP resolution. In addition, since the 1st- and 2nd-order RP are usually not the same and they have different sensitivity to L, we derive a relationship to explain the $\rho_{00}$ obtained between the two RP. Furthermore, a deviation of $\rho_{00}$ from 1/3 can be caused by finite acceptance in pseudo rapidity (e.g., the case for STAR and ALICE). We demonstrate that this effect can be corrected elegantly in a data-driven approach. At last, because vector mesons can have an apparent spin alignment in the helicity frame (local $\rho_{00}$), this will cause an artificial azimuthal angle dependence when study the global $\rho_{00}$ as a function of emission angle with respect to the RP. We lay down a procedure to correct for this effect as well as a procedure to correct for the effect of smearing $\rho_{00}$ in azimuth bins.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Aihong', 'last_name': 'Tang', 'fullName': 'Tang, Aihong', 'id': '3513393', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Lab', 'emailHash': '96234423491c977102f92c87b72a7f0d', 'db_id': 3513393, 'person_id': 3642652}"
Poster Session,poster,Probing beauty and charm production in p-Pb collisions with high pT electrons measured with ALICE,"Kawana, Daichi",University of Tsukuba (JP),UK,"Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculation predicts that a colour-deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) is formed at high temperature and high energy density reached in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are mostly produced by initial hard scatterings before the formation of the QGP. Therefore heavy-flavour hadrons are ideal probes to investigate the properties of the hot and dense QCD matter. In Pb-Pb collisions, a strong suppression of the production of heavy-flavour hadrons with high transverse momentum has been observed.
　A deeper understanding of heavy-flavour production in nucleus-nucleus collisions requires detailed studies of Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects in order to clarify the role of initial- and final-state effects on their production. CNM effects include shadowing and/or saturation of partons, energy loss in CNM and $k_{\rm{T}}$-broadening. Such effects on heavy quark production can be studied in proton-nucleus collisions by measuring electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays.
　The nuclear modification factor of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays was measured up to $p_{\rm{T}}$ = 20 GeV/$c$ in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 eV. The result suggests that heavy-flavour production in p-Pb collisions scales with the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. High $p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons are particularly interesting because they mainly originate from beauty hadron decays.

Results on transverse momentum spectra, yields and their ratios to long-lived particles will be presented and discussed as a function of energy and event multiplicity, as well as in comparison to model predictions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arvind', 'last_name': 'Khuntia', 'fullName': 'Khuntia, Arvind', 'id': '3528408', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': 'c335c291a78ee7431900f0a84a17ffaf', 'db_id': 3528408, 'person_id': 3643424}"
Poster Session,poster,Nuclear modification factor in the monte-carlo model with burning-out partons,"Altsybeev, Igor",St Petersburg State University (RU),Russia,"The so-called wounded-quark model (WQM) of particle production in heavy-ion collisions extends the monte-carlo Glauber approach to sub-nucleonic degrees of freedom. In the current work, a monte-carlo model, which is conceptually similar to the WQM, is presented. The main difference from the WQM is that each parton from the projectile nucleus can interact with only one parton inside the target (burning-out partons). As a result of each binary partonic interaction, a particle-emitting source is formed (usually modeled as a quark-gluon string), and this pair of partons does not participate in other partonic collisions anymore. It is shown that in this model it is possible to reproduce in a natural way the behaviour of some basic observables like the centrality dependence of charged particle multiplicity and nuclear modification factor, as well as several kinds of fluctuation observables in A-A and p-A collisions. Bayesian approach is used to estimate main parameters of the model, namely, number and distribution of partons inside nucleons and partonic cross sections.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Igor', 'last_name': 'Altsybeev', 'fullName': 'Altsybeev, Igor', 'id': '3513620', 'affiliation': 'St Petersburg State University (RU)', 'emailHash': 'd3dd359a41c8793dcc267fd627b872b2', 'db_id': 3513620, 'person_id': 3647443}"
Poster Session,poster,Measurement of D meson azimuthal correlations with charged particles in p-Pb collisions at √ s = 5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Kumar, Shyam",IIT- Indian Institute of Technology (IN),Unknown,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are produced via hard parton scatterings in the initial stage of the collision. Thus, they are ideal probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. Two-particle angular correlation studies in heavy-ion collisions have provided deep insight into the the in-medium partonic energy loss and its dependence on the parton path length in the medium. The extension of these studies to the heavy-flavour sector could shed light on the interaction of the heavy quarks with the medium.

 Heavy-flavour correlation measurements in p-Pb collisions are necessary to disentangle final-state QGP-induced modifications from effects caused by cold nuclear matter. In p-Pb collisions, double-ridge long-range correlations have been observed for light particles. They could originate from a collective behaviour of the system, as well as from gluon saturation in the initial state, as addressed by the Color Glass Condensate theory. This feature can also be searched for heavy quarks. Angular correlation of D mesons with charged particles are also useful to probe the properties of charm jets and charm-production processes. 


In this contribution, we will present ALICE results on D-meson azimuthal correlations with charged particles in p-Pb collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV collected during run 2 at the LHC. The measurement extends the $ p_{\rm T}$ coverage of the previous result obtained with run-1 data and improves significantly its precision.

Poster Session,poster,Intermittency analysis of proton density as a probe for the critical point of strongly interacting matter in NA61/SHINE,"Turko, Ludwik",University of Wroclaw (PL),Poland,"The search for experimental signatures of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter is one of the main objectives of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS. In the course of the experiment, an energy (beam momentum 13A – 150/158A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La) scan is performed. Proposed observables include non-monotonic fluctuations of integrated quantities, as well as local critical fluctuations connected to the critical behavior of the order parameter in the CP neighborhood, which scale according to universal power-laws.

Proton density fluctuations are investigated as a possible order parameter of the phase transition in the neighborhood of the CP by performing an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments (SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. A previous analysis of this kind [1] revealed significant power-law fluctuations in the NA49 heavy-ion collision experiment for the Si+Si system at 158A GeV/c. The fitted power-law exponent was consistent with the theoretically expected critical value within uncertainties, a result suggesting a baryochemical potential for the critical point in the vicinity of ~250 MeV.

The intermittency analysis is extended to systems of intermediate size as studied by NA61/SHINE, the primary candidates being the Be+Be and Ar+Sc systems at 150A GeV/c. Statistical techniques are developed for the calculation of scaled factorial moments which allow to subtract non-critical background and enhance the signal in case of low statistics. The analysis is supplemented by both critical and non-critical Monte Carlo simulations, by which one can estimate non-critical background effects on the quality and magnitude of uncertainties of the intermittency power-law fit, as well as explore the possibility of non-critical effects producing an intermittency signal.

In order to obtain sufficient statistics, the experiment will operate at high interaction rates of up to 10 MHz. Moreover, most of the trigger signatures are complex and require information from several detector subsystems. Thus, CBM needs a novel data read-out and analysis concept based on free streaming front-end electronics. The CBM experiment will collect time-stamped data into a readout buffer in a form of a time-slice and deliver it to a large computer farm. In order to effectively reduce the number of events to be recorded, a First Level Event Selection (FLES) has to identify a clean event sample containing the desired physical observable. 

Grouping measurements into physical collisions in this case must be performed in software and requires reconstruction not only in space, but also in time, the so-called 4-dimensional reconstruction. The FLES reconstruction package consists of several modules: track finding, track fitting, event building, short-lived particles finding, and event selection, which allow reconstructing time-slices in parallel (between processor cores). The tracks, reconstructed with the 4D Cellular Automaton track finder, are combined into event-corresponding clusters according to the estimated production time, obtained with the 4D Kalman Filter method. The reconstructed events are given as an input to the KF Particle Finder package for short-lived particle reconstruction.

Poster Session,poster,Performance of the new DiRICH based readout chain for MAPMTs in test beam data,"Patel, Vivek",Unknown,Unknown,"Modern RICH detectors often employ Multianode Photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs), providing excellent timing properties, good quantum efficiency, fine granularity and low dark noise. The CBM RICH detector, as well as the upgraded HADES RICH detector, will both use, actually even share, Hamamatsu H12700 MAPMTs for spacially resolved Cherenkov photon detection. A new FPGA-TDC based electronic readout chain has been developed for the readout of MAPMTs or MCPs with the 32ch DIRICH readout module as its core component. The signal discrimination, time- and time-over-threshold measurement, as well as digital data handling, are all implemented on a central Lattice ECP5 FPGA, providing a very cost-efficient and powerful solution. Another important aspect is the very low power consumption (12 mW/amplifier, 50 mW per channel, including discrimination, TDC, and data handling). 
The new readout chain has been tested at the COSY accelerator, Forschungszentrum Jülich, for the first time under realistic beam conditions, using a small Cherenkov prototype detector. Cherenkov photons were produced by the 600 MeV proton beam passing a solid Cherenkov radiator made of 3 mm quartz. The photons were registered by 12 MAPMTs read out using 24 DIRICH modules, with a total of 768 individual channels. In addition to the readout electronic test, a wavelength shifter (WLS) coating on the MAPMTs was tested.

The poster will present first performance results from the analysis of the COSY beamtime data, focusing in particular on efficiency and timing precision, and the potential suppression of crosstalk and noise by making use of  the precise Time-over-Threshold information. In addition, the effect of the WLS coating on efficiency and timing properties is investigated.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Vivek', 'last_name': 'Patel', 'fullName': 'Patel, Vivek', 'id': '3513587', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '5d62268b0c551a4878d9c993ee91a6a8', 'db_id': 3513587, 'person_id': 3647488}"
Poster Session,poster,"Using machine learning for data quality assurance, particle identification, and fast simulations in ALICE","Graczykowski, Lukasz Kamil",Warsaw University of Technology (PL),Poland,"Machine learning (ML) is one of the most rapidly evolving fields of computer science. High-energy physics (HEP) with its complex detectors is an ideal place to utilize ML in its full extent. The ALICE experiment is a perfect environment to test the ML capabilities, which can  automatize quality assurance (QA), particle identification, as well as perform fast simulations.
 
QA in ALICE is an important task in order to avoid processing low quality or redundant data, and to classify it for analysis. Currently, human experts are involved in an offline data assessment. This process is time-consuming and it typically takes days, or weeks to assess the quality of the past data taking periods. Furthermore, since after the LHC Long Shutdown 2 upgrades ALICE plans to record data at higher rates, manual data quality checks may not be feasible. We show first attempts of using ML for this purpose.
 
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are important ingredients of HEP experiments. They are needed not only to compare experimental data with theory but also to calibrate the detector as well as the reconstruction and analysis software. One of the biggest tasks is propagating each generated particle through the detector medium in order to obtain the correct detector responses. This usually involves the use of Geant or other transport packages which is very time consuming. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) can be utilized to provide reconstructed clusters basing on input MC particles with much higher computational speed. We show results of the  preliminary approach of using GANs for this purpose in ALICE.
 
ML can also be used for particle identification. In traditional analysis physicists usually select particles by applying an arbitrary specific selection criteria on certain detector signals, such as the TPC energy loss or TOF arrival time. We show the results of applying ML methods to select particles of interest with maximized efficiency.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lukasz Kamil', 'last_name': 'Graczykowski', 'fullName': 'Graczykowski, Lukasz Kamil', 'id': '3513563', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology (PL)', 'emailHash': 'f8980dc49484eb5ffee6c1e3850373b3', 'db_id': 3513563, 'person_id': 3644806}"

In nucleus-nucleus collisions at these beam energies strongly interacting matter with densities up to 10 times normal nuclear matter is expected to be produced. The key objective of CBM is to investigate the QCD phase diagram in the region of high baryon-densities, where a first order phase transition from hadronic to partonic matter as well as a chiral phase transition is expected to occur, representing a substantial discovery potential at FAIR energies. As a fixed-target experiment CBM is consequently designed to cope with very high interaction rates up to 10 MHz. This will allow to perform high precision measurements of extremely rare probes which have not been accessible by previous nucleus-nucleus experiments in this energy regime. To achieve the high rate capability CBM will be equipped with fast and radiation hard detectors employing free-streaming readout electronics. A prototype high performance Data Aquisition (DAQ) system is currently being built for mini-CBM (mCBM). The mCBM setup is scaled down from the full CBM experiment. Already by summer 2018, it will serve as development platform for a high rate system test of the detector systems, the free-streaming readout chain, the online time-slice building and online event selection in the First Level Event Selector (FLES).

The data used is collected by the ALICE detectors using a trigger based on calorimeter information. Trigger performance using EMCal and DCal will be discussed. A selection based on shower shape and isolation methods is used to identify π0 and direct photon triggers, with the latter ones originating from hard parton scatterings in the nucleus-nucleus. In leading order these are annihilation from Comp- ton scattering and Annihilation in the hard processes happened in the nucleus-nucleus collisions.

In heavy-ion collisions, the very low dielectron mass region ($m_{\rm ee} < 0.3 GeV/c^2$) provides information on the temperature of the system via the measurement of thermal radiation in the form of quasi-real virtual photons.Recently, one has observed collective phenomena in high-multiplicity pp collisions that are similar to the ones observed in heavy-ion collisions.

Examples include the collective behaviour of the QGP medium, jets, quantum statistics or Coulomb effects, conservation laws, and resonance decays.

In this contribution, we report measurements of the correlations of identified particles and their antiparticles ($\pi$, K, p, $\Lambda$) in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV  for momenta up to 2.5 GeV/$c$. The analysis reveals significant differences in particle production between mesons and baryons. The correlation functions for mesons exhibit the expected peak dominated by effects of mini-jet fragmentation and are well reproduced by general purpose Monte Carlo generators. This is not the case for baryon pairs; results for baryons present a challenge to the contemporary models (PYTHIA, PHOJET) with  simulations showing significant differences in respect to experimental data. Moreover, when both particles have the same baryon number (pp, $\bar{p}\bar{p}$, p$\Lambda$, $\bar{p}\bar{\Lambda}$, $\Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$) a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak.

Poster Session,poster,Pathlength dependence of particle-yield modification on the near-side with ALICE at the LHC,"Kim, Hyeonjoong",Yonsei University (KR),KR,"Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC produce a hot and dense medium, which is a deconfined state of quarks and gluons. Jets are produced from hard processes in the initial stages of the collision and interact with the medium while propagating through it. Angular correlation analyses of hadron pairs are a convenient method to observe jets and their interaction with the medium without fully reconstructing the jets.
Comparing the jet peak yield in pp collisions and Pb-Pb collisions gives information about the hard parton's energy loss mechanism through the medium. The jet energy loss while propagating through the medium can be quantified in azimuthal di-hadron correlations with the observable $I_{AA}$, the ratio between the jet peak yield in Pb-Pb collisions to pp collisions. Furthermore, the in-medium jet modification can be more precisely measured by comparing jets which traverse different pathlengths through the medium. The pathlength dependence of the jet modification can be observed with $I_{AA}$ as a function of the relative angle between the trigger particle and the event plane.
In this presentation, $I_{AA}$ as a function of centrality, relative angle to the event plane, and the transverse momentum of the associated particles for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV will be shown.

Poster Session,poster,Impact of magnetic field fluctuations on the CME in small systems,"Zhao, Xinli","Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Scien",Unknown,"Many great efforts have been made to investigate the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME), which replies on the existence of extremely large electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the recent CMS measurements in small systems challenge the traditional CME interpretation, indicating that the dominant contribution to the CME observable of charge azimuthal correlation ($\gamma=<cos(\phi_{\alpha}+\phi_{\beta} - 2\Psi_{RP})>$) may not be related to the CME in p+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions.

  In this work, we investigate the properties of the electromagnetic fields in small systems by using a multiphase transport (AMPT) model [1]. We find that compared to A+A collisions, the magnitudes of absolute electric and magnetic fields in small systems are comparable. We show that **the correlation of $<cos2(\Psi_B - \Psi_{2})>$ between the magnetic field direction and the particant plane angle is strongly suppressed in high-multiplicity events, but strongly correlated in parallel in low-multiplicity events**. It indicates that the traditional CME observable $\gamma$ is not valid to study the CME in high-multiplicity events. However, the strong correlation in low-multiplicity events can reduce or even change sign of the traditional CME observable, which is qualitatively consistent with the recent event-shape engineering measurement from the CMS [2]. Therefore, we suggest searching for a possible CME signal in small systems with low multiplicities.

Poster Session,poster,A new correlator for the detection and characterization of the Chiral Magnetic Effect,"Shi, Shuzhe",Indiana University,USA,"A charge-sensitive in-event correlator ($R(\Delta S)$) is proposed and tested for its efficacy to detect and characterize charge separation associated with the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions~[1]. For CME-driven charge separation, the correlator gives a concave response relative to the second-order event plane ($\Psi_2$), and a null response relative to the third-order plane ($\Psi_3$), consistent with the correlation (de-correlation) of the $\vec{B}$-field with the $\Psi_2$ ($\Psi_3$) plane. For non-CME background, the correlator gives responses, relative to $\Psi_2$ and $\Psi_3$, which allows a distinction between CME-driven charge separation and non-CME backgrounds. We discuss the $R(\Delta S)$ correlator and present results for its detailed response and sensitivity, to both signal and background, in several reaction models. They include (but are not limited to) a 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamic model [2], the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) model [3] and the Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) [4].

Poster Session,poster,Response studies of the CME-sensitive sine observable to heavy ion backgrounds,"Feng, Yicheng",Purdue University,USA,"A new sine observable, $R(\Delta s)$, has been proposed [1] to measure the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in heavy ion collisions, where $\Delta s$ is  the $\langle\sin\phi\rangle$ difference between positive and negative charges ($\phi$ is the particle azimuth) and $R(\Delta s)$ is the ratio of the out-of-plane to in-plane $\Delta s$ distributions. Studies with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) and Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) models show concave R($\Delta s$) distributions for CME signals and convex ones for typical resonance backgrounds [1]. A recent hydrodynamic study, however, indicates concave shapes for backgrounds as well [2]. Preliminary STAR data, on the other hand, reveal concave $R(\Delta s)$ distributions in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions.

To better understand these results, we present a systematic study of the $v_{2}$ and $p_{T}$ dependences of resonance backgrounds by toy-model simulations, based on the toy model used in our previous study [3]. The resonance $v_{2}$ introduces different numbers of decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pairs in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The resonance $p_{T}$ affects the opening angle of the decay $\pi^+\pi^-$ pair. Low $p_{T}$ resonances decay into large opening-angle pairs, and result in more ``back-to-back'' pairs out-of-plane because of the more in-plane resonances, mimicking a CME charge separation signal perpendicular to the reaction plane, or a concave $R(\Delta s)$. High $p_{T}$ resonances, on the other hand, decay into small opening-angle pairs, and result in a background behavior of convex $R(\Delta s)$. With this toy-model insight, we further investigate the responses of the $R(\Delta s)$ observable to AMPT backgrounds and AVFD CME signals,and the possible implications of the preliminary STAR data.

We compare the commonly used equation of state S95n-v1, which was constructed using what are now considered outdated lattice results and hadron states, to the current state-of-the-art lattice QCD equations of state with 2+1 and 2+1+1 flavors coupled to the most up-to-date hadronic resonances and their decays. New hadronic resonances lead to an enhancement in the hadronic spectra at intermediate $p_T$. Using an outdated equation of state can directly affect the extraction of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, of the quark-gluon plasma and results for different flow observables. The effects of the QCD equation of state on multiparticle correlations of identified particles are determined for both AuAu $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and PbPb $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions. New insights into the $v_2\{2\}$ to $v_3\{2\}$ puzzle in ultracentral collisions are found. Flow observables of heavier particles exhibit more non-linear behavior regardless of the assumptions about the equation of state, which may provide a new way to constrain the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$.

Poster Session,poster,Towards first-principle hydrodynamics for heavy-ion collision phenomenology,"Dubla, Andrea",GSI,Germany,"Heavy-ion collisions are well described by a dynamical evolution with a long hydro-dynamical phase. In this phase the properties of the strongly correlated quark-gluon plasma are reflected in the equation of state (EoS) and the transport coefficients, most prominently by the shear and bulk viscosities over entropy density ratio $\eta$/s(T) and $\zeta$/s(T), respectively. 
While the EoS is by now known to a high accuracy, the transport coefficients and in particular their temperature and density dependence are not known from first-principle computations yet. To remedy this situation we deploy a complementary QCD based approaches to compute $\eta$/s(T) using functional renormalization group to compute gluon real-time spectral functions [1]. In addition we will show the work and progresses of a novel lattice simulation prescription in non-compact imaginary time [2,3], in which the conventional analytic continuation problem is significantly improved.   
In this work, these most recent QCD-based parameters are provided as input to the MUSIC framework [4]. The IP-Glasma model is used to describe the initial energy density distribution, and UrQMD the late hadronic phase. Simulations are performed for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, for different centrality intervals. The resulting kinematic distributions of the particles produced in the collisions are compared to data from the LHC, for several experimental observables. The high precision of the experimental results and the broad variety of observables considered allow to critically verify the quality of the description based on first-principle input to the hydro-dynamic evolution.

Poster Session,poster,Temperature dependence of $\eta/s$: Constraints from Xe+Xe collisions and uncertainties from the equation of state,"Auvinen, Jussi",Institute of Physics Belgrade,Unknown,"Recent advancements in multi-parameter model-to-data comparison have provided notable constraints on the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ in the matter produced in the Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Bayesian analysis with a flexible initial state parametrization [1,2] supports a linear temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ found in the earlier study using the EKRT pQCD + saturation + hydrodynamics model [3]. However, some open issues yet remain. The uncertainties regarding the value of $\eta/s$ increase quickly towards higher temperatures, and it remains unexplored how much the choice of the equation of state affects the final outcome of the global analysis.

The recently performed LHC Xe+Xe run at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.44$ TeV introduces a new nuclear mass number and a new maximum collision energy for the heavy ion collisions, and consequently adding Xe+Xe data to the analysis has potential to further constrain $\eta/s(T)$. We perform a global model-to-data comparison on Au+Au, Pb+Pb, and Xe+Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, $2.76$ TeV, $5.02$ TeV and $5.44$ TeV, respectively, using a hydrodynamics model with the EKRT initial state, and the same parametric form for $\eta/s(T)$ as in Ref. [3]. Furthermore, to quantify the amount of uncertainty incorporated in the choice of EoS, we compare analysis results based on three different equations of state: the well known s95p parametrisation [4], an updated parametrisation based on the same list of particles, but recent lattice results [5] for the partonic EoS, and an updated parametrisation based on  the Particle Data Group 2016 particle list and the recent lattice results.

Poster Session,poster,Dynamical initialization with core-corona picture in small colliding systems,"Kanakubo, Yuuka",Sophia Univ.,Unknown,"We study effects of dynamical initialization with a core-corona picture in hydrodynamic description of small colliding systems at RHIC and the LHC energies. We previously proposed an idea of dynamically initializing hydrodynamic fields by utilizing source terms in hydrodynamic equations [1]: Instead of setting initial conditions at a fixed hydrodynamic initial time, we make initially produced partons propagate and deposit energy and momentum into the bulk matter via the source terms to form the quark gluon plasma (QGP) fluids gradually. Under this idea, not only initial fluctuations of geometry but also those of velocity fields are naturally generated. In the present study, we further introduce the core-corona picture to the idea by considering spatial density of the initially produced partons. Here, partons produced in the dilute region fragment into hadrons separately instead of taking part in the initial QGP fluid formation. This picture strongly affect the fluid profile in small colliding systems and must be taken into account. 

To demonstrate the above idea, we employ a QGP fluid + jet model [2] in which the QGP medium evolution is described by (3+1)-D hydrodynamic equations with source terms. As an input, we generate partons by using the latest version of PYTHIA 8.230 which involves heavy-ion collisions. As propagating after the production, these partons deposit energy and momentum into the bulk QGP fluid according to the parton density around them in the core-corona picture. From simulations with this newly developed framework, we calculate hadron spectra including contributions from both the surviving partons in the dilute regions with PYTHIA fragmentation and  the fluid part in the dense region and show that the core-corona picture plays a crucial role in small colliding systems.

In this work we study the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations when the chemical potentials conjugated to the conserved charges are turned on. We study the small frequency behavior of different response functions using stochastic fluid dynamics. We obtain a number of model independent results, including the long-time tail of different transport coefficients, and the leading non-analyticity of the correlators of energy, momentum and particle density for a system undergoing Bjorken flow. When applying our formalism to the lattice QCD equation of state at finite chemical potential we find lower bounds on the heat conductivity, shear and bulk viscosities.

Poster Session,poster,Investigating applicability of fluid dynamics in heavy ion collisions,"Niemi, Harri",J. W. Goethe Universität,Unknown,"We investigate the applicability of fluid dynamics (FD) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions by comparing its solutions to those of the relativistic Boltzmann equation (BE) [1]. The latter can be solved numerically [2] and its FD limit is well known [3]. We consider various (2+1)-dimensional boost-invariant scenarios, with realistic initial transverse profiles of energy and particle density. By varying the system size and the cross section we then identify regions where FD is a good approximation to the BE.

We observe that the space-time evolution of energy density and fluid velocity is well described by FD for all considered values of the cross section. However, the FD shear-stress tensor starts to deviate from its BE counterpart when the Knudsen number $\rm Kn$, defined as a mean free path times the local expansion rate, exceeds a value of one.

We furthermore study the elliptic flow generated for Glauber-type initial conditions. We consider various decoupling conditions in FD and identify the $\rm Kn$ regions where the elliptic flow is generated. Decoupling at a constant $\rm Kn \sim 2-3$ gives a good agreement with the solutions of the BE when the cross section is sufficiently large, i.e., when most of the elliptic flow is generated during the evolution where $\rm Kn < 1$. With decreasing cross section most of the flow signal is generated in regions where $\rm Kn > 1$. In this case, the FD elliptic flow starts to deviate from that generated by the BE.

The analysis is performed over a wide range in event multiplicity, especially reaching the multiplicity regime in which long-range collective correlations were observed. This extension to high multiplicity events represents an important investigation to probe the behavior of the femtoscopic radius and shed light on theoretical models. Three different experimental techniques are applied and discussed in the measurement of these quantum-statistical correlations. Each one of them adopts a different analysis approach, with variable degrees of dependence on Monte Carlo simulated events, which is employed for estimating and correcting the non-Bose-Einstein contributions (resonances and mini-jets). All of the three methods employed provide values for the resulting one-dimensional fit parameters (lengths of homogeneity and correlation intensity) that are consistent within the experimental uncertainties of the analysis.

Poster Session,poster,Harmonic flow with self-consistent bulk viscous corrections,"Molnar, Denes",Purdue University,USA,"One of the most spectacular observations in heavy ion physics has been that  thermalization may occur in small system collisions. For example, harmonic flow coefficients vn(pT) measured in high multiplicity p+A reactions are well reproduced by viscous hydrodynamics calculations. Small system collisions in fact serve as good tests of hydrodynamics because they should be more difficult to thermalize; in other words, shear stress and bulk pressure corrections are expected to be larger than in A+A collisions.

At freezeout, shear stress and bulk pressure manifest as nonthermal $\delta f$ corrections to the particle distributions. Hydrodynamic variables cannot fix the momentum dependence of the corrections, nor how these vary with hadron species. Therefore, to compute observables, hydro calculations rely on a model for $\delta f_i$. In practice, ad hoc postulated forms are used based on Grad's quadratic ansatz, completely disregarding the microscopic dynamics of the system. On the other hand, a self-consistent set of corrections can be obtained from kinetic theory, which depend on the scattering rates between the various species.

Self-consistent shear viscous corrections can generate a characteristic meson vs baryon difference in harmonic flow coefficients, much akin to quark number scaling. The difference arises because meson-meson cross sections tend to be smaller than meson-baryon cross sections (additive quark model). It is not yet known, however, how bulk viscosity and self-consistent bulk corrections affect harmonic flow. This is especially interesting in small systems because bulk pressure can be large. Extending the work of Molnar and Wolff (PRC95, 024903) we calculate self-consistent bulk viscous corrections in a multi-species hadron gas. Then, we use the self-consistent corrections to calculate harmonic flow observables in p+Pb collisions at the LHC, and show how bulk viscosity manifests in the momentum and species dependence of the harmonic flow coefficients.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Denes', 'last_name': 'Molnar', 'fullName': 'Molnar, Denes', 'id': '3530719', 'affiliation': 'Purdue University', 'emailHash': '2499fb643638c071cf30c16e8ec80df3', 'db_id': 3530719, 'person_id': 3647658}"

Our findings show a characteristic decrease of the overall polarization in the system with the increasing collision energy, as recently found in the experimental measurements of the Lambda hyperons. We also find that the polarization in our approach increases with time during the hydrodynamic evolution, an effect connected with the overall angular momentum and entropy conservation laws.

Poster Session,poster,Understanding $\gamma$-jet angular correlation and momentum imbalance with QCD resummations.,"Chen, Lin",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"$\gamma$-jet correlations and their momentum imbalance have been widely regarded as the ""Golden probe"". Based on our previous studies on dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlations in $p+p$ and $A+A$ collisions [1,2,3,4], we further employ the systematic Sudakov resummation formalism to study the angular correlation between direct photon and jets as well as their transverse momentum imbalance in both $pp$ and $PbPb$ collisions. 

Our results [5] for the $\gamma$-jet angular correlation agree nicely with the ATLAS and CMS data. Since the vacuum Sudakov effects are overwhelmingly larger than QGP medium effects,  we can naturally explain the negligible difference between $pp$ and $PbPb$ data. Furthermore, based on the resummation improved pQCD approach, our calculation for the distribution of $\gamma$-jet transverse momentum imbalance in $pp$ collisions can provide  important predictions for this observable, and can be compared with all LHC data once experimental data are unfolded. In addition, using the $pp$ collision as the baseline, we can also apply BDMPS and High-Twist energy loss formalism to $PbPb$ collisions, and thus extract the jet transport coefficient in the LHC regime.

Poster Session,poster,"Dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet correlations in resummation improved pQCD approach","Zhang, Hanzhong","IOPP, CCNU",Unknown,"Dijet, dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlations as well as dijet transverse momentum asymmetry have been reckoned as important probes of the transverse momentum broadening effects in relativistic nuclear collisions [1,2]. Dijets become de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening. 

We first employ the systematic Sudakov resummation formalism to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data in $pp$ and central $AA$ collisions [1]. For a quark jet at RHIC top energy, a global $\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data renders the best fit for the medium-induced broadening $\langle p_\perp^2\rangle$ and the so-called jet transport coefficient $\hat q$ in central $AA$ collisions.

Then we develop a systematic theoretical approach to dijet asymmetries in $pp$ collisions based on pQCD expansion and Sudakov resummation formalism [2]. We find that the NLO pQCD calculation is indispensable to describe experimental data, while the resummation formalism is vital near the end points where the pQCD expansion fails to converge due to appearance of large Sudakov logarithms. Utilizing our resummation-improved pQCD approach, we extract jet transport coefficient for quark-gluon plasma in $PbPb$ collisions at 2.76A~TeV. 

We can also use this method to study the properites of cold nuclear matter and other related topics [3].

Further experimental and theoretical efforts along the direction of this work shall significantly advance the quantitative understanding of transverse momentum broadening and help us acquire precise knowledge of jet quenching parameter in heavy-ion collisions.

ALICE studies low-mass dimuon production at the CERN LHC with the Muon Spectrometer covering the forward rapidity range $2.5 < y < 4$. Observations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 2.76$ and $5.02$ TeV allowed for the characterisation of $\phi$-meson production in the $p_{\rm T}$ range $2 < p_{\rm T} < 5$ GeV/$c$ and $2 < p_{\rm T} < 7$ GeV/$c$, respectively, giving insight on strangeness production at forward rapidity. $\phi$-meson production has also been studied in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$, $5.02$, $7$, $8$ and $13$ TeV, offering the unique possibility to test the energy dependence of the production cross section in the common $p_{\rm T}$ range $1.5 < p_{\rm T} < 5$ GeV/$c$.

Other descriptions, based on ordinary diffusion, are known to produce charge fluctuations which propagate with infinite velocity, thus violating a fundamental postulate of special relativity.  We present an alternative approach based on Cattaneo diffusion which restores relativistic causality, and show how to generalize this approach to dynamical, rapidly evolving systems such as heavy-ion collisions.  We demonstrate that this approach leads to measurable consequences for the balance functions constructed from electrically charged hadrons in a simple 1+1 dimensional Bjorken hydrodynamic model.  We find that limiting the speed of propagation of charge fluctuations increases the height and reduces the width of these balance functions when plotted versus separation in rapidity.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of Quantum Corrections on a Realistic Nuclear Matter EoS and on Compact Star Observables,"Barnafoldi, Gergely Gabor",Wigner RCP Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),HU,"The accuracy of astrophysical observations regarding compact stars are
ahead of a big evolution jump thanks to instruments like NICER [1],
which will increase the accuracy of the measurements. The discovery of
gravitational waves originating from merging neutron stars in this year
(GW170817 [2]) is the first step to use gravitational waves as a probe
for extremely dense nuclear matter.

Despite these developments the masquarade problem still persists in
modeling cold superdense nuclear matter based on compact star
observables. Since many different models yield similar neutron star
parameters only high-precision measurements and theoretical reasons can
exclude models.

In this talk we present a realistic, Walecka-type model where the
bosonic fluctuations are included using the Functional Renormalization
Group (FRG) method in the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), based on
a our technique published previously [3,4]. The thermodynamical
quantities, equation of state (EoS), compressibility are calculated in
different approximations: mean field, 1st order and high order. Based
on these EoS, the properties of the corresponding neutron stars are
also calculated using the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkov (TOV) equations.

It is also presented, how calculating quantum corrections in different
approximations change the predicted neutron star parameters like mass,
radius and compactness. These results show, that in the light of the
new developments in astrophysical observations quantum corrections are
approaching the threshold where calculating them will be necessary for
the correct comparison between different models.

The former will be installed during the Long Shutdown 2 (2019/2020), while the latter is proposed for Long Shutdown 3 (2024-2026).
 
The FIT detector provides a fast trigger, a precise collision time measurement for time-of-flight based particle identification, and will be the main ALICE luminometer. FIT will measure an unbiased multiplicity distribution in the forward direction needed for the determination of the centrality and of the event plane in heavy-ion collisions. FIT is composed of two Cherenkov detector arrays (T0+) with a time resolution in the 20-50 ps range and a large, sectored scintillator ring (V0+). The T0+ arrays surround the beam pipe on both sides of the IP at a distance of 82 cm on the side of the muon arm, and 330 cm on the opposite side. In total, FIT will produce 208 Cherenkov signals and 48 scintillator signals, respectively.
 
The main goal of the FoCal proposal is to measure forward ($3.5 < y < 5$) direct photons in pp, and p--Pb collisions to obtain unique experimental constraints on proton and nuclear PDFs in a new region of low $x$ ($10^{-5} - 10^{-6}$). In addition it provides measurements of neutral mesons, two particle correlations, and jets in p+p, p--Pb and (partially) in Pb--Pb. The direct photon measurement requires a new electromagnetic calorimeter with extremely high granularity. The design principle of the high-resolution SiW sandwich calorimeter will be presented and results from the ongoing R$\&$D program with test beams will be shown. The detector will be instrumented with Si-pad sensors with analog readout and a MAPS-based digital pixel readout. The test beam results include linearity and energy resolution measurement, but also three-dimensional shower distributions on the sub-millimeter scale and the corresponding excellent position resolution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ian Gardner', 'last_name': 'Bearden', 'fullName': 'Bearden, Ian Gardner', 'id': '3553810', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '73281c999b22d7ef2db9b9622dc842a9', 'db_id': 3553810, 'person_id': 3737701}"

However, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, such as the change in the parton distribution function between a free nucleon and a nucleus, also affect the charm quark production in nuclear collisions with respect to p+p collisions. These effects can be measured in small systems such as p+A and d+A collisions, where only the CNM effects are present. Furthermore, a sizable azimuthal anisotropy ($v_2$) has been observed in both nucleus-nucleus collisions and small-system collisions of high multiplicities. To better understand the origin of the flow-like signal in small-system collisions, it is important to study charm quark azimuthal anisotropy in these systems.

In this presentation, we will report on the first measurements of $\text{D}^{0}$ production in p+Au collisions, and the $\text{D}^{0}$ transverse momentum spectrum and $v_2$ with the Heavy Flavor Tracker in d+Au collisions, all at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=200$ GeV. The nuclear modification factors of $\text{D}^{0}$ meson will be extracted to quantify the CNM effects, and a comparison will be made to those of electrons from open heavy flavor hadron decays in p+Au collisions. Different cuts on the pseudo-rapidity gap between $\text{D}^{0}$ candidates and tracks used for event plane reconstruction, as well as different techniques, such as event plane and two-particle correlation methods, will be explored to help understand different physics mechanisms contributing to the azimuthal anisotropy.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Lukas', 'last_name': 'Kramarik', 'fullName': 'Kramarik, Lukas', 'id': '3582449', 'affiliation': 'Czech Technical University (CZ)', 'emailHash': '470c252ce4d3978c795e157efd341239', 'db_id': 3582449, 'person_id': 3765372}"

of the biggest theory challenges. So far, there are no first principle calculations for the equilibration
process of the quark gluon plasma and the dynamics close to the phase transition. In particular
describing the behavior close to the conjectured critical point, where critical slowing down leads
to off-equilibrium dynamics, poses difficulties.
Here we study the initial stages of a HIC using a low-energy effective theory of QCD, the
quark-meson model, in order to gain insight into the thermalization process. This model manifests
a central and physically relevant feature of QCD: chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum and its
restoration at finite temperature and density. At the critical endpoint this model is expected to
be in the same universality class as QCD and hence a viable model to explore dynamical critical
phenomena.
We solve the non-perturbative real-time quantum equations of motions for the quark and meson
fields in the two-particle irreducible effective action framework. Similar to a HIC, our system is
prepared in a high-energy initial state and suddenly quenched out of equilibrium, evolving towards
a thermal final state in the chirally broken phase.
In a first step, we investigate the time-evolution of both bulk and spectral properties of this
system, which provides us with insight into the approach of thermalization over time and the
properties of the relevant degrees of freedom dominating the real-time dynamics. For the thermal
final state, this implies information about the mass spectrum and the thermalization temperature.

As QGP has large gradients in both temperature and the fluid velocity, it is crucial to study energy loss without assuming a homogeneous plasma, especially as it is known that energy loss depends on the plasma evolution in a non-local way. In a holographic description, we consider several subsequent improvements of the hydrodynamic background by keeping increasing orders in the gradient expansion. Already for varying temperature and velocity profiles and ideal hydrodynamics, the energy loss is considerably modified. However, this description is limited to very small gradients and it is hence necessary to include viscous corrections. We present a numerical analysis of jet energy loss in a boost-invariant and transversely-expanding droplet of QGP. We find that depending on the direction of the fluid flow, the velocity gradients can change the distance a parton can travel by a factor of two, which would correspond to changing the coupling constant by a factor of more than fifty.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wilke', 'last_name': 'van der Schee', 'fullName': 'van der Schee, Wilke', 'id': '3530900', 'affiliation': 'MIT', 'emailHash': '66afd64e8cf68b02dbd409a401b873bf', 'db_id': 3530900, 'person_id': 3647316}"

The model is capable of describing the full $p_{T}$, rapidity, and centrality dependence of the measured jet $R_{AA}$ using three effective parameters. The analysis done using this simple model can explain the shape of the modification of fragmentation functions observed in the data as well as the relation between the magnitude of the jet $R_{AA}$ and the $R_{AA}$ of charged particles. The analysis of recent data on  splitting functions and fragmentation functions allows for further constrains on the role of coherence effects in the parton energy loss. Further, the analysis of charmonia suppression using this model points to a remarkable similarity between the quenching of light-quark-initiated jets and the prompt charmonia suppression.

Poster Session,poster,Resolution Effects in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model,"Hulcher, Zachary",Cambridge University,UK,"Within a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching, plasma produced in a heavy ion collision cannot resolve the substructure of a collimated parton shower propagating through it with arbitrarily fine spatial resolution. We introduce a screening length parameter, $L_{res}$, proportional to the inverse of the local temperature in the plasma, estimating a range for the value of the proportionality constant via comparing weakly coupled QCD calculations and holographic calculations appropriate in strongly coupled plasma. When a parton in a jet splits, its two offspring are initially unresolved and suffer the energy loss of the original parton until they are separated by $L_{res}$. This delays the quenching of partons with intermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final state with $p_T$ in the several GeV range. Introducing a nonzero $L_{res}$ results in modifications to the jet shapes and jet fragmentations functions, as it makes it more probable for particles carrying a small fraction of the jet energy at larger angles from the jet axis to survive their passage through the quark-gluon plasma. These effects are small in magnitude, which we confirm via checking for effects on missing-$p_T$ observables.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Hulcher', 'fullName': 'Hulcher, Zachary', 'id': '3530917', 'affiliation': 'Cambridge University', 'emailHash': '6d3d0d97012a346ef520bcbc24a9ce80', 'db_id': 3530917, 'person_id': 3640339}"

Recent advances in understanding mass effects on the QCD splitting functions enable us to apply this method for the first time to heavy flavor tagged jets, the main topic of this presentation. Theoretical predictions for the momentum sharing distribution modification of jets tagged by single and two in-jet heavy mesons will be presented. We find that in the kinematic region that will be accessed by sPHENIX in the future, or by studying jets of lower transverse momenta than currently explored at the LHC, there is a unique reversal of the mass hierarchy of jet quenching effects. Namely, the momentum sharing distribution of b-tagged jets is more strongly modified in comparison to the one for light jets. This unique feature provides a handle on mass corrections that are at present difficult to constraint using inclusive heavy meson production.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ivan', 'last_name': 'Vitev', 'fullName': 'Vitev, Ivan', 'id': '3650121', 'affiliation': 'Los Alamos National Laboratory', 'emailHash': None, 'db_id': 3650121, 'person_id': 3634913}"
Poster Session,poster,Heavy quark transport in a hybrid Boltzmann + Langevin approach,"Ke, Weiyao",Duke University,USA,"Heavy quarks produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions have proven to be sensitive to the properties of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which they propagate. Current measurements of open charm in heavy-ion collisions show unexpectedly large momentum anisotropies and small nuclear modification factors, posing a challenge for the theoretical understanding of the nature of coupling between heavy quark and the medium.

Linearized Boltzmann transport and Langevin diffusion are two popular kinetic models for heavy quark in-medium propagation. However, both of these approaches also suffer from shortcomings, i.e. Langevin diffusion is only fully applicable for heavy quarks experiencing small momenta transfer and vice versa a linearied Boltzmann transport approach with perturbative matrix elements works best in the high momentum transfer limit. In this work, we develop a hybrid heavy quark transport model that combines the strengths of each approach: heavy quarks are evolved with Langevin diffusion using an empirical diffusion constant, while rare but important scattering processes are described using linearized Boltzmann equations with perturbative matrix elements. This Langevin component is a complementary contribution to the Boltzmann component when perturbative calculation may be inadequate to describe all the interactions. Both elastic and inelastic scatterings are included in the Boltzmann component. The Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect is treated effectively via a gluon formation time and detailed balance is imposed between gluon emission and absorption. Finally, the QGP evolution is obtained by a state-of-the-art relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculation.

With this hybrid model, we study heavy flavor momentum anisotropies, nuclear modification factor, and correlation observables in A-A collisions at RHIC and  LHC energies. Comparing to available D and B meson data, we constrain the diffusion constant of the Langevin component.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Weiyao', 'last_name': 'Ke', 'fullName': 'Ke, Weiyao', 'id': '3531010', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '1240602cf275b01cbc3a4cc9b6afb783', 'db_id': 3531010, 'person_id': 3642824}"

A global analysis encompassing all available collision systems and energies as well as an improved treatment of known uncertainties for different observables would significantly improve our ability to distinguish between different theoretical models and constrain the heavy flavor diffusion coefficient in an unbiased way.


In this study, we show that describing the heavy quark energy loss with Langevin diffusion and a radiative energy loss component in a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic medium, including heavy meson hadronic interactions modeled with UrQMD allows for a simultaneous description of the $D$-meson $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ and $v_n$ at both RHIC (200 GeV) and the LHC (2.76 \& 5.02 TeV) energies. The heavy flavor interaction with the quark-gluon plasma is encoded in the diffusion coefficient, which is calibrated on experimental measurements using a systematic model-to-data Bayesian analysis. The estimated diffusion coefficient $D_sT$ has a positive temperature dependence and a non-trivial momentum dependence. The constrained diffusion coefficient is validated by comparing $D$-meson $R_{\mathrm{AA}}$ in pPb collisions along with $B$-meson measurements. New observables are proposed to further constrain the diffusion coefficient.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yingru', 'last_name': 'Xu', 'fullName': 'Xu, Yingru', 'id': '3531005', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '6c29d92a9d43b72e34863aa41983a2b9', 'db_id': 3531005, 'person_id': 3642825}"

The main goal of the experiment is the study of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. This goal is pursued by performing a two-dimensional scan by varying the beam momentum (13A-158A GeV/c) and the system size (p+p, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) of the collisions.

The properties of strangeness production show nontrivial dependence on the beam momentum. This dependence is interpreted as the onset of deconfinement. The prediction of theoretical models will be compared with the measured data.

A new effect, onset of fireball, is indicated by the unexpected similarity between p+p and Be+Be data. Collisions of the light systems can be treated as a superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. However, a rapid qualitative change of the value of various observables occurs when colliding heavier systems. This may indicate another threshold behaviour of strongly interacting matter.

The theoretical models SMES and PHSD describe the onset of deconfinement in the heaviest system relatively well. However, no model describes the behaviour of the data in previously unmeasured collisions of light and intermediate size ions. The onset of fireball is not described by models at all.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Emil Aleksander', 'last_name': 'Kaptur', 'fullName': 'Kaptur, Emil Aleksander', 'id': '3531040', 'affiliation': 'University of Silesia (PL)', 'emailHash': '1ff96d7b3aa3f1e527e492c7e14da0f2', 'db_id': 3531040, 'person_id': 3643551}"

The nature of the CP such as the soft modes is known to be affected by the value of $m_q$: We first determine the whole phase structure in the three-dimensional space $(T, μ, m_q)$ consisting of temperature $T$, quark chemical potential $\mu$ and $m_q$, with the tricritical point, $\mathrm{O}(4)$ and $\mathrm{Z}_2$ critical lines being located; they altogether make a winglike shape quite reminiscent of those known in the condensed matters with a tricritical point. We then calculate the spectral functions in the scalar and pseudoscalar channel around the critical points. We find that the sigma mesonic mode becomes tachyonic with a superluminal velocity at finite momenta before the system reaches the $\mathrm{Z}_2$ point from the lower density, even for $m_q$ smaller than the physical value. One of the possible implications of the appearance of such a tachyonic mode at finite momenta is that the assumed equilibrium state with a uniform chiral condensate is unstable toward a state with an inhomogeneous $\sigma$ condensate. No such anomalous behavior is found in the pseudoscalar channel. We find that the $\sigma$-to-$2\sigma$ coupling due to finite $m_q$ plays an essential role for the drastic modification of the spectral function.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takeru', 'last_name': 'Yokota', 'fullName': 'Yokota, Takeru', 'id': '3531051', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto University, Japan', 'emailHash': '64a935d432fea8c255beff9ea811ebec', 'db_id': 3531051, 'person_id': 3644431}"

Poster Session,poster,Constraining the QCD equation of state with identified particle spectra,"Monnai, Akihiko","Institut de Physique Théorique, CNRS/CEA",Unknown,"The equation of state is one of the fundamental properties of the QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. Lattice QCD simulations now provide a realistic equation of state at vanishing density, but it may differ from what we should see in the experiments because heavy-ion systems may be out of chemical equilibrium, in strong magnetic fields and affected by finite size effects. It is thus important to understand the imprints of the equation of state on the data.

We find that the mean transverse mass as a function of the multiplicity density reproduces, up to proportionality factors, the energy over entropy ratio as a function of the entropy density [1]. We perform viscous hydrodynamic simulations using a variety of equations of state and compare the results to the experimental data. The equations of state with the effective number of degrees of freedom equal to or larger than that of lattice QCD are favored.

A clear sign change is observed in excitation function of the proton v1 slope, which could be an indication of the softening of the equation of state (EoS) due to 1st order phase transition. The v1 slope for produced particles, such as charged pions and kaons are negative while the v1 slope of protons show positive values at low energies. This anti-correlation between proton and pion v1 slope has been previously studied at 1GeV beam energy [2]. 

In this talk, we will report the v1 of proton, and charged pions, kaons in Au+Au collisions at √sNN = 3-20 GeV from transport model (JAM). For the first time, we explicitly and quantitatively discuss the effects of spectator shadowing on the v1 at RHIC BES energy region. We observe that the negative v1 slope for both pions and kaons BES energies are caused by their scattering with the spectator nucleons (shadowing effects), which can explain the different behavior of the directed flow for proton and other produced particles. We also find that a softening of EoS will lead to a negative proton v1 slope within JAM hadronic transport model.

The light nuclei (e.g. deuteron) can only be formed within a restricted volume in phase space, therefore, they can probe local density fluctuation.
      
  I will demonstrate the usefulness and advantage of probing the QCD phase diagram with light nuclei in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Dielectron production in pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV measured in a dedicated low magnetic-field setting with ALICE,"Jung, Jerome",Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe Univ.

Since leptons do not interact strongly and are produced throughout the whole collision process, they carry information from all collision stages with negligible final-state interaction.

The ALICE detector is well-suited to perform this measurement due to its excellent tracking and particle identification capabilities at low momenta. However, Dalitz decays and photon conversions lead to a high combinatorial background with a signal-to-background ratio of 1:10 to 1:1000 in Pb-Pb collisions, depending on the invariant mass. Therefore, the minimization of the background is a key aspect of this analysis.
The reconstruction efficiency of low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons can be increased by reducing the magnetic field of the ALICE central barrel solenoid from 0.5 T to 0.2 T. This allows a better rejection of the electron background and simultaneously gives the opportunity to increase the accessible phase space of the dielectron measurement. Such a configuration is planned in ALICE for part of the Pb-Pb campaigns in LHC Run 3 and 4 from 2021 on.

This poster will present the status of the dielectron measurement in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV from pilot runs taken with B=0.2 T in the ALICE central barrel.

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of Lambda_cbar-/Lambda_c+ Ratio in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV with the STAR Experiment,"Simko, Miroslav",Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences (cz),UK,"The yield ratios of strange anti-baryons to baryons have been measured in heavy-ion collisions and exhibit a trend that is getting closer to unity with increasing number of valence strange quarks. This ratio has, however, never been measured for charm baryons, and it will be important to establish if they exhibit a similar amount of baryon-to-anti-baryon enhancement as strange baryons. $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ is the lightest baryon containing a charm quark and, as such, presents a unique probe to study the hadronization of charm quarks in the hot and dense QCD medium created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ has, however, an extremely short lifetime ($c \tau \sim 60\,\mu$m) which makes the reconstruction experimentally challenging. The Heavy Flavor Tracker, installed at the STAR experiment between the years 2014-2016, has shown a high efficiency and an unparalleled track-pointing resolution that facilitates the $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ reconstruction  in heavy-ion collisions. In this poster, we will present the reconstruction of $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ baryons via hadronic decays and the measurement of the yield ratio of $\overline{\Lambda_\mathrm{c}}^-/\Lambda_\mathrm{c}^+$, utilizing the high-statistics data samples of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200\,$GeV, recorded with the STAR experiment in 2014 and 2016.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Miroslav', 'last_name': 'Simko', 'fullName': 'Simko, Miroslav', 'id': '3580648', 'affiliation': 'Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences (cz)', 'emailHash': '4451083801f0c76a75d380a42e7c0ea1', 'db_id': 3580648, 'person_id': 3763612}"
Poster Session,poster,Strangeness Production in U+U Collisions at STAR,"Tripathy, Srikanta","Institute Of Physics, Bhubaneswar",Unknown,"Strange quark production in high-energy heavy-ion collisions is a good tool in studying the properties of the deconfined phase of quarks and gluons. It is suggested that the dominant process for the production of strange quarks in the quark gluon plasma is gluonic fusion. Chemical equilibration of strange quarks, formed in such a medium, happens faster than would be the situation in hadronic scenario [1]. At similar colliding energies, U+U collisions are expected to have larger energy density [2] and higher number of produced particles than in the case of Au+Au or Pb+Pb collisions. This makes U+U system to be a unique platform for testing various observables.

We will present transverse momentum spectra of $K_s^{0}$, $\Lambda$($\bar{\Lambda}$), $\Xi$($\bar{\Xi}$) and $\Omega$($\bar{\Omega}$) in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in the STAR experiment at RHIC. These strange particles are reconstructed from their weak decay topology via dominant hadronic decay modes using the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector of STAR. We will also show a comparison of the properties of these particles with PDG values and other measurements viz., particle ratios, nuclear medium effect etc. Physics implications of these results will be discussed along comparison with results from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

Poster Session,poster,Pion induced reaction with carbon and polyethylene targets obtained by HADES-GSI in 2014,"Rodríguez-Ramos, Pablo",Nuclear Physics Institute ASCR,UK,"In the summer of 2014, HADES conducted measurements with secondary pion-beam using different targets. The program is devoted to measure dielepton radiation from baryonic resonances. In particular we investigated a sub-threshold coupling of rho to baryonic resonances in the second resonance region, specially N(1520). Most of the beam time was dedicated to measurement of $e^{+}e^{-}$ production from PolyEthylene target at pion beam momentum of 690 $MeV/c$. Combining these data with carbon data it is possible to extract pion-proton interactions. Therefore it was possible to measure at the same time exclusive $\pi^{-}p \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ and inclusive $e^{+}e^{-}$ production. The normalization of spectra has been done using elastic scattering of pion on proton. The identification of $e^{+}e^{-}$ is was performed through appropriate cuts on time-of-flight, energy loss, shower signal and RICH (Ring Imaging Cherenkov) observables. Exclusive and inclusive invariant mass spectra is compared with the different channel contributions simulated with a dedicated  Monte Carlo simulation tool for hadronic physics (PLUTO). Using missing mass cuts it was possible to identified the events from the reaction  $\pi^{-}p \rightarrow n e^{+}e^{-}$ which shows that the $e^{+}e^{-}$ yield of invariant mass above 250 $MeV/c^{2}$ is consisted with $N(1520)\rightarrow n\rho\rightarrow ne^{+}e^{-}$.

The measurements are performed with a charge-sensitive correlator $R(\Delta S)$ [1] and the three-particle mixed harmonic correlator $\mathrm{C_{m,n,m+n} = \left< cos(m\phi_1 + n\phi_2 -(m+n)\phi_3)\right>}$ [2]. These are expected to give different responses to the CME-driven charge separation and non-CME background correlations. The $R(\Delta S)$ measurements are found to be flat relative to $\Psi_3$ in all systems and $\Psi_2$ in p(d)+Au systems, consistent with the expectation of random $\vec{B}$-field orientations relative to these event planes. In contrast, the heavy-ion measurements relative to $\Psi_2$ show concave-shaped $R(\Delta S)$ distributions, which is consistent with the presence of CME-driven charge separation characterized by an out-of-plane Fourier dipole coefficient $a_1$. We will present and discuss $R(\Delta S)$ and $\mathrm{C_{m,n,m+n}}$ measurements for a broad range of transverse momenta, pseudorapidity, and centrality intervals and compare it with model predictions [1]. The implication of these measurements for the upcoming isobar collisions at RHIC will also be discussed.

Additional benefits from the EPD include TPC-independent centrality determination and event planes at BES energies where the VPD and ZDC suffer from low occupancies. The EPD is a set of disks consisting of 1.2cm-thick scintillator tiles optically isolated with reflective epoxy and embedded with wavelength-shifting fibers held in place with optical epoxy which are coupled to Silicon photomultipliers via clear fiber optics. The detector was constructed in $2\pi/12$ azimuthal sections called supersectors, each of which were tested for tile quality with cosmic rays and tile crosstalk with a radioactive source.

However, recent measurements of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) for open charm mesons at RHIC show results comparable in magnitude to those of light hadrons, suggesting that charm quarks also interact strongly with the QGP medium. This could mean that the charm quark may not be heavy enough to clearly exhibit the mass dependence of parton energy loss in these measurements at RHIC. Thus it is of particular interest to study the bottom quark energy loss in the medium since bottom quarks are about three times heavier than charm quarks.

In this poster, we will present an analysis based on a data-driven method for determining the yields of electrons from charm and bottom hadron decays, respectively, in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV.

At the STAR experiment, utilizing high-precision secondary vertex reconstruction provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT), $D^{0}$ mesons have been comprehensively studied to investigate the charm quark transport in the QGP. Measurement of $D^{*\pm}$ production is complementary to the $D^{0}$ measurement in studying the medium modification to the open charm meson production. It also provides useful information on feed-down contributions to the $D^{0}$ yields.

Poster Session,poster,Extension of the Identity Method to Measurements of Differential Correlation functions,"Pruneau, Claude Andre",Wayne State University (US),United States,"Studies of integral and differential correlation functions of elementary particles produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions provide invaluable information on the particle production dynamics, the collision system evolution,  and might also enable the determination of fundamental properties of the quark matter produced in these collisions. Extensive measurements of general balance functions, in particular, should provide detailed probes of the formation, evolution, and hadronization of the quark matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The difficulty arises, however, that such measurements are particularly statistics hungry and severe particle losses may be incurred experimentally to achieve  high species purity and contamination  free measurements of correlation functions. However, the identity method, invented by Gazdzicki, provides a technique to essentially  recover the full statistics and extend the kinematic range of measurements while providing reliable disambiguation  of particle species. The technique was first proposed for measurements of first and second moments of particle multiplicities (integral correlation functions) with two particle species but successively extended to handle an arbitrary number of species, higher moments, and measurements of moments in the presence of transverse momentum dependent efficiency losses. I present yet another extension of the method towards measurements of differential correlation functions, more specifically for differential measurements  of the normalized two-particle cumulants, $R_2$,  but the method  can be  extended to other types of two-particle correlators or towards multiple-particle correlation functions. The method is developed for an arbitrary  number of particle species  and in the presence of particle losses, as well as multiple sources of particle identification ($dE/dx$, TOF, etc).","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Claude Andre', 'last_name': 'Pruneau', 'fullName': 'Pruneau, Claude Andre', 'id': '3513484', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University (US)', 'emailHash': '9fb7df76b8e8f49c5f63429cae1aad8b', 'db_id': 3513484, 'person_id': 3642597}"

However, all previous STAR results were obtained with a binomial assumption for the efficiency correction. Unfolding of net-proton distributions is necessary in order to correct for non-binomial detector effects [2]. In addition, there are still no established ways for volume fluctuation corrections. Recently another model dependent method [3] has been suggested to eliminate the participant fluctuations. In this poster, we present the results of the unfolding method that attempts to correct for the non-binomial detector efficiencies and apply the new method for volume fluctuation corrections. The differences with respect to the previous results are discussed.

CF is influenced by various physical phenomena such as conservation laws, collective particle flow, resonance decays, final state interactions, or particle production mechanism - e.g., correlation of particles within the single jet. By analysis of long-range correlations (of pairs with $\Delta\eta \geq$1.0) it is possible to access the early stage of the system created during heavy-ion collision and its longitudinal and azimuthal dynamics.

The STAR Beam Energy Scan data allows one to perform a detailed CF analysis to investigate the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. Recently [1] STAR reported an angular correlation measurements of $\pi$-$\pi$, K-K, and p-p pairs with $\Delta \eta \leq$1 in 0-5% central Au+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7-200 GeV. These results show a significant difference between CF of given particle species combinations.

In this poster, we extend this results to $\Delta \eta \leq\;$2, which allows for analysis of long-range correlations of $\pi$-$\pi$, K-K, and p-p pairs. We describe the data by fitting a multi-component function. Such an approach allows for disentanglement of various correlation sources. The study is conducted in nine centrality classes (70-80%, 60-70%, 50-60%, 40-50%, 30-40%, 20-30%, 10-20%, 5-10% and 0-5%) of Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ between 7.7 and 200 GeV.

We also investigate the impact the correction has on the bulk viscosity. This correction automatically satisfies the Landau matching condition and energy-momentum conservation. It also makes the appearance of the Callan-Symanzyk $\beta_\lambda$-function natural in the bulk viscosity calculation. The bulk viscosity has the expected parametric form for the Boltzmann gas, while for the Bose-Einstein case, it is affected by the cut-off of infrared divergences.

The kinematic reach of these measurements will overlap with those made at the LHC by taking advantage of the increased luminosity due to accelerator upgrades and the sPHENIX acceptance and rate capability.  Particle jets, formed when a hard scattered parton fragments and then hadronizes into a spray of particles, were proposed as a probe of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions.  As these partons traverse the QGP, they lose energy to the medium, an effect called ""jet quenching"".  To answer fundamental questions about parton energy loss and the microscopic nature of the QGP, we need to characterize both the medium induced modification of the jet fragmentation pattern and the correlation of the lost energy with the jet axis.  Observables centered around gamma-jet correlations are especially useful as the photon kinematics are more tightly correlated with the hard scattered parton.  In addition, there are other observables such as jet fragmentation functions and jet shape measurements, which require the precise tracking and calorimetry that sPHENIX will provide.  We will show the performance of jet and gamma-jet observables with the improved simulation framework developed for understanding the performance of the new detector.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Songkyo', 'last_name': 'Lee', 'fullName': 'Lee, Songkyo', 'id': '3661041', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State University (US)', 'emailHash': '87ab725fa74470ce1f518cf06d321dec', 'db_id': 3661041, 'person_id': 3839684}"

Poster Session,poster,Interference effect between jet-induced flows in dijet events,"Tachibana, Yasuki",Wayne State University,Unknown,"We investigate the hydrodynamic medium response to jets in the quark gluon plasma (QGP) fluid in dijet events, in particular focusing on the interference effect between the flows induced by a back-to-back pair of jets. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, jets deposit their energy and momentum into the QGP medium fluid via the successive interactions with the medium constituents during their propagation. The deposited energy and momentum are supposed to excite the medium fluid, and induce flows following the jets as hydrodynamic medium responses. The flow induced by the highly quenched jet develops very widely in the QGP fluid, and can affect also the medium response contribution to the structure of the opposite-side jet in dijet events. 

We simulate dijet events in high-energy heavy-ion collisions by employing a coupled jet-fluid model combining jet shower transport equations and hydrodynamic equations with source terms [1]. The jet shower transport equations describe the evolution of the momentum distributions of partons in the jet showers with the medium effects, i.e., collisional energy loss, transverse momentum broadening, and medium-induced radiation. The QGP medium evolution is described by (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms which transfer the energy and momentum deposited by the jet pair to the QGP fluid. We study how the interference effect between the jet-induced flows in dijet events come out in the jet-correlated particle distributions in the final state and their dependence on the event selection and background subtraction method. For the extensive studies, we also study the energy momentum deposition and induced flows by heavy quarks or jets with virtuality-ordered splittings.

Poster Session,poster,Averaged jet charge as a probe of quark gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions,"Chen, Shi-Yong",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Averaged jet charge characterizes the electric charge distribution inside jets, and provides a powerfull tool to distinguish quark jets from gluon jets. In this talk, we give the first prediction for the medium nodification of averaged jet charge in heavy-ion collision at the LHC energy, where the jet productions in $pp$ collisions are simulated by pythia6+FastJet, and parton energy loss effects in the QGP are calculated with two Monte Carlo codes of jet quenching: PYQUEN and JEWEL. In $pp$ collisions, the value of jet charge for quark jets goes up with increasing jet transverse momentum, while for gluon jets it approximates to zero in the whole range of $p_{T}$  because gluon carries no electric charge. It is shown that the distribution of averaged jet charge is significantly suppressed by initial state nuclear effects due to the participants of neutrons with zero electric charge during nuclear collisions. Considerable enhancement of averaged jet charge in central $PbPb$ collisions relative to  peripheral collisions is observed, since jet quenching effect is more pronounced  in central collisions. In the jet quenching calculations, a fast gluon will lose more energy in the QGP than a fast quark due to its large color-charge($\Delta E_{g}/\Delta E_{q}=C_{A}/C_{F}=9/4$), more quarks with electric charge may survive in central collisions as compared with that in peripheral $PbPb$ collisions. The fraction of quark jet will be increased, which results in the larger value of averaged jet charge in central collisions than that in peripheral reactions. Distinct feature of averaged jet charge between quark and gluon jets, together with the sensitivity of jet charge alternations to flavour dependence of parton energy loss, could be very useful to discriminate the energy loss pattern between quark and gluon jets in heavy-ion collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shi-Yong', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Shi-Yong', 'id': '3530965', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '43efbb72d1e9ee7feb7cc6c3b1667211', 'db_id': 3530965, 'person_id': 3643755}"
Poster Session,poster,"Measurements of Open Bottom Hadron Production via Displaced J/psi, D0 and Electrons in Au+Au Collisions at √sNN = 200 GeV at STAR","Chen, Xiaolong",USTC / LBNL,USA,"Recent RHIC and LHC results show that the nuclear modification factors of open charm hadrons at high transverse momenta as well as their elliptic flow are similar to those of light flavor hadrons, indicating that charm quarks also interact very strongly with the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). During interactions, charm quarks suffer from substantial energy loss and gain significant elliptic flow. It is then imperative to measure bottom production in heavy-ion collisions to study the mass dependence of parton-medium interactions in the QGP suggested by QCD.

In this talk, we will report on STAR measurements of open bottom hadron production through their displaced decay daughters ($B \rightarrow J/\Psi,~D^{0},~e$) in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV. These measurements are made possible with the high-precision vertexing and tracking provided by the Heavy Flavor Tracker. With a factor of 2-5 times more data recorded in year 2016, signal precisions of these measurements are greatly improved compared to previous preliminary results. For Non-prompt $D^0$, further improvement is obtained from a successful implementation of a supervised machine learning method in offline reconstruction. Centrality dependence of nuclear modification factors for non-prompt $D^0$ and electrons from bottom hadron decays will be presented.

Poster Session,poster,Suppression of resonance production in high multiplicity pp events due to colour reconnection effects in PYTHIA8,"Derradi De Souza, Rafael",University of Campinas UNICAMP (BR),Unknown,"The measurement of short-lived hadronic resonances in high energy collisions has always been considered an important observable to investigate the properties of the systems created in such collisions. In particular, the observed suppression of the measured yields of resonance with respect to non-resonance particles towards central heavy-ion collisions has so far been interpreted as being due to re-scattering of decay daughters in a hadronic phase of the system evolution. However, hints of suppression in the measured resonance to non-resonance particle ratios have also been recently observed for high multiplicity events in collisions of small systems, such as pp and p-Pb. In this work, we explore the effects of colour reconnection (CR) mechanisms, such as the new more QCD based scheme and the rope hadronization approach, in hadronic resonance production in high multiplicity pp collisions using the PTYHIA8 event generator. Our studies have shown that the inclusion of CR leads to a suppression of hadronic resonance production with respect to non-resonance states, observed in the evolution of the ratios of $K^{*}/K$, $\rho/\pi$ and $\eta’/\pi$ as a function of the event activity. These results bring an alternative possible explanation for the phenomenon in small systems collisions.

A number of competing explanations have been sought, most of which focus on the pronounced late-side tail in the TOF signal. Some examples include: influence of feeddown descendants, energy losses from multiple scattering, biases from inner-to-outer detector track matching, and biases innate to TOF detector technology. Herein we examine each of these and derive from first principles the ideal TOF distribution and momentum dependent early-late asymmetry. We further conclusively explain its mysterious absence in test beam trial data.

Poster Session,poster,Dilepton production and resonance properties within a new hadronic transport approach,"Staudenmaier, Jan","Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies",Unknown,"As electromagnetic probes dileptons open a window to the in-medium properties of vector mesons. In this talk, medium effects to vector mesons are discussed for heavy ion collisions in the low kinetic energy regime of $1 - 3A$ GeV, where the dielectron emission is accessed by the HADES experiment at GSI. A new hadronic transport approach named SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons) is employed to study dilepton production, which is based on vacuum resonance properties and consistently includes dilepton emissions below the hadronic threshold. The approach is validated by an excellent agreement with experimental data up to system sizes of carbon-carbon collisions. After establishing this well-understood baseline in elementary and small systems, the significance of medium effects is investigated with a coarse-graining approach based on the same hadronic evolution. Interestingly, the effect of explicit in-medium modifications to the vector meson spectral functions is already important for dilepton invariant mass spectra in ArKCl and larger systems, even though the transport approach with vacuum properties reveals similar features due the coupling to baryonic resonance and the intrinsically included collisional broadening. In addition, the validated dilepton production allows to assess the importance of a microscopic evolution of the hadronic stage by studying the non-equilibrium dilepton radiation in late, dilute stages of high-energy heavy ion collisions, i.e. in hybrid approaches.

 helicity amplitudes . For the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, it is 
 shown that -- in the case of the unpolarized electron and positron -- the final
 muons are also unpolarized but their spins are strongly correlated. For the
 final  $(\mu^+ \mu^-)$ system, the structure of triplet states is analyzed and 
 explicit expressions for the components of the spin density matrix and 
 correlation tensor are derived. It is demonstrated that here the spin correlations 
 of muons have the purely quantum character, since one of the Bell-type 
 incoherence inequalities for the correlation tensor components is always violated.
 In doing so, it is established that the qualitative character of the muon spin 
 correlations does not change when involving the additional contribution of the
 weak interaction of lepton neutral currents through the virtual $Z^0$ boson.
 
   On the other hand, the theoretical investigation of spin structure for the two-photon 
 process  $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$  ( where the photon pairs, in

Poster Session,poster,Diffusion of conserved charges in relativistic heavy ion collisions,"Greiner, Carsten",University of Frankfurt,Unknown,"We present the first calculations of all the diffusion transport coefficients related to the baryon, electric and strangeness charge for a hot and dense hadron resonance gas and for a simplified kinetic model of the quark-gluon plasma[ \[arXiv:1711.08680\]][1]. We demonstrate that the diffusion currents do not only depend on gradients of their corresponding charge density. Instead, there exists coupling between the different charge currents, in such a way that it is possible for density gradients of a given charge to generate dissipative currents of another charge. Within this scheme, the charge diffusion coefficient is best viewed as a matrix, in which the diagonal terms correspond to the usual charge diffusion coefficients, while the off-diagonal terms describe the coupling between the different currents. We find that the baryon diffusion current is strongly affected by baryon charge gradients, but also by its coupling to gradients in strangeness. The electric charge diffusion current is found to be strongly affected by electric and strangeness gradients, whereas strangeness currents depend mostly on strange and baryon gradients.

The calculated diffusion coefficients can be easily included in hydrodynamic simulations of heavy ion collisions, and will be particularly important for lower energy collisions such as those that are performed at the RHIC Beam energy scan and that will be performed at NICA or FAIR. We show preliminary hydrodynamic calculations that include the effects of the computed diffusion coefficients.

Poster Session,poster,Finite-Size-Finite-Time Scaling of susceptibilities and susceptibility ratios; Implications for the search for the QCD Critical Point,"Lacey, Roy",Stony Brook University,USA,"Studies of the fluctuations of conserved charges (baryon number, electric charge, strangeness, etc.) can be used to chart the phases of strongly interacting QCD matter, as well as to locate the critical end-point (CEP) in the associated QCD phase diagram. The cumulants (and cumulant ratios) of the multiplicity distributions for conserved charges, which are linked to susceptibilities and their ratios, are predicted to be sensitive to the growth of fluctuations near the critical point, leading to detectable non-monotonic signatures for the CEP [1]. However, the effects of Finite-Size (FS) and Finite-Time (FT) complicate the search for the CEP, because they nullify the possible non-monotonic patterns, and shift the CEP's location to a so-called pseudo-critical point, different from its genuine location. Alternatively, Finite-Size-Finite-Time scaling (FSFTS) of susceptibilities and susceptibility ratios provide a robust avenue to search for the CEP and to characterize its critical exponents. I will describe the rudiments of FSFTS and present the scaling functions for the inverse compressibility ($\kappa^{-1}$) obtained from both the cumulant ratio $C_1/C_2$) for net-protons, and two-pion HBT radii, measured over a broad range of collision centralities in Au+Au collisions spanning the energy rage $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 7.7 - 200$ GeV. The location of the CEP and the critical exponents estimated from these disparate measurements will be presented and discussed.

We present within a coalescence plus fragmentation model the predictions for $D_{0}$, $D_{s}$, $\Lambda_{c}$, $B$ and $\Lambda_{b}$ and the related baryon to meson ratios at RHIC and LHC in a wide range of transverse momentum region up to 10 GeV [1].
We will discuss how our model can predict values for $\Lambda_{c}/D_{0}$ and $\Lambda_{b}/B$ of the order of $O(1)$, which is much larger than the expectations from fragmentation, and in agreement whit early data from STAR collaboration [2].
Furthermore the same approach can be employed to predict baryon to meson ratio $\Lambda/K$ [3], $\Lambda_{c}/D^{0}$ in $pp$ collisions assuming that at the LHC top energies there can be the formation of QGP matter. 
We find considerable volume effects that significantly reduce the ratios but still predict quite larger values with respect to fragmentation, again in agreement with recent data from ALICE in $pp$ collisions [4]. A comparison to other coalescence models and thermal models is discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Recent results on cumulant ratios at nonzero temperature and density from lattice QCD,"Schmidt, Christian",University of Bielefeld,Unknown,"We present recent results on the distributions of conserved charge fluctuations. In particular, we discuss ratios of the shape parameters mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of the net baryon- number, electric charge and strangeness distributions. For the net baryon-number fluctuations we find – using a next-to-leading order Taylor expansion – that qualitative features of these ratios closely resemble the corresponding experimentally measured cumulants ratios of net proton-number fluctuations for beam energies down to collision energies of 19.6 GeV. We show that the observed difference in cumulant ratios for the mean net baryon-number and the normalized skewness arises naturally in QCD thermodynamics. Moreover, we establish a close relation between skewness and kurtosis ratios, at small values of the baryon chemical potential. In the case of electric charge and strangeness fluctuations we show that these ratios are sensitive to the presence of multiple charged particles.
The calculations are based on lattice QCD simulations with physical quark masses and a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action. The lattice size is $N_\sigma^3\times N_\tau$, with an aspect ratio $N_\sigma/N_\tau=4$ and three different lattice spacings, corresponding to the number of temporal sites $N_\tau=8, 12$ and $16$. Continuum extrapolations have been performed for most of our observables.

Poster Session,poster,Forward Dihadron Angular Correlations in pA collisions,"Wei, Shu-yi",Ecole Polytechnique,Unknown,"Dihadron angular correlations in forward $pA$ collisions have been considered as one of the most sensitive observables to the gluon saturation effects. In general, both parton shower effects and saturation effects are responsible for the back-to-back dihadron angular de-correlations. Recent developments have allowed to incorporate the so-called parton shower effect, namely the Sudakov effect, into the small-$x$ formalism [1-3]. This, in particular, will enable us to go beyond the saturation dominant region, and conduct calculations for dihadron correlation in a much wider regime where both saturation effects and Sudakov effects are important.

In this paper [4], we carry out the first detailed numerical study in this regard, and find a very good agreement with previous RHIC $pp$ and $dAu$ data. This study can help us to establish a baseline in $pp$ collisions which contains little saturation effects, and further make predictions for dihadron angular correlations in $pAu$ collisions, which will allow to search for the signal of parton saturation.

The origin of the work lies in two observations concerning particle production at high pT (> 8 GeV/c) in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at sNN = 5.02 TeV. On one hand, within uncertainties the RAA of light and heavy flavoured particles is essentially the same. On the other hand, the identity of the rise observed in the RAA with that observed in the ratios of the multiplicity dependent spectra, in pp collisions, divided by the same pp reference spectrum. We have made a systematic study of available data, fitting the power law function to the high pT spectra in different multiplicity and centrality classes. The comparison of the spectra of pp and Pb-Pb collisions at multiplicities corresponding to the same power law exponent exhibits marked differences at low momenta, namely, an increased contribution of low momentum particles, that could be attributed to the debris of the high momentum jets in Pb-Pb collisions. The claim is supported with studies of leading particle pT production as well as its connection with the event activity and quenching properties.

Poster Session,poster,Understanding phenomenological constraints on the bulk viscosity of QCD,"Bass, Steffen A.",Duke University,USA,"The bulk viscosity of QCD is expected to vary considerably with temperature, from very small values at high temperatures to a possible large peak in the confinement region. Heavy ion collisions present a unique opportunity to establish experimental constraints on this transport coefficient, providing guidance to better understand the response of QCD systems to deviations from equilibrium. 

In this work, we undertake a systematic analysis of hadronic observables within a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model of the quark-gluon plasma, and establish a set of measurements that can constrain the temperature dependence of bulk viscosity. We explicitly show the resilience of these constraints to experimental uncertainties. The temperature dependence of shear viscosity is investigated side-by-side with bulk viscosity for completeness.

We highlight the impact of bulk viscosity on the hadronic chemistry. We further look at different models of initial conditions of the plasma to clarify their effect on phenomenological constraints of bulk viscosity.

We use Lagrangian Effective Field theory techniques to understand the ideal hydrodynamic limit for such systems.   After discussing the relation between this limit, transport theory, and ideal hydrodynamics we derive the equations of motion for a polarized fluid.  We show that this system will generally require non-dissipative dynamics at higher order in gradient than first order, leading to breakdown of stability and causality.  Thus, such a system necessitates relaxation-type dynamics already in the ideal fluid limit, unlike unpolarized hydrodynamics where the ideal limit is known to be causal.

Specifically, the yield of low-mass thermal dileptons was identified as a measure of the fireball lifetime, while the slope of intermediate-mass dilepton spectra can serve as a thermometer unaffected by blue-shift effects of collective expansion which distort $p_T$ spectra. Here, we couple in-medium thermal dilepton rates, which reproduce existing data at ultrarelativistic collision energies, with a coarse-graining method of hadronic transport simulations to compute dilepton spectra at lower energies, $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \leq$ 10 GeV, where hydrodynamic simulations may be less reliable. By extracting local temperature, baryon and pion densities the convolution with thermal rates can be readily carried out. Our calculations suggest that also at lower energies the $\rho$-meson melting in a near-thermal source prevails and that the emission duration closely correlates with the build-up of the transverse flow in the fireball. The resulting yields and slopes of the invariant-mass spectra extend previous excitation functions of the fireball lifetimes and temperatures to lower energies.

We present the first numerical results for the photon cross-section including both the leading order terms computed previously [2,3] supplemented by novel next-to-leading results [4].  We compare the relative contributions of the LO and the NLO terms at different collider energies, and present detailed comparisons to data from RHIC and LHC on p+p and p/d+A collisions.

The Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD) is the forward hadron calorimeter to be used in these both fixed target experiments to measure the event centrality and reaction plane orientation in heavy-ion collisions. The PSD at the CBM is designed for the beam energy range of 4-10 AGeV and rates up to 10 MHz, whereas the PSD at the NA61 beyond 2020 would operate in the beam energy range of 20-150A GeV and rates up to 5x10$^4$ Hz. 
In this poster we will present the status of the development of the PSD for both, CBM and NA61 beyond 2020 experiments. Both detectors have similar design, modular transverse structure and longitudinal segmentation. Each module has 5.6 hadron interaction lengths and transverse size of 200x200 $mm^2$. The module consist of 60 lead/scintillator sandwiches with the sampling ratio 4:1. Light from each scintillator plate in module is collected by WLS fibers. Six consecutive scintillator plates are read out by one photodetector, 3x3 $mm^2$ Hamamatsu MPPC placed at the end of the module. 
Recently, for the first time, the PSD supermodule (3x3 array of 9 modules) was studied at CERN test beams with protons and pions in the energy range of 2-10 GeV. Preliminary results of the energy resolution, linearity of response and longitudinal profile of hadron showers will be presented.

The dynamical evolution of the QGP medium that hard jets probe is simulated with relativistic hydrodynamics that has been tuned to describe the soft hadron production at RHIC and the LHC. Our numerical results can simultaneously describe the experimental data on both light and heavy flavor hadron suppressions for different centralities at both RHIC and the LHC heavy-ion collisions. Detailed analysis show that the initial parton spectra, the details of the energy loss mechanism, and the shapes of fragmentation functions all play important role in understanding the difference between the nuclear modifications of light and heavy flavor hadrons.

However, the validity of hydrodynamical models in describing the extreme conditions produced in heavy ion collisions has still not been properly justified theoretically. Even more, the gradient expansion, commonly used to derive hydrodynamics from microscopic theory, has been recently shown to diverge for conformal fluids or relativistic gases undergoing Bjorken flow [1,2], putting under question the definition of hydrodynamics itself. Alternative derivation of the hydrodynamic series have been proposed recently, such as the slow-roll expansion [1], and can be promising candidates to define hydrodynamics.

In this contribution, we present general analytical and semi-analytical solutions of the hydrodynamic attractor of Israel-Stewart theory [2] and kinetic theory for Bjorken and Gubser expanding fluids. We show that the gradient expansion diverges in both cases. For Israel-Stewart theory, we show for the first time that even the slow-roll expansion, a commonly used approach to characterize the attractor, diverges. Finally, we construct the slow-roll expansion for a general flow scenario and find the effective shear viscosity [3] and relaxation time that are able to describe a more general hydrodynamic regime.

Poster Session,poster,Relaxation Time for the Chiral Vortical Effect and Spin Polarization in Strongly Coupled Plasma,"Li , Shiyong",University of Illinois at Chicago,USA,"Anomalous transport phenomena arising from chiral anomaly such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect have recently attracted much attention. One such phenomenon, the Chiral Vortical Effect, that is an induced current along fluid vorticity, is somewhat special because it is related to chiral anomaly on one hand, while on the other hand its microscopic origin is the spin polarization of chiral quarks in the fluid vorticity, whose physics is more general and applicable even for massive spinful particles such as Lambda baryon. In theoretical understanding of recently measured Lambda polarization in off-central heavy-ion collisions at RHIC, it is vitally important to know the dynamical time scale of this spin polarization, that is, the relaxation time it takes to achieve the equilibrium with Lambda spins polarized in a finite fluid vorticity. Therefore, by studying the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect in massless chiral limit, we can get a useful proxy for this time scale for Lambda spin polarization.
We first derive the correct Kubo formula for the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect from the energy-momentum and current two point functions, pointing out that some of the previous claims for a zero relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect is due to an incorrect identification of the Kubo formula for the relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect. Using our Kubo formula, we compute the correct and finite relaxation time of the Chiral Vortical Effect for the first time in strongly coupled plasma using the AdS/CFT correspondence.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shiyong', 'last_name': 'Li ', 'fullName': 'Li , Shiyong', 'id': '3545644', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Chicago', 'emailHash': 'b005ffd278a81432b5f8fc854ef4a7a0', 'db_id': 3545644, 'person_id': 3639026}"

Searches for these quark chirality effects in nucleus-nucleus collisions have been performed at RHIC and the LHC as major scientific goals. For example, the RHIC 2018 run will be devoted to the isobaric collisions of $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr at √s$_{NN}$ = 200 GeV, where one may expect an up-to-20% difference in the experimental observables related to the magnetic-field-induced effects. 
Current data indicate that the experimental sensitivity to the chirality effects also depends on the beam energy and the colliding system size, presumably owing to variations in the magnetic field and/or the size of the QGP droplets. Therefore, another venue to enhance the experimental sensitivity could be Au+Au collisions at lower beam energies. We will demonstrate with the AMPT simulations that the number of net protons (N$_{\mathrm{net-p}}$) at mid-rapidity is anti-correlated with the number of spectator protons, and hence provides an excellent handle on the magnetic field from spectator protons in Au+Au collisions at lower RHIC beam energies. Equipped with the event-shape engineering technique [1], the search for chirality effects by varying N$_{\mathrm{net-p}}$ in Au+Au collisions at lower energies (with √s$_{NN}$ still higher than 10 GeV) will complement the isobaric collision data. The future RHIC Beam Energy Scan II program will facilitate the application of our method and discern the true contribution due to the quark chirality effects.

A numerical model simulation was developed for hydrodynamic evolution in (1+1)-dim which was tested to reproduce the analytic results for the Riemann solutions of expansion of matter in vacuum at early times, and the Landau-Khalatnikov wave propagation inside the medium for later times. Numerical simulation of thermal noise is performed for various second-order dissipative evolution equations using lattice QCD equation of state. Phenomenological effects of thermal fluctuations for the two-particle rapidity correlations showed that viscous damping of the correlation is at most ~20%.Further, significant damping was found at small rapidity separations when second-order dissipative hydrodynamics was employed instead of first-order Navier-Stokes theory. As compared to the conformal equation of state, the softer lattice QCD EOS causes reduced propagation of the fluctuations and leads to a pronounced peak in 
the rapidity correlations.

While soft-gluon approximation is convenient, doubts have been raised over its validity, especially since different theoretical approaches reported significant radiative energy loss of high $p_T$ partons, which implies that this approximation is not applicable in such calculations.

To address this issue, we relaxed the soft-gluon approximation within DGLV formalism [1], and discuss generalizing this relaxation in the dynamical QCD medium. Although the obtained results are quite distinct compared to the soft-gluon case, numerically both cases lead to nearly overlapping predictions for the first order in opacity fractional energy loss. The fractional number of radiated gluons is also barely affected. The effect on these two variables runs in opposite directions, which when combined results in negligible suppression change. Therefore, we unexpectedly conclude that soft-gluon approximation works surprisingly well in energy loss calculations, and that there is no need to go beyond the soft-gluon approximation in energy loss based models of parton suppression.

Therefore, the Bjorken formula cannot be trusted at lower energies, for example, below $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \sim 50$ GeV for central Au+Au collisions. 

Here we extend the Bjorken formula by including the finite crossing time of the two nuclei, which leads to a finite duration time for the initial energy production. We have derived analytical solutions for the energy density as a function of time for several representative duration-time profiles. We also use a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model [3], which treats more realistically the baryon stopping and has been modified to include the finite duration time (as well as the finite longitudinal width) of the initial energy production, and the AMPT results confirm the key features of our analytical solutions. At low energies in comparison with the Bjorken formula, we find [4] that the maximum energy density achieved is much lower while the width of the time evolution of the energy density is much bigger. In addition, it is good to find that the energy density is much less sensitive than the Bjorken formula to the value of the poorly-known formation time $\tau_0$. Furthermore, the extended analytical solutions reduce to the Bjorken formula at high energies. This extension thus provides a general model for the initial energy production of relativistic heavy ion collisions, especially at lower energies such as the RHIC Beam Energy Scan energies.

Poster Session,poster,Beam Energy Scan program with EPOS model,"Stefaniak, Maria",Warsaw University of Technology,Unknown,"Studies of collisions of highly accelerated ions are the key to understand the creation of quark matter. Experimental physicists put considerable effort in collecting information characterizing the various processes occurring during such collisions. In order to describe such scenarios, complex models have been constructed, one of them being the EPOS approach. It applies Parton-based Gribov-Regge theory as an initial condition, introduces the core-corona approach, hydrodynamical evolution and hadronic cascades as well. The model is used by the experimental physicist at the LHC or in cosmic ray physics.

At the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the STAR collaboration is currently investigating an interesting project called Beam Energy Scan. The QCD phase diagram is studied in order to understand the phase transitions close to the critical point, which should be in the energy domain studied in this program. Models have difficulties to describe this energy range properly. The aim of our investigation is to adapt the EPOS model to describe correctly collisions of ions with energies studied in the framework of the BES program.

The detailed description of the theory included in EPOS model will be presented. The energy dependence of the separation into the core and corona will be discussed, and the way it affects transverse momentum spectra of identified particles and the observables of the azimuthal anisotropy of expanding matter. The particles from the corona are strongly affected by the radial flow and the flow asymmetries. The results of different types of analysis of elliptic flow will be discussed. The simulation results for collisions of Au+Au at selected BES energies will be presented in comparison with the published STAR data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maria', 'last_name': 'Stefaniak', 'fullName': 'Stefaniak, Maria', 'id': '3545881', 'affiliation': 'Warsaw University of Technology', 'emailHash': '784066dac7593c1b4fb38f29a1d20dab', 'db_id': 3545881, 'person_id': 3641009}"

(DE),Germany,"The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will be installed at the SIS100 accelerator at FAIR and is currently in construction. It is devoted to precision measurements of QCD matter at high net-baryon densities. With heavy-ion interaction rates up to $10\;\textrm{MHz}$, rare probes like, e.g., multi-strange hyperons will be accessible. In-medium mass distributions of vector mesons can be measured via lepton pairs and excitation functions of various observables will serve as sensitive probes for phase transitions. This talk reports on the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) of CBM. Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers (MWPCs) for this detector are challenged to record the mentioned unprecedented heavy-ion interaction rates, which will result in particle rates at the TRD plane up to $120\;\textrm{kHz}\;\textrm{cm}^{-2}$: the MWPCs will therefore be built in a fast design with signal collection times below $300\;\textrm{ns}$ and nevertheless deliver an excellent pion suppression.

The physics case, the detector concept and its PID as well as tracking performance will be presented. The TRD will, for instance, be essential for the identification of hypernuclei and the measurement of intermediate mass dielectrons. The latest evolution of the fully self-triggered and free-streaming read-out chain will be shown. In 2017, testbeam measurements have been performed in DESY II electron beam and in the high-rate environment of the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF$^{++}$) at CERN.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium hadroproduction and photoproduction in quark-gluon plasma and strong electromagnetic fields at RHIC and LHC,"Chen, Baoyi",Goethe University,Unknown,"We study the charmonium coherent photoproduction and hadroproduction consistently with modifications from both cold and hot nuclear matters. The strong electromagnetic fields from fast moving nucleus interact with the other target nucleus, producing abundant charmonium in the extremely low transverse momentum region $p_T<0.1$ GeV/c, based on the process $\gamma +A\rightarrow J/\psi +A$. This results in significant enhancement of $J/\psi$ nuclear modification factor in semi-central and peripheral collisions. In the middle $p_T$ region such as $p_T<3\sim 5$ GeV/c, $J/\psi$ final yield is dominated by the combination process of single charm and anti-charm quarks moving in the deconfined matter, $c+\bar c\rightarrow J/\psi +g$. In the higher $p_T$ region, $J/\psi$ production are mainly from parton initial hard scatterings at the beginning of nucleus-nucleus collisions and decay of B hadrons. We include all of these production mechanisms and explain well the experimental data from ALICE and STAR in different transverse momentum regions at LHC and RHIC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Baoyi', 'last_name': 'Chen', 'fullName': 'Chen, Baoyi', 'id': '3545914', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University', 'emailHash': '93f993449b2aaa26cded165cd07bcc97', 'db_id': 3545914, 'person_id': 3641325}"
Poster Session,poster,Effect of field fluctuations on heavy mesons nuclear modification factor at LHC energies,"Sheikh, Ashik Ikbal",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"The aim of the ongoing relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments is to explore the possible hot and dense deconfined state of QCD matter produced in such high energy collisions, the so called Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP). High energy partons (gluons, light quarks as well as heavy quarks) are produced in initial partonic sub-processes in the collisions between two heavy nuclei. Heavy quarks are mostly produced at the early stage of the collisions from the initial fusion of the partons which makes them a good probe to characterize the QGP. Immediately after their production, these heavy quarks will travel through the dense QGP medium and will start loosing energy during their path of travel. They lose energy in two different manners,one is by elastic collisions and another is by bremsstrahlung gluon radiations. These energy loss calculations are usually obtained by considering the QGP medium in an average manner and statistical field fluctuations of the QGP medium are ignored. The QGP being a statistical system of mobile color charge particles, one could characterize it by stochastic electromagnetic field fluctuations. The effect of this field fluctuations in the QGP leads to an energy gain of the travelling heavy quarks of all momenta and significant at the lower ones. 

  We have calculated the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$ ) of heavy mesons by considering the collisional and radiative energy loss of heavy quarks along with the energy gain due to field fluctuations. Our results are in good agreement with the experimentally measured $R_{AA}$ of D and B mesons by ALICE and CMS experiments at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ashik Ikbal', 'last_name': 'Sheikh', 'fullName': 'Sheikh, Ashik Ikbal', 'id': '3545877', 'affiliation': 'Department of Atomic Energy (IN)', 'emailHash': 'ea0798891abbbac4787c45ad804025f1', 'db_id': 3545877, 'person_id': 3645012}"
Poster Session,poster,Study of Quarkonia Production in proton+proton collisions at the LHC and the Role of Multiple Partonic Interaction,"Sahoo, Raghunath",Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN),India,"In high multiplicity p+p collisions, the Underlying Event observable is of great interest to the scientific community. The Multiple Partonic Interaction (MPI) is one of them, where several inelastic interactions at partonic level occur in a single p+p collision. In general, MPI plays an important role to produce light quarks and gluons. But it is observed that it can also contribute to produce heavy flavor particles like charmonia, when the interaction occurs in a harder scale. This leads to a strong dependence of J/ψ production with charged particle multiplicity. ALICE experiment has observed a monotonic increase of J/ψ with charged particle multiplicity in p+p collisions at √s = 7, 13 TeV in dimuon as well as dielectron channels. But, till now the measurements are not available for all the LHC energies. This forbids one to infer about the energy dependence role of MPI on J/ψ production.

In our current study, we have made an effort to understand the role of MPI on multiplicity and energy dependence production of J/ψ using perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) inspired model, PYTHIA8 at different LHC energies of √s = 0.9, 2.76, 5.02, 7 and 13 TeV. J/ψ are reconstructed via dimuon channel at forward rapidities (2.5 < y < 4.0) and the charged particle multiplicity is measured at midrapidity (|y| < 1.0). The effect of Color Reconnection (CR) on the production of J/ψ at the LHC energies at different multiplicity bins is studied. The multiplicity ratio of higher state of charmonia, to J/ψ, i.e. ψ(2S)/J/ψ will be presented as a function of multiplicity at all the LHC energies. We observe the dominance of CR and MPI effects towards high multiplicity events at the LHC energies, showing a threshold of Nch > 20. The present study will help in understanding the charmonia production in p+p collisions at the LHC energies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raghunath', 'last_name': 'Sahoo', 'fullName': 'Sahoo, Raghunath', 'id': '3545910', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology  Indore (IN)', 'emailHash': '5e9ee078c0296b41a7757808274b3c42', 'db_id': 3545910, 'person_id': 3642132}"

We notice that recently $b\bar{b}$ dijet correlations in proton-proton collisions have been measured by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations at the LHC, NLO+PS p+p baseline could give a rather perfect description of the experimental data than PYTHIA. Moreover detailed mechanisms of heavy flavoured jets propagation and energy loss in dense QCD matter are not yet fully investigated.
In this talk, we present the first predictions of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet angular correlations in Pb+Pb collision. In this work, a NLO+PS event generator SHERPA has been employed to give the p+p baseline and events, A Langevin evolution is used to describe the heavy quark evolution ,and the higher-twist approach is implemented to simulate the radiative energy loss of the gluon,heavy and light quarks simultaneously,and the hard-thermal-loop calculation is used to describe the collisional energy loss of light quarks and gluon. We predict  the azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi$ , angular distance $\Delta R$ , and rapidity variables $y_B $ distributions of the normalized $b\bar{b}$ dijet production at the LHC 8.8 TeV. We find the energy loss of the $b\bar{b}$ dijet will suppress and broden the near side(small $\Delta \phi$)peak and also enhance and sharp the away side (near $\Delta \phi=\pi$ ) peak. We have also calculated the distribution of transverse momentum $p_T$ of $b\bar{b}$ dijet, the transverse momentum imbalance $X_j$ of back-to-back $b\bar{b}$ dijet pairs  and the flavour asymmetry $A_b$ of mixed-flavour dijet pairs to gain new insight into heavy flavour dynamics in the quark-gluon plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sa', 'last_name': 'Wang', 'fullName': 'Wang, Sa', 'id': '3545756', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '2b609468aa2ac6ec877a46a4e4d89f67', 'db_id': 3545756, 'person_id': 3643766}"
Poster Session,poster,Probing the thermal state of the fireball at freezeout via isothermal compressibility and specific heat capacity,"Mukherjee, Maitreyee",Central China Normal University,China,"The thermal state of the fireball at freezeout has been inferred from the mean hadron yields previously. In this study, we go beyond the mean hadron multiplicities and access the variances from multiplicity and transverse momentum distributions that provide us the thermodynamic responses of the fireball at freezeout – namely the isothermal compressibility ($k_T$) and specific heat capacity ($c_v$) that enable us to determine the thermodynamic state of the fireball at freezeout independently of the mean hadron yields. Further, in case the freezeout lies in the critical region of the QCD phase diagram, evidence of criticality could also show up in $k_T$ and $c_V$.

We have for the first time estimated $k_{T}$ of the system formed in heavy-ion collisions for energies from 7.7 GeV to 2.76 TeV, with the help of event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. An estimate of the dynamical fluctuation has been made from the experimental data by subtracting the statistical fluctuation within the approximation of the participant model.  For $c_v$, the experimental data on the event-by-event mean transverse momentum distributions are transformed to distributions of effective temperatures and the dynamical temperature fluctuations are obtained by subtracting the widths of the corresponding mixed event distributions.  We have compared our results with model expectations based on the hadron resonance gas model as well as event generators. The estimation of $k_{T}$ and $c_{v}$ complements our previous understanding of the thermal state of the fireball at freezeout based on mean hadron yields.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maitreyee', 'last_name': 'Mukherjee', 'fullName': 'Mukherjee, Maitreyee', 'id': '3545783', 'affiliation': 'Central China Normal University', 'emailHash': '9b012a345a24f92cd27d177df00c8e3f', 'db_id': 3545783, 'person_id': 3646670}"
Poster Session,poster,Calculations of coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC,"Zha, Wangmei",USTC/BNL,USA,"The coherent photon-nucleus and photon-photon interactions has been studied in detail at RHIC and LHC to probe the gluon distribution in nucleus and to test QED via relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These kind of interactions are traditionally thought to only exist in ultra-peripheral collisions, where there is no hadronic interactions. Recently, a significant excess of $J/\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_T < 0.3$ GeV/c) was observed by the ALICE and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions, which points to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions. Assuming that the coherent photonuclear production is response for the observed $J/\psi$ excess, the coherent two-photon process should be there and contribute to the dilepton production. According to above, STAR made measurements of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production at very low $p_{T}$, and indeed, a significant excess is observed in peripheral collisions.  The survival of photoproduced $J/\psi$ and electron pair merits theoretical investigations, which are currently absent on the market.


In this presentation we report on calculations of coherent photon-nucleus ($\gamma + A \rightarrow J/\psi + A$) and photon-photon ($\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^{+} + e^{-}$) interactions in hadronic A+A collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We also address the questions about how the electromagnetic field translates into a flux of equivalent photons in hadronic A+A collisions: if the photons is emitted from the whole nucleus, or if only the spectator fragments contribute to the photon emission. Similarly, for photon-nucleus interactions, it is not clear whether the whole nucleus or only spectator fragment act as photon target. The model used to calculate the cross section will be discussed and the expected yield will be compared with experimental results from RHIC and LHC.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Wangmei', 'last_name': 'Zha', 'fullName': 'Zha, Wangmei', 'id': '3545790', 'affiliation': 'USTC/BNL', 'emailHash': '6ddbd8df1526daddeb2a40eb0325d8bb', 'db_id': 3545790, 'person_id': 3641326}"
Poster Session,poster,Functional QCD: From Correlators to Thermodynamics,"Cyrol, Anton K.",University of Heidelberg,Unknown,"Functional continuum methods provide ab-initio access to the non-perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics. In particular, they allow accessing non-zero temperatures and densities, making them an ideal tool to access QCD's phase diagram.

Within the functional renomalization group (FRG) approach, remarkable progress has been achieved over the last few years. 

In this talk I will briefly review results on chiral symmetry breaking and confinement at vanishing and finite temperature [2-5]. A particular challenge within the functional approaches is the extraction of the equation of state from correlation functions. I will report on recent progress and present first results on the trace anomaly as well as the pressure.

In this talk we report the lattice observation of deconfinement in dense matter. The study of the deconfinement transition was conducted within lattice simulation of dense two-color QCD at zero temperature. We reach very large baryon density (up to quark chemical potential $\mu_q > 2000 \mathrm{~MeV}$). In the region $\mu_q\sim 1000 \mathrm{~MeV}$ we observe for the first time the confinement/deconfinement transition which manifests itself in a rising of the Polyakov loop and vanishing of the string tension. After the deconfinement at $\mu_q > 1000 \mathrm{~MeV}$ we observe a monotonous decrease of the spatial string tension which ends up with its vanishing at $\mu_q > 2000 \mathrm{~MeV}$. From this observation we draw the conclusion that the confinement/deconfinement transition at finite density and zero temperature is quite different from that at finite temperature and zero density. Our results indicate that in very dense matter the quark-gluon plasma is similar to a weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons without magnetic screening mass in the system, sharply different from a quark-gluon plasma at large temperature.

It has been shown that a multiphase transport (AMPT) model can naturally reproduce the long-range two-particle correlation in p+Pb collisions and in a good agreement with the experimental data [1]. A new subevent cumulant method is recently developed,  which can significantly reduce the non-flow effects in long-range correlations for small systems [2]. In this study, we use subevent cumulant method to study multi-particle correlations in p+Pb collisions within the AMPT model. The 2nd and 4th order of multi-particle cumulants and multi-particle azimuthal correlations between different flow harmonics, SC(2,3) and SC(2,4), are numerically calculated. Our results show that $v_{2}\{2\}$ is consistent with the experimental data, while $v_{2}\{4\}$ is systematically smaller than the experimental data, which may indicate the collectivity is underestimated by the AMPT model. The SC(2,3) from the traditional cumulant method is negative at high multiplicity, while it is positive at low multiplicity. However, the SC(2,3) from the subevent cumulant methods is negative for all range of multiplicity. The SC(2,4) from the traditional cumulant method is larger than that from subevent cumulant methods. We will discuss the implication of these results,  which help us to understand the origin of collectivity in small systems [3].

Poster Session,poster,Modeling QCD phase diagram within chiral relativistic mean field model fitted to $\mu_B=0$ lattice data,"Motornenko, Anton",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"The SU(3) flavor parity-doublet quark-hadron model is used to investigate the phase diagram of QCD matter. The quark sector of the model is tuned to the $\mu_B=0$ lattice QCD data on trace anomaly. The structure of the baryon number susceptibilities in the temperature/chemical potential plane is studied in some detail.
The model predicts three phase transitions - nuclear first-order liquid-gas phase transition, chiral symmetry restoration, and deconfinement transition.
At $\mu_B=0$, good agreement with the corresponding lattice data is obtained.
The deviations from the free hadron gas baseline in the crossover temperature region at $\mu_B=0$ are mainly attributed to the leftover of the liquid-gas transition in nuclear matter, the chiral phase transition determines the baryon fluctuations at much higher $\mu_B$, and at even higher baryon densities the behavior of fluctuations is controlled by deconfinement transition.

Poster Session,poster,An Initial State with local shear and vorticity for peripheral heavy ion collisions,"Magas, Volodymyr",University of Barcelona,Unknown,"More than 15 years ago a longitudinal effective string rope model was proposed [1] to construct nucleus-nucleus collision Initial State (IS) for realistic 3+1D relativistic fluid dynamical models. This model reflected correctly not only the energy-momentum, but also angular momentum conservation, initial shear flow, and local vorticity [2]. Recent experimental and theoretical developments indicate that angular momentum, local vorticity and the subsequent particle polarization is observable and provides valuable information: a significant Λ polarization was detected and analyzed in detail in the RHIC BES program [3]. 

On the other hand, recent developments in parton kinetic and field dominance models provide a rather different initial state configuration, more compact for non-central collisions, see for example [4], what makes us revisit the early IS model [1] in that direction.

We will present a new initial state model for hydrodynamical simulation of relativistic heavy ion collisions, which is based on Bjorken-like solution applied streak by streak in the transverse plane [5]. The proposed model satisfies all the conservation laws including  conservation of a strong initial angular momentum which is present in non-central collisions. As a consequence of this large initial angular momentum we observe the fluid shear in the IS, which leads to large flow vorticity. Another advantage of the proposed model is that the initial state can be given in both [t,x,y,z] and [τ, x, y,η] coordinates.

Poster Session,poster,Directed Flow Due to the Initial Source Tilt and Density Asymmetry in Cu+Au and Au+Au Collisions at STAR,"Niida, Takafumi",Wayne State University,United States,"Despite of a generally very successful description of the elliptic and higher harmonic flow in heavy-ion collisions by theoretical models, there is no single model that explains the dependence of the directed flow on pseudorapidity, collision energy, system size, and the particle type. This indicates that an important piece in our picture of ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is still missing. Directed flow is thought to arise from two main mechanisms: the so-called ""tilted"" source and the dipole-like initial density asymmetry. The asymmetric Cu+Au collisions provide a unique possibility to identify the roles of theses two mechanisms.

We present the results of directed flow measurements for charged and identified particles in Cu+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 200 GeV as a function of centrality, pseudorapidity, and transverse momentum. We show how the comparison of pseudorapidiy dependence of $v_1$ and $\langle p_x\rangle$ can be used to quantify the contribution of different mechanisms of directed flow formation. We compare the results with Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies, and discuss the centrality and energy dependence of the relative contributions to the directed flow from the initial source tilt and from the density asymmetry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Takafumi', 'last_name': 'Niida', 'fullName': 'Niida, Takafumi', 'id': '3582594', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University', 'emailHash': 'a6bcf2a7df71b01e46b5a5223d213055', 'db_id': 3582594, 'person_id': 3763511}"
Poster Session,poster,Medium response to jet energy loss and redistribution of lost energy via the AMPT model,"Luo, Ao",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"Jet-medium interaction has two important aspects: jet energy loss and the medium response to the lost energy/momentum. The study of jet energy loss has been very successful in the explanation of the suppression of high $p_T$ hadron and jet productions as well as the nuclear modification of dihadron, dijet, photo-jet and hadron-jet correlations. The search for the signal of the medium response to jet transport has been a long-standing topic: how does the lost energy from the jets evolve with the dynamical medium and where does it show up in the final state particle distributions and correlations?

We study the medium response and redistribution of the lost energy from hard jets via the AMPT model. In particular, we study asymmetric dijet events in PbPb collisions at 2.76 TeV. We first investigate in detail the contribution from the final charged hadrons carrying different transverse momenta and emitted from different angular directions, the projected transverse momentum $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle$ [1]. It is found that $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle $ in the leading jet direction is mainly contributed by hard hadrons in both peripheral and central PbPb collisions, while the opposite direction in central collisions is dominated by soft hadrons. Our study of the in-cone and out-of-cone contributions to $\langle p_{T}^{||} \rangle$ shows that these soft hadrons are mostly emitted at large angles away from the dijet axis. These results indicate that in the AMPT model, a large amount of the lost energy from hard jets occurred in the partonic stage is transported by elastic collisions to soft partons at large angles; this is qualitatively consistent with the CMS measurements. To further investigate the signals of the medium response effect and the redistribution of the lost energy at large angles, we also study the jet shape functions with a wide range of $r$ for asymmetric dijet events.

Poster Session,poster,Plasmon mass scale in classical nonequilibrium gauge theory in two and three dimensions,"Peuron, Jarkko",University of Jyväskylä,Italy,"The initial stage of a relativistic heavy ion collision is dominated by an overoccupied, strong gluon field, which can be understood in a classical approximation. The physics of equilibration and isotropization of this field is dominated by the plasmon mass scale, which is poorly understood in this very nonequilibrium system. We address this by measuring the plasmon mass scale in two and three dimensional classical Yang-Mills systems numerically. We use three different methods: a Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) expression involving the quasiparticle spectrum constructed from Coulomb gauge field correlators, an effective dispersion relation (DR) and the measurement of oscillations between electric and magnetic energies after introducing a spatially uniform  perturbation to the electric field (UE). We find that the HTL and the UE methods are in rough agreement. The DR method agrees with other methods within a factor of two. We also study the dependence on time and occupation number. We observe that a power law dependence sets in in both cases after an occupation number dependent transient time. We find that in both cases our results are insensitive to the infrared cutoff. In three dimensions we find that the UE and HTL measurements can be brought into agreement when we take the ultraviolet cutoff to zero. However, in two dimensions the results obtained using all three methods seem to increase when we take the ultraviolet cutoff to zero. At late times in three spatial dimensions, the square of the plasmon mass seems to scale as $t^{-2/7}$, which is also predicted by kinetic theory analysis and previous research. In two dimensions the square of the plasmon mass seems to decrease as $t^{-1/3}$ according to HTL method measurement.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Jarkko', 'last_name': 'Peuron', 'fullName': 'Peuron, Jarkko', 'id': '3545844', 'affiliation': 'University of Jyväskylä', 'emailHash': '0225cb2dd7994698f2ac0347826bab5a', 'db_id': 3545844, 'person_id': 3640474}"

Poster Session,poster,Equilibration in finite gluon systems,"Wolschin, Georg",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"The equilibration of a finite Bose system is modelled using a gradient expansion of the collision integral in the bosonic Boltzmann equation that leads to a nonlinear transport equation. Employing a method that had been proposed earlier for the analytical solution of the equilibration problem in a finite fermion system [1], the basic equation for bosons and in particular, gluons, is solved in closed form for constant transport coefficients through a nonlinear transformation.

With initial conditions that are appropriate for the gluon system in a relativistic heavy-ion collision such as Au+Au or Pb+Pb at energies reached at RHIC or LHC, the exact solution is derived. It agrees well with the numerical solution of the nonlinear equation. The analytical expression for the local equilibration time in the thermal tail is compared to the corresponding case for fermions. The method is also applicable to the (nonrelativistic) equilibration of a cold quantum gas.

Due to the nonlinearity of the basic equation, the sharp edges of the initial gluon distribution at Q_s ≈ 1 GeV are continously smeared out and local equilibrium of the gluon distribution with a thermal tail in the ultraviolett region is rapidly attained [2]. Although gluon condensate formation at p=0 is in principle possible, due to inelastic processes and the nonconservation of particle number in relativistic collisions this appears unlikely to occur in heavy-ion collisions.

The thermal equilibration time for gluons turns out to be nine times shorter than the equilibration time for fermions (quarks) as a consequence of the statistical properties of bosons versus fermions [2]. This result can be viewed as one of the main reasons for the very short local equilibration time in relativistic heavy-ion collisions that are dominated by gluons in their initial stage.

Poster Session,poster,An event-shape-engineering method to study charge separation in heavy-ion collisions,"Wang, Gang",UCLA,USA,"Recent measurements of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC have indicated charge-separation signals perpendicular to the reaction plane, and have been related to the chiral magnetic effect (CME) (see a review in Ref [1]). The discovery of this phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions will signify simultaneously three important physics ingredients: the strongest magnetic field ever made by mankind, the chirality imbalance caused by vacuum transition, and the chiral symmetry restoration in the deconfined nuclear matter. However, the correlation signal is contaminated with the background driven by the elliptic flow ($v_2$) of the collision system [2], and an effective approach is needed to remove the flow background from the correlation. 

In this talk, we will disclose a few shortcomings of a previous attempt of the event shape engineering (ESE) based on the ""event-by-event $v_2$"" [3]. We will further present a novel ESE technique [4] utilizing the magnitude of the flow vector to select spherical events in heavy-ion collisions, which leaves the charge separation measurements free of flow contributions. The simplified Monte Carlo simulations and a multi-phase transport model (AMPT) are employed to develop the ESE scheme to reveal the true CME signals from the experimental observation. Caveats regarding artificial effects and extreme conditions in this method will also be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,"""Classicalization"" of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma","Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"Recently there has been rapid progress in understanding in-medium dynamics of a quarkonium based on the framework of open quantum system [1-5]. The stochastic potential model [5] introduces thermal fluctuations on Debye screened potential and hence incorporates wave function decoherence. This model however lacks quantum dissipation, which has so far limited its application to early times and has prevented comparison with experimental measurements. In this contribution, we present two strategies that overcome this limitation:

1. quantum-classical matching
by investigating the localization properties of wave function and in turn of the reduced density matrix, we show, how, at intermediate time scales, one can switch from the quantum dynamics of the stochastic potential model to the classical dynamics of a Langevin equation. It involves matching the Wigner quasi-probability function of the former to the phase space distribution function of the latter. The validity of this matching procedure is discussed.

2. quantum state diffusion
by directly implementing the quantum state diffusion formalism [6] for the Lindblad master equation [1] of a quarkonium, i.e. mapping the Lindblad master equation to a non-linear stochastic Schrödinger equation (NLSSE) for the wave function. This for the first time provides a direct link between QCD and phenomenological models based on non-linear Schrödinger equations. By numerically solving the corresponding NLSSE, we can capture quantum dissipation and thus the thermalization of quarkonia in a quantum mechanical manner. For simplicity, we discuss this formalism for a single heavy quark in the QGP.

Poster Session,poster,Angular correlations between heavy and light jet-particles as a means to study in-medium heavy-quark energy loss,"Rohrmoser, Martin",Jan-Kochanowski University Kielce,Unknown,"Energetic heavy quarks passing through the hot and dense medium of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), represented by the resulting mesons, are viewed as a suitable probe for the interactions inside of the QGP,  in particular the mechanisms of energy loss, as they are less likely to thermalize within the medium and are mostly created at early stages of the medium evolution.
However, models of both, purely collisional energy loss as well as combinations of collisional and radiative energy loss are equally successful for reproducing the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ [1]. In an attempt to discriminate between the two different energy-loss mechanisms,an alternative observable, the angular correlations between two mesons were investigated. Azimuthal correlations between pairs of heavy mesons, like $D$-$\bar{D}$ pairs, allow for distinguishing the energy-loss scenarios [2]. 

We continue these studies by investigating the angular correlations between pairs of heavy and light mesons ($D$ and $\pi$), originating from a heavy quark jet. This is motivated by the fact that the emitted gluon in radiative collisions hadronizes and these hadrons are correlated to the emitting heavy quark.   

We created a Monte-Carlo code for the parton splitting in the vacuum together with an effective medium model. This program represents a consistent framework to study the influences of either collisional or radiative processes on parton propagation, and the resulting two-particle correlations. In order to learn at which stages of their space-time evolution jets are affected the most by interactions with the medium we studied contributions to angular correlations from different jet topologies.

Poster Session,poster,"Spin-offs from the rapid, volume hadronization of QGP applied at other scales for transitions in extreme hot and dense matter","Csernai, Laszlo Pal",University of Bergen,Unknown,"By now there is ample experimental and theoretical evidence that in high energy heavy ion reactions the Quark Gluon Plasma hadronizes in a very rapid transition, where most of the hadronization hypersurface or layer has a time-like normal. Thus the neighboring points of this surface are not causally connected to each other, and so collective pressure driven instabilities cannot develop.  This process is naturally described by relativistic fluid dynamics.

Rapid, simultaneous phase transitions or ignition in most of the volume of the material are important and vital problems in many fields of research and technology. Present laser and nano technology make radiation dominated, relativistic, rapid events possible at larger scales. This enables experimental and theoretical studies of rapid, volume transitions and phase transitions for extreme hot and dense matter.

One example for pico second, laser pulse induced, simultaneous ignition for pellet fusion is presented. Methods taken from nano-plasmonics, will be shown to enable us to achieve this simultaneous ignition, with moderate compression and enhanced light absorption. Consequently, mechanical, pressure driven Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, preventing stable volume ignition up to now, will not have time to develop and whole volume ignition can be achieved.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Laszlo Pal', 'last_name': 'Csernai', 'fullName': 'Csernai, Laszlo Pal', 'id': '3557460', 'affiliation': 'University of Bergen', 'emailHash': '6981303b0517d0022eb69d0802383fe6', 'db_id': 3557460, 'person_id': 3638075}"

Poster Session,poster,Initial Energy-Momentum Conservation and its Role in Particle Emission in A+A Collisions,"Davis, Nikolaos",Polish Academy of Sciences (PL),Unknown,"Our presentation will be based on our recent paper [1].

We construct a new, simple model of the heavy ion collision, local in the impact parameter plane. This model can be regarded as a new realization of the ``fire-streak'' approach, originally applied to studies of lower energy nucleus-nucleus reactions.

Starting from local energy and momentum conservation, we provide a full description of the centrality dependence of pion rapidity spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=17.3$ GeV. In particular we also explain the broadening of this distribution when going from central to peripheral collisions.

The results of our calculations are compared to SPS experimental data. We discuss the resulting implications on the role of energy and momentum conservation for the successive stages of the A+A collision, and for the dynamics of subsequent particle production.

A specific space-time picture emerges, where the longitudinal evolution of the system strongly depends on the position in the impact parameter (${b_x}$, ${b_y}$) plane. In non-central collisions we predict the existence of ``streams'' of excited matter moving very close to the spectator system in configuration $(x,y,z)$ space.

This picture is consistent with our earlier findings on the longitudinal evolution of the system as deduced from electromagnetic effects on charged pion directed flow [2], and can provide an explanation for specific low-$p_T$ phenomena seen in the fragmentation region of Pb+Pb collisions which we also address in this talk. We present our conclusions on the link between the initial stage of the A+A collision and the final state observables connected to strong and electromagnetic phenomena.

Poster Session,poster,The thermodynamics of a geometrically confined small system,"Kolbe, Isobel",University of Cape Town (ZA),Unknown,"The emergence of evidence for collectivity and strangeness enhancement in small colliding systems has raised urgent questions surrounding the apparent absence of energy loss among the observables that are traditionally attributed to the presence of a Quark Gluon Plasma in heavy ion collisions.  However, theoretical difficulties abound in the calculation of any measure of the energy loss, resulting in methods that were highly successful in the heavy ion regime coming up empty handed in the small system arena.  We present a novel approach, generalizing standard thermal field theory and thermodynamic techniques, to probe the thermodynamic behavior of a small system.  We consider first a single free scalar field theory that is geometrically confined.  We investigate the partition function along with the usual thermodynamic quantities, as well as the thermodynamic stability and statistical fluctuations of such a system.

In the color string percolation phenomenology the interactions between the strings occur in the initial stage of the collisions. This frame-work naturally predicts the reduction in the charged particle multiplicity and the enhancement of the transverse momentum with respect to the value expected from the number of independent strings. The initial temperature and  energy density are obtained from the data via the color reduction factor $F(\xi)$ and the associated string density parameter $\xi$. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio($\eta/s$), trace anomaly($\Delta$) ,the squared speed of sound ($C_{S}^{2}$), entropy density, bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio($\zeta/s$) are extracted using Color String Percolation Model (CSPM) for STAR data at various RHIC energies from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV. Results are in agreement with the lattice QCD calculations for (2+1) flavour.  The initial temperatures obtained by CSPM are compared with various hadronization and chemical freeze-out temperatures.

Deformation parameters $\beta$ are then introduced to describe non-spherical nuclei using an expansion in spherical harmonics $R_{0}(1+\beta_2Y^0_2+\beta_4Y^0_4)$. But when a nucleus is non-spherical, the $R_{0}$ and $a$ inferred from electron scattering experiments that integrate over all nuclear orientations cannot be used directly as the parameters in the Woods-Saxon distribution. In addition, the $\beta_2$ values typically derived from the reduced electric quadrupole transition probability B(E2)$\uparrow$ are not directly related to the ones used in the spherical harmonic expansion. 

In this talk, I present a method to calculate the $R_0$, $a$, and $\beta_2$ values that when used in a Woods-Saxon distribution, will give results consistent with electron scattering data, and then tabulate such parameters for nuclear species recently used in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, including U, Xe, Ru and Zr. The calculations of the second and third harmonic participant eccentricity ($\varepsilon$) with the new and old parameters are also presented and compared.

Charm quarks are one of the probes that has been extensively used to elucidate the properties of the QGP. They are dominantly produced at the initial stage of the collisions and experience the whole evolution of the system. 

While most of the charm-hadron measurements in heavy-ion collisions are currently limited to mesons, charm-baryon measurements could provide unique insights into hadronisation processes from the QGP. The baryon-to-meson ratio is expected to be enhanced if charm quarks hadronise via recombination with the surrounding light quarks in the QGP. Moreover, in such a recombination picture, the baryon-to-meson ratio could further be enhanced in the presence of diquark bound states in the QGP. Thus, the measurements of charm baryons could shed light on an unexplored aspect of the QGP. 
 
The production of charm baryons has been studied in pp and p-Pb collisions with the ALICE detector. The measurement in Pb--Pb collisions also became possible with the significantly improved statistics of LHC Run-2 compared to LHC Run-1.

Poster Session,poster,Contrasting freezeout schemes in large versus small systems,"Mohanty, Bedangadas",National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN),India,"Freezeout in relativistic collisions occurs as a result of competition between interaction of the fireball constituents and fireball expansion. The magnitude of interaction of the fireball constituents is expected to go down as we go from nucleus-nucleus (A-A) to proton-nucleus (p-A) to proton-proton (pp) collisions which should show up in the thermal model fits of the hadron yields. However, on the contrary, it has been found that within the unified freezeout scheme (1CFO), the fits to hadron yields are insensitive to system size. In this talk we extend the 1CFO scheme to multiple freezeout with early freezeout of strangeness (2CFO) and analyse the system size dependence of the freezeout scheme. We find unlike 1CFO that is blind to system size, 2CFO fits clearly distinguish between large and small system sizes.

We discuss the freezeout conditions in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC energies by analysing the data on hadron yields and transverse momentum spectra. We have studied three different schemes of freezeout, i) 1CFO, ii) strange hadrons freeze out along with non-strange with an additional strangeness undersaturation factor $\gamma_{S}$ which accounts for the non-equilibrium production of strangeness (1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$), and iii) 2CFO. A comparison of the fit to data suggests that different freezeout schemes are preferred for different collision systems. For small systems (pp and p--Pb) and peripheral Pb--Pb, data prefer 1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$ where $\gamma_{S}$ starts from ~0.8 for pp and reaches close to unity for central p-Pb and peripheral Pb-Pb. For Pb-Pb, 2CFO describes data better than 1CFO and 1CFO+$\gamma_{S}$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Bedangadas', 'last_name': 'Mohanty', 'fullName': 'Mohanty, Bedangadas', 'id': '3564082', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Science  Education and Research (IN)', 'emailHash': 'c29d717a3abe3e9c9082324579e1f8fe', 'db_id': 3564082, 'person_id': 3642323}"
Poster Session,poster,The Silicon Tracking System of the CBM experiment at FAIR,"Heuser, Johann",GSI - Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung GmbH (DE),Germany,"In the CBM experiment at FAIR, the Silicon Tracking System is the central detector for charged-particle identification and momentum measurement. Its key performance requirements are (a) pile-up free track measurement in collision rates between 0.1 and 10 MHz, (b) momentum resolution in a 1 Tm dipole magnetic field of better than 2%, and (c) capabilities for the identification of particle decays, e.g. such with strangeness content. 

The STS comprises 8 tracking stations equipped with double-sided silicon microstrip sensors. Two million channels are read out with self-triggering electronics, matching the data streaming and on-line event analysis concept applied throughout the experiment. The detector’s functional building block is a module consisting of a sensor, microcables and two front-end electronics boards. The modules are mounted on carbon fiber support ladders and further to mechanical frames. The microstrip sensors provide double-sided segmentation at a strip pitch of 58 $\mu$m and 7.5 degree stereo angle, have integrated AC signal coupling and second-metal routing lines. Ultra-thin microcables with up to 60 cm length transfer the sensor signals to the electronics located at the periphery of the detector. The custom-developed 128-channel read-out ASIC “STS-XYTER” has a self-triggering architecture that delivers time and amplitude information per channel. The detector will be operated at below −5 $^\circ$C within a thermal enclosure of about 2 m$^3$ volume so that the sensors’ leakage currents are kept low and the detector remains operational up to an integrated particle fluence of 10$^{14}$ n/cm$^{2}$ (1 MeV equivalent). The front-end, data aggregation and powering electronics will dissipate about 40 kW which is planned to be taken out of the system with a bi-phase CO$_2$ evaporative cooling.

Poster Session,poster,Kinetic equations and anisotropic hydrodynamics for quark and gluon fluids,"Maksymiuk, Ewa",Jan Kochanowski University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamics is one of the fundamental tools used to interpret the data measured in heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and the LHC. Despite the success of second order viscous hydrodynamics in reproducing physical observables, there exist still theoretical problems that may question validity of this approach for description of heavy-ion collisions. The main source of the problems are large gradients and fast longitudinal expansion which produce very large anisotropic pressure corrections to local equilibrium. One way to avoid this problem is the use of anisotropic hydrodynamics, a framework where large pressure corrections are taken into accound already in the leading order of the hydrodynamic expansion [1-4].

We have recently extended the anisotropic hydrodynamics description to the case of a non-conformal mixture of quark and gluon fluids studied in a one-dimensional and boost-invariant setup with quantum statistics effects included. We compared the predictions of the coupled kinetic equations treated in the relaxation time approximation with anisotropic hydrodynamics results, founding a very good agreement [5]. 

Our numerical results also illustrate how a non-equlibrium mixture approaches hydrodynamic regime described by the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate forms of the kinetic coefficients. The numerical studies of the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse pressures show, to a good approximation, that it depends on the ratio of the relaxation and proper times only. This behaviour is connected with the existence of an attractor for conformal systems [6].

The jet quenching effect is included via the medium-modified fragmentation functions based on the higher-twist energy loss formalism [3]. The evolution of the bulk medium is simulated by a (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic model which has been tuned to describe the soft hadron production at RHIC and the LHC [4].
A global $\chi^2$ fit is performed for both single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ with the experimental data taken from ALICE, CMS, PHENIX and STAR Collaborations, and the jet transport coefficient $\hat q_0$ is quantitatively extracted for central A+A collisions at both RHIC and the LHC energies. Our results show that $\hat q_0$ extracted from dihadron suppression is consistent with single hadron suppression. We obtain, for energetic quarks, $\hat q_{0}\approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ GeV$^2$/fm in central Au+Au collisions at RHIC, while $\hat q_{0}\approx 1.8 \pm 0.5$ GeV$^2$/fm in central Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. Using the $\hat q_0$ values extracted from central A+A collisions, we obtain good description of the experimental data on single hadron $R_{AA}$ and dihadron $I_{AA}$ in non-central A+A collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 0.2 and 2.76 TeV. We also predict dihadron $I_{AA}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV using the $\hat{q}_0$ value extracted from single hadron $R_{AA}$.

Different effective theories for the description of charmonium production exist, like the Color Singlet Model, the Color Evaporation Model or the non-relativistic QCD approach. However, none of them describes the production cross-sections and the polarization simultaneously. The correlations of J$/\psi$ mesons and hadrons can provide constraints on the color-singlet or color-octet nature of the pre-resonant charmonium state by measuring the amount of hadronic activity in the vicinity of the J$/\psi$.

They are produced at all stages of the collision without significant final-state interactions. Moreover, thermal radiation from the medium, both during the partonic and the hadronic phase, can be investigated through its internal conversion to e+e- pairs. In the intermediate mass region (1.2 – 2.8 GeV/c2), the measurement of thermal dileptons from the QGP is nevertheless challenging due to the dominant contribution from simultaneous semileptonic decays of correlated open heavy-flavour hadrons. The continuum yield in this mass region is sensitive to the energy loss of charm and beauty quarks in the QGP and further medium effects on the heavy-flavour hadron production. In order to understand the resulting modifications of the dielectron spectrum in heavy-ion collisions, a good understanding of the relevance of the various heavy-quark production mechanisms in proton-proton collisions is mandatory.

In this poster, the latest dielectron invariant-mass spectrum measured with ALICE in pp collisions at √s = 13 TeV is used to study the charm production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA event generator.

Determining spectral functions is subject of many calculations, in lattice QCD as well as in perturbation theory.
We compare continuum extrapolated lattice results [1] to a perturbatively determined spectral function obtained by interpolating between vacuum asymptotics at high frequencies and resummed thermal effects around the threshold [2]. Modest differences are observed, which may originate from non-perturbative mass shifts and renormalization factors. However, in the pseudoscalar channel no resonance peaks are needed for describing the quenched lattice data for charmonium at and above $T \sim  1.1T_c$. In the bottomonium case a good description of the lattice data is obtained with a spectral function containing a single thermally broadened resonance peak at $T$ up to $\sim 1.5T_c$.
The knowledge gained from the pseudoscalar channel is used to improve the studies in the vector channel [3]. In addition to information on the in-medium modification of charmonium and bottomonium bound states, this allows for continuum estimates on the temperature and quark mass dependence of heavy quark diffusion coefficients.

This is known as the ``direct photon puzzle"". We investigate the effect of initial conditions on the production and elliptic flow of photons from relativistic heavy ion collisions in detail.


It is well known that the inclusion of fluctuations in the hydrodynamic initial condition explains the experimental data on hadronic spectra and elliptic flow better compared to a smooth initial condition and it also increases the production and $v_2$ of photons significantly. In the same spirit, we consider another realistic constraint; initial state nucleon shadowing in the Monte-Carlo Glauber model and investigate the effect of shadowed initial condition on the production and elliptic flow of thermal photons at RHIC and LHC collision conditions [1].

In addition, we calculated the $p_T$ spectra and elliptic flow of thermal photons for two different orientations of fully overlapping uranium nuclei at 193A GeV at RHIC using a hydrodynamic model [2]. We see that the elliptic flow from body-body collisions of uranium nuclei is large and comparable to the photon $v_2$ obtained from mid-central collisions of gold nuclei at 200A GeV. We show that the photon results from fully overlapping U+U collisions are complementary to the results from Au+Au collisions at RHIC.

We quantitatively compare the strongly-coupled QGP predictions for AA collisions to the weakly-coupled QGP predictions of Nahrgang et al. 

When restricted to leading order production processes, we predict similar angular correlations for open heavy flavour pairs in a strongly coupled plasma and a weakly coupled plasma, but with an order of magnitude difference in the low momentum momentum correlations. We find that the difference in momentum correlations from the AdS model compared to the pQCD model is, surprisingly, due to tighter momentum correlations in the AdS model than the pQCD model.

When initialised at next-to-leading order (aMC@NLO matched to Herwig++), we observe significant additional broadening of azimuthal correlations.  However, the momentum correlations remain even when NLO production mechanisms are included. Thus, our conclusion for differences in momentum correlations with leading order production processes should carry over to next-to-leading order production processes once comparable predictions for a weakly-coupled QGP emerge. 

We then show quantitative agreement between all measured high momentum open heavy flavour observables in AA collisions at RHIC & LHC and predictions from this new NLO production plus AdS energy loss model using a recent AdS derivation for the spectrum of momentum fluctuations.

Poster Session,poster,Jet modification by MPI and determining the characteristic jet size based on multiplicity dependent jet-shape analysis,"Vertesi, Robert",Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HU),Unknown,"High multiplicity events of small colliding systems at high c.m.s. energies show similar collective features as those observed in events
of heavy ion collisions with comparable multiplicities, such as long-range near-side correlations and v_n coefficients [1,2]. Whether this behaviour may be attributed to the presence of a deconfined state in small systems is an open question.

Recent analyses of pp and p-Pb collisions also show an universal enhancement of heavy-flavour particles [3], that is usually attributed to multiple parton interactions (MPI) and higher gluon radiation associated with short distance production processes [4,5]. While we cannot expect to be able to apply hard probes on the medium created in the collisions of small systems, phenomena like MPI or Color reconnection (CR) may cause a modification of the jet shapes that can in principle be experimentally accessible.

We have carried out extensive studies using Monte Carlo event generators. We give predictions for multiplicity-dependent jet structures, and propose a way to validate the presence and extent of effects such as MPI or Color Reconnection, based on the detection of non-trivial jet shape modification in high multiplicity events. We also propose a definition of a characteristic jet size measure that is independent of multiplicity [6].

Studies of heavy-flavour production in different centrality intervals can provide information on the dependence of CNM effects on the collision geometry and on the density of final-state particles. In addition, these allow us to study the interplay between the hard and soft processes in heavy-flavour production. In this contribution, we will present the $p_{T}$-differential cross-section of heavy-flavour decay electrons for different centrality intervals in p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV at mid-rapidity ($|\eta| <$ 0.8). The Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was used to identify the electrons in 2 $< p_{T} <$ 8 GeV/c and the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal) was used to extend the $p_{T}$ range up to 16 GeV/c. The nuclear modification factor, $Q_{pPb}$, ratio of transverse momentum spectra in p-Pb collisions and the corresponding cross section in pp collisions scaled by the nuclear overlap function, and the central-to-peripheral ratio $Q_{cp}$, ratio of transverse momentum spectra measured at central collisions to that from peripheral collisions, scaled by the corresponding nuclear overlap functions, will be presented for different centrality intervals of p-Pb events.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sudipan', 'last_name': 'De', 'fullName': 'De, Sudipan', 'id': '3513793', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Indore (IITI)', 'emailHash': '3bb34873415b04f98259ab0931a71542', 'db_id': 3513793, 'person_id': 3639898}"
Poster Session,poster,Event-by-event cumulants of partonic eccentricity and flow harmonic,"Ma, Long",Fudan University,Unknown,"We report a comprehensive study on the initial-state partonic eccentricity fluctuation and final-state anisotropic flow fluctuation in Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV using a multiphase transport model. Event-by-event eccentricity and flow anisotropy are characterized by multi-particle cumulants up to fourth order harmonic. Experimental results of azimuthal anisotropy fluctuation by means of cumulants are well reproduced by our model simulation [1]. Results of initial eccentricity and their fluctuations in terms of second-, fourth- and sixth-order cumulants for different order of harmonics as function of centrality,  transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) and pseudorapidity ($\eta$) are presented. The ratio of the eccentricities $\varepsilon\left\{4\right\}/\varepsilon\left\{2\right\}$ and $\varepsilon\left\{6\right\}/\varepsilon\left\{4\right\}$ are shown in comparison with the ratio of the corresponding flow harmonics. The conversion coefficients $v_{n}$/$\varepsilon_{n}$ (n=2,3,4) are explored based on the cumulant method. We show that higher harmonic $v_{n}$/$\varepsilon_{n}$ (n$>=$3) show similar trend but exhibit quantitative difference in comparison with $v_{2}$/$\varepsilon_{2}$ [2]. We investigate further the role of partonic and hadronic scatterings in anisotropic flow and flow fluctuation development. We show that collisions between initial active partons are directly responsible for not only the development of anisotropic flow but also flow fluctuation [3]. Relevant physics on the connections between higher-order cumulant eccentricities and flow harmonics is discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Magnetohydrodynamics with chiral anomaly: phases of collective excitations and instabilities,"Hattori, Koichi",Fudan University,Unknown,"We study the relativistic hydrodynamics with chiral anomaly and dynamical electromagnetic fields. This theory is called the chiral magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [1]. It is a framework that can evolve the system of QGP fluids and electromagnetic fields consistently, and it will play an important role in quantifying anomaly-induced effects in heavy-ion collisions. We formulate the chiral MHD as a low-energy effective theory based on a derivative expansion. We demonstrate that the modification of ordinary MHD due to chiral anomaly can be obtained from the second law of thermodynamics and is tied to the chiral magnetic effect with the universal coefficient. When the chirality imbalance exceeds a critical value, a new type of collective gapless excitation emerges, as a result of the interplay among magnetic field, flow velocity, and chiral anomaly; we call it the chiral  magnetohelical mode (CMHM). These modes carry definite magnetic and fluid helicities and either grow exponentially or dissipate in time, depending on the relative sign between their helicity and axial charge density. The presence of exponentially growing CMHM indicates a hydrodynamic instability.

Poster Session,poster,Thermodynamic and magnetic properties of hot QCD medium in a strong magnetic field,"Rath, Subhalaxmi",Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Unknown,"We have investigated the equation of state of a hot QCD medium with two light flavors in a strong magnetic field, which may be produced in the non-central events at RHIC and LHC. We have cal- culated the thermodynamic observables up to one-loop perturbatively in real-time formalism, where the quark contribution is largely affected by the magnetic field whereas the gluon component is least affected except for the softening of the screening mass. For example, the presence of a strong magnetic field makes the pressure of hot QCD medium larger and the dependence of pressure on the tempera- ture becomes less steep compared to the dependence of the pressure on the magnetic field. This can be understood from the dominant scale of thermal medium in the strong magnetic field, being the magnetic field, in the same way that the temperature dominates in a thermal medium in the absence of magnetic field. the dependence of pressure on the temperature becomes less steep. Consistent with the above observations, the entropy density is found to decrease with the temperature in the presence of a strong magnetic field which is again consistent with the fact that the strong magnetic field restricts the dynamics of quarks to two dimensions, hence the phase-space becomes squeezed resulting in the reduction of the number of microstates. Due to the aforesaid reasoning, the energy density of hot QCD medium is seen to decrease, hence the speed of sound of thermal is increased due to the presence of a strong magnetic field. These findings could have implications on the expansion of the medium produced at RHIC and LHC and influence the outcomes of various signatures. Finally we determine the magnetization and susceptibility for several temperatures in strong magnetic field, where the paramagnetic response increases with the temperature. Hence a portion of QGP may be squeezed perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field, which is quantified by the enhancement of elliptic flow.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Subhalaxmi', 'last_name': 'Rath', 'fullName': 'Rath, Subhalaxmi', 'id': '3707716', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee', 'emailHash': '90ee5b06e2e0bb99092a860562344800', 'db_id': 3707716, 'person_id': 3635439}"

It provides measurements of neutral mesons, two particle correlations, and jets in p+p, p-Pb and (partially) in Pb-Pb collisions. The direct photon measurement requires a new electromagnetic calorimeter with extremely high granularity. We will discuss the physics case of this proposed detector. The design principle of the high-resolution silicon-tungsten (Si-W) sandwich calorimeter will be presented and results from the ongoing R&D program with test beams will be shown. The detector will be instrumented with Si-pad sensors with analog readout and on a Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) based digital pixel readout.

Poster Session,poster,Landau damping in a strong magnetic field: Dissociation of quarkonia,"Rath, Subhalaxmi",Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee,Unknown,"We have investigated the properties of quarkonia in a hot QCD medium in the presence of strong magnetic field, which may be produced in the non-central events at RHIC and LHC and then studied its quasi-free dissociation due to the Landau-damping mechanism. Using the Schwinger propagator in the lowest Landau level, we have calculated the real and imaginary parts of the retarded gluon self-energy in a strong magnetic field using the real-time formalism. The aforesaid self-energy computes the resummed retarded and symmetric propagators whose static limits embody the effects of the medium into the real and imaginary part of both short- and long-distance components of $Q \bar Q$ interaction in vacuum. In strong magnetic field, the large-distance interaction is affected more than the shot-distance interaction, as a result, the real part of potential becomes more attractive. On the other hand, due to the dimensional reduction, the magnitude of imaginary part becomes smaller compared to a thermal medium in absence of strong magnetic field. We have found that the average radii of the quarkonia get reduced and become more strongly bound in presence of the strong
magnetic field. However, further increase of the magnetic field results in the decrease of binding energies. In the presence of strong magnetic field, the decay width of the resonances becomes smaller and the dependence on magnetic field becomes less steep than the dependence on temperature. Having discussed the properties of quarkonia, we have estimated the magnetic field beyond which
the resonances go to the continuum due to Landau damping, where we found that $\psi^\prime$ and $\chi_c$ in a hot QCD medium are dissociated relatively at larger magnetic fields, $eB= 4~m_\pi^2$ and $5~m_\pi^2$, compared to the dissociation by the color screening mechanism only. However, the $J/\psi$ is dissociated at very large magnetic field.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Subhalaxmi', 'last_name': 'Rath', 'fullName': 'Rath, Subhalaxmi', 'id': '3727585', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee', 'emailHash': '90ee5b06e2e0bb99092a860562344800', 'db_id': 3727585, 'person_id': 3635439}"

The results show that, with the longitudinally accelerating hydrodynamic expansion, the temperature gradient becomes larger due to the acceleration effect, meanwhile the viscous corrections will decelerate the longitudinal hydrodynamic expansion and make the cooling rate smaller.

This has important implications in the search for the Disoriented Chiral Condensates (DCC) conjectured to be formed in relativistic collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Dimuon Invariant Mass Spectra with the Muon Telescope Detector at STAR in p+p collisions at 200 GeV,"Brandenburg, James",Rice University,USA,"Dileptons ($l^+l^-$) are produced throughout all stages of heavy-ion collisions (HIC) through various production mechanisms. Since leptons have a small interaction cross section with the strongly interacting medium, they carry information about the medium from the early stages to the final state of the system. For this reason, dileptons provide an essential tool for studying the properties of the strongly interacting medium produced in HICs. Dileptons produced within the intermediate mass region (IMR, $M_\phi$<$M_{ll}$<$M_{J/\psi}$) result predominantly from the decay of correlated charm but also arise from thermal radiation of the hot and dense medium. The inverse slope parameter of the thermally produced dileptons in the IMR provides a measurement of the medium's temperature at early times which is free from radial flow effects [1]. The installation of the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) at STAR allows a measurement of the dimuon ($\mu^+\mu^-$) production over a large invariant mass range for the first time. Data has been collected with the full MTD from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and from p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. These two datasets allow for new opportunities to measure the dimuon invariant mass spectra at STAR.

As a first step towards measuring the thermal dimuon invariant mass spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, this talk will present the baseline dimuon measurement in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV. The dimuon invariant mass spectra in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV will be presented and the viability of measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,Non-linear dynamical systems approach to out of equilibrium hydrodynamical attractors: the Gubser flow case,"Cruz Camacho, Nikolás",Universidad Nacional de Colombia,Unknown,"Attractors for relativistic hydrodynamics have been found recently in weakly and strong coupling physical systems. The existence of hydrodynamical attractor provides a firm theoretical foundation for the applicability of hydrodynamics in far-from-equilibrium conditions. In this work we explain how the non-equilibrium attractors of systems undergoing Gubser flow within relativistic kinetic theory can be established on general grounds by using methods of nonlinear dynamical systems. Namely we find the fixed points and investigate the structure of flow diagrams of the evolution equations and characterize the basin of attraction using a Lyapunov function near the stable fixed point. We obtain the attractors of anisotropic hydrodynamics, Israel-Stewart (IS) and transient fluid (DNMR) theories and show that they are indeed non-planar and the basin of attraction is essentially three dimensional. The attractors of each hydrodynamical model are compared with the one obtained from the exact Gubser solution of the Boltzmann equation within the relaxation time approximation. We observe that the anisotropic hydrodynamics is able to match up to high numerical accuracy the attractor of the exact solution while the second order hydrodynamical theories fail to describe it. Our findings indicate that anisotropic hydrodynamics is an effective theory for far-from-equilibrium fluid dynamics which resums the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds numbers to all orders.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Nikolás', 'last_name': 'Cruz Camacho', 'fullName': 'Cruz Camacho, Nikolás', 'id': '3530972', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Nacional de Colombia', 'emailHash': 'bb97c12b591efa783957e7f14b01681a', 'db_id': 3530972, 'person_id': 3644420}"
Poster Session,poster,Direct flow of heavy mesons as unique probes of the initial Electro-Magnetic fields in Ultra-Relativistic Heavy Ion collisions,"Coci, Gabriele",INFN - National Institute for Nuclear Physics,UK,"In Ultra-relativistic Heavy-Ion Collision (HIC) very strong initial electro-magnetic (e.m.) fields are created inducing a vorticity in the reaction plane that is odd under charge exchange, allowing to distinguish it from the large vorticity of the bulk matter due to the initial angular momentum conservation. Conjointly thanks to its mass, $M_{b,c}>>\Lambda_{QCD}$, there should be no mixing with the chiral magnetic dynamics. We show that such e.m. field entails a transverse motion of both heavy quarks (HQ), bottom and charm, resulting in a splitting of directed flow $v_1$ of D(B) and anti-D (anti-B)  of few percent, i.e. much larger compared to pions. The considerable effect is due to a combination of several favorable conditions for HQ, mainly: (i) unlike light quarks formation time scale of HQ is comparable to the time scale when the e.m. field attains its maximum value and (ii) the kinetic relaxation time is similar to the QGP lifetime, which allows the HQ to retain the initial kick picked up from the electromagnetic field in the transverse direction. Hence HQs provide very crucial and independent information on the strength of the electro-magnetic field produced in HIC,
moreover the effect comes out of a delicate balance between the magnetic and the electric field supplying a novel probe of the electric conductivity of the QGP. Moreover, the impact of a Langevin vs a Boltzmann transport of HQ in the medium is also investigated.

Poster Session,poster,Equation of state for QCD with a critical point from the 3D Ising Model,"Parotto, Paolo",University of Houston,Unknown,"Currently, one of the major investigations in heavy ion physics concerns the search for the QCD high temperature critical
point associated with the chiral transition, which has stimulated tremendous effort from both theory and experiment. On the theory side, a major role in the analysis of experimental results is played by hydrodynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions, which need as an input an equation of state driving the evolution of the system. Current knowledge of the finite-density QCD equation of state from first principles is limited to a Taylor expansion in the baryonic chemical potential around $\mu_B = 0$.

By means of a scaling form for the equation of state of the 3D Ising model and a non-universal, parametrized map to QCD coordinates, we construct an equation of state matching state of the art first principle Lattice QCD calculations and including the correct critical behavior, which can be readily employed in hydrodynamical simulations of heavy ion collisions at finite density, covering most of the BES range at RHIC.

The parametrized form of this equation of state can be exploited to constrain the value of the parameters themselves by imposing thermodynamic consistency and through comparison of predictions obtained by simulations with experimental results.
