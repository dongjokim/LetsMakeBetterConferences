A pair-normalized two-particle covariance versus the rapidity
of the two particles, called R$_2$, was originally studied
[1] in ISR and FNAL data in the 1970's and has recently seen
renewed interest [2] to study the dynamics of heavy-ion
collisions in the longitudinal direction. These rapidity
correlations can be decomposed onto a basis set of Legendre
polynomials with prefactors $\langle$a$_{\rm mn}$$\rangle$,
which can be considered the rapidity analog of the
decomposition of azimuthal anisotropies into a basis set of
cosine functions with prefactors v$_{\rm n}$. The
$\langle$a$_{\rm mn}$$\rangle$ values have been suggested [2]
to be sensitive to the number of sources, baryon stopping,
viscosities, and criticality. The rapidity correlations have
been measured by the STAR collaboration as a function of the
centrality and beam energy in the range of 7.7 to 200 GeV.
The experimental results and comparisons to those from the
UrQMD model will be presented.

Parallel Session 8.1: Baryon-Rich QCD Matter and Astrophysics (III),parallel,Evidence for chiral symmetry restoration in heavy-ion collisions,"Moreau, Pierre",Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies,Unknown,"We study the effect of the chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) on heavy-ion collisions observables in the energy range $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3--20\,GeV within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. The PHSD includes the deconfinement phase transition as well as essential aspects of CSR in the dense and hot hadronic medium, which are incorporated in the Schwinger mechanism for particle production. Our systematic studies show that chiral symmetry restoration plays a crucial role in the description of heavy-ion collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3--20\,GeV, realizing an increase of the hadronic particle production in the strangeness sector with respect to the non-strange one. We identify particle abundances and rapidity spectra to be suitable probes in order to extract information about CSR, while transverse mass spectra are less sensitive. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the ""horn"" structure in the excitation function of the $K^+/\pi^+$ ratio: the CSR in the hadronic phase produces the steep increase of this particle ratio up to $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \approx$ 7 GeV, while the drop at higher energies is associated to the appearance of a deconfined partonic medium. Furthermore, the appearance/disappearance of the 'horn' structure is investigated as a function of the system size and collision centrality. We additionally present an analysis of strangeness production in the ($T,\mu_B$)-plane (as extracted from the PHSD for central Au+Au collisions) and discuss the perspectives to identify a possible critical point in the phase diagram.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Pierre', 'last_name': 'Moreau', 'fullName': 'Moreau, Pierre', 'id': '2778641', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies', 'emailHash': '57f5780389ab1be49d72f019b18e8f59', 'db_id': 2778641, 'person_id': 2973804}"

We have investigated higher moments of e-by-e proton distributions using data from our high-statistics measurement of Au+Au collisions. Systematic effects have been studied making use of our GEANT-based detector response simulation which includes sophisticated digitizers for all detector systems in use.

Insight as to the nature of these fluctuations is obtained by calculating from $p(v_{n})$ the cumulants and moments associated with the event shape. Flow harmonic distributions in PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are measured for the integrated $p_{T}$ ($\eta$) range $0.3 \leq p_{T} \leq 3.0$ GeV/c ($|\eta| \leq 2.4$) using the CMS detector at the LHC. The event-shape engineering technique is used to further divide events into classes based on their ellipticity, which allows for the study of detailed correlations between initial-shape components that would otherwise be destroyed by event-averaging techniques. Hydrodynamic models predict the $2^{nd}$ order participant eccentricity distributions to have a negative skewness, which is identified as the main source of non-Gaussian behavior in $p(v_{2})$ distributions. The skewness for $p(v_{2})$ distributions is measured with high precision over the full centrality range. In addition, $p(v_{n})$ distributions are fitted with an elliptic power law parameterization to infer the proportionality constant between the flow harmonics and the initial-state geometry. Furthermore, correlations between different order harmonics are measured using the event-shape selection technique.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'James Robert', 'last_name': 'Castle', 'fullName': 'Castle, James Robert', 'id': '2814682', 'affiliation': 'The University of Kansas (US)', 'emailHash': 'a3254d472d04a06fede015644ce1941f', 'db_id': 2814682, 'person_id': 3007704}"

The polarization can be calculated assuming that the spin degrees of freedom are at local thermodynamical equilibrium at the hadronization stage. The hydrodynamical quantity steering the polarization is the thermal vorticity, that is minus the antisymmetric part of the gradient of four-temperature field $\beta^\mu=u^\mu/T$ [1].

Based on this mechanism, we present a calculation of the global polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in relativistic Au-Au collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan range $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7.7 - 200$ GeV with a 3+1 dimensional cascade + viscous hydro + cascade model, vHLLE+UrQMD [2]. Within this model, the mean polarization of $\Lambda$ in the out-of-plane direction is predicted to decrease rapidly with collision energy from a top value of about 2% at the lowest energy examined. We explore the connection between the polarization signal and thermal vorticity and estimate the feed-down contribution to $\Lambda$ polarization due to the decay of higher mass hyperons.

The difference \Delta \gamma = \gamma(like- sign)-\gamma(un-like sign) measures charge separation across the reaction plane, a predicted signal of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [1]. Although charge separation has been observed, it has been argued that the measured separation can also be explained by elliptic flow related backgrounds [2]. To disentangle the two effects, we use triggered samples of U+U and Au+Au collisions for which predictions from flow related backgrounds and magnetic field dependent effects diverge. Our analysis includes events selected based on asymmetries in spectators observed in the Zero-Degree-Calorimeters which preferentially select body-tip events [3]. We find that for cases where known, flow driven, background expectations differ from CME related predictions driven by the correlation of the magnetic field and the flow; the data are in better accord with the CME related prediction.

Whether QGP is also formed in small collision systems is presently under intense investigation. To study the origin of the collective behavior in small systems, the PHENIX experiment performed a series of geometry-controlled experiments using $p$+Al, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^3$He+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV.

In equilibrium, correlations diverge at the critical point leading to large event-by-event fluctuations in conserved quantities. For expanding systems like in heavy-ion collisions it is important to study the dynamical formation of long-range correlations in the critical region. The critical mode is the diffusive baryon current and can be described fluid dynamically. We include the propagation of fluctuations in the fluid dynamical equations. Using an equation of state with a critical point we study the evolution of critical fluctuations, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, in static systems to compare to known analytical results. The requirements for the emergence of non-Gaussian correlations from underlying white noise will be explored. We investigate both relativistic and nonrelativistic fluid dynamics.

produced at different stages of the collision and escape the medium unaffected. In pp collisions, 
the direct photon yield at high transverse momentum ($p_T$) are produced in hard scattering (prompt photons), 
 but also in the fragmentation of high $p_T$ partons. Their measurement provides a direct test of pQCD and can constrain the parton distribution functions. 
The access to the prompt photon production can be achieved experimentally with isolation techniques.

In heavy-ion collisions, the high $p_T$ component provides information on the initial parton dynamics and nuclear parton densities in nuclei, whereas 
the low momentum component (below $p_T <$5 GeV/c) of the direct photon production is dominated by thermal radiation from the hot and dense matter created, 
carrying information on its space-time evolution, collective flow and temperature.

The presence of a temperature-dependent bulk viscosity in the hydrodynamical evolution of the medium modifies the development of the hydronynamic momentum anisotropy differently in the high- and low-temperature regions. Thus, anisotropic flow coefficients of hadronic observables, which are emitted predominantly from low temperatures, are affected differently by bulk viscosity than electromagnetic probes which are radiated during the entire evolution. Starting from the IP-Glasma initial conditions [1,2], we study how thermal dilepton production gets modified owing to the presence of bulk viscosity at RHIC and LHC energies. With calculations at different collision energies we can draw more robust conclusions regarding the role of bulk viscosity in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Dilepton radiation from the dilute phase of the medium will be included for the first time using the Boltzmann-transport model SMASH [3] and compared to previous hydrodynamic approaches to ascertain whether these modifications may be observable in experimental data.

Quarks and gluons from incoming nuclei collide to produce partons at high momenta early in the collision.  By fragmenting into collimated sprays of hadrons, these partons form ""jets"".  Within the framework of perturbative QCD, jet production is well understood in pp collisions and can be used as a baseline reference for comparing to heavy ion collision systems when studying jet quenching.  One approach is to measure the azimuthal correlations of a trigger and the associated hadrons in the event.  For a jet trigger, these are known as jet-hadron correlations, while a hadron trigger leads to di-hadron correlations.  Such correlations are examined in transverse momentum bins of the trigger, transverse momentum bins of the associated hadrons, and studied as a function of collision centrality.  The correlations are expected to be sensitive to broadening and softening of the associated recoil jet due to jet quenching.  We present azimuthal jet-hadron correlations constructed from a trigger R=0.2 full (charged + neutral) jet, which is correlated with charged hadrons.  In an effort to control the path length of the recoil jet and reduce the impact of the background, jets are required to pass a leading constituent cut and are reconstructed using only high energy and momentum constituents.  We present the current status of this analysis in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV.  To further probe the path length dependence, we will also present Pb-Pb jets relative to the event plane, which include a highly robust and precise background subtraction method to remove the complex, flow dominated, heavy ion background.

In particular, extensive jet energy loss measurements have allowed unique opportunity for probing the “internal working” of such plasma and for understanding the nonperturbative dynamics that underlies the confinement transition at $T_c$. Significant progress has been made recently in constructing such a microscopic model — the semi-quark-gluon-monopole plasma (sQGMP) which integrates two essential elements of confinements, i.e. the Polyakov-loop suppression of quarks/gluons and emergent magnetic monopoles. Based on sQGMP, a new comprehensive framework for simulating jet energy loss has been developed, called CUJET3.0, which (1) treats the radiative energy loss in the DGLV formalism; (2) convolutes energy loss with a bulk evolution of heavy ion collisions from the state-of-the-art viscous hydrodynamic simulation (VISHNU hydro) that is data-validated; (3) constrains the thermodynamic contents of the plasma constituents by current lattice QCD data.

Parallel Session 4.4: Open Heavy Flavors (I),parallel,"Heavy vs. light flavor jet quenching, flow, thermalization and $D$-hadron correlations from RHIC to the LHC energies","Cao, Shanshan",Wayne State University,Unknown,"Hard hadrons, including heavy flavor and high $p_\mathrm{T}$ light flavor hadrons, serve as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) coupled to (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic model that simultaneously describes the temporal evolution of both heavy and light partons inside QGP on the same footing [1]. Both quasi-elastic [2] and inelastic [3,4,5] processes are included in our LBT model for parton energy loss in the de-confined QCD medium. On the freeze-out hypersurface, the hadronization of hard partons into their corresponding color neutral bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid fragmentation plus jet-thermal coalescence model [1,6].

Within this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering leads to linear increase of parton energy loss with respect to time and is important at early time, inelastic scattering results in quadratic increase of energy loss at early time but then saturates to linear increase and dominates parton evolution at later time. With proper incorporation of the temperature and energy dependences of parton-medium interaction, we simultaneously describe heavy ($D$ and $B$ mesons) and light flavor (charged hadron) suppression, 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows for all centrality bins and all collision energies as observed from RHIC to the LHC experiments. The temperature and momentum dependences of the jet transport coefficient ($\hat{q}$) extracted from our model to data comparison are consistent with the range previously constrained by the JET Collaboration. While $\Delta E_g > \Delta E_q > \Delta E_c > \Delta E_b$ holds in our framework, we show that such flavor hierarchy in $R_\mathrm{AA}$ at hadron level can be modified due to the combinatory effect of initial momentum spectra, parton energy loss and fragmentation functions.

We also perform a systematic comparison for the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows of heavy vs. light flavor hadrons, from which the degree of heavy quark thermalization inside QGP is investigated as functions of centrality and colliding energy. $D$-hadron and $e$-hadron correlation functions are studied for the first time as well and shown to be a good observable to quantify not only the thermalization degree of heavy quarks [7] but also the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles. Comparisons between our predictions and future measurements are expected to provide better insights of the interaction dynamics between hard partons and the QGP.

Parallel Session 4.4: Open Heavy Flavors (I),parallel,Centrality dependence of D0 elliptic and triangular flow in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at STAR,"He, Liang",Purdue University,USA,"Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are predominantly produced through initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions and, as such, they experience the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium created in such collisions. Therefore, they can provide important insights into the properties of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP).  For instance, the azimuthal anisotropy of charm quarks with respect to the reaction plane over a broad momentum range can provide information on the degree of thermalization for heavy flavor quarks in the medium and the bulk properties of the system. Specifically, at low transverse momenta we can examine the bulk properties in the strongly-coupled regime. Furthermore, several models have predicted that fluctuations in the initial conditions, together with strong charm-medium interactions, could lead to a finite triangular flow $v_3$ for the $D^0$ meson, providing another handle to study the early stages of the collisions.
 
 In this talk we present the measurement of azimuthal anisotropy of $D^0$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}= 200$ GeV with the Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. Compared to previously reported $D^0$ $v_2$ in minimum-bias collisions, the significance of the new result is improved by a factor of 2-4, allowing the study of the transverse momentum and centrality dependence of $D^0$ elliptic and triangular flow for the first time. The results will be compared with the measurements of other particle species and a series of model calculations.

Parallel Session 4.3: Quarkonia (II),parallel,Bottomonium measurements at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions with ALICE at LHC,"Lardeux, Antoine",University of Oslo (NO),NO,"The production of heavy quarkonia is an important observable to study the
properties of the nuclear matter created in high-energy heavy-ion
collisions. Lattice QCD calculations predict a phase transition of the
hadronic matter to a deconfined medium of quarks and gluons, the Quark
Gluon Plasma (QGP), at extreme energy densities. The bottomonium bound
states while passing through the deconfined medium are dissociated
into quark-antiquark pair due to color screening. This is visible in data
as a suppression of $\Upsilon$ resonances with respect to the
proton-proton results scaled by the number of binary
collisions. However, the cold nuclear matter effects can also lead to the
suppression of $\Upsilon$ resonances in heavy-ion collisions. Cold
nuclear effects are studied in p-Pb collisions since the QGP is not
expected to be produced. ALICE measures the bottomonium down to zero
transverse momentum via the dimuon decay channel at forward rapidity
($2.5 \lt y \lt 4$).

In this presentation, the final results on the nuclear modification factor of $\Upsilon$
measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV

Parallel Session 8.3: Collective Dynamics (III),parallel,The onset of fluid-dynamical behavior in relativistic kinetic theory,"Noronha, Jorge",University of Sao Paulo,United States,"Relativistic hydrodynamics is the main theoretical framework used to describe the quark-gluon plasma produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and, possibly, proton-proton and proton-ion collisions. Therefore, understanding the physical assumptions that enter in the hydrodynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions is crucial. Especially, it is essential to elucidate the reason behind the onset of fluid-dynamical behavior at the very early stages of the collisions. 

In this contribution, we investigate the onset of hydrodynamic behavior for a gas of massless particles undergoing Bjorken expansion, a proxy for the dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. In this scheme, we demonstrate that the Chapman-Enskog series, i.e., a gradient expansion in the hydrodynamic variables, has zero radius of convergence and cannot be used to consistently derive relativistic hydrodynamics [1]. On the other hand, we show that the method of moments, traditionally employed to derive Israel and Stewart's theory of hydrodynamics, converges and can be used to systematically improve the applicability of fluid-dynamical theories [2]. We further discuss what are the extended theories of hydrodynamics that emerge from higher-order truncations of the method of moments and how they can help in the description of heavy ion collisions.

Parallel Session 8.4: Open Heavy Flavors (III),parallel,Data-driven analysis of the temperature and momentum dependence of the heavy-quark transport coefficient,"Xu, Yingru",Duke University,USA,"Heavy quarks are considered as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultra-realistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the simultaneous description of the heavy meson nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ poses a significant challenge for most commonly used transport modes, especially those based on Langevin transport. We propose a generalized ansatz for the temperature and momentum dependence of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient and subsequently extract its functional form by calibrating against RHIC and LHC data utilizing a Bayesian model-to-data analysis. Using the extracted transport coefficient, our improved Langevin framework is able to simultaneously reproduce the measured $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at both RHIC and LHC energies.

The Bayesian analysis used to extract  the transport coefficient is set up as follows: a set of input parameters, in which the temperature and momentum dependence of the transport coefficient $D_s$ is encapsulated, are evaluated via an event-by-event heavy flavor transport model. In a (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical model describes the QCD medium, heavy quarks propagate according to an improved Langevin equation that incorporates both radiative and collisional energy loss. Hadronization of heavy quarks occurs via a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination. Those model outputs are used to train Gaussian process emulators that mimic the behavior the heavy quark transport model, and act as a fast surrogate of the transport model to interpolate across the full model parameter space. We then calibrate the model parameters on experimental data via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Bayes' Theorem. The final results of the analysis are the posterior probability distribution of all the model parameters that contain the high likelihood parameters range  in which the model describes the data optimally. We find that the transport coefficient $D_s$ has a minimum value around critical temperature, and is comparable to lattice QCD calculation. A non-trivial momentum dependence of $D_s$ is observed as well.  With the extracted functional form of the transport coefficients, the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy quarks in different centralities at 200 GeV AuAu collisions and 2.76/5.02 TeV PbPb collisions are calculated, and observed to be consistent with the experimental data.

Parallel Session 6.3: New Theoretical Developments (II),parallel,Path-Integral Monte Carlo Study of the Magnetic Component of Quark-Gluon Plasma At and Above $T_c$,"Ramamurti, Adith",Stony Brook University,USA,"Magnetic monopoles are suggested to play an important role in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) near the deconfinement temperature. Lattice studies show that near the confinement temperature, $T_c$, quark-gluon plasma (QGP) contains both electric and magnetic quasiparticles. Further studies of the behavior of these quasiparticles at and above $T_c$, such as those by Liao and Shuryak (2006-2009) and D’Elia and D’Alessandro (2007-2009), found that the magnetic component of QGP forms a liquid, and that the magnetic monopoles form a Bose-Einstein condensate as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, creating the dual-superconductor proposed as a mechanism for confinement. 

In this work, we conduct path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of magnetic monopoles, in order to study their behavior at temperatures at and above the confinement temperature. First, we sought to replicate the lattice results of D’Alessandro, D’Elia, and Shuryak (2009) through the study of the permutation cycles of one- and two-component plasmas of bosons interacting with a Coulomb potential. We found for the two-component plasma, as they did on the lattice, that as the system approaches $T_c$ from above the exponential suppression of permutation cycles of these bosons decreases before disappearing at $T_c$, indicating a phase transition. 

We then study thermodynamics and physical distribution of magnetic monopoles, using the densities and coupling strengths given by D’Alessandro and D’Elia (2007); and Liao and Shuryak (2009). At low temperatures, in addition to the formation of the condensate, we see formation of “droplets” of the magnetic charges at strong coupling. This suggesting that the monopoles are indeed forming a liquid, as seen by Liao and Shuryak in their classical molecular dynamics simulations. At low temperatures and large couplings, there are also signs of crystallization in this system, an interesting analog to systems of extremely high density, such as helium white dwarf stars. We then simulate the system at higher temperatures — along lower densities and strong coupling — and see the breakup of these drops of monopole “liquid.” Finally, we draw conclusions about the contribution of the monopoles to the overall thermodynamics of the QGP above the confinement temperature.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adith', 'last_name': 'Ramamurti', 'fullName': 'Ramamurti, Adith', 'id': '2799719', 'affiliation': 'Stony Brook University', 'emailHash': '2e2b932272a26edcbc06148da41217ec', 'db_id': 2799719, 'person_id': 2993766}"

We find the values of $B_2$ for anti-deuteron are systematically lower than those for deuterons. The difference in $B_2$ for deuteron and anti-deuteron indicate the residual isospin brought in at the beginning of the collisions.

The vortical nature of the system is expected to polarize emitted hadrons along the direction of system angular momentum. $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ hyperons, which reveal their polarization through decay topology, should be polarized similarly. The vorticity of the fluid is an important parameter for the generation of a Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE).

These same collisions are also characterized by dynamic magnetic fields with magnitude as large as $10^{14}$ Tesla. A splitting between $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ polarization may signal a magnetic coupling and provide a quantitative estimate of the field strength at freeze out. Details of the magnetic field and its evolution are of particular interest to other novel phenomena, e.g. the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME).

The STAR Collaboration has made the first observation of global hyperon polarization in non-central Au+Au collisions at Beam Energy Scan energies.

It is well known that
higher harmonics of azimuthal angle distribution, for example, can be attributed to
initial fluctuations of transverse profile from event to event.
In this presentation, we focus on thermal fluctuations
during hydrodynamic evolution of the system in the intermediate stage
of the reactions.
These fluctuations are also known as hydrodynamic fluctuations and 
are indispensable for the system to be stabilized 
in a thermodynamic sense through
fluctuation-dissipation theorem [1].

We employ a cutting-edge integrated dynamical model [2,3]
which combines fully (3+1)-dimensional relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics
with Monte-Carlo version of the Glauber model as an 
event-by-event initialization model of the hydrodynamic fields
and the hadronic cascade model in the late stage.
By using this model, we first adjust initial parameters
and transport coefficeints to reproduce $dN_{\mathrm{ch}}/d\eta$
and centrality dependence of integrated $v_{2}$
in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy.
We then analyze the event-plane correlations
between two different rapidity regions $r_{n}(\eta^a, \eta^b)$
and between two different $p_{T}$ regions $r_{n}(p^a_{\rm{T}},p^b_{\rm{T}})$.
By switching on and off hydrodynamic fluctuations,
we quantify the effect of them
on these observables.

In this talk, we present the first measurement on the non-linear hydrodynamic response of higher harmonic flow using multi-particle correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{\rm NN}}}=$ 2.76 and 5.02 TeV.
These measurements can be used to study the relation between the linear and non-linear response in different centrality classes.
In addition, the measured centrality dependence of symmetry plane correlations between lower- and higher- order flow vectors can be adequately explained by contributions from non-linear response.
Furthermore, the results of newly proposed non-linear response coefficients $\chi_{m,n}$ [1] will be presented. The measurements provide crucial information on freeze-out conditions, which are poorly constrained by previous flow measurements. 
Last but not least, the symmetric cumulants, which probe the correlations between different order flow harmonics, are studied in different kinematic regions ($p_{\rm T}$ and $\eta$) and include higher harmonics $v_{n}$ ($n>3$). The derived approximate relation between symmetric cumulants and the symmetry plane correlations are investigated, and this allows a direct test of hydrodynamic behavior of the created matter.

These thermal widths are large, eg O(20-100 MeV) for the Upsilon, and cause in-medium suppression of the states at temperatures below their traditionally defined disassociation temperatures. In order to apply the newly developed understanding to phenomenology, however, one must make detailed 3+1d dissipative hydrodynamical models of the plasma including the effects of finite shear viscosity.

Comparing particle production between Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions to pp collisions as a reference over a wide pseudorapidity range provides insight into the longitudinal (and low-x) nature of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions.

Studies from pp collisions at various energies show that the width of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density distribution increases with increasing collision energy. This underlines the importance of investigating the system size dependence of the particle production at the same collision energy. The approximate linearity versus η that is found in the ratio of the pseudorapidity density distributions of the different systems indicates a coherent particle production throughout the longitudinal extent of the collision region, while the dependence on pseudorapidity may reflect underlying mechanisms, for example colour fluctuations or Colour-Glass Condensate initial conditions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christian Holm', 'last_name': 'Christensen', 'fullName': 'Christensen, Christian Holm', 'id': '2823348', 'affiliation': 'University of Copenhagen (DK)', 'emailHash': '9180d1bb8333e5d537b236cf12a9662a', 'db_id': 2823348, 'person_id': 3015913}"

We argue that contemporary jet substructure techniques facilitate a more direct measurement of the radiative mechanism caused by medium interactions. As a concrete example, we focus on jet grooming using the “soft drop” procedure that singles out the two leading jet substructures with largest angular separation inside an energetic jet. The interplay between hard, quasi-collinear vacuum or medium-induced radiation within the reconstructed cone and soft, large-angle emissions that are responsible for out-of-cone energy flow is studied.

But there are interesting and potentially important corrections to the usual treatment of the LPM effect that arise from situations where the formation times of two consecutive splittings overlap each other, and various attempts have been made over the years to account for these effects.  I will summarize recent research on computing the effect of overlapping formation times, while avoiding soft-bremsstrahlung assumptions that have been used in some of the (very interesting) theoretical work of the last few years.

When a pair of high-energy jets created in hard collisions traverse the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, they become de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening [2, 3]. For the first time, we employ the systematical resummation formalism and establish a baseline calculation to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data in $pp$ and peripheral $AA$ collisions where the medium effect is negligible. We demonstrate that the medium effects, especially the so-called jet quenching parameter $\hat q$, can be extracted from the angular de-correlations observed in $AA$ collisions. A global $\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data renders the best fit $\langle \hat q L\rangle_{\textrm{tot}} \sim 14 \textrm{GeV}^2$ for a quark jet at RHIC top energy, with $L$ the typical traversed medium length. Our approach [1] stands as a new and complimentary method for the extraction of the jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ as compared to the JET Collaboration effort [4]. Further experimental and theoretical efforts along the direction of this work shall significantly advance the quantitative understanding of transverse momentum broadening and help us acquire unprecedented knowledge of jet quenching parameter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.

Comparison of these two jet shapes in Pb-Pb and pp collisions highlights the role of coherence effects on jet quenching, in the presence of the QGP medium, by separating two-pronged jets from the rest of the jet population. Coherence effects relate to the ability of the medium to resolve a jet's substructure, which has an impact on the energy loss magnitude and mechanism of the traversing jet. In both collision systems charged jets are found with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm, a resolution parameter of R = 0.4 and a constituent cut off of 0.15 GeV.

While color screening in a plasma phase is expected to play a role, there are numerous other possible suppression mechanisms that do not require deconfinement, as well as effects on the heavy quark initial state in the nucleus which can also play a role.  To study these effects, the PHENIX collaboration has used the flexibility of the RHIC accelerator complex to observe the evolution of open heavy flavor and quarkonia dynamics as both the projectile and target nuclei size are varied.  Open heavy flavor in small collision systems can serve as the baseline for interpreting quarkonia production in the nuclear environment, and comparisons of the $\psi(2S)$ with the $J/\psi$ show that in rapidity regions with relatively high hadron density, the larger $2S$ state is preferentially more suppressed than the more tightly bound $J/\psi$.

Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is the macroscopic manifestation of the fundamental chiral anomaly in a many-body system of chiral fermions, and emerges as anomalous transport current in hydrodynamic framework. Experimental observation of CME is of great interest and significant efforts have been made to look for signals of CME in heavy ion collisions. Encouraging evidence of CME-induced charge separation has been reported from both RHIC and LHC, albeit with ambiguity due to potential background contributions. Crucial for addressing such issue, is need of quantitative predictions of CME signal with sophisticated modeling tool. 


In this talk we report a recently developed Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework, which simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the data-validated VISHNew bulk hydro evolution. With realistic initial conditions and magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively consistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV AuAu collisions. We further develop the event-by-event AVFD simulations that directly compute CME-induced two-particle correlations as well as the non-CME background. Finally we report predictions for the upcoming isobaric (RuRu v.s.

leading hadrons at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at both RHIC and LHC collision energies. We focus on the
established reduction in the interaction measure $\hat{q}/T^{3}$ between RHIC and LHC, as discovered by the JET

that the reduction is not caused by a temperature dependence in the ratio of $\hat{q}/T^{3}$ but rather by an energy
dependence of $\hat{q}$.
We study this dependence by introducing an $x$ dependence in the distribution function that is integrated to obtain

We demonstrate here that key elements of the Kibble-Zurek framework of non-equilibrium phase transitions can be employed to describe the dynamics of these critical cumulants [2]. Our results suggest that observables sensitive to critical dynamics in heavy-ion collisions should be expressible as universal scaling functions, thereby providing powerful model independent guidance in searches for the QCD critical point.

Parallel Session 4.1: Baryon-Rich QCD Matter and Astrophysics (I),parallel,Revealing the collision energy dependence of $\eta/s$ in RHIC-BES Au+Au collisions using Bayesian statistics,"Auvinen, Jussi",Duke University,USA,"Significant progress has been made in the past few years in determining QGP properties, such as the temperature dependence of shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\eta/s$. However, $\eta/s$ might depend also on the baryochemical potential $\mu_B$, as has been hinted at in a recent beam energy scan study [1].

It is generally difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the extracted values of QGP properties, as the computational models used in the analysis typically have numerous interconnected parameters. We utilize novel optimization techniques based on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to calibrate the computational model to data. The end result of such an analysis is a conditional probability distribution, which provides a set of data-calibrated parameter values with a full uncertainty quantification. Gaussian process emulators are also used in the analysis to overcome its significant computational expense and predict model results for all needed input parameter combinations. These statistical methods have already been applied with great success to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [2].

In this presentation we investigate the $\mu_B$ dependence of $\eta/s$, with collision energy as the control parameter, by performing a Bayesian analysis on RHIC beam energy scan data, applying the same UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model as in [1], to verify if the reported differences between the energies remain significant even when uncertainties are included. We determine the probability distributions for the model parameters for Au+Au collisions at $19.6$, $39$, and $62.4$ GeV; the results indicate that while the uncertainty on the optimal value of $\eta/s$ does increase at lower collision energies, the probability for a large value of the ratio is much higher at $19.6$ GeV with the median value $0.24$, compared to $62.4$ GeV with median value $0.07$ [3]. Moreover, we also find that multi-strange hadron yields provide significant constraints on the switching condition between the hydrodynamic evolution and the hadron transport afterburner and thus are essential for a proper model-to-data comparison [4].

The results from the NA49 experiment at CERN have been used to claim that the onset of deconfinement occurs at √(s_NN )  ≈7 GeV, the low end of the BES range. Additionally, studies of several interesting observables during the BES, including v1 of protons and lambdas, v2 of identified hadrons, and net-proton higher moments, show interesting behavior below 20 GeV and could suggest a transition to a hadron dominated regime. Data from energies lower than 7 GeV could help determine whether these behaviors are indicative of phase transitions or criticality. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES-II with the same detector to lower energies than is feasible at RHIC with colliding beams. 

In this talk we present results from STAR’s first dedicated fixed-target test run conducted in 2015 with Au + Au collisions at √(s_NN )=4.5 GeV. Direct flow of protons, elliptic flow of identified hadrons, HBT radii, as well as pion, proton, kaon, K_S^{0}, and lambda spectra are compared with previous results from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS).

The multiplicities, together with those for non-strange hadrons, have been analyzed in the context of statistical hadronization models. Overall, a good fit is obtained if an additional parameter ($R_c$) is used to account for canonical strangeness suppression. We find that about 30 % of observed $K^-$ are produced through Phi-decay.

When coupled with an external magnetic field, such P- and CP-odd domains will generate electric currents along the magnetic field --- a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC released data of charge-dependent azimuthal-angle correlators with features consistent with the CME expectation. However, the experimental observable is contaminated with significant background contributions from elliptic-flow-driven effects, which makes the interpretation of the data ambiguous. In this Letter, we show that the collisions of isobaric nuclei, $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr, provide an ideal tool to disentangle the CME signal from the background effects.

Parallel Session 2.1: Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium (II),parallel,Characterization of the initial state and QGP medium from a combined Bayesian analysis of RHIC and LHC data,"Bernhard, Jonah",Duke University,Unknown,"A primary goal of heavy-ion physics is the measurement of the fundamental properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the characterization of the initial state that leads to its formation.
While these properties—such as temperature-dependent transport coefficients—are not directly measurable, they may be quantitatively estimated through computational models of heavy-ion collisions.
The properties of interest are input as model parameters and tuned so that a variety of simulated observables optimally fit corresponding experimental data.

Previous studies [1, 2] have applied Bayesian parameter estimation methods to simultaneously constrain a variety of QGP properties, including the temperature dependence of the specific shear viscosity $(\eta/s)(T)$ and the scaling of initial entropy deposition, and confirmed a finite QGP bulk viscosity $\zeta/s > 0$.
However, this work also demonstrated that more precise estimates of the shear and bulk viscosities could be achieved by including experimental data from multiple beam energies and improving several aspects of the computational model.

In this work, we utilize Bayesian methodology to estimate the parameters of an updated heavy-ion collision model [3] including the parametric initial conditions TRENTO [4], a pre-equilibrium free streaming phase [5], viscous 2+1D hydrodynamics, improved Cooper-Frye particlization, and UrQMD.
We calibrate the model to multiplicity, transverse momentum, and flow data from multiple RHIC and LHC beam energies, report the latest quantitative estimates of the temperature dependence of QGP shear and bulk viscosities as well as initial state properties, and validate model predictions of higher-order observables such as flow correlations.

Parallel Session 8.3: Collective Dynamics (III),parallel,Optimized fluid dynamics for heavy ion collisions,"Bazow, Dennis",The Ohio State University,Unknown,"Local momentum anisotropies are large in the early stages of the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, due to the extreme difference in the initial longitudinal and transverse expansion rates. In such situations, fluid dynamics derived from an expansion around an isotropic local equilibrium state is bound to break down. Instead, we resum the effects of the slowest nonhydrodynamic degree of freedom (associated with the deviation from momentum isotropy) and include it at leading order, defining a local anisotropic quasi-equilibrium state, thereby treating the longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy nonperturbatively. Perturbative transport equations are then derived to deal with the remaining residual momentum anisotropies [1]. This procedure yields a complete transient effective theory called viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics [1,2]. 

The anisotropic hydrodynamic approach, especially after perturbative inclusion all residual viscous terms, has been shown to dramatically outperform viscous hydrodynamics in several simplified situations for which exact solutions exist but which share with realistic expansion scenarios the problem of large dissipative currents [1,3,4]. We will discuss the present status of applying viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics to the phenomenological description of the quark-gluon plasma in realistic expansion scenarios. To satisfy the high-performance needs of the JETSCAPE Collaboration, standard [5] and anisotropic viscous hydrodynamics algorithms were implemented on graphical processing units (GPU), leading to a 100-fold speed-up. Results from these accelerated 3+1-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulations for event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions will be compared between the standard and anisotropic frameworks and with experimental data.

D 93, 114025 (2016)  and arXiv:1606.09019, based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic one-particle distribution function. In order to close the conservation laws, it is needed to choose an additional moment of the Boltzmann equation. This is achieved by selecting the relaxation equation for the longitudinal pressure with a suitable Landau matching condition. As a result one obtains two coupled differential equations for the energy density and the longitudinal pressure which respect the $SO(3)_q \otimes SO(1,1) \otimes Z_2$ symmetry of the Gubser flow in the deSitter space. These equations are solved numerically and compared with the predictions of the recently found exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow.

Parallel Session 8.3: Collective Dynamics (III),parallel,Phenomenological constraints on the bulk viscosity of QCD,"Denicol, Gabriel",McGill University,Unknown,"While small at very high temperature, the bulk viscosity of quantum chromodynamics is expected to grow in the confinement region. Although its precise magnitude and temperature-dependence in the cross-over region is not fully understood, recent theoretical and phenomenological studies [1-5] provided evidence that the bulk viscosity can be sufficiently large to have measurable consequences on the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. In this work, a Bayesian statistical analysis is used to establish probabilistic constraints on the temperature-dependence of bulk viscosity using combined hadronic measurements from RHIC and the LHC. IP-Glasma initial conditions are used to provide realistic event-by-event fluctuations, which are understood to have an important interplay with bulk viscosity. The width of the peak of bulk viscosity, along with the position of the peak in the transition region, are investigated phenomenologically for the first time. A lower but wider peak than the parametrization used in [3-5] is found to be preferred. Constraints on the position of the peak are found to be limited, with tension observed between the values favoured by RHIC and LHC measurements. The relative effect of shear and bulk viscosities on hadronic observables, in particular momentum anisotropies, is investigated.

In addition to the single particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$, we study event-plane correlations, non-linear response coefficients $\chi_n$, and flow factorization breaking ratios $r_n$, which were presented for the first time in the IP-Glasma framework.  Furthermore, we investigate event shape engineering as well higher flow harmonics such as $v_5$, $v_6$, and $v_7$, which were recently measured at 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS collaboration. Taken together, these observables provide a wealth of insight into the collective behavior of the QGP and initial state fluctuations. These quantities shed light on flow correlations in different $p_{T}$ ranges, flow at fixed system size but different initial geometries, as well as the non-linear hydrodynamic response to the initial state energy anisotropy. By synthesizing this information we can gain further insight into the transport properties of the QGP as well as the fluctuation spectrum of the initial state.

We find that an apparent decrease of $v_3$ with pseudorapidity in traditional measurements is not, in fact, a dependence on $\eta$, which is negligible within the TPC acceptance, but instead is a dependence on relative pseudorapidity due to a lack of perfect correlation between $v_3$ at different rapidities.   We also observe short-range correlations, due to rapidity dependent fluctuations in the initial condition.  While the short-range correlation is slightly smaller in both magnitude and range, it serves as a demonstration that short-range correlations are not necessarily generated only by non-flow sources such as jets, but can have a significant contribution from purely hydrodynamic effects.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Matthew', 'last_name': 'Luzum', 'fullName': 'Luzum, Matthew', 'id': '2778693', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': '5adad411b956c5e4f34ef725af4a47a6', 'db_id': 2778693, 'person_id': 2973840}"

Detailed simulations demonstrate that the bottom-up results match on to relativistic viscous hydrodynamics on time scales of order 1 Fermi for realistic values of the coupling [3]. We explore the detailed implications of this scenario for photon production in the Glasma relative to the QGP [4]. In particular, we argue that the ""reheating” phase of the bottom-up scenario will lead to enhanced production rates for photons and may possibly generate the significant flow anisotropies essential for resolving the v2 puzzle. We report on first kinetic simulations of photon production in the expanding Glasma that will quantify our estimates and determine how brightly the Glasma shines relative to the QGP [5].

The dielectron continuum is extremely rich in physics sources: on top of ordinary Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, thermal black-body radiation is of particular interest as it carries information about the temperature of the hot and dense system created in such collisions. Dielectron invariant-mass distribution is furthermore sensitive to medium modifications of the spectral function of short-lived vector mesons that are linked to the potential restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperatures. Correlated electron pairs from semi-leptonic charm and beauty decays provide complementary information about the heavy-quark energy loss.

In this talk, we will present an extensive summary of the LHC Run-1 results in all three collisions systems: pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb, the former two providing crucial vacuum and cold-nuclear matter references for the latter. Furthermore, we will discuss the status of the ongoing Run-2 pp and Pb-Pb analyses with a focus on pp collisions collected with a trigger on high charged-particle multiplicities and conclude with an outlook for future measurements in Run-3 following the ALICE detector upgrades during the second long shutdown phase.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Oton', 'last_name': 'Vazquez Doce', 'fullName': 'Vazquez Doce, Oton', 'id': '2796073', 'affiliation': 'Technische Universitaet Muenchen (DE)', 'emailHash': 'bec604ada6b125ca8149e6fe41467e02', 'db_id': 2796073, 'person_id': 2990437}"

Event-by-event longitudinal fluctuations in the initial conditions are expected to result in a strong asymmetry in particle multiplicities at forward and backward (FB) rapidities. In this talk, FB multiplicity correlations are measured in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb  collisions, with a data-driven method utilized to separate long-range FB correlations (LRC) and short-range correlations (SRC). The magnitude of the LRC reveals a significant FB multiplicity asymmetry, quantified by its slope in pseudorapidity $a_1$, which decreases with increasing multiplicity and is similar in magnitude across the three collision systems. The measured correlation in $pp$ collisions is compared in detail with expectations from the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS-LHC models.  Both models significantly underpredict the measured $a_1$ values (by a factor of two), and PYTHIA 8 is found to significantly overpredict the magnitude of the SRC, even though both of these models were tuned to reproduce the total charged particle multiplicity distributions out to $N_{ch}$~120.  These findings imply that the measurement of FB multiplicity correlations provides supplementary constraints on multi-particle production mechanisms, including restricting the number of independent sources in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mingliang', 'last_name': 'Zhou', 'fullName': 'Zhou, Mingliang', 'id': '2816377', 'affiliation': 'State University of New York (US)', 'emailHash': '8b8acbdc0e759f4f31aa8ccfacd7b998', 'db_id': 2816377, 'person_id': 2973673}"

While the HBT radii modulations with respect to the second harmonic event plane reflect mostly the spatial geometry of the source, the third harmonic results are mostly defined by the system dynamics. Radii variations with respect to the third harmonic event plane unambiguously signal a collective expansion and anisotropy in the flow fields. Strong fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system lead to fluctuations in the anisotropic flow as well as the shape of the pion source at freeze-out. Event shape engineering (ESE) is a technique proposed to select events corresponding to a particular shape. Azimuthally differential HBT combined with ESE allows for a detailed analysis of the relation between initial geometry, anisotropic flow and the deformation of source shape.

In this talk, we present azimuthally differential pion femtoscopy with respect to second and third harmonic event planes as a function of the pion transverse momentum for different collision centralities. Our results on the dependence of the side-, out-, and long-radii on the pion emission angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane qualitatively agree with theoretical calculations, but the details show significant deviations. The final-state source eccentricity, estimated via side radius oscillations is found to be significantly smaller than the initial state source eccentricity. While the final-state source eccentricity for the second harmonic event plane remains positive in all centralities, the third harmonic event plane eccentricity becomes negative. All these results are compared to existing models. The effect of the selection of the events with high/low elliptic and/or triangular flow is also presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mohammad Ahmad', 'last_name': 'Saleh', 'fullName': 'Saleh, Mohammad Ahmad', 'id': '2823323', 'affiliation': 'Wayne State University (US)', 'emailHash': '5c8bc1ed648761272702d0b7eb391dd7', 'db_id': 2823323, 'person_id': 3015883}"

As a result of strong collective flow, the spatial distribution of local vorticity on the freeze-out hypersurface converts to Lambda spins with intrinsic azimuthal angle distribution and correlation at RHIC and LHC energy. The azimuthal correlation of the transverse spin is shown to have a cosine form plus an offset due to a circular structure of the transverse vorticity around the beam direction and global angular momentum in non-central collisions. The longitudinal spin correlation shows a structure of vortex-pairing in the transverse plane due to the convective flow of hot spots in the radial direction.

Systematic studies of the QCD matter from Bevalac to LHC energies have suggested that the highest density QCD matter can be reached around the AGS energies (sqrt(s_{NN})=~5-GeV) where a rich production of strange hadrons is expected.
 
The future heavy-ion program at J-PARC (J-PARC-HI) is focused to explore such a highest density QCD matter. The J-PARC-HI will accelerate ions up to Uranium with the cms energy of sqrt(s_{NN})=2-6.2-GeV at the beam rate up to 1.0e+11 ions per cycle, five orders of magnitude higher than that of AGS. We could reach as 8-10 times higher density as the normal nuclear matter with the Uranium ions. The heavy-ion acceleration scheme consists of a new linac and a booster as the injector, followed by the existing 3-GeV Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 50-GeV Main Ring (MR). The booster design is much advanced since last year by a new charge exchange injection scheme and multi-charge state acceptance.
 
Taking advantage of the very high intensity beam, we introduce new event selection quantities, such as strangity (strange hadron fraction) and baryonity (net baryons), on top of the conventional centrality variable, which would exclusively select high-density matter events. We will then primarily measure the probes that were not measured at AGS, namely, electromagnetic probes (photons and lepton pairs), higher-order flow of particles and the fluctuation of conserved charges such as net-baryons. We will also perform systematic measurement of conventional hadronic observables.
 
A large acceptance heavy-ion spectrometer based on a Toroidal magnet has been designed for the high density QCD matter study. We will show the updated acceleration scheme as well as the detector performance and expected physics result.

temperature hadronic phase to the quark-gluon plasma phase.

We use results from our $6^{th}$ order Taylor expansion of the QCD equation
of state to construct expansions for second and fourth order cumulants

can be calculated up to ${\cal O} (\mu_B^4)$ in the baryon chemical

out that the latter is inappropriate to describe equilibrium properties

For vanishingly small baryon chemical potential, we show that fourth
order cumulant ratios calculated in QCD start to deviate from hadron

the sixth order cumulants differ from HRG model calculations even earlier.
Even some second order cumulants like the correlations between net-baryon

Parallel Session 2.3: Electromagnetic Probes (II),parallel,Photon emission at hadronization: possible resolution to the direct photon puzzle,"Itakura, Kazunori",KEK,Japan,"We discuss photon emission at the stage of hadronization as a possible resolution to the direct-photon puzzle. In an ordinary plasma, it is well known that photon emission occurs when a plasma goes back to a normal state through recombination processes such as $e^- + p^+ \to H + \gamma$ for an electron-proton plasma. This is called the “radiative recombination”. A similar process should take place when a QGP hadronizes. For example, meson formation from a quark and an antiquark will be accompanied by photon emission $q + \bar q \to meson + \gamma$ to compensate the energy difference between the initial and final states. 

In order to compute the number of photons emitted at hadronization, we employ the “recombination model” developed by the Duke group. There, the number of produced hadrons is computed under the assumption that coalescence of valence (anti)quarks just occurs without emission of additional particles, which surely violates energy and entropy conservation. With the photon emission added in this coalescence process, however, energy and entropy can be made conserved. We reinterpret the production formula of hadrons in the original recombination model as that of artificial “resonant states” whose invariant masses are not necessarily equal to the masses of any physical hadrons. We further assume that the “resonant state” decays into a physical hadron and a photon. 

This “improved” recombination model has a potential to resolve the direct-photon puzzle: (1) a larger yield of photons since we add photon production at hadronization, which has been overlooked so far, and (2) radiated photons flow similarly as hadrons because photons are emitted in a collimated way with the resonant state's motion. Moreover, the pt distribution of emitted photons mimics thermal distribution whose effective temperature is essentially given by blue-shifted quark’s temperature and thus becomes much higher than critical temperature.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazunori', 'last_name': 'Itakura', 'fullName': 'Itakura, Kazunori', 'id': '2778728', 'affiliation': 'KEK', 'emailHash': '45ea746755071e8f8403b0ffcbb5e0f0', 'db_id': 2778728, 'person_id': 2973865}"

Operating FCC-hh with heavy-ion beams would provide Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 39 and 63 TeV, respectively. Current estimates indicate that a luminosity of about 30/nb could be integrated during a one-month Pb-Pb run, that is more than one order of magnitude above the maximum projections for the LHC. The FCC-hh beams could also be used for fixed-target collisions, either with beam extraction or gaseous target techniques.

The Quark-Gluon Plasma state produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 39 TeV is expected to have initial temperature and energy density substantially larger than at LHC energy, a stronger flow field and freeze-out volume twice as large. The larger temperature could entail novel features, like e.g. abundant in-medium production of charm quarks. The latter could determine an increase in the number of degrees of freedom of the QGP and provide a new tool to study its temperature evolution. New, rarer, hard probes would be available, like boosted top quarks, which could give access to the time-evolution of the medium opacity.

High-energy photon-photon interactions in ultraperipheral AA collisions will also enable the study of very rare processes such as light-by-light scattering and $\gamma\gamma\to W^+W^-$.

Detector design studies, focused on multipurpose pp experiments, and a survey of the possible technological solutions are ongoing and will be summarised as well in the presentation.

Abstract
The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment will be one of the major scientific pillars of the future Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt. The goal of the CBM research program is to explore the QCD phase diagram in the region of high baryon densities using high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. This includes the study of the equation-of-state of nuclear matter at neutron star core densities, and the search for the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions. The CBM detector is designed to measure rare diagnostic probes such as hadrons including multi-strange (anti-) hyperons, lepton pairs, and charmed particles with unprecedented precision and statistics. Most of these particles will be studied for the first time in the FAIR energy range. In order to achieve the required precision, the measurements will be performed at very high reaction rates of 1 to 10 MHz. This requires very fast and radiation-hard detectors, a novel data read-out and analysis concept based on free streaming front-end electronics, and a high-performance computing cluster for online event selection. The status of FAIR and the physics program of the proposed CBM experiment will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Peter', 'last_name': 'Senger', 'fullName': 'Senger, Peter', 'id': '2778747', 'affiliation': 'GSI', 'emailHash': '1c9159ef2347b38de9a3d99dc1eb037e', 'db_id': 2778747, 'person_id': 2973874}"

These correlations test the underlying QCD dynamics of the quark-gluon scattering that dominates at forward rapidity.

Measuring the cross section differentially in transverse momentum transfer makes it possible to determine the transverse density profile (via coherent diffraction) and density fluctuations (incoherent diffraction) of the target hadron. This knowledge about the geometric fluctuations of the proton is particularly important for understanding collective phenomena observed in proton-nucleus collisions.

We calculate coherent and incoherent diffractive vector meson production in photon-proton scattering at high energy.  We demonstrate that incoherent gamma-p scattering is sensitive to sub-nucleon scale fluctuations, and show that the effect of geometric fluctuations can be disentangled from saturation scale fluctuations.

The Bjorken-x (or energy) evolution of the fluctuations is studied by solving the JIMWLK evolution equation. In particular, we study the energy evolution of the diffractive cross section. This is particularly interesting, as the ALICE collaboration has recently observed the disappearance of the incoherent contribution to the diffractive cross section in ultraperipheral p+A collisions at high energies, which suggests that the proton gets smoother at small x.

The fluctuating proton, constrained by the HERA data, is then used as input for hydrodynamic calculations of azimuthal anisotropy coefficients in proton-nucleus collisions, which we show to be sensitive to initial state geometric fluctuations.

We extend the IP-Glasma model by consistently including JIMWLK rapidity evolution and compute event-by-event rapidity distributions of produced gluons and the early time energy momentum tensor as a function of space-time rapidity and transverse coordinates. We show how the effects of small-x evolution manifest themselves in longitudinal (rapidity) correlations of event-by-event multiplicities and transverse geometry and compare our results to various phenomenological models and experimental observations.

Parallel Session 2.1: Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium (II),parallel,Particle production in proton-nucleus collisions beyond leading order,"Iancu, Edmond",IPhT Saclay,France,"The study of particle production in proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions provides essential
information about high-density effects (like gluon saturation) in the nuclear wavefunction and offers a benchmark for the corresponding studies in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The cross-sections for particle production in $pA$ can in principle be computed within perturbative QCD, using the framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). However, recent efforts trying to extend such calculations beyond the leading-order (LO)
approximation met with an unexpected difficulty: the next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction for the hadron multiplicity suddenly turns negative at transverse momenta of the order of a few GeV, in a range where perturbation theory was expected to be reliable.
This problem triggered much interest and several studies over the last 5 years, but not satisfactory solution has emerged. 

In a recent publication [1], we have revisited the previous proposals for the CGC 
factorization at NLO and identified the source of the negativity problem: this is related
to the subtraction method used to separate LO from NLO contributions. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new factorization scheme which involves no such a subtraction: the relevant, LO or NLO, perturbative contributions are included once and only once. We have thus obtained a manifestly positive expression for the cross-section for hadron multiplicities in $pA$. On this occasion, we have also extended the resummation program that we recently proposed [2] for the BK and JIMWLK evolution equations to the calculation of cross-sections. Besides its phenomenological implications, this new factorization scheme should provide a better framework for computing particle production in QCD at high energy.

Parallel Session 6.2: Correlations and Fluctuations (I),parallel,Jet evolution in a dense medium: event-by-event fluctuations and multi-particle correlations,"Escobedo Espinosa, Miguel Ángel",University of Jyvaskyla,Unknown,"We study the gluon distribution produced via successive medium-induced branchings 
by an energetic jet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma. We show that
under suitable approximations, the jet evolution is a Markovian stochastic process, 
which is exactly solvable. For this process, we construct exact analytic solutions 
for all the n-point correlation functions describing the gluon distribution 
in the space of energy [1,2]. Using these results, we study the event-by-event distribution of the energy lost by the jet at large angles and of the multiplicities
of the soft particles which carry this energy. We find that the event-by-event fluctuations are huge: the standard deviation in the energy loss is parametrically as large as its mean value [1]. This has important consequences for the phenomenology
of di-jet asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC: it implies that the fluctuations in the branching process can contribute to the measured asymmetry on an equal footing with the geometry of the di-jet event (i.e. as the difference between the in-medium path lengths of the two jets). We compute the higher moments of the multiplicity distribution and identify a remarkable regularity known as Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling [2]. 

These predictions could be tested via event-by-event measurements of the di-jet asymmetry.

modification of the angular distribution of the energy within jets in 
heavy ion collisions, as partons within jet showers lose energy
and get kicked as they traverse the strongly coupled plasma
produced in the collision.  To describe 
the dynamics transverse to the jet axis,  we add 
the effects of transverse momentum broadening 
into our hybrid construction, introducing a parameter $K\equiv \hat q/T^3$
that governs its magnitude. We show that, because of the quenching
of the energy of partons within a jet, even when $K\neq 0$ the jets
that survive with some specified energy in the final state are narrower
than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this reason,
many standard observables are rather
insensitive to $K$.
We
propose a new differential jet shape ratio observable in which
the effects of transverse momentum broadening are apparent.
We also analyze the response of the medium to the passage
of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet
appears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After 
freezeout this wake becomes soft particles with a broad angular
distribution but with net momentum in the jet direction, meaning that
the wake contributes to what is reconstructed as a jet.  This effect must
therefore be included in any description of the angular structure
of the soft component of a jet.
We show that the particles coming from the response of the medium to the momentum
and energy deposited in it leads to a correlation between the momentum of soft particles
well separated from the jet in angle with the direction of the jet momentum, and find
qualitative but not quantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed
to extract such a correlation.
More generally, by confronting the results that we obtain upon introducing transverse momentum
broadening and the response of the medium to the jet 
with available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes for
understanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Krishna', 'last_name': 'Rajagopal', 'fullName': 'Rajagopal, Krishna', 'id': '2778918', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '2c68a5f0ec1dce250f21eee4b240232f', 'db_id': 2778918, 'person_id': 2974027}"
Parallel Session 6.4: Jets and High pT Hadrons (V),parallel,Effect of hydrodynamic response in QGP on full jet,"Tachibana, Yasuki",Central China Normal University,Unknown,"We study modification of full jet structures in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium including effect of the hydrodynamic medium response. The structures and energies of jets in heavy ion collisions are significantly modified by the processes involving strong interactions during the propagation through the QGP medium, i.e., collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening, and induced parton radiation. The energy and momentum are deposited into the QGP medium by jets via the collisional energy loss and the $p_T$-broadening due to the energy-momentum conservation. The QGP medium is supposed to respond hydrodynamically to the deposited energy and momentum and flows propagating with the jets are caused. Particles originating from the jet-induced flows are observed as a part of the jets in the actual experiments, and contribute to the modification of the full jet structures. Studying this contribution is not only important for the precise interpretation of the experimental data but also provides a novel opportunity to investigate the collective response of the QGP. 

We employ a full jet shower + QGP fluid model composed of transport equations for jet evolution and hydrodynamic equations with source terms for the QGP medium evolution. The transport equations describe the evolution of the three-dimensional momentum distributions of partons in the full jet [1]. In the transport equations, all the processes of the collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening and partonic splittings for all partons within the full showering jet are covered. The space-time evolution of the QGP medium is described by (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms [2]. The source terms transfer the deposited energy and momentum to the QGP fluid and are constructed with the evolving distributions of the partons in jets obtained as solutions of the transport equations. In this work, we study the shape and energy loss of the full jet in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC including the effect of the jet-induced flows. We find that the contribution of the particles originating from the jet-induced flows significantly modifies the full jet shape, and especially dominates it at large angles from the jet direction. We also find that this contribution increase the jet-cone size dependence of the full jet energy loss.

High-momentum partons, that then hadronize in jets, are useful tools to study the QGP properties since they are produced via hard scattering processes and they probe the full evolution of the system, losing energy while passing through it.

In particular the characterization of the jet substructure can bring insight on the microscopic nature of modifications induced on these partons by the medium. These modifications can be studied using a set of jet shape observables like the first order radial moment, the jet momentum dispersion, the difference between the leading and sub-leading jet tracks. Moreover measurements of the jet mass will allow for direct experimental access to the virtuality evolution of partons interacting with the medium.

Measurements of these observables in pp or p-Pb collisions will be presented and compared with theoretical calculations, as well as with Monte Carlo generators, providing important tests of QCD in elementary collisions.

By defining a $K$-factor that quantifies the departure of the transport coefficient, $\hat{q}$, from an ideal estimate, $K = \hat{q}/(2 \epsilon^{3/4})$, we fit the single-inclusive experimental data for charged particles. Then, using the fitted $K$-value for each energy and centrality we also compute high-$p_T$ $v_2 $ and $v_3$, getting a good agreement with data.

For correlation studies of jet energy loss, two complementary trigger object choices offer access to the initial hard parton’s energy: On the one hand, direct-photon–tagged jets are a self-generated tomographic medium probe, unaffected by the medium and hence with an unbiased in-medium path length. They are also expected to exhibit a different flavor-dependence of energy loss, since high-$p_T$ direct photons are primarily produced with a quark recoil. On the other hand, reconstructed jets offer the promise of path length control or Jet Geometry Engineering through cut parameters. Previously, $A_J$ measurements at STAR observed significant imbalance for anti-$k_T$ di-jets with a resolution parameter R = 0.4 and a “hard-core” selection using only constituents with $p_T$ above 2.0 GeV/c and a neutral high tower with $E_T$ > 5.5 GeV.

One key difference lies in the treatment of the Altarelli-Parisi, AP, splitting functions. While in some models, such as Q-PYTHIA,  the splitting functions are directly modified in the medium, this core component remains unchanged in others (e.g. YaJEM). The *shared momentum fraction* $z_g$ was shown to be a Sudakov-safe measurement of the splitting function [1].
This quantity measures the $p_T$ ratio between the two dominant branches 
as determined by the SoftDrop grooming process.

An inclusive measurement of $z_g$ in p+p collisions at top RHIC energy will be presented.
The focus of our Au+Au results will be on a comparative study to p+p

Individual examination of the splitting behavior of leading and recoil jet adds a new dimension to this observation, and new input to energy loss models.

opening angle is modified in an ensemble of jets that has propagated
through an expanding cooling droplet of plasma [1]. Each jet in the
ensemble is represented holographically by a string in the dual 4+1-
dimensional gravitational theory with the distribution of initial energies and
opening angles in the ensemble given by perturbative QCD. In [1], the full
string dynamics were approximated by assuming that the string moves at
the speed of light. We are now able to analyze the full string dynamics for
a range of possible initial conditions, giving us access to the dynamics of
holographic jets just after their creation. We show that, after a period of
time that we compute, the string nullifies: the force of gravity accelerates
each section of string until it approaches the speed of light. The
nullification timescale and the features of the string when it has nullified
are all results of the string evolution. This emboldens us to analyze the full jet shape, rather than just the opening angle of each jet in the ensemble as in [1]. We find the
striking result that the jet shape scales with the opening angle at any
particular energy. We construct an ensemble of dijets with energies and
energy asymmetry distributions taken from events in proton-proton
collisions, opening angle distribution as in [1], and jet shape taken from
proton-proton collisions and scaled according to our result. We study how
all of these observables are modified after we send the ensemble of dijets

Jet fragmentation modification has been measured previously in PHENIX in central Au+Au collisions.  Recent RHIC runs offer the potential to study these observables in heavy ion collisions with greater statistics and over different collision systems including asymmetric collision geometries.   In this talk we present results of isolated direct photon-triggered correlations in $d$+Au collisions and discuss the constraints of cold nuclear matter effects on the fragmentation functions.  We also present the latest results with higher statistics on direct photon-triggered correlations in Au+Au collisions including differential measurements of fragmentation function modification.   Finally, we present the status of the centrality and collision species dependence of these observables, including comparisons to related di-hadron correlations. Together these results can give a view of jet modification going from small to large system size.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joseph', 'last_name': 'Osborn', 'fullName': 'Osborn, Joseph', 'id': '2802766', 'affiliation': 'University of Michigan', 'emailHash': '032783a467ae09c773fc647e4d4a1362', 'db_id': 2802766, 'person_id': 2996615}"

Recent RHIC runs have provided Cu+Au and U+U collisions. Asymmetric Cu+Au collisions provide a system with similar energy density but different path lengths when compared to Au+Au with the same number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. Also, in the most central Cu+Au events the surface bias is reduced in the Cu-going direction. Similarly the non-spherical nuclear U+U collisions can produce different energy density and surface biases compared to Au+Au collisions.

The observation of collective behavior in $p$+Pb at the LHC and $d$+Au RHIC has spurred speculation that a plasma is formed in small collision systems. Jet production in the same collisions at the LHC and RHIC has an anomalous centrality dependence if centrality is determined the same way as in large ion-ion collisions. One interpretation could be that the nucleus probes the dynamical structure (""color fluctuations"") of the projectile. Hints of gluon saturation effects have been observed at forward rapidities in $d$+Au collisions at RHIC. To systematically explore the physics using very asymmetric systems, RHIC has provided beams of $p$+Au, $p$+Al, $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au. Single particle production in these collisions should be sensitive to the physics of energy loss, modifications of the nuclear wavefunction, and the dynamics of the projectile wavefunction.

However, our ability to reliably extract such information is contingent on understanding the sensitivity of any given substructure observable to specific features of in-medium jet dynamics. Monte Carlo event generators with transparent physics content and that have been validated for a wide set of observables, e.g. JEWEL, are powerful tools to establish the sensitivity of observables to specifics of jet-QGP interaction. Using the generic procedure we put forward in Eur.Phys.J. C76 (2016) no.5, 288 (arXiv:1512.08107 [hep-ph]) — where we applied it to establish the origin of the excess dijet asymmetry observed in AA collisions as due to fluctuations of the jet fragmentation pattern rather than, as widely believed in the community, to the difference in the amount of matter traversed by the two jets in the pair — we examine the z_g substructure observable recently measured by CMS and STAR. We find straightforward interpretations of the z_g measurement as indicating a QGP-induced modification of the QCD splitting function to be over-simplistic and confounded by the observable sensitivity to fluctuations of the jet-medium interaction pattern.

Parallel Session 6.3: New Theoretical Developments (II),parallel,A kinetic regime of hydrodynamic fluctuations and long time tails for a Bjorken expansion,"Akamatsu, Yukinao",Osaka University,United States,"We develop a set of kinetic equations for hydrodynamic fluctuations which are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. The hydro-kinetic equations can be coupled to existing second order hydrodynamic codes to incorporate the physics of these fluctuations, which become dominant near the critical point.

We first show that the kinetic response precisely reproduces the renormalization of the shear viscosity and the fractional power ($\propto \omega^{3/2}$) which characterizes
equilibrium correlators of energy and momentum for a static fluid. Such fractonal powers are known as ""long time tails"", and were previously discussed by Kovtun, Moore and Romatschke.

Then we use the hydro-kinetic equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion, evaluating the contribution of thermal noise from the earliest moments and at late times. In the Bjorken case, the solution to the  kinetic equations precisely determines the coefficient of the first fractional power of the gradient expansion ($\propto 1/(\tau T)^{3/2}$) for the expanding system. Numerically, we find that the contribution to the longitudinal pressure from hydrodynamic fluctuations is larger than second order hydrodynamics for typical medium parameters used to simulate heavy ion collisions.

If the coalescence mechanism also plays a significant role for charm quark hadronization inside the hot and dense medium, one would expect enhancements in the $D_{s}^{+}$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ yields in heavy-ion collisions relative to p+p collisions. The magnitudes of the enhancements are sensitive to the QGP dynamics, e.g. the degree of thermalization for charm quarks, the amount of strangeness enhancement, etc. Knowledge of the yields for different charm hadrons is also critical for determining the total charm quark yield in heavy-ion collisions.

Heavy quarks are produced in initial hard parton-scattering processes of the nucleon-nucleon collisions and on short time scales compared to the QGP formation time. Therefore they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents. 

The measurement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm AA}$) of charmed hadrons 
allows us to gain insight into the colour-charge and parton-mass  dependence of energy loss as well as into possible modifications of hadronization in presence of the medium. 
Results from Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV indicate that momentum distributions of charmed mesons are modified in Pb--Pb with respect to pp collisions,
owing to quenching of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium. The D-meson $R_{\rm AA}$ exhibits a suppression of a factor 5-6 for $p_{\rm T}$ $\approx$ 10 GeV/$c$ in central collisions, with a hint of reduced suppression for D$_{\rm s}$ mesons as compared to non-strange D mesons.
Results from Run 2 will allow us to reduce uncertainties and draw firmer conclusions about possible charm recombination at low and intermediate $p_{\rm T}$ and about colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of energy loss.

The measurement of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) provides further insight into the deconfined phase. At low $p_{\rm T}$, D-meson $v_2$ offers the unique opportunity to test whether also charm quarks participate in the collective expansion dynamics and possibly thermalize in the medium. At low and intermediate $p_{\rm T}$, the elliptic flow is also expected to be sensitive to the hadronization mechanism, while at high $p_{\rm T}$, it can constrain the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. During the LHC Run 1, ALICE measured a positive $v_{2}$ for D$^{\rm 0}$, D$^{\rm +}$, D$^{\rm *}$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV. The increased statistics of semi-central Pb--Pb events at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV, obtained with the LHC Run 2, provides access to more precise results for non-strange D-meson $v_{2}$ as well as to the first measurement of the D$_{\rm s}$-meson elliptic flow at LHC energies.

Such a suppression can be attributed to the energy losses of heavy flavor quarks due to their interactions with the QGP, which are expected to be different for bottom and charm quarks because of their different masses. In order to fully understand the parton-QGP interactions and thus the QGP properties, it is essential to measure open bottom and charm hadron suppressions separately in Au+Au collisions. Moreover, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects due to the different initial states in p+p and Au+Au collisions also need to be taken into account when interpreting these results.

The suppression of quarkonia in the medium due to color screening has been proposed as a direct signature of the QGP formation. However, other effects, such as regeneration of quarkonia by the coalescence of uncorrelated quark-antiquark pairs, co-mover absorption, and cold nuclear matter effects, add additional complications to the interpretation of the observed quarkonium suppression. Compared to charmonia, bottomonia suffer much less from regeneration contribution and co-mover absorption. Furthermore, different bottomonium states may dissociate at different temperatures, known as ""sequential melting"", which can be used to constrain the temperature of the medium.

Quarkonium measurements have been traditionally performed in the dielectron channel at STAR. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), which provides muon identification and triggering capabilities at mid-rapidity, was fully installed into the STAR experiment.

Hadronization of the heavy quarks via coalescence and fragmentation and particlization of the fluid enable us to investigate the importance of the final hadronic rescatterings on the heavy-flavor observables.
This global description allows us to draw conclusions from the comparison to a variety of heavy-quark observables in different systems and constrain important aspects in our underlying model for the in-medium interaction, such as the contributions stemming from elastic and inelastic energy loss, or the mass dependence by comparing charm and bottom quark dynamics. We present strategies to quantify the off-equilibrium dynamics of heavy flavor at lower momentum compared to the bulk flow by focussing on the higher-order flow harmonics of B and D mesons and the light, charged hadrons and it's centrality dependence. At higher momentum path length differences become the driving force of flow observables.

Parallel Session 3.1: QCD at High Temperature,parallel,High statistics study of in-medium S- and P-wave quarkonium states in lattice Non-relativistic QCD,"Rothkopf, Alexander",Heidelberg University,Unknown,"Many precision measurements of quarkonium suppression at the LHC, e.g. the nuclear modification factor R_AA of J/Psi, are well described by a multitude of different models [1]. Thus pinpointing the underlying physics is difficult and first principles guidance is needed. In-medium spectral properties, e.g. mass shifts or the broadening of states can help us to understand quarkonium production in a kinetically equilibrated setting. While potential based approaches with lattice input [2] have been used to estimate such modifications, a direct and quantitative determination from first principles lattice QCD is still outstanding.

Advancing towards this goal we present here a high statistics study of bottomonium and charmonium S-wave and P-wave spectral properties at finite temperature using the effective field theory NRQCD on the lattice. This EFT allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modelling assumptions in a realistic thermal QCD medium, described by state-of-the-art lattices of the HotQCD collaboration at almost physical pion mass [3]. The availability of two Bayesian methods for spectral functions (MEM and BR [4]) makes it possible to thoroughly test the systematic uncertainties of their reconstruction.

Our new lattice QCD correlation functions and reconstructed spectra corroborate a picture of sequential modification of states with respect to their vacuum binding energy. We find that remnant features of the bottomonium S-wave may survive up to T~400MeV, while the P-wave ground state disappears around T~300MeV. The charmonium analysis hints at melting of the P-wave below T~190MeV while some S-wave remnant feature might survive up to T~245MeV.

With the inclusion of charmonium spectra, an extended temperature range and increased statistics by more than an order of magnitude our study provides a coherent picture of in-medium quarkonium modification extending significantly beyond our previous results of Ref. [5].

Herein, the sigma field as the chiral order parameter is propagated explicitly and coupled to a fluid of quarks. Before investigating these fluctuations in an expanding nonequilibrium medium, we scrutinize the N$\chi$FD model by comparing cumulants of the sigma and net-baryon number fluctuations in a thermalized box to (ratios of) susceptibilities as they are obtained from derivatives of the grand canonical potential. The dynamically determined cumulants follow the trend of the thermodynamic susceptibilities. After implementing a particlization procedure into this model, we study the behavior of the net-proton kurtosis in the critical region and find that it shows the typical shape around the pseudocritical temperature. This demonstrates how critical fluctuations are able to develop in a realistic heavy-ion collision scenario and, moreover, have observable consequences.

of strong-interaction matter at non-zero temperature and density. In view of the 
upcoming Beam Energy Scan II program at RHIC, it is important to gain control
over the EoS in the entire range of chemical potentials ($\mu_B$) accessible at 
RHIC, $0\le \mu_B/T \le 3$. This will provide crucial input for the hydrodynamic
modeling of hot and dense matter and will allow to clarify whether or not a
critical end-point exists in this parameter range.

We present results for the QCD Equation of State at non-zero chemical potentials 
corresponding to the conserved charges in QCD using Taylor expansion upto $6^{th}$ order 
in the baryon number, electric charge and strangeness chemical potentials. The latter
two are constrained by strangeness neutrality and a fixed electric charge to
baryon number ratio. In our calculations, we use the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks
(HISQ) discretization scheme at different values of the lattice spacings to
control lattice cut-off effects. The light and strange quark masses are 
adjusted to reproduce physical values of pion and kaon masses. Furthermore we calculate the 
pressure along lines of constant energy density, which serve as proxies for the 
freeze-out conditions and discuss their dependence on $\mu_B$, which is necessary for 
hydrodynamic modeling near freezeout.

We also provide an estimate of the radius of convergence of the Taylor series from the $6$th order

Parallel Session 2.2: QCD in Small Systems (II),parallel,Multiplicity fluctuations and collective flow in small colliding systems,"Kawaguchi, Koji",Sophia university,Unknown,"Recent observation of  collective-flow-like behaviors in small colliding systems
attracts significant theoretical and experimental interests.
In large colliding systems,
large collective flow has been interpreted as manifestation of almost-perfect
fluidity of the quark gluon plasma (QGP).
So it is quite intriguing to explore how small
the QGP can behave as a fluid. 

In this presentation, 
we newly develop an initialization model 
for hydrodynamic simulations
by combining a
Monte-Carlo version of the Glauber model (MC-Glauber)
with an event generator PYTHIA.
We further implement this model into
an integrated dynamical framework [1]
which is based on
fully three-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic description
of the QGP fluid and kinetic description of the hadron gas.
Using this new version of integrated dynamical model,
we analyze multiplicity fluctuations and
collective flow in small colliding systems
at RHIC and LHC energies. 

Multiplicity fluctuations play a crucial role in centrality definition of the events
in small colliding systems
since the fluctuations
are, in general, more important as the  system size is getting  smaller.  
To consider the correct multiplicity fluctuations,
we employ
 PYTHIA which 
 naturally describes multiplicity distribution in $p$+$p$ collisions.
We superpose $p$+$p$ collisions 
by taking into account the number of participants and that of binary collisions
from MC-Glauber
and evaluate initial entropy density distributions which
contain not only multiplicity fluctuations but also fluctuations of longitudinal profiles.
Solving hydrodynamic equations followed by the hadronic afterburner,
we calculate $p_{T}$ spectra, elliptic ($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) flow
 in  $p$+Au, $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au collisions 
at the RHIC energy and 
$p$+Pb collisions at the LHC energy.
Although a large fraction of final $p_{T}$-integrated $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ comes from
the fluid-dynamical stage,  the effects of hadronic rescatterings turn out to be also important as well
in understanding of the flow data in small colliding systems.

This state of nuclear matter was not expected to be found in reactions involving smaller systems, such as the pA and pp collisions. Nevertheless, a wealth of experimental evidence in recent years has suggested the presence of collective phenomena and a possible QGP medium being formed also in high-multiplicity pPb collisions. A detailed investigation is needed to establish the cause of the observed collective behavior and to determine if, indeed, a QGP medium is being created or if another mechanism is responsible. Final results of differential $v_{n}$ harmonics in pPb collisions as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity obtained using scalar product, multi-particle cumulant and Lee-Yang Zeros methods are presented in various multiplicity classes. The effect of event plane decorrelations on the observed $\eta$ dependence of $v_{n}$ is studied in detail. Furthermore, new measurements of correlation between $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ ($v_{4}$) harmonics are performed using the technique of symmetric cumulants to gain more insight to the initial state and possible medium response of the pPb system.

The well-known DGLV, ASW, BDMPS-Z, AMY and HT calculations all exploit both the large separation distance (between scattering centre and radiation) and the large system approximations.  We relax the large system assumption and recompute the energy loss in the DGLV formalism in order to address the glaring lack of theoretical control over small-system energy loss.  Alarmingly, we find that the correction terms dominate at large energies, resulting in ~100% *negative* correction, calling into question the validity of the large formation time assumption used in *all* pQCD-based energy loss calculations.

Parallel Session 3.3: Quarkonia (I),parallel,Lattice calculations of the heavy quark potential at non-zero temperature,"Petreczky, Peter",BNL,USA,"For theoretical understanding of quarkonium production in heavy ion collisions
it is important to know the potential between the heavy quark and anti-quark
at non-zero temperature. This potential is complex and provides an efficient
way to calculate quarkonium spectral functions at non-zero temperature and
 an important input for dynamical models aiming to describe quarkonium 
production in heavy ion collisions (see e.g. [1]). 

I report on the lattice calculations of the heavy quark potential at T>0
in 2+1 flavor QCD at physical quark masses using Highly Improved Staggered
Quark formulation. The gauge configurations needed for the high statistics
study of the heavy quark potential have been generated by HotQCD and TUMQCD 
collaborations [2]. In this study lattices with temporal extent $N_t=12$ and $16$ 
are used and the real and imaginary part of the potential are obtained using the 
moments of the temporal Wilson loops. I study in detail the systematic effects in the determination of the real and the imaginary parts of the potential when using the moment method. It turns out that below the transition temperature the imaginary part is consistent 
with zero, while above the transition temperature it increases with increasing temperature and separation between the quark and anti-quark till the signal diminishes. 
The real part of the potential is similar to the zero temperature one for distances smaller than 0.8fm and temperatures smaller than 250 MeV. This analysis significantly extends the preliminary work presented in [3].

I will also discuss the implications of these findings for existence of heavy quark bound
state in QGP by calculating the corresponding meson spectral functions with the newly determined potential.

Considerable theoretical and experimental efforts have been invested in 
the last 30 years to study the properties of the QGP. One of the signals 
of QGP formation is the charmonium suppression. Measurements from Pb-Pb 
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 2.76$  TeV revealed a suppression of 
charmonium yields in central collisions, compared to binary-scaled pp 
collisions. However, the magnitude of the suppression is smaller than 
what was observed at lower energies at the SPS and RHIC, indicating that 
J/$\psi$ regeneration via  recombination of  charm and anti-charm quarks

Since quarkonium suppression can occur through complicated processes not only related to the medium effect but also any other ones such as cold nuclear matter effects, good theoretical understanding of quarkonium behavior in the hot medium is required. Low frequency behavior of the quarkonium spectral functions for the vector channel also tells us transport properties of heavy quarks in quark-gluon plasma, which is important input for hydrodynamic models trying to explain collective phenomena in heavy-ion experiments. Therefore it is important to investigate the quarkonium spectral functions, especially using first-principle lattice QCD calculations.

In this talk we report our recent study on quarkonium spectral functions in lattice QCD at finite temperature. To get correlation functions with high data quality, which is important to extract reliable spectral functions, we performed simulations on very large and fine lattices with a couple of lattice cutoffs towards the continuum limit. Our previous studies on some of these lattices have been reported in [1,2]. At temperatures in a range between 0.75$T_c$ and 2.3$T_c$ we reconstruct quarkonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators with both charm and bottom quark masses, where to estimate systematic uncertainties we adopt the conventional maximum entropy method as well as two different stochastic methods: one is the stochastic analytical inference based on the Bayes' theorem and the other is the stochastic optimization method, which does not rely on any prior information (see our preliminary works in [3,4]). We discuss dissociation of quarkonium states from temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions. We also estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient using low-frequency behavior of the spectral functions for the vector channel.

Dileptons in the low invariant mass region (up to M$_{ll}\sim$1~GeV/c$^2$) retain information about the in-medium modification of vector mesons while dileptons in the intermediate mass region (extending out to M$_{ll}\sim$3 GeV/c$^2$) predominantly originate from charm decays and thermal radiation of the medium. At higher invariant masses, recent studies of $J/\psi$ yields in peripheral A$+$A collisions by the ALICE~\cite{alice} and STAR collaborations showed significant excess at very low momentum transfers (p$_T$ $<$ 0.3~GeV/c).

properties of the correlation are shown to exhibit only a weak energy dependence and are remarkably similar to that observed in $p$+Pb collisions. Another new aspect of this talk is a detailed study of ridge properties in collisions containing hard processes,
characterized by large four-momentum transfer. This may help answering the question whether the ridge arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale.

In order to assess the collective nature of multi-particle production, the correlation measurements are extended to include azimuthal
correlations measured using multiparticle cumulants. The presented measurements of multi-particle cumulants $c_2 \{2–8\}$ confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions. However, for $pp$ collisions, the measurements of cumulants do not yet provide clear evidence for collectivity as they are susceptible to event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. In order to address this, results from a new modified cumulant method which suppress both the contribution of multiplicity fluctuation and non-flow effects are presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Adam', 'last_name': 'Trzupek', 'fullName': 'Trzupek, Adam', 'id': '2816383', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nuclear Physics Polish Academy of Sciences (PL)', 'emailHash': 'd623cfbdea887d472bd67ffc8e4b2549', 'db_id': 2816383, 'person_id': 3009284}"
Parallel Session 7.3: Collective Dynamics (II),parallel,Measurement of the transverse and longitudinal dynamics of collective flow in 2.76 and 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector,"Mohapatra, Soumya",Columbia University (US),USA,"The collisions of lead nuclei provided by the LHC in Run 2 provide new opportunities to study matter produced at unprecedented temperatures and densities. In particular, the study of the azimuthal anisotropy of produced charged particles not only constrains the initial state of the nuclear collisions and soft particle collective dynamics, but also sheds light on jet quenching via the measurement of flow harmonics at high transverse momenta. In this talk, new ATLAS measurements of flow harmonics from $v_2$ to $v_7$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, performed in a wide range of transverse momenta 0.5-40 GeV,  pseudorapidity ($|\eta|$<2.5) and collision centrality are presented. This includes a first measurement of $v_6$ and $v_7$, as well as harmonics in ultra-central collisions. A procedure of removing correlations arising from back-to-back jets,
recently used in $pp$ collisions, is implemented in the Two-Particle Correlation method to evaluate $v_n$ without a jet bias. The scaling relations between the $v_n$ harmonics are also discussed.

Longitudinal dynamics has recently become a topic of great interest in the study of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $\Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions. Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $\Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order
flow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented. These result will help to constrain initial conditions along longitudinal direction and also help understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Soumya', 'last_name': 'Mohapatra', 'fullName': 'Mohapatra, Soumya', 'id': '2816382', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '098f3c097bb6400e64dd2de0d2eee4aa', 'db_id': 2816382, 'person_id': 3009283}"

The heavy quarks traversing the medium lose energy via collisional and radiative processes in the interaction with the medium constituents. The heavy-flavour energy loss can be investigated with measurements of the modification of the transverse momentum distribution of heavy-flavour particles in heavy-ion collisions with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions (nuclear modification factor $R_{\rm{AA}}$). An observable that complements the investigation of the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium is the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour particles, which is defined as the second harmonic ($v_{2}$) of the Fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution in momentum space. The measurement of the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at low transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) provides insight into the collective motion of heavy quarks in the medium, while the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at high $p_{\rm T}$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of the energy loss of heavy quarks in the almond-shaped overlap area in non-central collisions.
The semi-leptonic decay channel of open heavy-flavour hadrons is well suited for heavy-flavour studies in ALICE, since the branching ratio is relatively large (10$\%$) and ALICE has an unique capability for identification of electrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.8$) and muons at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4$) over a wide $p_{\rm T}$ range.
In this talk, we will present the ALICE results on the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of open heavy flavour hadrons via their semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via their semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in Pb–Pb collisions. Progress on the measurements of leptons from heavy-flavour and beauty-hadron decays in Pb–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV will be discussed. The first results on the $R_{\rm{AA}}$ and $v_{2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb–Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and prospects for measurements of electrons from beauty-hadron decays will be presented.

Parallel Session 1.1: Initial State Physics and Approach to Equilibrium (I),parallel,"Measurements of multi-jet production in pp, p+Pb and ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions with the ATLAS detector","Angerami, Aaron",Columbia University (US),USA,"Beams of relativistic heavy ions are accompanied by a large flux of equivalent photons, and photon-induced reactions are the dominant interaction mechanism in heavy-ion collisions when the colliding nuclei have transverse separation larger that the nuclear diameter. In these ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) the photon can provide a clean probe of the partonic structure of the nucleus analogous with deep inelastic scattering. This talk presents measurements of dijet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions performed with the ATLAS detector. Events are selected using requirements on rapidity gaps and forward neutron production to identify the photo-nuclear processes. The relatively clean environment of these events allows for measurements in a region of x and Q^2 where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected to be present and not strongly constrained by previous measurements. 

This talk also presents measurements of four-jet cross sections in pp and p+Pb collisions over a large kinematic range. In addition to higher order QCD effects, the four-jet cross section receives contributions from so-called double parton scatterings (DPS) in which two independent hard scattering processes occur in the same collision. Thus measurements of DPS, which have already been performed in 7 TeV pp collisions, can yield new information on the spacial and momentum correlations between partons in a nucleon beyond single parton distributions. In p+Pb collisions, additional mechanisms for DPS are possible when two partons in the proton scatter off partons in different nucleons in the nuclear target, leading to an enhancement in the four jet rate and a different sensitivity to the underlying correlations. Differential cross sections as well as measurements of momentum and angular correlations, which help disentangle the single and double parton scattering contributions, will be presented.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Aaron', 'last_name': 'Angerami', 'fullName': 'Angerami, Aaron', 'id': '2816843', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University (US)', 'emailHash': '11b23fd503aed050e358aa1d92b18a9d', 'db_id': 2816843, 'person_id': 3009750}"
Parallel Session 6.1: QCD in Small Systems (III),parallel,Bayesian analysis of flow in small and large QGP droplets: the role of subnucleonic structure,"Moreland, Scott",Duke University,USA,"Recent measurements of azimuthal particle correlations in small collision systems show striking simularities to flow signatures observed in gold-gold and lead-lead collisions, leading many to question if the origin of small system correlations is hydrodynamic in nature. The ensuing effort to construct a unified hydrodynamic model for small and large collision systems revealed new tension in the QGP initial conditions: heavy-ion collisions appear to prefer saturation based initial conditions [1209.6330, 1505.02677], while small system collectivity is currently best described using a Monte Carlo Glauber model [1502.04745].

It has since been suggested that adding subnucleonic structure to the QGP initial conditions could strongly affect flow in small collision systems and may explain apparent model discrepancies [1405.3605v1]. While practical implementations of subnucleonic structure are relatively straightforward—one simply replaces smooth protons with lumpy protons—there exist large theoretical uncertainties regarding the fluctuated shape of the proton, and corresponding theory predictions are highly model dependent.

In this work, we extend previous efforts to parametrize and constrain the QGP initial conditions using systematic Bayesian analysis and study the effects of subnucleonic structure predicted by a simple constituent parton model. We vary both subnucleonic degrees of freedom, e.g. the constituent parton number and effective parton width, as well as typical transport parameters such as the hydrodynamic starting time and QGP viscosity. The initial conditions are then embedded in an event-by-event hydrodynamic model and calibrated to simultaneously fit charged particle yields, flows and mean $p_T$ for light-heavy and heavy-heavy collisions at RHIC. We finally apply Bayesian parameter estimation methods to extract posterior distributions for the optimal initial condition parameters and comment on the implied viability of related theoretical frameworks.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Scott', 'last_name': 'Moreland', 'fullName': 'Moreland, Scott', 'id': '2895385', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '5c3dae75953dc245616e28d238363076', 'db_id': 2895385, 'person_id': 2993716}"

These fields are traditionally computed by integrating the Maxwell equations with point sources. One might expect that such an approach is valid at distances much larger than the proton size and thus such a classical approach should work well for almost the entire interaction region in the case of heavy nuclei. We argue that, in fact, the contrary is true: due to the quantum diffusion of the proton  wave function, the classical approximation breaks down at distances of the order of the system size.
We compute the electromagnetic field created by a charged particle described initially as a Gaussian wave packet of width 1~fm and evolving in vacuum according to the Klein-Gordon equation. We completely neglect the medium effects. We show that the dynamics, magnitude and even sign of the electromagnetic field created by classical and quantum sources are different.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Balthazar', 'last_name': 'Peroutka', 'fullName': 'Peroutka, Balthazar', 'id': '2934193', 'affiliation': 'Iowa State University', 'emailHash': '5942d803a2d69eaf4ec5171321e5329e', 'db_id': 2934193, 'person_id': 3007425}"
Parallel Session 6.2: Correlations and Fluctuations (I),parallel,Dynamical critical fluctuations near the QCD critical point,"Song, Huichao",Peking University,Unknown,"The recent BES data of the energy dependent κσ^2 for net protons in Au+Au collisions presented large deviations from the statistical baselines at lower collision energies, and non-monotonic behavior at around 20 GeV, which indicates possible signals for the existence of the QCD critical point [1]. 

  In our recent paper [2], we introduce a freeze-out scheme to the dynamical models near the QCD critical point. Our model calculations for the static critical fluctuations  on the freeze-out surface shows that the C_4 and κσ^2  data of net protons can be roughly described. However, C_2 and C_3 are always over-predicted due to the positive static critical fluctuations. After solving the time evolution equations of the various cumulants of the sigma field,  the BNL group found the Skewness and Kurtosis could change their sign after the evolution, which indicates that dynamical critical fluctuations could solve the sign problem of C_3  [3]. However, such BNL approach can not be easily combined with our freeze-out scheme to compared with the experimental data since only the zero mode of sigma field are considered there, which already erase the needed spatial information.

  Within the framework of Langevin dynamics, we simulate the dynamical evolution of the fluctuating sigma field in position space and calculate the cumulants of the sigma field in the critical regime[4]. Our numerical simulations show that C_2 automatically increases as the system evolves in the critical regime, which represents the spontaneous increase of the chiral field’s correlation. Besides, for both C_3 and C_4, the sign in the earlier times can be remembered during the dynamical evolution due to the memory effects near the critical point[4]. Combined with the freeze-out scheme developed in [2], our calculation provides a possible way to qualitatively describe the different cumulants data of net protons.

Parallel Session 7.3: Collective Dynamics (II),parallel,Choice of moment and derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics,"Niemi, Harri",Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität,Unknown,"We present a derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics from the moments of the Boltzmann equation based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic single-particle distribution function [1]. We construct such an expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum space orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the anisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle distribution function from the anisotropic distribution. Truncating this set via the 14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics. We further consider a particular choice for the anisotropic distribution function and the boost-invariant expansion of a fluid in one dimension, neglecting deviations from the chosen distribution function [2]. In order to close the conservation equations, we need to select in addition a particular moment of the Boltzmann equation. We discuss the influence of the choice of this moment on the time evolution of fluid-dynamical variables and identify the moment that provides the best match of anisotropic fluid dynamics to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation.
