Poster Session,poster,Quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics for central collisions,"Alqahtani, Mubarak",Kent State University,Unknown,"We use quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics to study an azimuthally-symmetric boost-invariant quark-gluon plasma including the effects of both shear and bulk viscosities. In quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics, a single finite-temperature quasiparticle mass is introduced and fit to the lattice data in order to implement a realistic equation of state (EoS).  We compare results obtained using the quasiparticle method with the standard method of imposing the EoS in anisotropic hydrodynamics and viscous hydrodynamics.  Using these three methods, we extract the primordial particle spectra, total number of charged particles, and average transverse momentum for various values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$.  We find that the three methods agree well for small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$, but differ at large $\eta/s$, with the standard anisotropic EoS method showing suppressed production at low transverse-momentum compared to the other two methods considered.  Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that, when using standard viscous hydrodynamics, the bulk-viscous correction can drive the primordial particle spectra negative at large $p_T$.  Such a behavior is not seen in either anisotropic hydrodynamics approach, irrespective of the value of $\eta/s$.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mubarak', 'last_name': 'Alqahtani', 'fullName': 'Alqahtani, Mubarak', 'id': '2778354', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University', 'emailHash': 'b2a1114eb092e6a2e1c30949d6867119', 'db_id': 2778354, 'person_id': 2973555}"

Poster Session,poster,Phenomenological predictions of 3+1d anisotropic hydrodynamics,"Nopoush, Mohammad",Kent State University,Unknown,"We make phenomenological predictions for particle spectra and flow in heavy-ion col- lisions using 3+1d anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) including the effects of both bulk and shear viscosities. The dynamical equations necessary are derived by taking moments of Boltzmann equation allowing for three distinct momentum-space anisotropy parameters. The formulation is based on relaxation-time approximation for the collisional kernel and a lattice-QCD-based equation of state. Evolving the system to late times, we calculate par- ticle production using THERMINATOR modified to account for an ellipsoidal distribution function. We obtain particle spectra for different particle types such as pions, kaons, and protons and elliptic flow, $v_2$, as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity. In our model, we have four free parameters, i.e. freeze-out temperature, initial energy den- sity, initial momentum-space anisotropy, and shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. Using a multidimensional fit to LHC experimental data, we extract these parameters. We find good agreement between 3+1d aHydro and available experimental data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Mohammad', 'last_name': 'Nopoush', 'fullName': 'Nopoush, Mohammad', 'id': '2778359', 'affiliation': 'Kent State University', 'emailHash': '0de7a98ce52e94798d68be7abb0b5ad2', 'db_id': 2778359, 'person_id': 2973559}"
Poster Session,poster,"Measurement of neutral mesons in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=5.02\,\text{TeV}$ with PCM in ALICE","Danisch, Meike Charlotte",Ruprecht-Karls-Universitaet Heidelberg (DE),KR,"Neutral mesons can provide important information on the energy loss of partons traversing the hot and dense state of matter, which is created in high energy heavy-ion collisions.
Furthermore, they constitute the largest background contribution for direct photons, which are also a very important tool to study the properties of the Quark Gluon Plasma.
In the ALICE experiment, neutral mesons can be measured via their decay to two photons. 
Apart from the two calorimeters EMCal and PHOS, photons can be reconstructed also via the Photon Conversion Method (PCM). 
The latter exploits the fact that a photon can convert to an electron-positron pair. 
These charged particles can be detected via their tracks in the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) and the Inner Tracking System (ITS). 
The PCM allows the measurement of both photons and neutral mesons, carrying low transverse momenta (down to $p_{\text{T}} \approx 1\,\text{GeV}$), with very good energy resolution.
Apart from presenting the performance of the photon conversion method, first results on the $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ meson production in Pb-Pb collisions

By introducing additional transverse momentum anisotropy parameters into the parton distribution functions, we generalize previous results which were obtained for the case of a spheroidal anisotropy. Our results demonstrate that the presence of anisotropies in the transverse directions affects the real and imaginary parts of quark self-energy and, consequently, the self-energy depends on both the polar and azimuthal angles in the local rest frame of the matter.

Poster Session,poster,$J/\psi$ production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV at the STAR experiment,"Yang, Qian",University of Science and Technology of China,Unknown,"Understanding $J/\psi$ meson hadroproduction has been a long-term effort both experimentally and theoretically.  However, none of the existing theoretical models can successfully describe both $J/\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectrum and the polarization. Furthermore, the composition of inclusive $J/\psi$ is complicated, including direct production via gluon fusion, parton fragmentation, and feed-down from excited charmonium states and B hadrons. Measurements of $J/\psi$ production at a different beam energy can shed new lights on the understanding of different $J/\psi$ production mechanisms, and help to constrain model calculations. 

We report measurements of $J/\psi$ production in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV in both the di-electron and di-muon channels.  By combining measurements from these two channels, the $p_{T}$ spectrum of $J/\psi$ is measured from 0 to 20 GeV/$c$ and compared with NLO NRQCD and CGC+NRQCD calculations at different kinematic ranges. Feed-down contributions from $\psi(2S)$  is studied in the $p_{T}$ range of $4 < p_{T} < 12$ GeV/$c$. In addition, measurements of the $J/\psi$ production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity will be presented. A strong increase of the relative $J/\psi$ yield with multiplicity is observed for all $p_{T}$ bins with significant $p_{T}$ dependence.

Poster Session,poster,Constituent quarks and systematic errors in midrapidity charged multiplicity ($dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$) distributions.,"Tannenbaum, Michael",Brookhaven National Laboratory (US),USA,"Although it was demonstrated more than 13 years ago that the 
increase in midrapidity $dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta$ with increasing centrality 
of Au+Au collisions at RHIC was linearly proportional to the number 
of constituent quark participants ($N_{qp}$) in the collision, 
it was only in the last few years that generating the spatial positions of the 
three quarks in a nucleon according to the Fourier transform of the measured electric 
charge form factor of the proton could be used to connect $dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta/N_{qp}$ as a function 
of centrality in  p(d)$+$A and A$+$A collisions with the same value of $dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta/N_{qp}$ 
determined in p$+$p collisions. The several calculations had slightly different methods. 
One calculation, which only compared its calculated 
$dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta/N_{qp}$ in p$+$p at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV to the least central of 12 centrality
bin measurements in Au$+$Au by PHENIX, claimed that the p$+$p value was higher by ``about 30\%'' from 
the band of measurements vs. centrality and suggested a smaller number of subnuclear contributors, e.g. quark-diquark. However the clearly quoted systematic errors were ignored for which a 1 standard deviation systematic shift would move all the 12 Au$+$Au data points to within 1.3 standard deviations of the p$+$p value, or if the statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature a difference of 35 $\pm$ 21\% .

Poster Session,poster,Δη dependence of net-charge fluctuations in Au+Au collisions from the Beam Energy Scan at the STAR experiment,"Sugiura, Tetsuro","University of Tsukuba, Japan",UK,"In heavy-ion collision experiments, the study of event-by-event fluctuations provides a powerful tool to characterize and understand the thermodynamic 
properties of the hot and dense QCD matter.
The fluctuations of conserved quantities in a finite phase space rapidity window ($\Delta\eta$), like the net-charge, are predicted to be one of the most sensitive signals of the QGP formation and phase transition [1].

D-measure which is defined by second order cumulant per unit entropy was obtained as a function of $\Delta\eta$ in LHC-ALICE experiment at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76~$TeV Pb+Pb collisions, and it is observed to decrease with $\Delta\eta$ [2].
D-measure is considered to become $3$-$4$ in an equilibrated hadronic medium and $1$-$1.5$ in an equilibrated QGP medium [3]. Thus the ALICE results don't conflict with the theoretical prediction.
$\Delta\eta$ dependence of the higher order cumulant ratios are also important and predicted to decrease 
as the $\Delta\eta$ become larger [4].

In this study, D-measure and 1st to 4th order cumulant ratios are calculated in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4,$ and $200~$GeV during Beam Energy Scan in 2010, 2011 and 2014.
We will report $\Delta\eta$, centrality and energy dependence of the net-charge fluctuation and compare STAR Beam Energy Scan results to ALICE results ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76TeV).
Then, we will discuss an energy dependence of the fluctuation as a function of $\Delta\eta$ and possible information from the QGP phase transition.

The PHENIX experiment has previously used the micro-vertexing capabilities of its silicon vertex detector (VTX) to infer the yield of charm and bottom quarks in Au+Au collisions from measurements of both the invariant yield of heavy flavor electrons and the distance of closest approach to the collision vertex of heavy flavor electrons. This poster will describe the current effort toward the measurement of the invariant yields in the 2015 p+p collision dataset.

The PHENIX experiment measured direct photons in p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and discovered thermal photons from Au+Au collisions with internal photon conversions. Recently PHENIX has reported thermal photon production with wide centrality bins in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via external photon conversions.

Poster Session,poster,Performance of ALICE EMCal and DCal in Electron Identification,"Gauger, Erin Frances",University of Texas (US),USA,"A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a major experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is specifically designed to investigate the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are momentarily deconfined. The QGP is short-lived, and must therefore be studied indirectly by identifying the final-state particles produced in heavy-ion collisions. The final-state particle of interest in this poster is the electron. Electrons must be identified to study, for instance, the semi-leptonic decay channels of heavy-flavor hadrons. Because heavy-flavor quarks are created early in the collision, they travel and interact with the QCD medium. This makes them an important probe of the QGP. 
	
	One of the detectors important in identifying electrons is the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). The ALICE EMCal is a sampling calorimeter with 77 layers of lead and polystyrene scintillator and is composed of $\sim$6.0$\times$$\sim$6.0$\times$24.6 cm$^{3}$ towers (cells). It has an azimuthal and pseudo-rapidity coverage of 107$\degree$ (80$\degree$\textless $\varphi$\textless 187$\degree$) and $|\eta|$\textless 0.7, respectively. For Run 2, the EMCal has been expanded to include the Di-jet Calorimeter (DCal), which is located on the opposite side of the beam axis from the original EMCal. The DCal spans an additional azimuthal angle of 67$\degree$ (260$\degree$\textless $\varphi$\textless 327$\degree$) and covers the pseudo-rapidity region $|\eta|$\textless 0.7. The EMCal has an effective radiation length ($\chi_{0}$) of $\sim$2.3 mm, a nuclear interaction length ($\lambda_{\rm{int}}$) of $\sim$24.6 cm, and an effective Moli\`{e}re radius ($R_{\rm{M}}$) of 3.20 cm. Finally, the EMCal detector is used to improve statistics at high-$p_{\rm{T}}$ using the EMCal gamma trigger.
	
	The energy loss and shower shape parameters in the EMCal can be used to distinguish electrons from hadrons. These parameters are particularly useful when an analysis requires electrons with high-$p_{\rm{T}}$. In this poster, the electron identification performance of the EMCal with DCal in Run 2 is investigated using both minimum bias and EMCal gamma-triggered data from pp ($\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV) and Pb-Pb ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV) collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Erin Frances', 'last_name': 'Gauger', 'fullName': 'Gauger, Erin Frances', 'id': '2778388', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas (US)', 'emailHash': '5a383e8a9c637b372cb7155d4c627ec0', 'db_id': 2778388, 'person_id': 2973585}"
Poster Session,poster,Reconstruction of neutral-triggered full recoil jets in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV p+p collisions at the STAR experiment,"Anderson, Derek","Cyclotron Institute, Texas A&M University",USA,"In heavy-ion collisions, the study of recoil jets tagged by high transverse-momentum ""direct photons"" ($\gamma_{dir}$) should provide a measurement of the partonic energy loss in the hot, dense medium produced in such collisions\footnote{X.-N. Wang, Z. Huang, and I. Sarcevic, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 231 (1996)}.  Since a $\gamma_{dir}$ does not interact strongly with the medium, it closely approximates the initial energy of the recoiling parton.  It is also interesting to compare the recoil jets tagged by $\gamma_{dir}$ to those tagged by high transverse-momentum $\pi^{0}$.  In contrast to the $\gamma_{dir}$, high transverse-momentum $\pi^{0}$ are assumed to be biased towards being produced near the surface of the medium.  Moreover, the production mechanisms of $\gamma_{dir}$ favor recoiling quarks over gluons, but the production mechanisms of $\pi^{0}$ show no such preference.  Thus the comparison of $\gamma_{dir}$-tagged recoil jets to $\pi^{0}$-tagged recoil jets may shed light on the path-length and color-factor dependence of in-medium partonic energy loss.

To establish a vacuum fragmentation reference, we present the measurement of the yields of full recoil jets (recoil jets consisting of both charged and neutral particles) in p+p collisions.  The yields are measured using the STAR Time Projection Chamber and Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV tagged by neutral-particle triggers recorded during the running year 2009.  The neutral-particle triggers satisfy $9 < E_{T}^{trig} < 20$ GeV and $|\eta^{trig}| < 1$, and are separated into a sample of identified $\pi^{0}$ triggers and a sample of triggers with an enhanced fraction of $\gamma_{dir}$.  Jets are reconstructed from charged tracks and neutral towers with $p_{T} > 0.2$ GeV/c and $E_{T} > 0.2$ GeV respectively and $|\eta| < 1$ using the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm for resolution parameter $0.3 \leq R \leq 0.6$. To assay the effect of reconstructing full jets versus charged-only jets in such studies, the yields of charged recoil-jets are compared to the yields of full recoil-jets.  The data are corrected for instrumental effects and compared to Pythia simulations\footnote{T. Sj\""ostrand, S. Mrenna and P. Z. Skands, Comput. Phys.

Poster Session,poster,Inclusive muon yield from charm and bottom quark production at forward rapidity in p+p and p+Au collisions at sqrt(s) = 200 GeV in the PHENIX Detector,"Bok, Jeongsu",New Mexico State University,KR,"PHENIX has studied the production of muons from the semi-leptonic decay

measurement of heavy quark production in p+p collisions is important as
a baseline for studying hot and cold matter effects in heavy-ion
collisions, and is a test of pQCD theory. In p+Au collisions, we can
study cold-nuclear-matter (CNM) effects on heavy flavor production.
Measurement of charm and bottom yields will help to understand flavor
dependence of CNM effects. In 2015, a high-statistics dataset of p+p and
p+Au collisions wascollected with the Forward Silicon Vertex (FVTX)
detector in PHENIX at RHIC. The complete PHENIX silicon vertex tracking
system (VTX+FVTX) allows us to measure a precise primary vertex as well
as the radial distance of muon tracks to the collision vertex. The
distributions of radial distances for tracks from short-lived
heavy-flavor mesons ($D$ and $B$) and long-lived light-flavor mesons

Poster Session,poster,Jet-Hadron correlations in pp and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Ehlers, Raymond",Yale University (US),USA,"Jet energy loss in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is an active area of research, with many different measurement techniques attempting to determine its properties. One technique is to measure the azimuthal correlations of a trigger jet and the associated hadrons in the event. These measurements, known as jet-hadron correlations, are expected to be sensitive to broadening and softening of an associated recoil jet due to jet quenching. To help get a handle on energy loss, the path length of the recoil jet can be varied by imposing a surface bias condition on the trigger jet population. Previous measurements with such a bias at RHIC have already shown jet-hadron correlations to be a useful tool for studying energy loss. In particular, by comparing heavy ion measurements to pp, the correlations exhibit a strong suppression of higher $p_{{\rm T}}$ hadrons, which is balanced by an excess of lower $p_{{\rm T}}$ hadrons.

For this analysis, the azimuthal jet-hadron correlations are constructed from a trigger R=0.2 full (charged + neutral) jet, which is correlated with charged hadrons. In an effort to enhance the surface bias and reduce the impact of the background, jets are required to pass a leading constituent cut and are reconstructed using only high energy and momentum constituents. We present the current status of the analysis, including measurements of associated hadron yields and widths in central Pb–Pb data collected at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration. These measurements will also be compared to jet-hadron correlations measured in pp.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Raymond', 'last_name': 'Ehlers', 'fullName': 'Ehlers, Raymond', 'id': '2778398', 'affiliation': 'Yale University (US)', 'emailHash': '74d5703256a0a2ac12ed83af54d47972', 'db_id': 2778398, 'person_id': 2973595}"

Because the correlation between different order flow harmonics responds differently to the initial conditions or(and) $\eta/s$, SC provide a strong constraint on the QGP properties in heavy-ion collisions. Furthermore, the higher order to lower order harmonic correlations can be used to understand the viscous correction to the momentum distribution at freeze-out which is probably the least understood part of hydrodynamic calculations [2, 3]. These results have a great potential to constrain the dominant physics in each stage of heavy-ion collisions.

Poster Session,poster,D-tagged jet measurements in p-Pb collisions in ALICE,"Trzeciak, Barbara Antonina",Utrecht University,Unknown,"Heavy charm quarks are produced dominantly in the initial stage of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They take part in the whole evolution of the medium, interact with the produced Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and lose energy due to collisional and radiative processes. Therefore, they serve as unique probes of the QGP transport properties. Charm quarks can be studied by measuring D mesons that originate from the charm-quark fragmentation. Furthermore, identifying the charm-jets (with D-meson tagging) gives additional information about the energy-loss distribution in the medium. In order to disentangle effects related to the presence of the hot and dense medium, measurements in elementary pp and in p--A collisions are needed. In addition to the charm-jet transverse momentum spectrum, an important observable is the charm fragmentation function (fraction of the jet momentum carried by D mesons), which is still not fully understood even in pp collisions, and provides important constraint for Monte-Carlo event generators. The study of possible charm-jet modifications in p--Pb collisions is an important intermediate step between pp and Pb--Pb collisions that complements the simple pp vacuum case and the heavy-ion case with interplay of many different effects.

D mesons are identified via their hadronic decay channels using information from the ALICE Inner Tracking System to reconstruct decay topologies displaced with respect to the collision primary vertex.

The proper decay length for B-mesons is $c\tau \approx500 \text{ }\mu m$ and for D-mesons it is 100-300 $\mu m$, hence the reconstructed decay electrons do not point to the primary vertex of the collision.

We employ the above model to analyze the data on Upsilon suppression measured in terms of nuclear modification factor, $R_{AA}$ versus transverse momentum, $p_{T}$, and centrality obtained from Pb$+$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV LHC energy. We find that our model describes the LHC data reasonably well.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'CAPTAIN R.', 'last_name': 'SINGH', 'fullName': 'SINGH, CAPTAIN R.', 'id': '2778430', 'affiliation': 'BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE', 'emailHash': '188a019999569c1e18ff5d7d4d0b309f', 'db_id': 2778430, 'person_id': 2973627}"

Dihadron azimuthal correlations with high $p_T$ trigger particles are a valuable tool to study the interactions between jets and the medium.
Previously, it was shown that dihadron azimuthal correlations are expected to depend on the azimuthal angle of trigger particle relative to the event plane [1].
However, in-medium path length can additionally differ in the same multiplicity class because of the evolution of the system, and thus the strength of long-range correlations (flow), is sensitive to fluctuations in the initial geometry.
Event shape engineering (ESE) has been proposed as a powerful method to select the events which have different strength of flow [2].
We present a study of dihadron correlations for different selections of the trigger azimuthal angle with respect to the event plane in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200GeV utilizing ESE.

An answer to this behavior is presented by models containing a regeneration component. In these models a possible (re)combination of (un)correlated c$\overline{\rm{c}}$-quarks enhances the J/$\psi$ production.
Since those c$\overline{\rm{c}}$-quarks interact with the bulk medium before forming a J/$\psi$, they should be coupled to the medium flow. Hence the measurement of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) for J/$\psi$ imposes strong constraints on the J/$\psi$ production models in high energy Pb$-$Pb collisions.\\

We present the measurement of the probability distribution of event-by-event flow and multiparticle cumulants in Uranium nuclei collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV in STAR. The observed flow vector ( $\vec{Q}$ ) is smeared by statistical fluctuations and non-flow correlations. To subtract this smearing an iterative, data-driven matrix inversion method is used. The distributions of $v_2$ are observed to be Bessel-Gaussian in central and mid-central regions and deviates from Bessel-Gaussian in the peripheral region. The comparison of UU flow distributions with that of AuAu may show the manifestation of the deformed collision geometry of Uranium. From the probability distribution ( p($v_2$) ), multiparticle cumulants of $v_2$ - $v_2\{2\}$, $v_2\{4\}$ and $v_2\{6\}$ are calculated. Unfolded $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$ are consistent with the results published by STAR Collaboration. The ratio of $v_2\{6\}/v_2\{4\}$ in ultra central region, is observed to be less than unity unlike AuAu where the ratio is observed to be close to unity.

Zachariah Miller (UIC)

Due to their large masses, heavy flavor quarks are dominantly produced in initial hard parton scattering processes in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They experience the full evolution of the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in such collisions. Thus, heavy quarks have been suggested as excellent probes of the properties of the QGP. To study how heavy flavor quarks interact with the QGP, initial-state effects upon heavy flavor production due to the presence of the heavy ions must be understood. These initial-state effects, also known as Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, need to be studied in collision systems that include a heavy ion but are not expected to produce a QGP, such as p+Au collisions. Non-Photonic Electrons (NPE) from semi-leptonic decays of open heavy flavor hadrons can serve as a proxy for heavy flavor quarks, and be used to measure CNM effects on heavy flavor production. 
    
In this poster, we will present the first measurement of inclusive NPE production in p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. Data were triggered by large energy deposition in the Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 140-410 nb$^{-1}$ depending on the trigger threshold, from the 2015 run at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$, which is a measure of CNM effects on NPE production, will be reported, and its implications for NPE production in Au+Au collisions will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachariah', 'last_name': 'Miller', 'fullName': 'Miller, Zachariah', 'id': '2778462', 'affiliation': 'University of Illinois at Chicago', 'emailHash': '94f2b0dcda1c8eea1dbccbfa12799f17', 'db_id': 2778462, 'person_id': 2973658}"

Poster Session,poster,Studying Geometric Bias for Jet-Hadron Correlations with Monte Carlo Models,"Oliver, Michael Henry",Yale University (US),USA,"A key topic of interest in studies of jets in heavy ion physics is the path-length dependence of jet-medium interactions.  In this contribution, Monte Carlo event simulators are used to estimate the path-length traversed by the recoil jet, under a varying range of trigger conditions.  These simulations are then used to make predictions for studies of jet-hadron correlations, where a high pT jet is used as a trigger, and the distribution of associated particles from the awayside is examined.
 
  Since we cannot experimentally measure the location of a hard-scatter vertex or the path-length traversed by the resulting partons, we require models to understand the role of path-length in experimental analysis.  With Monte Carlo event generators, we can directly track the path-length of the trigger jet and the recoil jet.  An especially interesting quantity is how biased the trigger is towards the surface, since the recoil jet from a surface biased trigger is likely to traverse a longer path.  This is connected back to experiment by predicting how much jet energy loss resulting in softening and broadening can be observed in jet-hadron correlations.

While collectivity is well established in $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions, its evidence in $pp$ collisions is still a matter of debate. The presented measurements of multi-particle cumulants $c_2 \{2–8\}$ confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity PbPb collisions. For $pp$ collisions the same conclusion can be derived from two-particle cumulants calculated with the requirement of a large pseudorapidity separation, $|\Delta\eta|>2$. However, the measurements of $c_\{4\}$ cumulants with a method that is not susceptible to event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations, but is biased by higher order non-flow correlations, do not yet provide clear evidence for collectivity.  A modified cumulant method is used to suppress both the contribution of multiplicity fluctuation and non-flow effects. The results from this method are presented for pp and $p$+Pb collisions.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Arabinda', 'last_name': 'Behera', 'fullName': 'Behera, Arabinda', 'id': '2820119', 'affiliation': 'State University of New York (US)', 'emailHash': 'aa29944425fd059a39e7b3c41c97df0b', 'db_id': 2820119, 'person_id': 3012735}"
Poster Session,poster,Radiation Hard Prototype for ATLAS ZDC Upgrade,"Phipps, Michael William",Univ. Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (US),USA,"Increases in luminosity and collision energy at the LHC challenge the radiation hardness of detectors located along the beamline. This problem is especially acute for the ATLAS Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDCs), which are exposed to about 10^10 rad/yr, rendering the current version of the detector unusable during p+p running. To address this shortcoming and allow for important triggers and access to interesting low-x physics, we have designed a prototype that replaces quartz radiator material with a circulating, liquid hydrocarbon, as well as a new radiator geometry that orients the radiator gaps and tungsten absorber plates along the Cherenkov angle of normally incident particles. Design considerations, results from prototype beam tests at the SPS, and comparisons to GEANT simulation will be presented. The poster will also discuss plans for a material test that will take place at the ZDC’s nominal location in ATLAS during the 2017 p+p run, allowing for important radiation hardness measurements of candidate materials for liquid radiator, reflectors and quartz fibers.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Michael William', 'last_name': 'Phipps', 'fullName': 'Phipps, Michael William', 'id': '2778489', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

Poster Session,poster,A Cellular Automaton tracking algorithm for the Upgrade of the Inner Tracking System of ALICE,"Puccio, Maximiliano",Universita e INFN Torino (IT),Italy,"In view of the LHC Run3 starting in 2021, the ALICE experiment is preparing a major upgrade including the construction of an entirely new inner silicon tracker (the Inner Tracking System) and a complete renewal of its Online and Offline systems.

During its Run3, LHC will deliver Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.5 TeV with a peak luminosity $L=6\times10^{27}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ and an interaction rate of 50 kHz, to be compared to the 8 kHz design interaction rate of the LHC Run1 and Run2. The aim of ALICE is to cope with such a high interaction rate improving at the same time the resolution and the efficiency of its silicon tracker.

In this context, one of the requirements for a prompt calibration of external detectors and a fast offline data processing is to run online the reconstruction of tracks in the Upgraded Inner Tracking System.

A new algorithm based on Cellular Automata has been developed to tackle this issue. In this algorithm the tracking is split in multiple phases to profit from data locality. At first, hit points are organised in sectors of azimuthal angle and longitudinal coordinate; then the algorithm looks for track segments within these sectors of the detector, independently. Track segments with compatible track parameters are marked as neighbours.

Neighbouring track segments are then merged at the final stage using a set of rules defined by the Cellular Automaton mechanism, somewhat similar to the set of rules used in the Conway's Game of Life.

The obtained computing and tracking performance are compliant with the requirements of ALICE being able to reconstruct tracks of transverse momentum down to 100 MeV/c in events with high track density ($\mathrm{d}N_{ch} / \mathrm{d}\eta$ up to 2000). The tracking and computing performance of this algorithm will be shown in the case of central Pb-Pb events at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.5 TeV.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Maximiliano', 'last_name': 'Puccio', 'fullName': 'Puccio, Maximiliano', 'id': '2778493', 'affiliation': 'Universita e INFN Torino (IT)', 'emailHash': '19d9d87bc57f620dd7916c39994da488', 'db_id': 2778493, 'person_id': 2973681}"

Direct photons provide complementary insight towards the physical nature of the suppression of hadron yields since they are directly sensitive to the gluon density at forward rapidities (through gluon Compton scattering) and are not affected by final state effects.
Experimentally the ability to isolate direct photons from the background of photons from hadron decays can be achieved with a high spatial resolution preshower detector coupled with an electromagnetic calorimeter. 
Such detector, the Muon Piston Calorimeter Extension (MPC-EX),  has been installed in PHENIX at RHIC and successfully took data for d+Au collisions at 200 GeV during 2016, providing a high statistics dataset for the analysis of prompt photon production.

In heavy ion collisions, radial and anisotropic flow of the expanding medium have been observed.
These hydrodynamic expansions result in the deformation of the initial geometry.

Studying the deformation of the source shape is important for investigating the dynamics of the system evolution.

In the last decade, azimuthally differential femtoscopy with respect to the second order event plane has been measured.
The comparison between initial and final source eccentricities indicates the dilution of the source eccentricity by the expanding medium.

It is thought that initial density fluctuations generate higher order azimuthal anisotropy and it is expected
to be a good probe to constrain initial conditions and the viscosity of the QGP.
However it is not clear how the initial spatial fluctuations evolve to the geometry at freeze out.
Azimuthally differential femtoscopy with respect to the third order event plane provides new insights
into the medium expansion from the initial geometrical fluctuations to final anisotropies.

The azimuthal anisotropy flow coefficients vn fluctuate largely even in the same centrality class due to the fluctuations in the participant shape.
Recently event shape engineering(ESE) was suggested as a powerful tool to control event-by-event flow fluctuations
by selecting the magnitude of flow vectors $q_{2}$ and $q_{3}$.
Azimuthally differential HBT with ESE offers a detailed analysis of the relation between anisotropic flow and
the deformation of the source shape.

Poster Session,poster,Event-by-event charge separation in Au+Au collisions at $\it {\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC,"Attri, Anjali",Panjab University,Unknown,"Theoretical studies predict that some metastable states leading to the local parity violation may be created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. The interaction of the strong magnetic field produced in the non-central heavy-ion collisions and the deconfined state created in these collisions causes the separation of charges along the axis of the magnetic field. This phenomenon of the charge separation along the axis of the magnetic field and perpendicular to the reaction plane is called the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [2]. We investigated the event-by-event charge separation using Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM), similar to the Sliding Window Method [3]. In this method, we evaluate Db$_{+-}$, which is defined as:

$Db_{+-} = \frac{N^L_{+}}{(N^L_{+} + N^L_{-})} + \frac{N^R_{-}}{(N^R_{+} + N^R_{-})}$ ,

where, N$^L_{+}$ and N$^L_{-}$, respectively, are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the left side of the dumbbell, whereas N$^R_{+}$ and  N$^R_{-}$, respectively, are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the right side of the dumbbell. The whole azimuthal plane is scanned by sliding the ${\Delta \phi}$ =$90^{\circ}$ dumbbell in steps of ${\delta \phi}$ =$1^{\circ}$ and calculating the observable Db$_{+-}$ for each ${\Delta \phi}$ region to extract the maximum value of Db$_{+-}$ in each event. We have analysed the events with higher values of Db$_{+-}$ and some interesting events displaying back to back charge separation are found. The data has been analysed for different dumbbell sizes i.e., ${\Delta\phi}$ =90$^{\circ}$, 60$^{\circ}$ and 40$^{\circ}$ and the results will be presented.

Poster Session,poster,Hard Substructure of Jets Probed in p-Pb collisions,"Lapidus, Kirill",Yale University (US),USA,"Collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions provide an opportunity to investigate strongly interacting matter under extreme energy densities and temperatures. Interaction of hard scattered partons with the hot and dense medium leads to a suppression of the observed jet yields, known as jet quenching. Along with other experimental approaches, studies of the jet substructure have the prospects of providing valuable information about jet quenching mechanisms. One of the jet substructure observables is the transverse momentum distribution of hard subjets probed with the Soft Drop algorithm. This algorithm removes soft large-angle components of a jet and identifies a pair of subjets that forms a hard splitting. The momentum balance of the pair is characterized by the $z_g$ observable defined as the fraction of the groomed jet's transverse momentum carried by the softer subjet.

One of the shortcomings is the lack of data which would constrain the nuclear effects of all parton flavours simultaneously without any a priori assumptions. For example, it has been customary to assume that nuclear modifications for both valence quarks u and d are the same. We have studied the prospects of using the Drell-Yan dilepton process in pion-nucleus collisions as a novel input in the global analysis of nPDFs [1]. In a NLO QCD framework, we find the measured nuclear cross-section ratios from the NA3, NA10 and E615 experiments to be largely independent of pion parton distributions and also compatible with the EPS09 and nCTEQ15 nPDFs. These data sets can thus be included in global nPDF analyses without introducing significant new theoretical uncertainties or tension with the other data.

The initial collision geometry proposed in our model could impact significantly the interpretation of data specially sensitive to it, like the eccentricities of proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.
The hollowness effect, not observed at lower energies, consists in a depletion of the inelasticity density at zero impact parameter of the collision. Counterintuitively, there is more inelasticity when the two protons are at about half a fermi transverse separation that for head-on collisions. Our analysis is based on three main ingredients: we rely gluonic hot spots inside the proton as effective degrees of freedom for the description of the scattering process. Next we assume that some non-trivial correlation between the transverse positions of the hot spots inside the proton exists. Finally we build the scattering amplitude from a multiple scattering, Glauber-like series of collisions between hot spots. In our approach, the onset of the hollowness effect is naturally explained as due to the diffusion or growth of the hot spots in the transverse plane with increasing collision energy. Furthermore, we will explore the impact of the non-trivial correlations between the transverse positions of the hot spots in the calculation of eccentricities in proton-proton collisions, a highly debated topic nowadays as there are suggestive signals of collective phenomena, associated to the formation of QGP in heavy ion collisions, in this smaller system that may be caused by the initial state geometry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Alba', 'last_name': 'Soto Ontoso', 'fullName': 'Soto Ontoso, Alba', 'id': '2799545', 'affiliation': 'UGR/FIAS', 'emailHash': 'c5e6d9bc49c877c562c3d76180406fce', 'db_id': 2799545, 'person_id': 2993660}"

For the purposes of illustration, we show the explicit form of the result from 1 to 3 gluon emissions then present the general expression for any generic n numbers of gluons.  In particular, we compute for the first time analytically the QCD corrections to the multi-gluon Poisson approximation and evaluate numerically the importance of these corrections. Since all current energy loss calculations assume that the Poisson distribution of photons from QED bremsstrahlung is a good approximation for the multi-gluon radiation in QCD, our results will prove invaluable to leading particle and jet energy loss modellers.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Andriniaina', 'last_name': 'Rasoanaivo', 'fullName': 'Rasoanaivo, Andriniaina', 'id': '2799555', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': 'b878dd2a599b633c1b178c861f2523aa', 'db_id': 2799555, 'person_id': 2993667}"
Poster Session,poster,Charm $v_2$ is more hydrodynamic than light quark $v_2$,"Li, Hanlin",Wuhan University of Science and Technology & Purdue University,USA,"Azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ is a useful tool for the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recent studies with parton transport models suggest, however, that the majority of light quark $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons, not hydrodynamic flow [1-4]. Heavy quarks, produced by hard scatterings at early times in relativistic heavy ion collisions, are regarded as an excellent probe of the QGP. Is charm quark $v_2$ mainly from anisotropic escape or hydrodynamics? In this talk we try to address this question using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model, which has been very successful in describing experimental data for the bulk matter [5]. We follow the entire evolution history of charm quarks in AMPT and study the development of charm $v_2$ in heavy ion collisions as well as small system collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies. We find the common escape mechanism to be at work for both charm and light quark $v_2$. However, in contrast to naive expectations, the charm $v_2$ appears to be more sensitive to hydrodynamics than light quark’s $v_2$. We then use a simple Monte Carlo simulation to shed insights on the results. Our finding thus highlights the importance of heavy quark flow in the study of the QGP.

The transition from positive to negative values of $c_{2}\{4\}$ in high-multiplicity events, which has been taken as an experimental evidence of collectivity, is observed in our hydrodynamic calculations with the same multiplicity cuts and acceptance cuts as the CMS measurements. We further study the mass ordering of anisotropy $v_{2}$ among different particle species.

Poster Session,poster,Background subtraction in jet-hadron and di-hadron correlations using the reaction plane fit method,"Nattrass, Christine",University of Tennessee (US),USA,"Jet-hadron and di-hadron correlations are sensitive to the low momentum and large angle modifications induced by interactions with the medium and allow higher precision measurements than jet-by-jet measurements because the background can be determined by averaging over several jets.  However, the combinatorial background has limited the precision of these measurements.  The Zero Yield At Minimum method, the standard method, has limitations, particularly at low momenta where modifications may broaden the jet.  Typically the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal asymmetries ($v_n$) of the background are taken from independent measurements of flow coefficients.  This means that the standard method is also not robust to effects which lead to different $v_n$ in jet-like correlations, including the impact of different $v_n$ due to flow and due to jet quenching at high momenta.  

We present an alternate method, the Reaction Plane Fit (RPF) method, which uses the reaction plane dependence of the $v_n$ to constrain the shape and level of the background in the background dominated region at large $\Delta\eta$.  We demonstrate the efficacy of this method using a toy model.  We then apply the RPF method to di-hadron correlations relative to the reaction plane measured by STAR.  We present the correlation functions and calculate the yields, per-trigger yield modification factor ($I_{AA}$), and the widths.  Using this method, the shape of the correlation functions show little shape dependence relative to the reaction plane, an increasing $I_{AA}$ with decreasing momentum.  This is consistent with the broadening and softening of jets seen in measurements of full jets at the LHC, rather than the ""Mach cone"" structure observed in earlier studies.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Christine', 'last_name': 'Nattrass', 'fullName': 'Nattrass, Christine', 'id': '2799574', 'affiliation': 'University of Tennessee (US)', 'emailHash': '2ed7799a1532e9e2b1161e10d8a6da69', 'db_id': 2799574, 'person_id': 2993678}"

A theoretical understanding of these transitions and their interrelations is of fundamental importance. While it is widely perceived that their dynamics arises from nontrivial topological configurations in Yang-Mills theories, a concrete and sophisticated realization of such idea is an outstanding challenge. We report significant progress along this direction by the construction of a new framework based on correlated ensemble of instanton-dyons, namely the constituents of the finite-temperature instantons with non-trivial holonomy. We present a comprehensive numerical study of confinement properties in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature, obtaining important observables such as the effective holonomy potential, the static-quark potentials from Polyakov loop correlators as well as spatial Wilson loops, among others. These results are compared with lattice data.

In the first approach, we obtain both the spinodal boundaries of the unstable modes with different wavelengths and the growth rates of them at a certain temperature and baryon density in the early stage of phase separation. We find the spinodal boundaries shrink with the wavelengths of the unstable modes, and the spinodal instability is suppressed by a repulsive vector interaction. In the second approach, we study the spinodal instability of the baryonic rich quark matter in both a static box and an expanding fireball by investigating the time evolution of the quantities such as the scaled density moments, the event distribution of the particle numbers in a sub-volume, the event distribution of the anisotropic flows, and the dilepton yield.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Feng', 'last_name': 'Li', 'fullName': 'Li, Feng', 'id': '2799583', 'affiliation': 'Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Study', 'emailHash': '9760c91439c9c7e9d01c878398931e11', 'db_id': 2799583, 'person_id': 2993683}"

Furthermore I will show how the hadronic rescattering decorrelates the initial distributions of conserved charges in a fixed acceptance window of a nuclear collision.

Further insights into radial dependence of momentum balance in central Pb+Pb collisions show that the soft particles carrying the balance are scattered at large angles to jet axes in the direction of subleading jet.

Thus, $l^{+}l^{-}$ pair measurements play an essential role in the study of hot and dense nuclear matter, created in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, a significant excess of $J/\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_{T}<0.3$ GeV/$c$) was reported by the ALICE [1] and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions. These observations may point to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions while traditionally coherent photoproduction is thought to only exist in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions when the traversing nuclei remain intact. It is interesting to investigate the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in a wider invariant mass region ($M_{ee}<4$ GeV/$c^{2}$) at very low $p_{T}$ in heavy-ion collisions for different centrality bins. If the coherent photoproduction mechanism is confirmed, the coherently photoproduced $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs accompanying violent hadronic collisions may provide a novel probe of the hot and dense nuclear matter.

The structure of $t$ ($t = p_{T}^{2}$) distributions of  these three mass regions and comparisons with that in ultra-peripheral collisions will be shown. The centrality dependence of these $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair measurements will be reported, and physics implications will be discussed.

Poster Session,poster,EoSization in non-conformal holgraphic shockwave collisions,"attems, maximilian",University of Barcelona,Unknown,Understanding the properties of extreme phases of nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions is one of the major challenges in theoretical physics. A question that is central to the understanding of the very early stages of such collisions near the cross-over temperature of QCD is: How do non-conformal properties affect the resulting plasma? In this presentation we address this problem in a strongly coupled setup via the gauge/gravity duality by utilizing numerical relativity techniques to describe black hole formation in the gravity side. This allows to access real-time dependent non-equilibrium dynamical quantities like pressure gradients and bulk viscosity. We observe that the equation of state is not obeyed out of equilibrium. We do a systematic explore when the equation of state is applicable again -  and will coin this time-scale the EoSization time.

Poster Session,poster,Dynamical quarkonia suppression in a realistic AA background,"Katz, Roland",University of São Paulo,Unknown,"The suppression of the quarkonium states in AA collisions, observed by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC and by the CMS and ALICE collaborations at LHC, is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The precise survival of excited states vs ground states could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions, according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature. 

In our contribution, we address the question of charmonium and bottomonium dissociations resorting to a dynamical approach, i.e. the non-linear Schroedinger-Langevin equation (SLE). In this scheme, a time-dependent real potential reflects the Debye-screening of the heavy quark/antiquark pair self interaction, while a fluctuation/dissipation mechanism expresses its hard interactions with the QGP. The SLE enables to treat the transitions to open quantum states and between bound states, which play an important role for excited state final populations. It allows to consider a realistic compact initial state, made of a linear superposition of eigenstates and to preserve quantum coherence and unitarity in the time-evolution of a pair.
In a stationary QGP, our SLE naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of the states following correct statistical weights, which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination. This sanity check is a unique feature of our approach.
 
We will describe the most important properties of the SLE. We will then present the suppression prediction resulting from the SLE embedded in the state-of-the-art EPOS evolution scenario of the QGP background. Including initial cold nuclear matter effects, the pT and centrality dependences of the yields will be discussed both for RHIC and LHC energies.

II (FR),France,"Quarkonia are mesons formed of either a charm and anti-charm quark pair (J/Psi, Psi(2S)), or a beauty and anti-beauty quark pair (Upsilon(1S), (2S) and (3S)). In high-energy hadronic collisions such as those delivered by the LHC between 2010 and 2015, quarkonium production results from the hard scattering of two gluons in a process which occurs very early in the collision followed by the hadronization of the heavy quark pair in a bound state. In pp collisions, quarkonium measurements help characterize production mechanisms. These same measurements also provide a reference baseline for p-A and A-A measurements which in turn quantify cold and hot nuclear properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). While charmonia are produced rather abundantly in such collisions, interpreting the measurement of their inclusive production is complicated by the presence of a sizable non-prompt contribution from the decay of b-hadrons. Bottomonia on the other hand have much smaller production cross sections but no non-prompt contribution. Moreover, their heavier mass makes them more suitable for perturbative QCD calculations. In this presentation we will report on forward rapidity ($2.5 \lt y \lt 4$) $\rm{J}/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$ and $\Upsilon$  latest results in the di-muon decay channel performed by ALICE in pp collisions at a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, using data collected at the LHC during the 2015 run and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 3.5 pb$^{-1}$.

Poster Session,poster,J/ψ yield enhancement at very low transverse momentum in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=5.02 TeV with ALICE,"Zhou, Zhuo",University of Bergen (NO),NO,"A large excess in the yield of J/ψ at very low transverse momentum compared to the expectations from the nuclear overlap region was recently reported by ALICE in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at √sNN=2.76 TeV. The observation, made at forward rapidity (2.5<y<4.0) for pT<300 MeV/c using the muon spectrometer, is suggestive of coherent J/ψ photo-production, similar to the measurements done in ultra-peripheral collisions, where the nuclei interact only electromagnetically.

 

During the LHC Run-2, ALICE recorded a large sample of Pb-Pb collisions which allows the measurement of the very low pT J/ψ production also at mid-rapidity, in the di-electron decay channel. An important aspect of this analysis is that the reconstruction is done using the central barrel detectors, with a much better momentum resolution, making our new measurement sensitive to key characteristics of the J/ψ coherent photo-production component, like the shape of the transverse momentum spectrum.

Poster Session,poster,Many-body T-matrix Approach to Strongly Coupled Quark Gluon Plasma,"Liu, Shuai",Texas A&M University,USA,"Current experimental findings at RHIC and LHC imply that a strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is created in heavy-ion collisions. This calls for a non-perturbative investigation to understand relations between various observables and the underlying physical mechanisms. Considering the difficulties in first principle approaches, we have developed a tractable non-perturbative many-body T-matrix model to investigate the strongly coupled features of the QGP. Through our recent developments [1,2],  we can self-consistently solve the thermodynamics of our model including resummed non-perturbative t-channel contributions [3], where two-body resonance and scattering states are treated on equal footing. Inputs of the model are constrained by matching thermal Euclidian-time quantities with lattice QCD, such as static quark free energy, equation of states (EoS), and various susceptibilities. With these constrained inputs, the model can directly calculate various real-time amplitudes and spectral functions that closely relate to observables without involving analytic continuations. More concretely, matching to heavy-quark (HQ) free energy data, we extract a strongly coupled potential [1]. Using this potential as input, we find broad light-parton spectral functions by comparing to the EoS [2]. With these constraints, we obtain large HQ relaxation rates with nontrivial temperature and momentum dependences. Results from implementing these into a HQ transport model will be compared to low-momentum heavy-flavor observables from experiments [4]. We also discuss the calculation of the EoS at finite chemical potential and the comparison to susceptibilities at the finite temperature.

Poster Session,poster,Experimental study of vector meson in nuclear medium at J-PARC,"Aoki, Kazuya",KEK,Japan,"Hadrons are elementary excitations of the QCD vacuum
thus they reflect the property of the vacuum.
Indeed it is the chiral symmetry breaking of the QCD vacuum that leads to the generation of hadron mass.
The vacuum properties could change according the the enviroment, namely the temperature and the density
but are not well explorered.
For the understanding of QCD and its structure,
it is important to study the hadron properties under different environment.

Our experiment, J-PARC E16, has been proposed to measure hadron mass in nuclear medium,
to study a high density part of the QCD phase,
in contrast to the studies in rather high temperature part being performed at RHIC and LHC.
J-PARC E16 uses p+A->phi+X reactions and the invariant mass of phi meson
is reconstructed with e+e- decay. The measured phi mesons may or may not escape
the target nucleus at the time of their decay, thus the measurement is sensitive to in-medium
changes of hadron mass. As the nuclear targets, CH2, C, Cu and Pb are planned.

The advantage of the experiment is the good mass resolution and the
ability to collect high statistics for the phi mesons.
A mass resolution of 7 MeV/c^2 is expected for phi meson with the spectrometer
which is under construction.
The large acceptance and the high luminosity capability
allow us to collect 10^5 of phi mesons with the full spectrometer,
make it possible to measure the dispersion relation for the first time.
KEK E325 experiment, the predecessor experiment of J-PARC E16,
collected 10^3 of phi mesons with a mass resolution of 10 MeV/c^2
and measured in-medium mass of phi mesons
which may be related to the chiral symmetry restoration at normal nuclear density.
J-PARC E16 will study this with a better resolution and with 100 times better statistics.

Due to budgetary limitations, we adopt staging approach.
We start with a limited acceptance (likely 1/3) of the spectrometer by 2018
and take physics data. Then we prepare the full spectrometer
for the ultimate goal. A special beam line is being prepared
for the experiment and is planned to be completed by 2019. 
 
We discuss the expected physics results and
report the preparation status of the beam line and the experiment.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Kazuya', 'last_name': 'Aoki', 'fullName': 'Aoki, Kazuya', 'id': '2799688', 'affiliation': 'KEK', 'emailHash': 'ba05cf23f1d8bafe174a36f98a11c8aa', 'db_id': 2799688, 'person_id': 2993746}"

Underlying-event measurements therefore provide a tool to study non-factorizable and non-perturbative phenomena. Systematic measurements of the relationship between the underlying event and jet processes help to disentangle initial and final state effects. Jet-hadron correlations give insights into the jet contribution to the underlying event, which needs to be accounted for when making collectivity measurements in small systems. Underlying-event activity is measured by particle production in the azimuthal direction perpendicular to the leading jet in the event. Measurements of underlying-event activity dependence on the leading jet transverse momentum in p+p collisions at 200 GeV will be presented and a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, other energies, and asymmetrical collisions will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Li', 'last_name': 'Yi', 'fullName': 'Yi, Li', 'id': '2799677', 'affiliation': 'Yale University', 'emailHash': '051ea1ac8fa2c71d3cf2035d4da3ada6', 'db_id': 2799677, 'person_id': 2993738}"
Poster Session,poster,Reinterpretation of higher harmonics from mini-jet propagation,"Okai, Michito",Sophia University,Unknown,"We investigate effects of mini-jet propagation 
on collective expansion of the quark gluon plasma (QGP)
and, based on this picture, reinterpret higher harmonics ($v_{n}$) data
in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energies.
In ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions, 
a  large number of mini-jets are subject to traverse the QGP
 and are expected to disturb its collective expansion
due to deposition of energy and momentum from them.
Thus, we focus on hydrodynamic responses to  propagation	
of a large number of mini-jets in the QGP.
 
We employ a QGP fluid + jet model [1,2]
to demonstrate the above idea.
We solve  (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations
with energy-momentum
source terms.
As an input, we generate partons by using an event generator PYTHIA
with switching off hadronization, combined with a Monte-Carlo version
of the Glauber model.
Instead of setting initial conditions
for hydrodynamic fields,
we make these partons propagate until hydrodynamic initial time and,
during this stage, they deposit
energy and momentum locally.
We suppose these deposited energy and momentum are quickly
equilibrated  to form initial hydrodynamic fields.
Although this is rather phenomenological treatment of thermalization/equilibration,
this naturally generates not only initial fluctuations of geometry
but also those of velocity fields which are often neglected in
the conventional hydrodynamic analysis.
Subsequently we consider survived partons as mini-jets and
simulate hydrodynamic responses to mini-jet propagation.
We find mini-jet propagation
 indeed causes sizable anisotropic flow in the QGP fluid.
This suggests conventional hydrodynamic interpretation of
flow data based solely on initial eccentricity
should be revisited by taking account of correction from mini-jet
propagation and initial random velocity fields.

Poster Session,poster,In-Medium Bottomonium Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions,"Du, Xiaojian",Texas A&M University,USA,"We study bottomonium production at RHIC and the LHC using a transport model including both suppression and regeneration mechanisms. The transport model utilizes a kinetic rate equation [1] to calculate the centrality dependence of the production yields, and a Boltzmann equation for transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra. It has been successful in describing and predicting charmonium data at SPS, RHIC and the LHC. The bottomonium dissociation rates are improved over previous work [2] by using in-medium binding energies from an in-medium T-matrix approach, which, in turn, require to account for both gluo-dissociation (dominant for large binding) and inelastic parton-induced break-up (dominant for weak binding) including interference effects [3]. We also update the equation of state for the bulk medium using lattice-QCD results. For the calculation of the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of the regeneration contribution we use a coalescence model [4] where the input bottom-quark spectra are taken from Langevin transport simulations of bottom quarks [5] to account for their non-equilibrium distributions. We then conduct a systematic analysis of bottomonium observables for the nuclear modification factor as a function of $N_{\rm part}$ and $p_T$ in comparison to ALICE, CMS and STAR data. The comparison suggests that the centrality dependence of the total yields is sensitive to different scenarios for the screening of binding energies. The off-equilibrium bottom-quark spectra are found to play an important role in both the bottomonium $p_T$ spectra and their predicted elliptic, which helps to disentangle the role of regeneration contributions.

A phenomenological approach called AdS/QCD uses a dilaton field to break conformal symmetry. This describes the linear confinement of hadronic spectra at zero temperature. Using an AdS-black hole metric allows for the study of the behavior of hadrons interacting with a hot, dense medium like the quark-gluon plasma.

We present an improved AdS/QCD model for meson spectra and chiral dynamics at finite temperature and baryon chemical potential. We find a second-order chiral phase transition in the chiral limit, with a critical temperature of 155 MeV and critical baryon chemical potential of 566 MeV, consistent with lattice calculations. For physical quark mass the transition is a rapid crossover, with a pseudo-transition temperature and density of 151 MeV and 559 MeV, respectively. Using a pure AdS-Schwarzschild metric, the light meson bound states are found to melt before the chiral phase transition occurs. This behavior is modified with appropriate parameterization of the metric.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sean', 'last_name': 'Bartz', 'fullName': 'Bartz, Sean', 'id': '2799686', 'affiliation': 'Macalester College', 'emailHash': '68b9f050237d838d04ecdb3847736c08', 'db_id': 2799686, 'person_id': 2993744}"

However, a quantum field theoretical way to handle such a locally thermalized matter has not been clearly clarified.

In this study, we develop imaginary-time formalism for relativistic quantum field theories under local thermal equilibrium. We show microscopically that the Masseiu-Planck functional, which is a thermodynamic potential for locally thermalized systems, plays a role as the generating functional for the expectation values of conserved current operators such as the energy-momentum tensor and electric current in local thermal equilibrium. We also provide the complete path-integral formulation of the Masseiu-Planck functional from a scalar field [1] to a spinor field [2], in which it is written in terms of the emergent thermally curved spacetime with the notable intrinsic symmetry properties: Kaluza-Klein gauge symmetry, spatial diffeomorphism symmetry, and gauge symmetry for external fields. With the help of the symmetry argument, we can construct the nondissipative part of the hydrodynamic equations including the anomaly-induced transport such as the chiral magnetic effect.

Examples include the collective behaviour of the QGP medium, jets, quantum statistics or Coulomb effects, conservation laws, and decays of resonances. In this talk, we report such measurements from ALICE with identified particles (pions, kaons, protons, and lambdas) in pp at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and p-Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions. The analysis of identified particles in pp collisions reveals differences in particle production between baryons and mesons, which reflect the specific conservation laws for these quantum numbers. For baryon pairs, where both particles have the same baryon number, a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak. Such effects have usually been connected to conservation laws in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions and were thought to be under theoretical control; however, our results present a challenge to the contemporary models (PYTHIA, PHOJET). In case of p-Pb collisions at LHC energies, we report results of two particle correlations with identified trigger particles (pions and protons) selected from the intermediate $p_T$ range (2.0 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/c), where an inclusive baryon to meson enhancement has been observed. Our results are reported as a function of multiplicity. The large enhancement of the baryon to meson ratio observed at intermediate $p_T$ in central heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC can be attributed to coalescence and/or radial flow. These mechanisms may lead to a dilution of the near side jet-like yield, that impacts baryons and mesons differently.

quark-antiquark complex potential is obtained by correcting both the
Coulombic and the linear terms in the Cornell potential
through the dielectric function in real-time formalism using the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation.
We show the variation of both the real and the imaginary parts of the potential for different values of velocity
when the bound state is aligned in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the velocity of the thermal medium.
We find that real part of potential increases with the increase in velocity at short distances and becomes 
less screened but it decreases with increase in velocity at large distances for the parallel case. On the other
hand, the potential decreases with the increase in velocity for the perpendicular case which results in 
the more screening of the potential. Since the $ Q\bar{Q} $ potential is effectively more screened 
in the moving plasma, it results in the earlier dissociation of quarkonium states in a moving medium.
The inclusion of string term makes the potential less screened as compared to the Coulombic term alone for both the cases.
Combining all these effects we expect a stronger binding of a $ Q\bar{Q} $ pair in moving medium in the presence of string
term as compared to the Coulombic term alone. The imaginary part decreases (in magnitude) with increase in velocity and 
increases (in magnitude) with inclusion of string term. We also calculate the decay width of the quarkonium state  
and find that width decreases with increase in velocity and increases with the inclusion of the string term.
All of these effects leads to the modification of the quarkonium suppression.

We seek independent experimental information on the degree of thermalization in order to identify those truly hydrodynamic collision systems in which flow is sensitive to equilibrium QCD properties. 

We aim to develop a protocol for identifying the degree of thermalization using a combination of momentum and multiplicity correlation observables. To study the effect of thermalization on these correlations, we turn to the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation with Langevin noise. We derive a new nonequilibrium transport equation for the two-body distribution function that is consistent with the conservation laws obeyed by microscopic scattering processes. We find that these conservation laws constrain the long-range behavior of the correlation observables to behave differently depending on the degree of thermalization.

We report the update of our Color-Glass-Condensate (CGC) calculation of heavy flavor production including quarkoniums, open heavy flavor mesons and decay leptons. Moreover, we will implement more realistic treatment for the initial saturation scale in the target nucleus with the Monte-Carlo (MC) Glauber approach. Within the MC-Glauber approach, we can take into account the initial fluctuation of nucleon distribution and discuss event activity dependence of heavy quark production in p$A$ collisions.

In a series of our papers [1,2,3], we have computed heavy quark production in p$A$ collisions in the CGC framework. Essentially, our calculations have been based on the CGC framework at leading order (LO) with the running coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation (rcBK) which includes a subset of next-to-leading order (NLO) correction. A main difference between pp and p$A$ collisions is the choice of the initial saturation scale in the rcBK equation. 

We update the evaluation of the nuclear modification factors of $J/\psi$, $D$ meson productions (Refs. [1,2]) by varying the initial saturation scale more systematically and also by extending the calculation with the MC-Glauber implementation. We find that the $R_{{\rm p}A}$ is quite sensitive to the initial saturation scale for nucleus. In Ref. [3], we have computed heavy flavor decay leptons $l$, which should be compared with the new experimental data. 

In this talk, we will first review our previous results and then report our update for $J/\psi$, $D$, and $l$ productions in p$A$ collations at the LHC energy.

Unlike numerical solutions, the analytic approach provides an intuitive picture of the classical gluon field, and its energy momentum tensor, at the earliest times (tau < 1/Qs).  Here we use our previous work as the basis for the construction of an event generator that can provide a dynamical evolution of the system at early times. We calculate the time-evolution of the field strength tensor and the energy momentum tensor event-by-event in full SU(3). Using the previously established analytic methods makes the event generator fast and well controlled. It also makes it easy to single out non-abelian effects in the time evolution and to study them separately.

Poster Session,poster,Quarkonium production and polarization in pp collisions with the CMS detector,"Ferraioli, Chris",University of Maryland (US),USA,"Studies of the production of heavy quarkonium states are crucial to improve our understanding of QCD and hadron formation. Large data samples of S-wave quarkonium states decaying in the dimuon channel have been collected by CMS in pp collisions at 7, 8 and 13 TeV, profiting from a very selective trigger and the record-level energy and luminosity provided by the LHC. This allowed the CMS collaboration to perform a series of systematic measurements in quarkonium production physics, including double-differential cross sections and polarizations, as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum, and charged-particle multiplicity, for five S-wave quarkonia: J/psi, psi(2S), Y(1S), Y(2S) and Y(3S). CMS can also reconstruct low-energy photons through their conversions to e+e- pairs, then tracked in the high-granularity silicon tracker with a very good precision, resulting in an extremely good mass resolution, so that the J=1 and J=2 chi_c states can be resolved. This allows CMS to determine cross section ratios and feed-down decay fractions involving the chi states, in both the charmonium and bottomonium families. This talk presents the CMS quarkonium production results, in pp collisions, placing emphasis on the latest measurements, which include results from the run 2 of the LHC. Preliminary results on the chi_c polarization should also become available in time for this talk.

Poster Session,poster,"Exotic hadrons, hardronic molecules and resonance production from relativistic heavy ion collisions","Cho, Sungtae",Kangwon National University,Unknown,"High energy heavy ion collisions are found to be excellent factories for producing heavy hadrons and composite particles including light (anti)nuclei. With upgraded detectors, we are now able to measure hadrons beyond ground states. Thus, heavy ion collisions provide new ways of studying exotic hadrons, which are the primary interests in hadron physics, as many experiments other than heavy ion collisions have already found exotic candidates and their existence itself is related to the fundamental problems in QCD.

We discuss here the production of exotic hadrons with strange, charm and bottom quarks in heavy ion collisions, and show how, if measured, the production rates can be used to discriminate between compact multiquark configuration from hadronic molecular configurations [1,2]. We extend our previous study to include newly discovered states such as Zb, X(5568) and Pc, and present realistic estimates on their production yields. We furthermore discuss feasibility of confirming their existence and discriminating their structure from measurements in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.   

Specifically, we consider the coalescence and statistical hadronization model to calculate the production yields of exotic hadrons. We give detailed discussions on the application of the coalescence model to resonant states by including finite decay widths, and show that the production yields are sensitive to structures of exotic hadrons, namely compact multi-quark states or extended hadronic molecule states. We also investigate the production of scalar mesons, Lambda(1405), dibaryons, and Ds mesons in addition to charmonium-like and bottomonium-like states called X, Y, Z, which have been recently reported in several accelerator facilities, Belle, BaBar, BESS, LHCb and so on.

We compare the results obtained from several formulations of viscous hydrodynics and a recent approach to anisotropic hydrodynamics, which treats the pressure anisotropy in a non-perturbative fashion.
As expected from presvious comparisons, viscous hydrodynamics and anisotropic hydrodynamics have a relatively good agreement in the center (mid rapidity) of the system. However the situation is very different at the edges. All formulations of viscous hydrodynamics provide large negative pressures for large rapidities which may leads to misleading conclusion about particles production. The passage from positive to negative pressure has the character of a shock (sudden change in narrow range of rapidity), and may be probematic for the determination of freeze-out hypersurfaces, especially for event-by-event simulations and small systems.

Poster Session,poster,Viscous corrections to inelastic photon production channels in QGP,"Hauksson, Sigtryggur",McGill University,Unknown,"Photons emitted in heavy-ion collisions are sensitive to the entire history of the system evolution as they are emitted in all stages of the collision. As such they are excellent probes of the out-of-equilibrium nature of a fast evolving system. The degree of
out-of-equilibrium is encoded in the transport coefficients (the shear and bulk viscosities) and the so-called $\delta f$ corrections to the equilibrium density function. The importance of these corrections on hadronic observables has been shown in [1]. However, their effects on electromagnetic observables has been explored only for the 2-to-2 scattering channels [2]. Viscous corrections to the inelastic leading-order photon production channels have been lacking so far. In this work, we will present first calculations of the shear and bulk viscous correction to the Arnold-Moore-Yaffe (AMY) photon production rates which include bremsstrahlung and pair annihilation without relying on the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. We fold the rate with a hydrodynamic evolution in order to examine the phenomenological implications on photonic observables in AA collisions. Finally, we will discuss how the methods used in this calculation pave the way for the viscous correction to other processes in QGP where coherence between different scattering sites is important, such as jet-medium interaction.

In order to discriminate decay photons with very small opening angle from neutral pions, which is the dominant background, an extremely high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeter is required, which we propose as a detector upgrade to the ALICE experiment, the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal).

 

To facilitate the design of the upgrade and to perform generic R&D necessary for such a novel calorimeter, a compact Si/W sampling electromagnetic calorimeter prototype using CMOS pixel sensors with a granularity of 30×30 μm has been built and used for measurements in test beams. This digital calorimeter has shown to have good energy linearity and a very small Moliere radius(∼11mm). We will discuss new results of the R&D with electromagnetic showers, in particular a position resolution of better than 30μm, and first studies of hadron identification performance.

Poster Session,poster,Holographic photon production and flow in heavy ion collisions,"Yang, Di-Lun",RIKEN,Unknown,"Thermal-photon production from the quark gluon plasma (QGP) phase plays an imperative role for direct photon production in heavy ion collisions. In most of theoretical approaches, the emission rate from the perturbative calculation with hard thermal loop resummation is applied. In order to facilitate our understandings for the impact from coupling dependence on the photons from QGP phase, we resort to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Despite the distinction between holographic duals and strongly coupled QCD, former studies in holography have not incorporated the medium evolution and the contributions from other phases, which make the results difficult to be compared with experiments. We thus perform the state-of-the-art computations to embed the photon emission rates from holography into medium evolution and include other contributions for direct-photon production.  

In this work, the thermal-photon emission from strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature is calculated using holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano limit (V-QCD). The emission rates are then embedded in hydrodynamic simulations combined with prompt photons from hard scattering and the thermal photons from hadron gas to analyze the spectra and anisotropic flow of direct photons at RHIC and LHC. The results from different sources responsible for the thermal photons in QGP including the weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) from perturbative calculations, strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma (as a benchmark for reference), and Gubser's phenomenological holographic model are then compared. It is found that the direct-photon spectra are enhanced in the strongly coupled scenario compared with the ones in the wQGP, especially at intermediate and high momenta, which improve the agreements with data. Moreover, by using IP-glassma initial states, both the elliptic flow and triangular flow of direct photons are amplified at high momenta (pT>2.5 GeV) for V-QCD, while they are suppressed at low momenta compared to wQGP. The distinct results in holography stem from the blue-shift of emission rates in strong coupling. In general, compered to experiments, the theoretical results still underestimate the flow in RHIC.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of magnetic field on flow fluctuations in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"DAS, ARPAN","Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India",Unknown,"Very strong magnetic fields can arise in non-central heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies, which may not decay quickly due to induced currents in the conducting plasma. Presence of very strong magnetic fields in the plasma (of order $10^{15}$ Tesla) during early stages in RHICE has been explored extensively recently primarily in connection with the so called chiral magnetic effect. An important effect of the presence of such strong magnetic fields in the plasma will be to lead to strong variations in velocities of different types of waves in the plasma. In particular the velocity varies with the angle between the wave vector and the direction of the
magnetic field, and also has non-trivial dependence on pressure gradient. This can qualitatively affect the development of anisotropic flow. It was earlier believed that the magnetic field arising from the collision of initial nuclei peaks to strong values for a very short time, essentially the passing time of the Lorentz contracted nuclei (∼ 0.2 fm for RHIC energies). Subsequently it rapidly decays. However, it was later realized that due to induced currents in the conducting plasma, the magnetic field may survive for much longer time of order several fm, and can lead to interesting effects. We carry out magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the effects of this magnetic field
on the evolution of the plasma. We focus on the the elliptic flow as well as the power spectrum of flow fluctuations. Our results show that magnetic field leads to enhancement in elliptic flow. We further find that there are qualitative patterns in the power spectrum of flow fluctuations due to the presence of magnetic field. These features in the power spectrum may provide a clean signal for the presence of strong magnetic field during initial stages. We also show generation of vorticity arising from nontrivial dependence of magnetosonic waves on pressure gradients and magnetic field direction.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'ARPAN', 'last_name': 'DAS', 'fullName': 'DAS, ARPAN', 'id': '2799524', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India', 'emailHash': 'f2fcd79acecc3032a5715d37c1065cb6', 'db_id': 2799524, 'person_id': 2993643}"
Poster Session,poster,Procedure for measuring photon and vector meson circular polarization variation with respect to the reaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,"Tang, Aihong",Brookhaven National Laboratory,USA,"The electromagnetic field pattern created by spectators in relativistic heavy-ion collisions plants a seed of positive (negative) magnetic helicity in the hemisphere above (below) the reaction plane. Owing to the chiral anomaly, the magnetic helicity interacts with the fermionic helicity of the collision system and causes photons emitted in upper and lower hemispheres to have different preferences in the circular polarization. Similar helicity separation for massive particles, owing to the global vorticity, is also possible. In this talk, we lay out a procedure to measure the variation of the circular polarization with respect to the reaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for massless photons, as well as similar polarization patterns for vector mesons decaying into two daughters. We propose to study the yield differentially and compare the yield between upper and lower hemispheres to identify and quantify such effects. This procedure will facilitate the investigation of novel phenomena related to chirality, magnetic field and vorticity in the Quark Gluon Plasma.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Aihong', 'last_name': 'Tang', 'fullName': 'Tang, Aihong', 'id': '2799527', 'affiliation': 'Brookhaven National Laboratory', 'emailHash': '96234423491c977102f92c87b72a7f0d', 'db_id': 2799527, 'person_id': 2993646}"

Poster Session,poster,Measurement of the D+-meson production in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE,"Grosa, Fabrizio",Politecnico e INFN Torino (IT),Unknown,"Open heavy-flavor mesons (particles made of a heavy quark, i.e. charm or beauty, and a light quark) are a unique tool to study and characterize the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in the initial stages of the collisions, and they experience the whole system evolution, interacting with the medium constituents. Since charm and beauty quarks have different mass, their in-medium energy loss is predicted to be different. Therefore, for charmed hadrons, it is crucial to distinguish prompt hadrons (which derive directly from the hadronization of a $c$-quark or from the decay of excited open charm and charmonium states) from those coming from B-hadron decays. The parton energy loss can be studied by measuring the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, defined as the ratio of the measured yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the one in proton-proton interactions, scaled by the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. Another interesting observable is the elliptic flow $v_2$ at low transverse momentum, which can give insight into the possible participation of heavy quarks in the collective expansion of the medium. 
Furthermore, the study of open heavy-flavor hadrons in proton-nucleus collisions, in which the formation of an extended QGP is not expected, can provide an important measurement of the Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, which is crucial for the interpretation of the results from nucleus-nucleus collisions.

The parity doublet model has been improved by adding the six-point interaction of the $\sigma$ (and $\zeta$) meson in the effective mean field Lagrangian, resulting in a good description of nuclear ground-state properties, in particular the nuclear compressibility. The resulting phase diagram of the model agrees qualitatively with expectations from lattice QCD, i.e. it shows a crossover at zero net baryo-chemical potential and a critical point at finite density. Using this model we investigate the dependence of the higher order baryon number susceptibilities as function of temperature and chemical potential.

Poster Session,poster,Neutron skin at the LHC,"Helenius, Ilkka",Tübingen University,Unknown,"High-energy nuclear collisions are often classified in terms of centrality. Theoretically, the centrality binning is determined by Glauber models which take the nuclear density as an input. The nuclear density is traditionally parametrized by the Woods-Saxon form and is taken to be the same for protons and neutrons. However, according to the theoretical expectations and experimental measurements as well, the tail of neutron density extends farther than that of the the protons. This results in growth of the neutron-to-proton ratio at the edges of nuclei - a phenomenon referred to as neutron-skin effect. In high-energy nuclear collisions this relative increase of neutrons at the edges will have an influence on the centrality dependence of high-$p_{\rm T}$ electroweak observables. 

In this talk we present NLO pQCD predictions for the centrality dependence of inclusive high-$p_{\rm T}$ photon production in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC taking into account the neutron-skin effect and spatially dependent nuclear PDFs, EPS09s [[Helenius, Paukkunen, Eskola, arXiv:1606.09044]][1]. In addition, we consider the ratio between positively and negatively charged hadrons as well as W production [[Paukkunen, PLB 745 (2015) 73]][2]. The advantage of these latter observables is that the nuclear modifications of the PDFs largely cancel out allowing for a cleaner study of the neutron-skin effect. According to our predictions, the neutron-skin effect can lead to modifications up to 20% in the most peripheral collisions and could thereby serve as a partial benchmark for the experimental centrality measures. In the future, the neutron skin should play a role in the centrality studies at the planned electron-ion colliders EIC and LHeC.

The electric conductivity is recently gaining attention within several new studies about the possibly strong magnetic field influence in heavy-ion collisions. Our mostly analytic method includes 11 (or more) hadron species with their mutual parametrized (resonance) cross sections. It is based on the Boltzmann equation with a linearized collision term, which can be solved for the coefficients with in principle arbitrary precision. We extend the calculations to the baryon diffusion constant, baryon conductivity and heat flow. Below the phase transition, there is so far very little knowledge about these quantities, and kinetic theory serves as a unique quantitative tool which has a clear physical interpretation. Our results for zero chemical potential are contrasted to  various strong coupling and lattice QCD results. Furthermore, results for finite chemical potentials can be obtained in the same framework.

The reported measurements have been carried out as well using a 'hybrid' system which reconstructs meson candidates by combining one EMCal photon with one PCM photon.

Poster Session,poster,Direct Photon Simulations with POWHEG BOX,"Poppenborg, Hendrik",Westfaelische Wilhelms-Universitaet Muenster (DE),Germany,"Direct Photon Simulations with POWHEG BOX

Direct photons provide particular insight into nuclear collisions. Since they give immediate access to the energy scale of a hard scattering, direct photons allow further constraints of (nuclear) parton distribution functions, especially on the poorly known distribution of initial state gluons. Direct photons have, moreover, the potential to yield unambiguous information on hot nuclear matter; in contrast to hard partonic probes they are not strongly affected by the medium.

In the last two decades, fixed order calculations of direct photons beyond leading order and resummation methods beyond leading log accuracy came to fruition. Yet, a parton shower Monte Carlo approach beyond Leading Order has been neglected so far, which is a pressing issue with respect to the prevalence of shower Monte Carlo generators in the HEP community. Considering that photon fragmentation functions for fixed-order calculations received no major updates in the last two decades, the role of the shower Monte Carlo approach becomes even more significant.

We present the POWHEG BOX implementation of the dominant direct photon production processes $qg \to q\gamma$ and $q\overline{q} \to g\gamma$ at Next-to-Leading Order, interfaced with the PYTHIA8 parton shower. We aim for a robust description of direct photons and investigate therefore various simulation parameters of both the hard scattering kernel and the shower Monte Carlo. We present comparisons to direct/isolated photon measurements from ATLAS, CMS and ALICE and evaluate the improvement with respect to the PYTHIA8 standalone description.

Poster Session,poster,Exploring the charm content of jets in pp collisions with ALICE,"Aiola, Salvatore",Yale University (US),USA,"Jets are a fundamental feature of high-energy particle interactions. 
They result from the fragmentation of hard-scattered partons, 
a key process of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). 
The study of the charm content of jets is interesting because up to now
it has eluded a precise quantitative understanding in the framework of perturbative
QCD (pQCD). This is in contrast with other hard processes that are successfully described
by pQCD, such as top and bottom production and the inclusive jet cross section.
The charm content of jets is known to arise both from prompt production in the process ${\rm gg\, (q\bar{q})} \rightarrow {\rm c\bar{c}}$, and
from the parton shower of gluons and light-flavor quarks.
The relative contribution of these two competing mechanisms is understood only qualitatively
and it is known to depend on the center-of-mass energy of the two colliding protons.
Furthermore charm hadrons coming from the fragmentation of prompt charm jets 
are expected to carry a larger fraction of the total jet momentum,
as compared to those where the charm content arises later in the
parton shower. Therefore the measurement of charm jet fragmentation functions (FFs) 
can be used to estimate the relative strength of the two mechanisms.

Heavy-flavor jets can also provide important insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)
produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as heavy quarks are predicted
to interact with the QGP differently compared to light quarks and gluons. 
However, their production mechanisms must first be studied in the vacuum, 
in order to provide a baseline for the observation of possible modifications induced by the presence of the QGP. 

We present the current status of the measurement of jets that contain a D meson (D-tagged jets) using the ALICE detector.
The aim of the analysis is to extract both the $p_{\rm T}$ spectrum of the D-tagged jets and the jet-momentum fraction of the D mesons. 
We identify D-meson candidates via their hadronic decay channels using topological selections and particle identification.
These D-meson candidates are combined with the other charged tracks reconstructed by the central tracking system, 
using the anti-$k_{\rm T}$ jet-finding algorithm.
We extract the yield of D-tagged jets through an invariant mass analysis of the D-meson candidates associated with each jet, 
in bins of jet $p_{\rm T}$ and momentum fraction carried by the D meson.

by ALICE with minimum bias triggers in pp collisions at 7 TeV. We will discuss also
the perspectives for the same measurement in pp collisions at 8 and 13 TeV using events triggered

Therefore, its associated scaling function can give insight on the location of the critical end point, as well as the critical

Correlations between different order flow harmonics are predicted to be sensitive to transport properties of the produced medium in heavy-ion collision. Magnitudes of measured flow fluctuation are also found to be sensitive to the initial condition and transport properties of QCD medium. Therefore, measurement of such correlations and fluctuation can be used to probe the QCD medium created after the heavy-ion collision.

In the PCM, neutral mesons are measured by detecting decay photons converted in electron-positron pairs which are reconstructed in the ALICE central barrel detectors, Inner tracking system and Time Projection Chamber.

This is the case for all particles produced in hard scattering processes, that can be reconstructed in jets, since they are mainly produced before the complete medium formation and can interact with the plasma during its early stages and its evolution.

Heavy-flavour and jet observables can be combined by reconstructing the spectra of jets that are back-to-back with respect to identified heavy-flavour electrons, produced in the fragmentation and decay of heavy quarks. Thus, this heavy-flavour based measurement is directly comparable to theory since heavy-flavour processes can be theoretically calculated and, similarly to the hadron-jet coincidence analysis, the combinatorial background jets subtraction is improved. The final aim is to compare the measurements in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions in order to identify the effects of nuclear matter and QGP.

Poster Session,poster,Separate measurements of physics background and the possible chiral magnetic effect in p+Au and d+Au collisions at RHIC,"Zhao, Jie",Purdue University,USA,"Metastable domains of fluctuating topological charges can change the chirality of quarks and induce local parity violation 
in quantum chromodynamics.  This can lead to observable charge separation along the strong magnetic field produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). The magnetic field is generated by spectator protons and therefore best measured by the 1st-order harmonic plane ($\Psi_{1}$) using the spectator neutrons. The 2nd-order harmonic plane ($\Psi_{2}$), on the other hand, estimates the initial participant geometry, connected to the elliptic flow anisotropy ($v_{2}$). 

A major background source for CME measurements is the intrinsic particle correlation coupled with $v_{2}$. In heavy-ion collisions,  the $\Psi_{1}$ and $\Psi_{2}$ are correlated, thus the CME and the $v_{2}$-induced background are entangled. 
In small system p+Au and d+Au collisions, the $\Psi_{2}$ is entirely due to geometry fluctuations,  and thus $\Psi_{1}$ and $\Psi_{2}$ are uncorrelated. A correlation measurement w.r.t. $\Psi_{1}$ is only  sensitive to CME while the $v_{2}$-induced background is averaged to zero. Likewise, a correlation measurement w.r.t. $\Psi_{2}$ is only  sensitive to $v_{2}$-induced background while any CME is averaged to zero. 

In this poster, we will present the STAR measurements of three-particle correlation in p+Au and d+Au collisions

temperatures or large nuclear densities.
Various probes were proposed to study this phase of matter, among which $J/\psi$ suppression due to color screening of the quark potential in the QGP is of special interest
since this mechanism implies the formation of the defined matter.
However, contribution from the recombination of charm and anti-charm
quarks in the medium complicates the interpretation of the observed
modification to the $J/\psi$ production in heavy-ion collisions.
Measurements of the second-order harmonic coefficient ($v_2$) of $J/\psi$
azimuthal anisotropy can help disentangle different contributions. For
primordial $J/\psi$ produced at the beginning of the collisions in hard
scatterings, $v_2$ is expected to be close to zero, whereas regenerated
$J/\psi $ should inherit the anisotropy of the constituent charm quarks.


$J/\psi$ $v_2$ has been measured by the STAR experiment to be consistent
with zero for $J/\psi$ $p_{T}>2$ GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV. Since U+U collisions
are expected to create medium of higher energy density compared to Au+Au

Poster Session,poster,Upsilon ground state formation and dissociation inside quark-gluon plasma,"Yao, Xiaojun",Duke University,USA,"Heavy quarkonia can be used as probes in heavy-ion collisions since the yield will contain imprint of the initial states and in-medium evolution, which can be used to extract properties of the cold and hot nuclear matters. This use of quarkonium as a probe is complicated by several factors: the competition between dissociation and recombination of quarkonium inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the feed-down contributions from excited states to the ground state. Among different quarkonium states, bottomonium ground state $\Upsilon$(1S) is a special probe because of its smaller size and longer thermalization time. A clear understanding of the fate of $\Upsilon$(1S) inside QGP can tell us more information about the suppression mechanism: whether it arises solely from the suppression of excited states, or originates from the suppression of both the ground and excited states. To this end, a consistent treatment of formation and dissociation is needed.
We use potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) to study $\Upsilon$(1S) inside QGP. The dissociation has been studied in pNRQCD but not the formation. The potential terms for the color singlet and octet can be calculated under the weak coupling assumption or fitted from lattice QCD results of the quarkonium free energy. The singlet and octet wave functions are calculated by solving the corresponding Schr$\ddot{\mathrm{o}}$dinger equations. Then the wave functions are used to calculate the in-medium rates of $\Upsilon$(1S) formation and dissociation, which are at leading order through a color dipole interaction. The rates depend on the quarkonium velocity relative to the medium. The two rates are compared as a function of the plasma temperature. Its connection to the phenomenological studies of Upsilon production from heavy-ion collisions will be discussed, together with a future plan to incorporate quarkonium formation and dissociation into transport models for heavy quarks.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Xiaojun', 'last_name': 'Yao', 'fullName': 'Yao, Xiaojun', 'id': '2799584', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '48b8c36abd8c27edd366e973357f1347', 'db_id': 2799584, 'person_id': 2993684}"

The suppression of quarkonia in the medium due to color screening has been proposed as a direct signature of the QGP formation. However, other effects, such as regeneration of quarkonia by the coalescence of uncorrelated quark-antiquark pairs and co-mover absorption, add additional complications to the interpretation of observed quarkonium suppression. Compared to charmonia, bottomonia suffer much less from regeneration contribution and co-mover absorption. Furthermore, the different bottomonium states may dissociate at different temperatures, known as ``sequential melting'', which can be used to help constrain the temperature of the medium.

According to the Lattice Gauge Theory calculation, at small $\mu_{B}$ a ""smooth cross-over"" for the transition from QGP to hadronic system occurs in heavy-ion collisions [1].
Experimentally, however, there is still no evidence for the predicted ""smooth cross-over"". 
One of the possible ways to test the prediction is to measure the higher order cumulants of net-baryon or net-charge multiplicity distribution [2].

Generally the higher order the cumulant, the more sensitve it is to the correlation length. Thus we might observe the signature with measurements of the sixth order cumulant.

Since they propagate through and interact with the hot and dense QCD matter,
measurements of the heavy-flavour production provide relevant information on the early stage of the collisions and parton-medium interaction.
A strong suppression of heavy-flavour hadron production has been observed in the most central heavy-ion collisions with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions, and it is thought to be due to energy loss of heavy flavours in the dense matter. 

This poster presents measurements of electrons from heavy-flavour decays at central rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions.
The dominant source at low $p_{\rm{T}}$ is composed of  electrons from charm-hadron decays, while at high $p_{\rm{T}}$ electrons from beauty-hadron decays  represents a large contribution. 
Thus, the measurement is sensitive to energy loss of charm and beauty in the dense matter.
The $p_{\rm{T}}$ dependence of the nuclear modification factor of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV is shown up to 18 GeV/$c$ in the most central collisions.

Poster Session,poster,Quantifying pre-thermal chiral magnetic effect with chiral kinetic theory,"huang, anping",Tsinghua Unversity,Unknown,"Chiral anomaly is a fundamental aspect of the quantum theory for chiral fermions. In a many-body system containing chiral fermions, such as the hot quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC, the chiral anomaly leads to macroscopic anomalous transport effects. A notable example is the chiral magnetic effect (CME), in which a vector current is generated along an external magnetic field given a nonzero imbalance between right-handed and left-handed fermions in the system. An observation of the CME is of great interest and significant efforts have been made. Current experimental data show encouraging evidences, but suffer from backgrounds. Realistic and quantitative modeling of CME signal is thus critically needed. The magnetic field in heavy ion collisions, however, is likely very short-lived, with its life time shorter than the onset time of hydrodynamics. It is thus a most pressing issue to simulate the CME in the pre-thermal stage in heavy ion collisions. The theoretical tool to do this, is the so-called chiral kinetic theory. We report the first attempt to utilize this tool for quantifying the pre-thermal CME. Exact solutions for collision-less case as well as the relaxation-time-approximation are obtained and used to compute two different CME-induced consequences: a pre-thermal charge separation across reaction plane, as well as a nonzero anomalous current along B field direction.

The radiated gluons induced by the medium are mostly collinear with the mother parton. Therefore, the energy carried by the radiated gluons outside of the jet-cone is very small. However, the $p_T$ broadening effect can enlarge the angle between the mother parton and the radiated gluons. We found that this $p_T$ broadening effect is very important, which almost doubled the radiative energy loss. We also studied the collisional energy loss based on the pQCD calculation. We found that the collisional energy loss is very small comparing with the radiative energy loss.

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of jet fragmentation functions and of their moments in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector.,"Shabetai, Alexandre",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (FR),France,"Produced in a hard scattering at the early stage of the collision a highly energetic parton is first expected to lose energy in the medium before fragmenting into a hadronic spray of particles called jet. A detailed study of the modification of the jet structure and of its fragmentation pattern in vacuum and in medium should provide insights into the QGP properties.
The jet fragmentation functions describe the momentum distribution of hadrons inside a reconstructed jet. In proton-proton (pp) collisions their measurement is important for understanding the mechanisms of parton fragmentation. Such measurements also provide a test of perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (pQCD) as well as a baseline for similar measurements in p-A collisions (revealing potential cold nuclear matter effects) or in A-A collisions (shedding light on the energy loss mechanisms in presence of a hot and dense medium). However, in heavy-ion collisions the presence of a large underlying event and of its event-by-event fluctuations makes the measurement of jet fragmentation functions a challenging task. The use of the fragmentation function moments has been proposed [1] as a way to overcome this difficulty.

The ALICE detector at the LHC has unique tracking capabilities enabling to measure charged particles down to transverse momenta as low as $150~$MeV/c. This allows assessing possible modifications of the jet structure and helps constraining the jet fragmentation functions.

We will present the ALICE measurements of charged-jet fragmentation functions in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV. The first studies of fragmentation function moments will be discussed. The results will also be compared to model predictions.

Poster Session,poster,Machine learning methods in the analysis of low-mass dielectrons in ALICE,"Lehner, Sebastian",Austrian Academy of Sciences (AT),Austria,"Results from non-perturbative QCD indicate that chiral symmetry may be restored in the hot and dense matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions. This restoration would affect the vector meson mass spectrum and could be examined with the ALICE detector at the LHC. One of the most promising probes to study these effects are dileptons ($μ^{+}μ^{-}$ and $e^{+}e^{-}$) from ρ meson decays since they reach the detector without significant final state interactions.
In order to precisely measure the low-mass dielectron spectrum a high purity sample of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs will be required. Whilst traditional cut-based methods can provide high purity samples, they suffer from low efficiency. Multivariate particle identification could in future be used to alleviate this drawback.

The main background in the analysis of dielectrons are combinatoric $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs (S/B ~ $10^{-3}$ for 0.3<$M_{ee}$<1 GeV/c$^{2}$). This background contribution can be suppressed by rejecting $e^{+}$ and $e^{-}$ tracks that originate from photon conversion processes. Numerous observables allow to discriminate background from signal dielectrons which motivates a multivariate approach in the classification of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs.

The employed machine learning methods and performance based on Monte-Carlo data will be presented as well as their application in the analysis of LHC Run 2 data.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Sebastian', 'last_name': 'Lehner', 'fullName': 'Lehner, Sebastian', 'id': '2778420', 'affiliation': 'Austrian Academy of Sciences (AT)', 'emailHash': '7470aa45206d6088a49fea1e79036caa', 'db_id': 2778420, 'person_id': 2973617}"

In hadronic collisions the $E_{\mathrm T}$ is determined by the initial scattering of the partonic constituents of the incoming nuclei as well as re-interactions among the produced partons, hadrons and the created medium, and so it provides information on the collision dynamics, particularly on the amount of incoming longitudinal energy converted into particle production.

Poster Session,poster,Effect of baryon-antibaryon annihilation on thermal model fit to extract chemical freeze-out parameters,"Das, Sabita","Central China Normal University, Wuhan-430079, China",Unknown,"Hadron yields obtained from elementary collisions up to heavy-ions
have been successfully described by 
thermal models with a few parameters such as temperature and baryon
chemical potential [1, 2]. 
However, the LHC$/$ALICE experiment has recently found that the proton
and antiproton yields are a factor of 2 too low compared to thermal
description [3]. This has been shown to arise from
baryon-antibaryon ($B\bar{B}$) annihilations which can still be
appreciable after chemical freeze-out because 
of their large cross-sections while the reverse reactions of
multi-particles fusing into a $B\bar{B}$ pair cannot be sustained [4]. In this study, we include the $B\bar{B}$  annihilation effect
into the thermal model [5] by introducing one more parameter for
the out-of-equilibrium annihilation loss of the protons. We use the quark model description for the annihilation losses of the other (anti-)baryons. We assume
 annihilation of a $B\bar{B}$ pair produces a certain number of mesons
 (default 5 pions and kaons depending on the strangeness
 content) [4, 6]. We fit both heavy-ion data ($\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} = $ 6.27 GeV to 2.76 TeV) and proton-proton collision data ($\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} = $ 200, 900, and 7000 GeV) at SPS, RHIC and LHC energies. We obtain new chemical freeze-out parameters with significantly improved fit quality in comparison to the default thermal model. 
We find that the baryon loss increases with increasing collision
energy while the antibaryon loss decreases. We further find a significant increase in the chemical freeze-out temperature compared to the default
fit, potentially provoking a rethink of the nuclear phase diagram.

This effect has been experimentally observed by the ALICE experiment for Pb-Pb collisions at $\it {\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV via multi-particle correlators [2]. We will present an event-by-event study of the localized charge separation effect in Pb-Pb collisions at $\it {\sqrt{s_{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV using the Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM) which is similar to the Sliding Window Method (SWM) [3] used for neutral-charged fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at 158 A GeV at the SPS. In this method, we are calculating the fraction $Db_{+-}$, which is the sum of the positive charge fraction on the left side of the dumbbell and the negative charge fraction on the right side of the dumbbell. The whole azimuthal plane is scanned by sliding a dumbbell of size ${\Delta \phi} = 90^{\circ}$ in steps of ${\delta \phi} = 1^{\circ}$ and calculating $Db_{+-}$ for each ${\Delta \phi}$ region to extract the maximum value of $Db_{+-}$ in each event. $Db_{+-}$ distributions obtained using the SDM are compared with those of randomly selected dumbbells in each event. The results are presented for different dumbbell sizes of ${\Delta \phi} = 90^{\circ}, 60^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}$.

at the moment of particle emission using two-particle correlations. In comparison to the most abundant pions, kaons provide a cleaner probe as they are less affected by resonance decays. Since kaons contain strange
quarks and have smaller cross section with hadronic matter than pions, they
may be sensitive to different effects and earlier collision stages. In
particular,
these measurements are of interest with the data from RHIC Beam Energy
Scan (BES).

In this talk, we will present the STAR preliminary results on
femtoscopic correlations
of like-sign and unlike-sign kaons from high-statistics dataset of
Au+Au collisions
at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$=200 GeV and Au+Au collisions from BES. The kaon source radii
for 200 GeV are compared to those for pions and the Blast-Wave model
predictions.
The common $m_T$-scaling for pions and kaons would be an indication of the simultaneous
thermal freeze-out. The $m_T$-scaling
breaking is observed
for both 1D and 3D femtoscopic analyses. Such behavior can be
interpreted as earlier
decoupling of kaons compared with pions.

Moreover, the system of unlike-sign kaons contains $\phi$(1020)
resonance which exhibits
high sensitivity. Systematic measurements in the region of resonance
are able to provide
complementary information about the source-size and can serve as a
test of femtoscopic formalism which was developed for measurement at
low relative momenta. Experimental results indicate a breakdown of the
formalism in the region of the resonance in peripheral collisions.
The measured unlike-sign correlation functions are compared to the
Lednicky final state interaction model which includes the treatment of
the resonance decay.

Finally, the technique of decomposition of the experimental 3D
correlation function into the spherical harmonics are used to study
the possible difference between positive and negative kaon sources at

Poster Session,poster,Charge Asymmetry Measurements in Au+Au collisions by STAR in Search of the Chiral Magnetic Effect,"Ajitanand, Nuggehalli",State University of New York at Stony Brook,USA,"Metastable domains of topological charges in QCD can cause chirality
imbalance and, under the strong magnetic field present in heavy-ion
collisions, result in charge separation along the magnetic field, a
phenomenon called the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [1]. Charge
separation can also be caused by intrinsic particle correlations coupled
with elliptic flow anisotropy, a major background for the CME search. In
this talk, we report results by two analysis methods designed to reduce
or eliminate, model-independently, background contributions.

In the first method [2], a correlator Cp is constructed  as the ratio of
real-event to shuffled-event differences between positive and negative
charge distributions of a correlation variable with respect to the event
plane. A second correlator Cp_perp is similarly constructed using the
particles perpendicular to the event plane. The shape of  the
double-ratio $C_p/C_{p_{perp}}$ is concave for a CME-associated charge
asymmetry and flat or convex for all non-CME associated effects. The
observation of a concave shape for $C_p/C_{p_{perp}}$ in the data confirms
the presence of a CME associated charge asymmetry. Quantification of
this signal is obtained via comparisons with data driven simulations.

In the second method [3], correlators are constructed from multiplicity
asymmetries of positive and negative  particles across the event plane.
The same- and opposite-sign difference is studied as a function of the
event-by-event anisotropy of the measured particles. A linear dependence
is observed in both real and mixed-events. The intercept or the
difference between real- and mixed-events measures the charge separation
with reduced flow background.

We present the results obtained via these two methods for Au+Au
collisions at several collision centralities and beam energies at RHIC.
We discuss our results in terms of the CME search.

Poster Session,poster,Time Evolution of Heavy Quarkonium in the Quark-Gluon Plasma from a Stochastic Potential Model,"Kajimoto, Shiori",Osaka University,Unknown,"In relativistic heavy ion collisions, the suppression of heavy quarkonia, such as charmonia and bottomonia, is considered as one of the important signals for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma. Understanding the behavior of heavy quarkonia in such hot matter would enable us in turn to extract the properties of the quark-gluon plasma from experimental data. And while lattice QCD studies have made progress in elucidating fully equilibrated quarkonium, our knowledge of its out-of equilibrium dynamics relevant for heavy-ion collisions remains scarce.


Here we present numerical results for the non-equilibrium real-time evolution of heavy quarkonium states in the quark-gluon plasma based on a recently proposed stochastic potential model [1-3] . The model adds a noise term to the real-valued Debye screened potential term. This noise term explains naturally the complex potential between a heavy quark and a heavy anti-quark, which has been found by both perturbative calculation and lattice calculation, i.e. the imaginary part is related to nontrivial noise correlations. The addition of the noise term to the potential leads to a stochastic Schrödinger equation, which implements unitary time evolution and provides insight on an important mechanism to play a role in the time evolution of a heavy quarkonium: decoherence of the wave function.


We investigate how the quarkonia evolve with the stochastic Schrödinger equation derived from the stochastic potential. In particular, we show the time evolution of the ground and excited states, and how it depends on the temperature of the environment and the correlation length of the noise.

The two different parametrizations are investigated and by comparing 3d-T\raisebox{-0.5ex}{R}ENTo +hydro+UrQMD calculations of the pseudorapidity correlation observable $\langle a_1^2\rangle$ with ATLAS measurement and it is found that the data clearly favors one parametrization over the other.

After calibrating the initial condition model on selected multiplicity observables ($dN_{\text{ch, PbPb}}/d\eta$ and $\langle a_1^2\rangle$),
we calculate pseudorapidity differential flows, event plane decorrelations  and compare with available data from ALICE and CMS as a validation of our parametric model.
Finally, the pseudorapidity dependence of symmetric flow correlation cumulants is predicted, since these observables should be very sensitive to the event-by-event initial state geometry.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Weiyao', 'last_name': 'Ke', 'fullName': 'Ke, Weiyao', 'id': '2799628', 'affiliation': 'Duke University', 'emailHash': '1240602cf275b01cbc3a4cc9b6afb783', 'db_id': 2799628, 'person_id': 2993656}"

At lower transverse momenta where the event-by-event reconstruction of jets becomes difficult, their event averaged effect generates observable correlations, which have been studied using triggered two-particle angular correlation measurements. To control the di-jet production point, we require two back-to-back trigger particles with different momenta.  Using symmetric and asymmetric trigger $p_{T}$ combinations, we are making an attempt to control the path lengths traversed by the triggers.These antipodal triggers allow us a simultaneous comparison of the near and away sides which is difficult otherwise due to the background subtraction involved on the away side, and so lets us compare the impact of different kinematic cuts on the fragmentation bias. 

In this analysis the relative pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions ($\Delta\eta$ - $\Delta\phi$) of particles with respect to both the triggers are constructed, and the yield extracted from a fit to the $\Delta\eta$ projection. The measurement is done in central and semi-central events for three $p_{T}$ combinations of primary and secondary triggers. Heavy ion measurements have been compared with pp reference data which forms a rigorous baseline for correlation measurements. The variation observed between near and away sides will be presented which will shed light on the modification of the $p_{T}$ of jet fragments.

The initial conditions for hydrodynamics are generated using a Glauber-type model which replaces each nucleon in the collision by three quarks. In this model, the quarks obey a joint Gaussian distribution about a nucleon's center of mass, and each quark deposits a Gaussian-shaped cloud of entropy in the transverse plane. By varying the parameters of this model, we quantify the effect of quark substructure on observable quantities. Results from the simulations are compared with experimental data from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS experiments. In particular, the hydrodynamic approach reproduces the observed distribution of particle multiplicities, and further achieves a quantitatively accurate description of the flow coefficients $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ at high multiplicities.

Poster Session,poster,Origin of the mass ordering of $v_n$ from a multi-phase transport,"Lin, Zi-Wei","Central China Normal University, East Carolina University",Unknown,"A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model has been shown to describe experimental data well, including the particle spectra and azimuthal anisotropies ($v_n$) of pions and kaons below $p_T$ of ~1.5 GeV/c in heavy ion collisions [1] as well as small system collisions [2]. By following the parton collision history in AMPT, we have found that the opacity in AMPT is relatively small and the parton $v_n$ is primarily produced by the anisotropic escape mechanism [3]. In this study, we investigate the origin and development of the $v_n$ mass ordering of identified hadrons in heavy ion collisions as well as small system collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies [4]. We show that a fraction of the mass ordering arises from kinematics in the quark coalescence hadronization process, while resonance decays tend to reduce the mass ordering. We find that the majority of the mass ordering comes from hadronic rescatterings, although they have little effect on the overall magnitude of charged hadron $v_n$. These findings are qualitatively the same as those from hybrid models that couple hydrodynamics to a hadron cascade [5-7]. In addition, we find no qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and small system collisions or between RHIC and LHC energies. Our results from the AMPT study thus demonstrate that the $v_n$ mass ordering may not be a distinctive signature of hydrodynamic collective flow, but can be a quantitative interplay of several physics processes.

As most of the heavy quarks are expected to propagate through the medium during its evaluation, they can encode information on different stages of the medium. The D$^0$ meson is the lightest meson containing a charm quark. Measurement of modifications to D$^0$ production in heavy-ion collisions relative to proton-proton collisions can be used to study properties of the nuclear medium.

In addition, asymmetric collisions of ions create systems with asymmetric density distribution, pressure gradient and magnetic field, which provide a good opportunity to study the influence of the asymmetry on particle production. In 2012, the STAR experiment at RHIC recorded Cu+Au collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200~\mathrm{GeV}$. The average number of binary collisions in 0-80$\%$ central Cu+Au collisions corresponds to the semi-central Au+Au collisions with centrality of 40-50$\%$. Measuring D$^0$ production in asymmetric Cu+Au collisions allows to probe charm quark production in a system with different geometry than that of Au+Au collisions.

In this poster, D$^0$ mesons are reconstructed via the hadronic decay channel ($\mathrm{D^0~\rightarrow~K^{-}\pi^+}$) in Cu+Au collisions. The invariant yield and the nuclear modification factor for D$^0$ meson will be shown as a function

In addition to transverse momentum and rapidity differential studies, measurements as a function of multiplicity are sensitive to the dependence of CNM effects on the collision geometry and on the density of final-state particles.

In particular, angular correlations on relative azimuth and pseudorapidity provide novel information about jet-like and collective behavior in these collisions. They also provide independent measures of important physical quantities, such as the second-order harmonic coefficient ($v_{2}$), by separating the quadrupole contribution (related to $v_{2}$) from η-dependent contributions such as those coming from jets and jet quenching. These correlations have already been measured for both unidentified and identified light-flavor hadrons. Heavy flavor (HF) quarks (e.g. charm, bottom) are new and ideal probes of these dynamics because they are predominantly formed in the early stage of the collisions, and therefore can be used to study the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium formed by such collisions.

We present here measurements of $D^{0}$-hadron angular correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s{}_{NN}} = 200$ GeV from the Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment. The $D^{0}$  meson is reconstructed via its hadronic decay channel using the Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT). The correlation structures will be shown as a function of both centrality and $D^{0}$ meson transverse momentum, and compared to the correlations for light-flavor hadrons.

Measurement of dielectron production in pp collisions serves as important vacuum reference to quantify modifications observed in heavy-ion collisions. It also provides complementary information on heavy-flavour production via correlated semi-leptonic decays. Recent studies of proton-proton collisions with high charged-particle multiplicities showed surprising results similar to the observations previously seen in heavy-ion collisions. Measurements of low-mass dielectrons could provide additional information regarding the underlying physics processes.

can reasonably describe the $dN/dy$ yields, $p_{T}$ spectra and
anistropic flows of pions and kaons at low $p_{T}$ in heavy ion

However, it failed to reproduce the $dN/dy$ and $p_{T}$ spectra of
baryons [2,3]. For example, it overestimates the proton yield at
mid-rapidity but underestimates the slope of the proton $p_{T}$
spectra. In addition, antiparticle/particle ratios 
from the current AMPT model are unexpectedly above unity for strange baryons.

In this work we improve the quark coalescence model in AMPT. 
In particular, we have removed the previous constraint that forced the total
numbers of mesons, baryons, and anti-baryons in an event to be separately conserved
through quark coalescence. Instead, a quark or anti-quark now has the
freedom to form either a baryon or a meson, depending on the distance
to its coalescence partner(s). We have also changed the order in quark
coalescence: previously coalescence partners of all mesons are
searched first (ahead of baryons), while now the sequence of meson and baryon
formations is dynamically determined.
In this talk we will show that this improved AMPT model can describe
baryons much better. In particular, the $p_{T}$ spectra of
protons and and $\Lambda$-baryons roughly agree with the heavy ion data at RHIC
and LHC, and antiparticle/particle ratios for strange baryons also
reasonably agree with the data.

Poster Session,poster,Van der Waals interactions in hadron resonance gas: from nuclear matter to lattice QCD,"Vovchenko, Volodymyr",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"An extension of the ideal non-interacting hadron resonance gas (HRG) model 
is constructed
which includes
the attractive and repulsive van der Waals (VDW) interactions between baryons. 
This VDW-HRG model yields the nuclear liquid-gas transition at low temperatures and high baryon densities.
The VDW parameters $a$ and $b$
are fixed by the ground state properties of nuclear matter,
and the temperature dependence of 
various thermodynamic observables at zero chemical potential 
are calculated
within VDW-HRG model. 

Compared to the ideal non-interacting HRG, the inclusion of VDW interactions between baryons leads to a qualitatively different behavior of 2nd and higher moments of fluctuations of conserved charges, 
in particular in the so-called crossover region $T \sim 140-190$ MeV. 
For many observables this behavior resembles closely the results obtained from lattice QCD simulations. 
Detailed comparisons suggest that strange baryons have weaker VDW interactions compared to
non-strange ones.
We also explore the effect of VDW interactions on the thermal fits to heavy-ion hadron yield data and find
that existing agreement of ideal HRG is not spoiled in the VDW-HRG model.
Finally, we find that VDW interactions have a substantial influence on the
higher orders of fluctuations of conserved charges at finite chemical potential,
in the regions where chemical freeze-out in heavy-ion collisions is expected to occur.

Our results imply that VDW interactions play a crucial role in thermodynamics of hadron gas.

Poster Session,poster,Heavy-flavour hadron decay electron correlations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{{s}_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector,"Thomas, Deepa",University of Texas (US),USA,"Heavy quarks (charm and beauty) are unique probes used to understand the properties of the QCD medium produced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Due to their large masses, they are created in the early stages of the collisions and experience the full evolution of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). They interact with its consitutents and lose energy as they travel through the medium. Heavy quarks can be studied by measuring electrons coming from the semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. 

Two particle angular correlation measurements are a powerful tool to study jet quenching especially in ${p}_{\rm{T}}$ regions where direct jet identification is difficult. In such measurements, we observe a near-side peak around $\Delta\varphi \approx 0$, formed by particles associated to a high-${p}_{\rm{T}}$ trigger particle, and an away-side peak around  $\Delta\varphi \approx \pi$, formed by back-to-back dijets. By studying heavy-flavour angular correlations triggered by electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays, we can access information about heavy-flavour jet quenching in the QGP. Near-side correlations can be studied to understand if the fragmentation and hadronization of heavy-quarks are modified by medium effects. 

In this poster, we present the current status of the ALICE measurement of azimuthal angular correlations of heavy-flavour decay electrons with charged hadrons in Pb-Pb collisions  at $\sqrt{{s}_{\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV from the LHC Run 2.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Deepa', 'last_name': 'Thomas', 'fullName': 'Thomas, Deepa', 'id': '2778456', 'affiliation': 'University of Texas (US)', 'emailHash': 'cdef5fe3621778e01f7cfda5547a587f', 'db_id': 2778456, 'person_id': 2973652}"
Poster Session,poster,Forward Calorimetry for Heavy-Ion Physics at the STAR Experiment,"Brown, Daniel",Lehigh University,Unknown,"A forward calorimeter utilizing hadronic and electromagnetic calorimetry at the STAR experiment of RHIC will achieve a variety of physics goals. These goals include studying long-range rapidity correlations, event plane correlations in heavy-ion interactions, and studying the gluon contribution to the proton spin by measuring forward di-jets and forward-mid rapidity jet correlations in proton-proton collisions. Upgrades to the AGS E864 lead-scintillating fiber calorimeter have increased spatial resolution by utilizing cell pixelization. Pixelization increases spatial resolution by replacing a single photosensor on individual 10cm x 10cm cells by a set of nine photosensors, resulting in 3.3cm x 3.3cm pixels. Pixelization was tested with colliding beams at STAR and fixed target test beams at FNAL. Light collection has been optimized and fringe field effects have been minimized by the introduction of Fresnel lenses and mu-metal shielding. A prototype consisting of a 2x3 cell stack was installed into the forward region of STAR for the end of run16. This prototype investigated the introduction of these new techniques as well as a trial of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) as an alternate to traditional Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). SiPMs do not suffer from fringe field effects, but are susceptible to radiation damage by neutrons, so their performance during the prototype operation was analyzed.  The prototype observed Au+Au collisions at 200GeV. There is a proposal to install two 9-column x 12-row cell stacks as forward jet detectors at STAR, with 16 cells in each stack pixelized. This poster will discuss the effects of Fresnel lenses on light collection, mu-metal shielding effects on PMTs, and radiation effects on SiPMs.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Daniel', 'last_name': 'Brown', 'fullName': 'Brown, Daniel', 'id': '2778457', 'affiliation': 'Lehigh University', 'emailHash': 'e0629193f37c57ebe87692b4d0e116df', 'db_id': 2778457, 'person_id': 2973653}"
Poster Session,poster,Jet energy loss in small systems with finite-size effects and running coupling,"Park, Chanwook",McGill University,Unknown,"In the LHC and RHIC experiments, strong collective behavior has been observed in high multiplicity events in the p-p and p-A collisions.
Such behavior strongly suggests that quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is being created even in small systems when enough entropy is produced.
In this work, we utilize an improved version of MARTINI to calculate the effect of the QGP droplet on the jet energy loss in p-A collisions with the well-calibrated 3+1D hydrodynamics medium[1].
The two important improvements implemented in this version of MARTINI are the finite medium size effect[2], and the running coupling effect[3].
Since the system we are dealing with is small, both of these improvements are critical.
Using realistic event-by-event initial conditions, we show that systematic measurements of jet quenching in small systems can provide a strong evidence of the QGP formation[4].
Rapidity dependence of $R_{pA}$ and harmonic flows of energetic partons in small collision systems will be also presented.
In addition, to access information of the medium structure and of missing jet energies, we provide calculations of jet $R_{pA}$ and di-jet imbalance through the full jet reconstruction.

shifts at finite temperature which shares basic features with recent developments within
the PNJL model for correlations in quark matter.

Poster Session,poster,Shear viscosity and entropy of a hadron gas,"Rose, Jean-Bernard",Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies,Unknown,"Microscopic non-equilibrium dynamics are used to calculate the transport coefficients of dense hadronic matter. Specifically, the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is investigated, and its temperature dependence between 75 MeV and 175 MeV is explored, and the effects of non-zero baryon and strange chemical potentials are probed. This is important to constrain the value of shear viscosity over entropy density used in hydrodynamic calculations of heavy ion reactions at RHIC and the LHC. Calculations are initialized using the corresponding particle densities computed from a thermal model in a hadronic box simulating infinite matter. After an appropriate equilibration delay, the shear viscosity $\eta$ is computed using the Green-Kubo formalism. The entropy density $s$ is obtained using the Gibbs formula and $dN/dp$ spectral fitting to obtain the final (equilibrated) temperatures and chemical potentials of the system. As a check, the results for the entropy and shear viscosity of a massive and massless pion gas are compared to analytic estimates. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ is found to be significantly lower than found in previous similar calculations by [Demir & Bass][1], but in qualitative agreement with other calculations using other methods by [Romatschke & Pratt][2] and [Song, Bass & Heinz][3].

Poster Session,poster,Resolution Effects in the Hybrid Strong/Weak Coupling Model,"Hulcher, Zachary",Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US),USA,"Within the context of a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching, we study the consequences of the fact that the plasma produced in a heavy ion collision cannot resolve the substructure of a collimated parton shower within it to arbitrary resolution.
We introduce a screening length parameter, $L_{Res}$, proportional to the inverse of the local temperature in the plasma, estimating the value of the proportionality constant from both weakly coupled QCD calculations and holographic calculations appropriate in strongly coupled plasma.
We then modify the hybrid model so that when a parton in a jet shower splits, its two offspring are initially treated as unresolved, and are only treated as two separate partons losing energy independently after they are separated by a distance $L_{Res}$.  This modification delays the quenching of partons with intermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final state with $p_T$ in the several GeV range.
We demonstrate that this effect modifies the jet shapes and jet fragmentations functions, as it makes it more probable for particles carrying a small fraction of the jet energy at larger angles from the jet axis to survive their passage through the quark-gluon plasma.
We analyze the consequences of different choices for the value of the resolution length $L_{Res}$  on both partonic and hadronic jet shapes and fragmentation functions, as well as on missing-$p_T$ observables. 
More generally, we discuss the qualitative consequences, and importance, of including the effects of finite resolution.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Zachary', 'last_name': 'Hulcher', 'fullName': 'Hulcher, Zachary', 'id': '2814584', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts Inst. of Technology (US)', 'emailHash': '6d3d0d97012a346ef520bcbc24a9ce80', 'db_id': 2814584, 'person_id': 3007604}"

The strength of the FB correlations between event-mean transverse momenta is robust against volume fluctuations and thus the centrality determination methods,

Poster Session,poster,Beam energy dependence of bulk properties via $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ resonances in Au+Au collisions at RHIC,"Singha, Subhash",Institute of Modern Physics CAS,Unknown,"Resonances are excellent probes to understand the properties and evolution of the
QCD medium created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Because of their short lifetime, resonances decay inside the
fireball and their decay daughters interact with particles present in the
medium. If the decay daughters are re-scattered
by other hadrons present in the medium, the resonance signal cannot
be reconstructed. On the other hand, pseudo-elastic interactions
among the hadrons can regenerate resonances. The properties of resonances
such as mass, width and yield are decided by the interplay of these processes. 
The centrality-dependent resonance to non-resonance ratio measured at top 
RHIC and LHC energies already hints at the dominance of
re-scattering in the hadronic phase of the medium at these
energies. The elliptic flow parameter, $v_{2}$, has
been widely used as a tool for understanding the dynamics of the
system created in the early stages of a collision. 
Comparison between $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ is very promising, because the 
lifetime of these examples differ by a factor of ten, and $K^{*0}$ is expected 
to be affected more by the hadronic phase. Moreover, both offer the advantage 
of being vector mesons with masses close to that of the proton.

We report the production of $K^{*0}$ and $\phi$ resonances

Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions.  Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order flow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented.

Prior measurements have shown that in $pp$ collisions with a large multiplicity of produced particles, a long-range structure (the ``ridge'') develops along $\Delta\eta$ at $\Delta\phi\sim$0. However, due to the presence of the large away-side jet, the full $\Delta\phi$ dependence of the long-range correlation could not be studied. In this analysis, a template fitting procedure is implemented to determine the contributions from dijets to the correlations, using low-multiplicity
events, and to extract the genuine long-range correlation. The long-range correlations are shown to be present even in events with a small multiplicity of produced particles, implying that the long-range correlations are not unique to rare high multiplicity events.

In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot hadronic matter by extracting it from the rho-meson spectral function, as its zero-energy limit at vanishing momentum. Recent calculations of the electric conductivity in hot nuclear matter have been performed in different approaches but show significantly varying results.
Using hadronic many-body theory, we calculate the rho meson self-energy in a pion gas. Previously the effects of in medium nucleons and delta particles on the pion cloud of the rho propagator have been calculated. However the effects of thermal pions on the pion self-energies were not included. This requires the determination of the relevant interactions between in-medium pions and the rho meson, and the calculation of these interactions. This calculation requires the dressing of the pion propagators in the rho self-energy with pion-rho loops. To maintain gauge invariance one must calculate vertex corrections to the rho self-energy loops. Using guidance from previous works, we calculate these vertex corrections relativistically. The resulting spectral function is used to calculate the electric conductivity of hot hadronic matter. In particular, we analyze the transport peak of the spectral function and extract its behavior with temperature and coupling strength. Our results suggest that, while obeying lower bounds set by conformal field theories in the strong-coupling limit, the pion gas is a strongly coupled medium.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Joseph', 'last_name': 'Atchison', 'fullName': 'Atchison, Joseph', 'id': '2814809', 'affiliation': 'Texas A&M University', 'emailHash': '9f4b02fbef8efc94ef9a29f9a3fc9da3', 'db_id': 2814809, 'person_id': 3007828}"

Different models predict different levels of enhancement in the $\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio depending on the degree of charm quark thermalization in the medium and how the coalescence mechanism is implemented. 

In this poster, we will report the first measurement of $\Lambda_{c}^+$ production in heavy-ion collisions using the recently installed Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. $\Lambda_{c}^+$ are reconstructed through the hadronic decay channel ($\Lambda_{c}^+$ $\rightarrow$ $pK\pi$) using topological cuts optimized by the Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis (TMVA). After correcting for the reconstruction efficiency and acceptance, the transverse-momentum spectrum of $\Lambda_{c}^+$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be presented. The measured $\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio will be compared with different model calculations, and the physics implications will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Guannan', 'last_name': 'Xie', 'fullName': 'Xie, Guannan', 'id': '2778497', 'affiliation': 'LBNL/USTC', 'emailHash': 'd3f3ff506067c5c7300b7dbd232d956b', 'db_id': 2778497, 'person_id': 2973685}"
Poster Session,poster,Centrality Determination for p+Au Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR Experiment,"Liu, Yanfang",TAMU,Unknown,"In heavy-ion collisions, properties of the created QCD matter highly depend on the collision geometry or ''centrality''. In A+A collisions, centrality is related to the size of the overlap region determined by the impact parameter. In p+A collisions, the term ''centrality'' is still taken to be a classification of the amount of activity in the collision, which, however, is not strictly related to the impact parameter, but more closely to the number of p+N collisions in a Glauber-like picture. This study focuses on the determination of centrality classes in p+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment using data taken in 2015. Simulation studies based on the Glauber model and the GEANT modelling of the STAR detector are performed to determine the sensitivity of different sub-detectors with different rapidity coverages to the event centrality. Comparisons of such studies to the data will be presented, and the implications on how to best determine centralities for p+Au collisions will be discussed.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Yanfang', 'last_name': 'Liu', 'fullName': 'Liu, Yanfang', 'id': '2778498', 'affiliation': 'TAMU', 'emailHash': '6125eeccb04a1c5b7425577a4efc2a40', 'db_id': 2778498, 'person_id': 2973686}"
Poster Session,poster,Deciphering the Charge Production Dynamics with General Charge Balance Functions in Pb-Pb Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV at ALICE,"Alam, Sk Noor",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),Unknown,"The two-wave quark production scenario can be investigated experimentally by measurements of balance functions of identified particle pairs [1]. In this scenario, quark-antiquark pairs produced in the earlier stages of the collision are pulled apart due to collective effects, while pairs produced during hadronization are unlikely to separate. We present the measurements of such balance functions based on an analysis of data acquired at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ALICE detector. Balance functions have been measured for identified charged-pion pairs and for identified charged-kaon pairs in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV. These balance functions are presented in relative pseudorapidity $\Delta\eta$, relative rapidity $\Delta y$ and relative azimuthal angle $\Delta\phi$. We observe that the charged-pion balance function widths in terms of $\Delta\eta$, $\Delta y$ and $\Delta\phi$ are narrower in central Pb-Pb collisions compared to peripheral collisions. In addition, a comparison between the balance functions of charged-pions and unidentified charged particles will be shown. We will also report on the measurements of charged-kaon balance functions. The findings in this analysis are consistent with the effects of delayed hadronization and radial flow, as well as the two-wave scenario. Detailed model comparisons are performed in order to draw more quantitative conclusions.

All pair combinations of $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ with K$^{+}$, K$^{-}$ and K$^{0}_{S}$ are analyzed.  The femtoscopic correlations are the result of strong final-state interactions, and are fit with a parametrization based on a model by R. Lednicky and V. L. Lyuboshitz [1].  This allows us to both characterize the emission source and measure the scattering parameters for the particle pairs.  We observe a large difference in the $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$) correlations in pairs with low relative momenta (k* < 100 MeV).  Additionally, the average of the $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$) correlation functions is consistent with our $\Lambda$-K$^{0}_{S}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{0}_{S}$) measurement.  The results suggest an effect arising from different quark-antiquark interactions in the pairs, i.e. $\rm s\bar{s}$ in $\Lambda$-K$^{+}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{-}$) and $\rm u\bar{u}$ in $\Lambda$-K$^{-}$ ($\bar{\Lambda}$-K$^{+}$).

Poster Session,poster,Measurements of D mesons in jets in Pb--Pb collisions\\ at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE at the LHC,"Oliveira Da Silva, Antonio Carlos",Universidade de Sao Paulo (BR),Unknown,"Charm quarks are created in the early stages of heavy-ion collisions in hard-scattering processes. Therefore, they are ideal probes of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). The fragmentation of charm quarks can produce D mesons.

Jets containing a D meson as one of their constituents can be identified as originating from heavy-quark fragmentation. D-tagged jets are a valuable tool to characterize the charm interaction with the QGP. Furthermore, charmed jets can provide complementary information to D-meson measurements to study the mass-dependent energy loss by analysing the modification of the charm-jet yield in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions as a function of the jet transverse momentum. A further insight can be obtained with the measurement of the momentum-fraction distribution, which is of particular interest to investigate the possible influence of the medium in the charm-jet fragmentation.

D mesons are reconstructed through an invariant mass analysis of their hadronic decay channels, rejecting the large combinatorial background with topological selections exploiting the relatively large signal lifetime of D mesons and the particle-identification capabilities of the detector. Jets are reconstructed with anti-$k_{\rm T}$ algorithm using the D-meson candidates and the charged tracks. The ALICE Time Projection Chamber and the Inner Tracking System detectors allow us to measure D mesons and jets down to low $p_{\rm T}$, where the probes are more sensitive to the effects of the hot medium.

The promising signatures of this new state are the enhanced production of multi-strange particles, production of hypernuclei and dibaryons. Theoretical models predict that single and double hypernuclei, and heavy multi-strange short-lived objects are produced via coalescence in heavy-ion collisions with the maximum yield in the region of SIS100 energies. The discovery and investigation of new hypernuclei and of hyper-matter will shed light on the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions.

Poster Session,poster,Pinning down the nature of QCD phase transition through the measurement of specific heat and isothermal compressibility,"Basu, Sumit",Department of Atomic Energy (IN),India,"Nature of QCD phase transitions in high energy collisions can be pinned down by studying the
behaviour of thermodynamic response functions with respect to $T$ and $\mu_B$.
A first order phase transition is signalled by the divergence of
specific heat ($c_v$), whereas for a second order
or continuous transition, isothermal compressibility 
($k_T$) diverges.
$c_v$ is estimated at the kinetic freezeout hyper
surface (at $T_{\rm kin}$), whereas $k_T$ is at chemical freezeout
hyper surface (at $T_{\rm ch}$).
Thus simultaneous measurements of $c_v$ and $k_T$ as a
function of collision energy probes the exact nature of phase
transition and can pin down
the location of the Critical Point in the ($T$,$\mu_{B}$) plane. 

The heat capacity is expressed as, $ C = \bigl(  \frac{\partial E}{\partial T} \bigr)_{V}$,    which implies $C^{-1} = 
\frac{(\langle T_{\rm kin}^2 \rangle -  \langle T_{\rm kin} \rangle ^2 )}  
{ \langle T_{\rm kin} \rangle ^2}$. Thus $c_v$ can be experimentally probed through  $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ distribution.
Similarly, $k_T = \frac{1}{V} \bigl( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P}  \bigr)$, which gives
      $ k_T = \frac{\sigma_N^2}{N^2}\frac{V}{k_BT_{\rm ch}} $, where $N$ and $\sigma_N^2$
are the number of charged particles and its variance. Thus $k_T$ can be obtained through multiplicity fluctuation of charged particles.

$c_v$ and $k_T$ have been calculated from the mean
transverse momentum ($\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$) and charged particle multiplicity
fluctuations, measured on an event-by-event
basis [1,2,3]. Experimental results along with results from the hadron
resonance gas (HRG) model and event generators will be presented.

Poster Session,poster,A faster pixel detector for open bottom hadron measurements at RHIC,"Wang, Yaping",Central China Normal University  CCNU (CN),China,"Heavy flavor quarks are dominantly produced from initial hard partonic scattering processes in high-energy nuclear collisions. Their interactions with nuclear medium are sensitive to the medium properties. The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) has been successfully integrated into the STAR experiment at RHIC since early 2014. Based on the state-of-the-art Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, the HFT allows precise measurements  of open charm mesons ($D^{0}$, $D^{\pm}$ and $D_{s}$) as well as the first measurements of open charm baryons ($\Lambda_{c}$) and bottom hadron production in heavy-ion collisions over a wide range of transverse momentum.

In this talk we propose a faster pixel detector, based on the next generation of MAPS technology, for precise bottom hadron measurements to study the flavor dependence of partonic energy loss in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The advantages of the new MAPS sensors are that they have a much better radiation tolerance and a much faster integration time of less than 40 $\mu$s, which allow for improved operation in high luminosity environment with less pile-up hits and better tracking efficiency. With the faster pixel detector and integrated luminosity of 10 nb$^{-1}$ for Au+Au collisions and 60 pb$^{-1}$ for p+p collisions at  $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV to be recorded, the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for non-prompt $J/\psi$ and $D^{0}$ from beauty decays and $b$-tagged jets can be measured with good precision according to Monte Carlo simulations.

Comparison of the Υ modifications measured at RHIC and LHC therefore provides a relatively direct comparison of the effect of high energy density on three states of different radius and binding energy, at two different initial temperatures of the plasma. The sPHENIX experiment proposed at RHIC will be able to reconstruct Υ states with a mass resolution of approximately 80 MeV, providing a clear separation of the three Y(nS) states. In combination with the large acceptance of sPHENIX and the high luminosity at RHIC  this will provide a high quality measurement of the modification for all three states.

The double-sided microstrip sensors have a strip pitch of 58 $\mu$m, are AC-coupled and oriented under 7.5 degree stereo angle. Double metallization is employed for read-out routing. Ultra-thin microcables with up to 60 cm length and a line pitch matching that of the sensor strips transfer the analog signals to the readout electronics at the periphery of the stations where cooling and further infrastructure can be provided without compromising the material budget. The custom-developed read-out ASIC “STS-XYTER” has a self-triggering architecture that delivers time and amplitude information.

In this contribution, we discuss the potential of HADES to reconstruct direct photons from Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV beam energy and present first results obtained from data acquired in a related run in 2012. Given that HADES is not yet equipped with an electromagnetic calorimeter, our analysis relies on an indirect detection of the direct photons. The method employed bases on reconstructing photons undergoing a conversion, via the di-electron pair created in this conversion. The approach is complicated by the fact that HADES is optimized for minimizing the related conversion process, which contributes to the background of other measurements. 

We discuss in details the method of the direct photon reconstruction used and describe how to correct for the impact of combinatorial background and Dalitz decays. Moreover, we present an extension of the study to the so-called “direct photon puzzle” observed by PHENIX and ALICE experiments.

identified particles for heavy-ion
collisions at RHIC and LHC have been used to quantitatively study 
the interplay of the partonic collectivity and hadronic
suppression. The outward pressure of strongly interacting partonic
medium in the early stage of the collision creates radial boost, which
is the key factor for Cronin-like peak structures. The structure could
be understood and unified in terms of ratio of particle species and
their mass dependence at a particular collision energy. The response
of the medium in the high $p_T$ region is same for all charged
particle species at a given collision energy, but the suppression
increases with increasing energy.
The primary goal of the present work is to understand the underlying
physics and disentangle the major
factors contributing to the shape of the nuclear modification
factors. A new observable, Integrated Suppression
Fraction (ISF) defined as the normalized area of the  $R_{AA}$ structures

In this talk, we will discuss the design and technology choices for the sPHENIX intermediate tracking system, the latest status of the prototype detector R&D, and the expected performance based on full Geant4 simulations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Gaku', 'last_name': 'Mitsuka', 'fullName': 'Mitsuka, Gaku', 'id': '2823909', 'affiliation': '', 'emailHash': 'e6b2812847307255fb98d462ae4999c7', 'db_id': 2823909, 'person_id': 3016487}"
Poster Session,poster,Jet spectra and jet structure measurements with sPHENIX,"Reed, Rosi Jan",Lehigh University,United States,"The sPHENIX proposal is for a second generation experiment at RHIC,
which will take advantage of the increased luminosity due to
accelerator upgrades, and allow measurements of jets and jet
correlations with a kinematic reach that will overlap with
measurements made at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Particle jets,
formed when a hard scatter parton fragments and then hadronizes into a
spray of particles, were proposed as a probe of the Quark Gluon Plasma
formed in heavy-ion collisions.  As they traverse the QGP, the hard
scattered partons probe the medium at a variety of length scales,
which is called jet quenching.  To answer the fundamental questions of
how and why partons lose energy in the QGP, we need to characterize
both the medium induced modification of the jet fragmentation pattern
and the correlation of the lost energy with the jet axis.  Some
observables that help elucidate these effects are gamma-jet
correlations and jet fragmentation functions, which require the
precise tracking and calorimetry that sPHENIX will have.  We will show
the performance of these observables as well as that for jet and
hadron spectra measurements, which are necessary for a baseline
understanding, based on detector simulations.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Rosi Jan', 'last_name': 'Reed', 'fullName': 'Reed, Rosi Jan', 'id': '2823917', 'affiliation': 'Lehigh University', 'emailHash': 'cca92ac74c8535f95992cff656dac734', 'db_id': 2823917, 'person_id': 3016494}"

Poster Session,poster,Susceptibilities from a black hole engineered EoS with a critical point,"Portillo, Israel",University of Houston,Unknown,"Currently at the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC experimental efforts are being made to find the QCD critical point. On the theoretical side, the behavior of higher-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon charge from Lattice QCD may allows us to estimate its position via Taylor expansion of the density of states at $\mu_B=0$. However, even if the series expansion continues to higher-orders, there is always the possibility to miss the critical point behavior due to truncation errors.  

An alternative approach to exploring the QCD critical point is using black hole engineering. This method allow us to obtain susceptibilities fitting the lattice data at $\mu_B=0$ but also can be expanded out to extremely large baryonic chemical potentials as well. Additionally, in the black hold engineered EoS there is a clear critical point at $\mu_B=725$ MeV and $T=80$ MeV.  In this talk, we obtain the freeze-out line and compare it with the hadron resonance gas model, lattice calculations, and experimental data. We also explore fluctuations at the lowest energies at the beam energy scan to see if there are signatures of the critical point.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Israel', 'last_name': 'Portillo', 'fullName': 'Portillo, Israel', 'id': '2799723', 'affiliation': 'University of Houston', 'emailHash': '5dd2a044431ba6bc8fa9943dc2fe1f2f', 'db_id': 2799723, 'person_id': 2993769}"

We then use statistical Bayesian analysis tools to extract the shear viscosity over entropy ratio at the kinetic freeze-out temperature  T=T_fo from experimental data.  Note that this approach is complementary to the existing extractions from viscous hydrodynamics. While the latter conflates the effects of shear viscosity on freeze-out and on the time evolution of the flow field, and is sensitive to an averaged shear viscosity during that time evolution, our analysis is only sensitive to the shear viscosity at freeze-out and represents its value at the corresponding temperature.

Poster Session,poster,A new relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code and its application to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy-ion collisions,"Okamoto, Kazuhisa",Nagoya University,Unknown,"Relativistic hydrodynamic simulations play a key role in exploring the QGP bulk property and the QCD phase transition from analyses of high-energy heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. From the intensive study based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamic models with event-by-event initial fluctuations, we can extract detailed information of the bulk feature of the QGP such as transport coefficients and the QCD equations of states. In the quantitative analyses of the QGP property, high-precision numerical treatment on the hydrodynamic calculation is important.

Recently, we developed a new 3+1 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code in Cartesian coordinates [1]. In the algorithm, we use a Riemann solver based on the two-shock approximation which is stable under existence of large shock waves. We extend the algorithm in Cartesian coordinates to that in Milne coordinates so that we can efficiently apply it to the analyses of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We check the correctness of the numerical algorithm by comparing numerical calculations and analytical solutions in various problems for ideal and viscous fluids. The new numerical scheme is stable even with small numerical viscosity [2], which is very important to discuss the physical viscosities at RHIC and LHC.

We apply our relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code to the analysis of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We find that the evolution of the hydrodynamic instability is sensitive to the values of the viscosities and the accuracy of the numerical calculation. We discuss possible existence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability originates from longitudinal fluctuations and effects of shear and bulk viscosities on the evolution of the instability [3].

Poster Session,poster,Reconstruction of particles produced at different stages of heavy ion collision in the CBM experiment at FAIR,"Kisel, Ivan","Goethe University Frankfurt, FIAS",Germany,"One of the main purposes of the physics program of the future heavy ion experiment CBM (FAIR, Germany) is to understand the properties of strongly interacting matter at very high baryonic densities and to study the possibility of a phase transition to a deconfined and chirally restored phase of quark matter. The experiment will operate at high interaction rates up to 10 MHz, that requires a full event reconstruction in real time. 

In order to make an efficient event selection online a clean sample of particles has to be provided by the reconstruction package called First Level Event Selection (FLES). The FLES package operates in two stages. First, particles registered in the CBM detector system are reconstructed. Then short-lived particles decayed before or inside the setup are searched based on their charged and neutral daughter particles. Since the FLES package is developed to run on many-core computer architectures, the reconstruction of particles is done in parallel that provides a possibility for a global competition between particle candidates. Such a global event topology reconstruction significantly improves suppression of a combinatorial background and provides for further physics analysis a very clean sample of particles produced at different stages of heavy ion collision. 

The global event topology reconstruction procedure and the results of its application to simulated collisions in the CBM detector setup are presented and discussed in details.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Ivan', 'last_name': 'Kisel', 'fullName': 'Kisel, Ivan', 'id': '2778555', 'affiliation': 'Goethe University Frankfurt, FIAS', 'emailHash': '4476ecb76f14659d9de3008f3371c157', 'db_id': 2778555, 'person_id': 2973734}"
Poster Session,poster,"AdS/CFT predictions for partonic and fragmented momentum, azimuthal, and rapidity correlations of heavy flavors in heavy ion collisions","Hambrock, Robert",University of Cape Town,Unknown,"We compute the suppression, angular, and rapidity distribution of single open heavy flavor and the momentum, angular, and rapidity correlations for pairs of open heavy flavor at RHIC and LHC from an AdS/CFT-based energy loss model.  We quantitatively compare these strongly-coupled QGP predictions to the weakly-coupled QGP predictions of Nahrgang et al., PRC90 (2014) [arXiv:1305.3823].  In the strong-coupling energy loss model, we include both the mean energy loss and thermal fluctuations; in the weak-coupling energy loss model, one set of predictions corresponds to the inclusion of purely collisional processes while the other additionally incorporates radiative corrections.

  When restricted to leading order production processes, we find that the strongly coupled correlations of high transverse momentum pairs ($>4$ GeV) are broadened less efficiently than the corresponding weak coupling based correlations, while low transverse momentum pairs ($1-4$ GeV) are broadened with similar efficiency, but with an order of magnitude more particles ending up in this momentum class. The strong coupling momentum correlations we compute account for initial correlations and reveal that the particle pairs suppressed from initially high momenta to the low momentum domain do not suffice to explain the stark difference to the weak coupling results in momentum correlations for $1-4$ GeV. From this, we conclude that heavy quark pairs are more likely to stay correlated in momentum when propagating through a strongly coupled plasma than a weakly coupled one.

  When initialised at next-to-leading order (aMC@NLO with Herwig++), we observe significant additional broadening of azimuthal correlations, with the angular correlations of low momentum pairs ($1-4$ GeV) essentially washed.  However, the momentum correlations remain even when NLO production mechanisms are included. Thus, our conclusion for differences in momentum correlations with leading order production processes should carry over to next-to-leading order production processes once comparable predictions for a weakly-coupled QGP emerge.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Robert', 'last_name': 'Hambrock', 'fullName': 'Hambrock, Robert', 'id': '2799734', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town', 'emailHash': '18c1bdb69390796ffcf8d3b0342e8e6e', 'db_id': 2799734, 'person_id': 2993775}"
Poster Session,poster,Dynamical evolution of critical fluctuation and its observation,"Sakaida, Miki",Osaka University,Unknown,"We study the time evolution of conserved-charge fluctuations near the QCD critical point and show how the existence of the critical point is observed in experimental measurements of fluctuation observables in heavy ion collisions.  

The soft mode of the QCD critical point should obey a diffusion equation because it is a linear combination of the chiral condensate and conserved densities, i.e., baryon number density and energy density.  The baryon fluctuation can represent the critical dynamics, while the chiral fluctuation mode is a slave mode of the conserved densities.

We propose a stochastic diffusion equation in the rapidity space with critical nature being encoded in the time-dependent diffusion coefficient and baryon number susceptibility. We find a novel non-monotonic dependence of the critical fluctuation observables on the rapidity cuts, depending on the approach to the critical point during the time evolution. We show that the effect of critical dynamics could be sustainable as a non-monotonic behavior as the rapidity-window dependence of conserved-charge cumulants at the kinetic freeze-out. We emphasize this rapidity-window dependence as a unique and robust signal for the critical point search in experiments.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Miki', 'last_name': 'Sakaida', 'fullName': 'Sakaida, Miki', 'id': '2799735', 'affiliation': 'Osaka University', 'emailHash': 'dbbf3478b5a27ff7e5cef8ef1a031458', 'db_id': 2799735, 'person_id': 2993776}"
Poster Session,poster,Formation of a transient Bose-Einstein condensate in the strong coupling regime,"Tsutsui, Shoichiro",Kyoto University,Unknown,"In relativistic heavy-ion collisions,
the initial state of the matter formed after the collision can be overpopulated due to the gluon saturation.
Recent simulations based on the kinetic theory or the classical statistical approach suggest that the Bose-Einstein condensate is created at a transient stage of the dynamics.
While these results make sense for weakly interacting systems,
the gauge coupling constant is no longer small for the realistic heavy-ion collisions.
Therefore, it is interesting to explore the dynamics of the overpopulated system in a strong coupling regime.

In this study, we investigate the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting systems based on the two-particle irreducible formalism.
As a first step, we consider the time evolution of the particle distribution function of the $O(N)$-symmetric scalar field theory within the next-leading order approximation of the $1/N$-expansion.

When the initial state is underpopulated, we found that the distribution function approaches toward the Bose-Einstein(BE) distribution with negative chemical potential before it converges to the BE distribution with zero chemical potential.
In contrast to the underpopulated case, overpopulated distributions lead to the condensation of soft modes on top of the Bose-Einstein distribution with positive chemical potential.","{'_type': 'ContributionParticipation', '_fossil': 'contributionParticipationMetadata', 'first_name': 'Shoichiro', 'last_name': 'Tsutsui', 'fullName': 'Tsutsui, Shoichiro', 'id': '2799737', 'affiliation': 'Kyoto University', 'emailHash': '2058750e391bc0cb277bfd7e69bfb2ec', 'db_id': 2799737, 'person_id': 2993778}"

We also use the complex Langevin method to the same model with a modified sampling, which correctly reproduces the crossover behavior in the relevant chemical potential region.

We will also examine these complexification approached to the chiral random model at finite temperature and chemical potential to see if the correct phase diagram can be predicted in these approaches.

Poster Session,poster,The RICH detector for the CBM experiment at FAIR,"Mahmoud, Tariq",J,Unknown,"The CBM fixed-target experiment at FAIR will investigate highly compressed baryonic matter at moderate temperatures in heavy-ion collisions with 2-11 AGeV beam energy for heaviest nuclei at the SIS100 accelerator at FAIR starting in 2022. The CBM experiment aims at understanding and characterizing nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities but moderate temperatures focussing on the investigation of rare probes as for example electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation, if measured with high precision, is particularly promising as is carries information on the temperature and evolution of the fireball, in-medium properties of vector-mesons and on the coupling to baryonic resonances. No measurements are available in this energy range so far, thus CBM has a high discovery potential due to the unprecedented reaction rates.

The major detector for clean electron identification in the CBM experiment at SIS 100 will be a RICH detector using CO${_2}$ as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors with reflective Al+MgF${_2}$ coating as focusing elements and a photodetector plane consisting of an array of H12700 MAPMTs from Hamamatsu. This detector concept has been tested extensively with a real-size RICH prototype in testbeams and proven to show a high performance. The testbeam evaluations included a detailed study of layers of wavelength-shifting films for enhanced UV sensitivity and the development of MAPMT readout. Several MAPMT sensors were tested in this setup but also for radiation hardness in separate experimental campaigns with thermal neutron and gamma irradiation. As result the H12700 sensor was ordered from Hamamatsu in spring 2015, until now 500 MAPMTs have been measured and tested. The readout electronics is based on the TRB3 developments and focusses on good time resolution while offering moderate amplitude infromation via time-over-threshold. The close to final readout electronics is available and will be tested in testbeams at COSY and in the lab.

In order to make use of the early delivery of the photosensors with respect to the CBM time scales and to recuperate performance losses of the HADES RICH detector, the HADES RICH detector will be upgraded with these photosensors and readout electronics as developed for CBM. This upgrade program will be finished for the next HADES data taking period starting 2018.
