      "Abstract": "We use quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics to study an azimuthally-symmetric boost-invariant quark-gluon plasma including the effects of both shear and bulk viscosities. In quasiparticle anisotropic hydrodynamics, a single finite-temperature quasiparticle mass is introduced and fit to the lattice data in order to implement a realistic equation of state (EoS).  We compare results obtained using the quasiparticle method with the standard method of imposing the EoS in anisotropic hydrodynamics and viscous hydrodynamics.  Using these three methods, we extract the primordial particle spectra, total number of charged particles, and average transverse momentum for various values of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$.  We find that the three methods agree well for small shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\\eta/s$, but differ at large $\\eta/s$, with the standard anisotropic EoS method showing suppressed production at low transverse-momentum compared to the other two methods considered.  Finally, we demonstrate explicitly that, when using standard viscous hydrodynamics, the bulk-viscous correction can drive the primordial particle spectra negative at large $p_T$.  Such a behavior is not seen in either anisotropic hydrodynamics approach, irrespective of the value of $\\eta/s$.",

      "Abstract": "We make phenomenological predictions for particle spectra and flow in heavy-ion col- lisions using 3+1d anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) including the effects of both bulk and shear viscosities. The dynamical equations necessary are derived by taking moments of Boltzmann equation allowing for three distinct momentum-space anisotropy parameters. The formulation is based on relaxation-time approximation for the collisional kernel and a lattice-QCD-based equation of state. Evolving the system to late times, we calculate par- ticle production using THERMINATOR modified to account for an ellipsoidal distribution function. We obtain particle spectra for different particle types such as pions, kaons, and protons and elliptic flow, $v_2$, as a function of centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity. In our model, we have four free parameters, i.e. freeze-out temperature, initial energy den- sity, initial momentum-space anisotropy, and shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. Using a multidimensional fit to LHC experimental data, we extract these parameters. We find good agreement between 3+1d aHydro and available experimental data.",

By introducing additional transverse momentum anisotropy parameters into the parton distribution functions, we generalize previous results which were obtained for the case of a spheroidal anisotropy. Our results demonstrate that the presence of anisotropies in the transverse directions affects the real and imaginary parts of quark self-energy and, consequently, the self-energy depends on both the polar and azimuthal angles in the local rest frame of the matter. Our results for the quark self-energy set the stage for the calculation of the effects of ellipsoidal momentum-space anisotropy on quark-gluon plasma photon spectra and collective flow.",

ALICE measured a positive D-meson elliptic flow in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV at LHC, which suggests that charm quarks with low transverse momentum are influenced by the collective motion of the system.

      "Abstract": "Understanding $J/\\psi$ meson hadroproduction has been a long-term effort both experimentally and theoretically.  However, none of the existing theoretical models can successfully describe both $J/\\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectrum and the polarization. Furthermore, the composition of inclusive $J/\\psi$ is complicated, including direct production via gluon fusion, parton fragmentation, and feed-down from excited charmonium states and B hadrons. Measurements of $J/\\psi$ production at a different beam energy can shed new lights on the understanding of different $J/\\psi$ production mechanisms, and help to constrain model calculations. \n\nWe report measurements of $J/\\psi$ production in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV in both the di-electron and di-muon channels.  By combining measurements from these two channels, the $p_{T}$ spectrum of $J/\\psi$ is measured from 0 to 20 GeV/$c$ and compared with NLO NRQCD and CGC+NRQCD calculations at different kinematic ranges. Feed-down contributions from $\\psi(2S)$  is studied in the $p_{T}$ range of $4 < p_{T} < 12$ GeV/$c$. In addition, measurements of the $J/\\psi$ production as a function of charged-particle multiplicity will be presented. A strong increase of the relative $J/\\psi$ yield with multiplicity is observed for all $p_{T}$ bins with significant $p_{T}$ dependence. The results are compared with predications from the Percolation model and PYTHIA8",

However the clearly quoted systematic errors were ignored for which a 1 standard deviation systematic shift would move all the 12 Au$+$Au data points to within 1.3 standard deviations of the p$+$p value, or if the statistical and systematic errors are added in quadrature a difference of 35 $\\pm$ 21\\% .   \nThe PHENIX method gives a difference of 19$\\pm$18\\%.",

The PHENIX experiment has previously used the micro-vertexing capabilities of its silicon vertex detector (VTX) to infer the yield of charm and bottom quarks in Au+Au collisions from measurements of both the invariant yield of heavy flavor electrons and the distance of closest approach to the collision vertex of heavy flavor electrons. This poster will describe the current effort toward the measurement of the invariant yields in the 2015 p+p collision dataset. The invariant yield is a necessary input for the separation of charm and bottom meson yields in p+p, which will provide a precise baseline for the charm and bottom meson yields in heavy ion collisions.",

Recently PHENIX has reported thermal photon production with wide centrality bins in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via external photon conversions. While the number of participants in Cu+Cu collisions are similar to the one in Au+Au peripheral collisions, the collision geometry is very different.  Thus a measurement of low-momentum direct-photons in Cu+Cu collisions can provide important constrains on the origin of the observed direct photons.

      "Speaker": "Erin Frances Gauger",
      "Institute": "University of Texas (US)",
      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is a major experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is specifically designed to investigate the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter in which quarks and gluons are momentarily deconfined. The QGP is short-lived, and must therefore be studied indirectly by identifying the final-state particles produced in heavy-ion collisions. The final-state particle of interest in this poster is the electron. Electrons must be identified to study, for instance, the semi-leptonic decay channels of heavy-flavor hadrons. Because heavy-flavor quarks are created early in the collision, they travel and interact with the QCD medium. This makes them an important probe of the QGP. \n\t\n\tOne of the detectors important in identifying electrons is the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). The ALICE EMCal is a sampling calorimeter with 77 layers of lead and polystyrene scintillator and is composed of $\\sim$6.0$\\times$$\\sim$6.0$\\times$24.6 cm$^{3}$ towers (cells). It has an azimuthal and pseudo-rapidity coverage of 107$\\degree$ (80$\\degree$\\textless $\\varphi$\\textless 187$\\degree$) and $|\\eta|$\\textless 0.7, respectively. For Run 2, the EMCal has been expanded to include the Di-jet Calorimeter (DCal), which is located on the opposite side of the beam axis from the original EMCal. The DCal spans an additional azimuthal angle of 67$\\degree$ (260$\\degree$\\textless $\\varphi$\\textless 327$\\degree$) and covers the pseudo-rapidity region $|\\eta|$\\textless 0.7. The EMCal has an effective radiation length ($\\chi_{0}$) of $\\sim$2.3 mm, a nuclear interaction length ($\\lambda_{\\rm{int}}$) of $\\sim$24.6 cm, and an effective Moli\\`{e}re radius ($R_{\\rm{M}}$) of 3.20 cm.

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, the study of recoil jets tagged by high transverse-momentum \"direct photons\" ($\\gamma_{dir}$) should provide a measurement of the partonic energy loss in the hot, dense medium produced in such collisions\\footnote{X.-N. Wang, Z. Huang, and I. Sarcevic, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 231 (1996)}.  Since a $\\gamma_{dir}$ does not interact strongly with the medium, it closely approximates the initial energy of the recoiling parton.  It is also interesting to compare the recoil jets tagged by $\\gamma_{dir}$ to those tagged by high transverse-momentum $\\pi^{0}$.  In contrast to the $\\gamma_{dir}$, high transverse-momentum $\\pi^{0}$ are assumed to be biased towards being produced near the surface of the medium.  Moreover, the production mechanisms of $\\gamma_{dir}$ favor recoiling quarks over gluons, but the production mechanisms of $\\pi^{0}$ show no such preference.  Thus the comparison of $\\gamma_{dir}$-tagged recoil jets to $\\pi^{0}$-tagged recoil jets may shed light on the path-length and color-factor dependence of in-medium partonic energy loss.\n\nTo establish a vacuum fragmentation reference, we present the measurement of the yields of full recoil jets (recoil jets consisting of both charged and neutral particles) in p+p collisions.  The yields are measured using the STAR Time Projection Chamber and Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV tagged by neutral-particle triggers recorded during the running year 2009.  The neutral-particle triggers satisfy $9 < E_{T}^{trig} < 20$ GeV and $|\\eta^{trig}| < 1$, and are separated into a sample of identified $\\pi^{0}$ triggers and a sample of triggers with an enhanced fraction of $\\gamma_{dir}$.  Jets are reconstructed from charged tracks and neutral towers with $p_{T} > 0.2$ GeV/c and $E_{T} > 0.2$ GeV respectively and $|\\eta| < 1$ using the anti-$k_{T}$ algorithm for resolution parameter $0.3 \\leq R \\leq 0.6$. To assay the effect of reconstructing full jets versus charged-only jets in such studies, the yields of charged recoil-jets are compared to the yields of full recoil-jets.

Thus, heavy flavours are an excellent probe to study in-medium energy loss (mechanisms) in nuclear collisions by measuring, for instance, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ or the azimuthal anisotropy and especially the elliptic flow $v_2$ of heavy-flavour particles. Experimentally, heavy flavours are often investigated using measurements of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays. These electrons can be separated statistically from the background originating from light flavours and gluons and provide insight into the colour charge (quark vs. gluon) and mass (charm vs. beauty) dependence of parton energy loss. In this poster, we present the relative contribution of electrons from beauty hadron decays to the yield of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays estimated with Monte Carlo simulations based on POWHEG.

      "Abstract": "Jet energy loss in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is an active area of research, with many different measurement techniques attempting to determine its properties. One technique is to measure the azimuthal correlations of a trigger jet and the associated hadrons in the event. These measurements, known as jet-hadron correlations, are expected to be sensitive to broadening and softening of an associated recoil jet due to jet quenching. To help get a handle on energy loss, the path length of the recoil jet can be varied by imposing a surface bias condition on the trigger jet population. Previous measurements with such a bias at RHIC have already shown jet-hadron correlations to be a useful tool for studying energy loss. In particular, by comparing heavy ion measurements to pp, the correlations exhibit a strong suppression of higher $p_{{\\rm T}}$ hadrons, which is balanced by an excess of lower $p_{{\\rm T}}$ hadrons.\n\nFor this analysis, the azimuthal jet-hadron correlations are constructed from a trigger R=0.2 full (charged + neutral) jet, which is correlated with charged hadrons. In an effort to enhance the surface bias and reduce the impact of the background, jets are required to pass a leading constituent cut and are reconstructed using only high energy and momentum constituents. We present the current status of the analysis, including measurements of associated hadron yields and widths in central PbâPb data collected at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV by the ALICE Collaboration.

      "Abstract": "Heavy charm quarks are produced dominantly in the initial stage of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They take part in the whole evolution of the medium, interact with the produced Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) and lose energy due to collisional and radiative processes. Therefore, they serve as unique probes of the QGP transport properties. Charm quarks can be studied by measuring D mesons that originate from the charm-quark fragmentation. Furthermore, identifying the charm-jets (with D-meson tagging) gives additional information about the energy-loss distribution in the medium. In order to disentangle effects related to the presence of the hot and dense medium, measurements in elementary pp and in p--A collisions are needed. In addition to the charm-jet transverse momentum spectrum, an important observable is the charm fragmentation function (fraction of the jet momentum carried by D mesons), which is still not fully understood even in pp collisions, and provides important constraint for Monte-Carlo event generators. The study of possible charm-jet modifications in p--Pb collisions is an important intermediate step between pp and Pb--Pb collisions that complements the simple pp vacuum case and the heavy-ion case with interplay of many different effects.\n\nD mesons are identified via their hadronic decay channels using information from the ALICE Inner Tracking System to reconstruct decay topologies displaced with respect to the collision primary vertex. The ALICE Time Projection Chamber is used for the tracking and the hadron identification, the hadron selection being improved with the Time Of Flight detector. Charged jets containing D mesons are reconstructed with the anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ algorithm.\n\nIn this poster, we will show the status of the D-tagged jets analysis in p--Pb minimum-bias collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

      "Abstract": "The dipole flow originates from the asymmetry in the initial density distributions either due to projectile-target asymmetry (Cu+Au collisions) or due to the event-by-event fluctuations. Unlike the conventional directed flow that is rapidity-odd in symmetric collisions, the dipole flow is rapidity-even and has weak dependence on the pseudorapidity. The dipole flow has a characteristic of zero net transverse momentum in the system. We present the dipole flow, the conventional directed flow, and the average projection of the transverse momentum on the flow direction for charged particles in Cu+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV in the STAR experiment.  The directed flow is measured with respect to the spectator planes and with the three-point correlator including the participant planes as functions of the pseudorapidity, the transverse momentum, and collision centrality. Results are compared with the results in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We discuss the system size and initial geometry dependence of the dipole-like fluctuations and their implications.",

      "Abstract": "A key topic of interest in studies of jets in heavy ion physics is the path-length dependence of jet-medium interactions.  In this contribution, Monte Carlo event simulators are used to estimate the path-length traversed by the recoil jet, under a varying range of trigger conditions.  These simulations are then used to make predictions for studies of jet-hadron correlations, where a high pT jet is used as a trigger, and the distribution of associated particles from the awayside is examined.\n \n  Since we cannot experimentally measure the location of a hard-scatter vertex or the path-length traversed by the resulting partons, we require models to understand the role of path-length in experimental analysis.  With Monte Carlo event generators, we can directly track the path-length of the trigger jet and the recoil jet.  An especially interesting quantity is how biased the trigger is towards the surface, since the recoil jet from a surface biased trigger is likely to traverse a longer path.  This is connected back to experiment by predicting how much jet energy loss resulting in softening and broadening can be observed in jet-hadron correlations.\n \n  Conditions that have been considered for their effect on the geometric bias include the pT of the jet, cuts on the constituents used to reconstruct the jet, and the jet's angle relative to the reaction plane.  The Monte Carlo event generators used include JEWEL and YaJEM.",

The correlations are expressed in terms of cumulants $c_n$, which can be directly related to Fourier harmonics $v_n$.  A comparison across different collision systems is presented as a function of the charged particle multiplicity $N_{\\mathrm{ch}}$.  These measurements aim to assess the collective nature of multi-particle production.  While collectivity is well established in $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions, its evidence in $pp$ collisions is still a matter of debate. The presented measurements of multi-particle cumulants $c_2 \\{2â8\\}$ confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity PbPb collisions. For $pp$ collisions the same conclusion can be derived from two-particle cumulants calculated with the requirement of a large pseudorapidity separation, $|\\Delta\\eta|>2$. However, the measurements of $c_\\{4\\}$ cumulants with a method that is not susceptible to event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations, but is biased by higher order non-flow correlations, do not yet provide clear evidence for collectivity.  A modified cumulant method is used to suppress both the contribution of multiplicity fluctuation and non-flow effects. The results from this method are presented for pp and $p$+Pb collisions.",

To address this shortcoming and allow for important triggers and access to interesting low-x physics, we have designed a prototype that replaces quartz radiator material with a circulating, liquid hydrocarbon, as well as a new radiator geometry that orients the radiator gaps and tungsten absorber plates along the Cherenkov angle of normally incident particles. Design considerations, results from prototype beam tests at the SPS, and comparisons to GEANT simulation will be presented. The poster will also discuss plans for a material test that will take place at the ZDCâs nominal location in ATLAS during the 2017 p+p run, allowing for important radiation hardness measurements of candidate materials for liquid radiator, reflectors and quartz fibers.",

      "Abstract": "In view of the LHC Run3 starting in 2021, the ALICE experiment is preparing a major upgrade including the construction of an entirely new inner silicon tracker (the Inner Tracking System) and a complete renewal of its Online and Offline systems.\n\nDuring its Run3, LHC will deliver Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.5 TeV with a peak luminosity $L=6\\times10^{27}\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$ and an interaction rate of 50 kHz, to be compared to the 8 kHz design interaction rate of the LHC Run1 and Run2. The aim of ALICE is to cope with such a high interaction rate improving at the same time the resolution and the efficiency of its silicon tracker.\n\nIn this context, one of the requirements for a prompt calibration of external detectors and a fast offline data processing is to run online the reconstruction of tracks in the Upgraded Inner Tracking System.\n\nA new algorithm based on Cellular Automata has been developed to tackle this issue. In this algorithm the tracking is split in multiple phases to profit from data locality. At first, hit points are organised in sectors of azimuthal angle and longitudinal coordinate; then the algorithm looks for track segments within these sectors of the detector, independently. Track segments with compatible track parameters are marked as neighbours.\n\nNeighbouring track segments are then merged at the final stage using a set of rules defined by the Cellular Automaton mechanism, somewhat similar to the set of rules used in the Conway's Game of Life.\n\nThe obtained computing and tracking performance are compliant with the requirements of ALICE being able to reconstruct tracks of transverse momentum down to 100 MeV/c in events with high track density ($\\mathrm{d}N_{ch} / \\mathrm{d}\\eta$ up to 2000). The tracking and computing performance of this algorithm will be shown in the case of central Pb-Pb events at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.5 TeV.",

Using the high statistics data sample of Au+Au collisions taken in 2014, PHENIX will  be able to reduce the experimental uncertainties on the low pT direct photon measurement and measure flow to higher orders.

The decay daughters of short-lived resonances suffer re-scattering in the dense hadronic medium, which modifies their correlations and hence the experimentally measured yields. New results on the production of Î(1520) resonances measured in Pb-Pb collisions at âsNN = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC are presented. The integrated production yield ratio Î(1520)/Î in central Pb-Pb collisions is observed to be suppressed with respect to peripheral collisions and also with respect to pp and p-Pb collisions. Statistical hadronisation models over-predict the measured yield ratio. The suppression adds further support to the existence of a prolonged hadronic phase, as already evidenced in the K*/K and Ï/Ï ratios. The results are also compared to predictions from the EPOS3 Monte Carlo generator, which includes the UrQMD for the hadronic transport treatment. The model reproduces the measured pT spectral shapes, â¨pTâ© and the trend of the suppression reasonably well when UrQMD is on, whereas the agreement with the data significantly degrades when the UrQMD is off.",

      "Abstract": "Theoretical studies predict that some metastable states leading to the local parity violation may be created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [1]. The interaction of the strong magnetic field produced in the non-central heavy-ion collisions and the deconfined state created in these collisions causes the separation of charges along the axis of the magnetic field. This phenomenon of the charge separation along the axis of the magnetic field and perpendicular to the reaction plane is called the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) [2]. We investigated the event-by-event charge separation using Sliding Dumbbell Method (SDM), similar to the Sliding Window Method [3]. In this method, we evaluate Db$_{+-}$, which is defined as:\n\n$Db_{+-} = \\frac{N^L_{+}}{(N^L_{+} + N^L_{-})} + \\frac{N^R_{-}}{(N^R_{+} + N^R_{-})}$ ,\n\nwhere, N$^L_{+}$ and N$^L_{-}$, respectively, are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the left side of the dumbbell, whereas N$^R_{+}$ and  N$^R_{-}$, respectively, are the numbers of positively and negatively charged particles on the right side of the dumbbell. The whole azimuthal plane is scanned by sliding the ${\\Delta \\phi}$ =$90^{\\circ}$ dumbbell in steps of ${\\delta \\phi}$ =$1^{\\circ}$ and calculating the observable Db$_{+-}$ for each ${\\Delta \\phi}$ region to extract the maximum value of Db$_{+-}$ in each event. We have analysed the events with higher values of Db$_{+-}$ and some interesting events displaying back to back charge separation are found. The data has been analysed for different dumbbell sizes i.e., ${\\Delta\\phi}$ =90$^{\\circ}$, 60$^{\\circ}$ and 40$^{\\circ}$ and the results will be presented.\n\n**References** \n\n[1] D. E.

      "Abstract": "Collisions of ultrarelativistic heavy ions provide an opportunity to investigate strongly interacting matter under extreme energy densities and temperatures. Interaction of hard scattered partons with the hot and dense medium leads to a suppression of the observed jet yields, known as jet quenching. Along with other experimental approaches, studies of the jet substructure have the prospects of providing valuable information about jet quenching mechanisms. One of the jet substructure observables is the transverse momentum distribution of hard subjets probed with the Soft Drop algorithm. This algorithm removes soft large-angle components of a jet and identifies a pair of subjets that forms a hard splitting. The momentum balance of the pair is characterized by the $z_g$ observable defined as the fraction of the groomed jet's transverse momentum carried by the softer subjet. In pp collisions the distribution of $z_g$ is linked to the vacuum QCD splitting functions. It is interesting, therefore, to search for a possible modification of the $z_g$ distribution in proton-nucleus collisions due to the presence of cold nuclear matter. We present the status of the jet substructure analysis with Soft Drop using the data collected by the ALICE experiment in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.",

The PHSD includes the deconfinement phase transition as well as essential aspects of CSR in the dense and hot hadronic medium, which are incorporated in the Schwinger mechanism for particle production. Our systematic studies show that chiral symmetry restoration plays a crucial role in the description of heavy-ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3--20\\,GeV, realizing an increase of the hadronic particle production in the strangeness sector with respect to the non-strange one. We identify particle abundances and rapidity spectra to be suitable probes in order to extract information about CSR, while transverse mass spectra are less sensitive. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the \"horn\" structure in the excitation function of the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio: the CSR in the hadronic phase produces the steep increase of this particle ratio up to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx$ 7 GeV, while the drop at higher energies is associated to the appearance of a deconfined partonic medium. Furthermore, the appearance/disappearance of the 'horn' structure is investigated as a function of the system size and collision centrality. We additionally present an analysis of strangeness production in the ($T,\\mu_B$)-plane (as extracted from the PHSD for central Au+Au collisions) and discuss the perspectives to identify a possible critical point in the phase diagram.",

We have investigated higher moments of e-by-e proton distributions using data from our high-statistics measurement of Au+Au collisions. Systematic effects have been studied making use of our GEANT-based detector response simulation which includes sophisticated digitizers for all detector systems in use.

This framework is in full (3+1)D, which allows us to study the non-trivial longitudinal structure and dynamics of the collision systems, for example, the baryon stopping and transport, as well as longitudinal fluctuations. We study hadronic chemistry, identified particle spectra, anisotropic flow, and HBT interferometry over the energy range relevant to the RHIC BES. For the first time, quantitative effects of boost-invariance breaking, net-baryon current/diffusion, and pre-equilibrium dynamics on these hadronic observables will be addressed.

Flow harmonic distributions in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are measured for the integrated $p_{T}$ ($\\eta$) range $0.3 \\leq p_{T} \\leq 3.0$ GeV/c ($|\\eta| \\leq 2.4$) using the CMS detector at the LHC. The event-shape engineering technique is used to further divide events into classes based on their ellipticity, which allows for the study of detailed correlations between initial-shape components that would otherwise be destroyed by event-averaging techniques. Hydrodynamic models predict the $2^{nd}$ order participant eccentricity distributions to have a negative skewness, which is identified as the main source of non-Gaussian behavior in $p(v_{2})$ distributions. The skewness for $p(v_{2})$ distributions is measured with high precision over the full centrality range. In addition, $p(v_{n})$ distributions are fitted with an elliptic power law parameterization to infer the proportionality constant between the flow harmonics and the initial-state geometry.

Our analysis includes events selected based on asymmetries in spectators observed in the Zero-Degree-Calorimeters which preferentially select body-tip events [3].

In large systems, it is well established that the final-state particle correlations arise from anisotropic pressure gradients in the initial state of the collisions that drive a near-perfect fluid evolution. Whether QGP is also formed in small collision systems is presently under intense investigation. To study the origin of the collective behavior in small systems, the PHENIX experiment performed a series of geometry-controlled experiments using $p$+Al, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^3$He+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The elliptic ($v_2$)  and triangular ($v_3$) flow coefficients are measured as a function of $p_T$ for inclusive and identified charged hadrons.   Mass dependence is observed in $v_2(p_T)$ indicative of hydrodynamic evolution. The relation of the $v_n$ strengths and the corresponding initial eccentricities in the different systems is studied and compared to several theoretical predictions that invoke different mechanisms for producing final-state particle correlations. The distinct initial geometries provide discriminating power against the models.",

In 2016, RHIC operations included $d$+Au collisions at 200, 62.4, 39, and 19.6 GeV.  In this talk we present results on elliptic and triangular flow at midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum and event multiplicity in $d$+Au collisions at various energies.  We compare these results with several theoretical predictions in scenarios including pre-equilibrium flow, hydrodynamic flow, partonic scattering, and purely hadronic scattering in order to assess the role of each stage in the system evolution for producing collective effects in small systems.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Charge-dependent azimuthal correlations relative to the event plane in AA collisions have been suggested as providing evidence for the chiral magnetic effect (CME) caused by local strong parity violation. However, the observation of the CME remains inconclusive because of several possible sources of background correlations that may account for part or all of the observed signals. This talk will present the first application of three-particle, charge-dependent azimuthal correlation analysis in proton-nucleus collisions, using pPb data collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The differences found in comparing same and opposite sign correlations are studied as a function of event multiplicity and the pseudorapidity gap between two of the particles detected in the CMS tracker detector. After selecting events with comparable charge-particle multiplicities, the results for pPb collisions are found to be similar to those for PbPb collisions collected at the same collision energy. With a reduced magnetic field strength and a random field orientation in high multiplicity pPb events, the CME contribution to any charge separation signal is expected to be much smaller than found in peripheral PbPb events. These results pose a challenge for the interpretation of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in heavy ion collisions in terms of the chiral magnetic effect.",

Two-particle correlation functions and the extracted three-dimensional source radii are presented as a function of average transverse pair momentum ($k_\\mathrm{T}$) and rapidity ($yâ_{\\pi\\pi}$) as well as collision centrality. Pairs are selected with a rapidity $â2<y^{â}_{\\pi\\pi}<1$ and with an average transverse momentum 0.1<$k_\\mathrm{T}$<0.8 GeV. The effect on the two-particle correlation function from jet fragmentation is studied, and a new method for removing its contributions to the measured correlations is described. The measured homogeneity regions are substantially larger in more central collisions, and in central events the radii are observed to decrease with increasing pair $k_\\mathrm{T}$, which is understood as a signature of collective behavior. In order to relate the freeze-out geometry to particle flow, the radii are also presented as a function of azimuthal angle with respect to the second-order event plane. The amplitude of the azimuthal modulation is shown as a function of centrality and flow vector magnitude $v_2$. A correlation of the source size with the local multiplicity $dN/dy^{â}$ is demonstrated.The scaling of the extracted radii with the mean number of participants is also used to compare a selection of initial-geometry models. The cross term $R_{\\mathrm{ol}}$, which couples the radial and longitudinal expansion of the source, is measured as a function of rapidity.

In equilibrium, correlations diverge at the critical point leading to large event-by-event fluctuations in conserved quantities. For expanding systems like in heavy-ion collisions it is important to study the dynamical formation of long-range correlations in the critical region. The critical mode is the diffusive baryon current and can be described fluid dynamically. We include the propagation of fluctuations in the fluid dynamical equations. Using an equation of state with a critical point we study the evolution of critical fluctuations, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, in static systems to compare to known analytical results. The requirements for the emergence of non-Gaussian correlations from underlying white noise will be explored. We investigate both relativistic and nonrelativistic fluid dynamics. Finally, moving toward more realistic scenarios of heavy-ion collisions, we discuss the development of critical fluctuations in expanding systems.",

      "Abstract": "Bulk viscosity has recently been shown to play an important role in describing both photon [1] and hadron [2] observables at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Cllider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The presence of a temperature-dependent bulk viscosity in the hydrodynamical evolution of the medium modifies the development of the hydronynamic momentum anisotropy differently in the high- and low-temperature regions. Thus, anisotropic flow coefficients of hadronic observables, which are emitted predominantly from low temperatures, are affected differently by bulk viscosity than electromagnetic probes which are radiated during the entire evolution. Starting from the IP-Glasma initial conditions [1,2], we study how thermal dilepton production gets modified owing to the presence of bulk viscosity at RHIC and LHC energies. With calculations at different collision energies we can draw more robust conclusions regarding the role of bulk viscosity in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Dilepton radiation from the dilute phase of the medium will be included for the first time using the Boltzmann-transport model SMASH [3] and compared to previous hydrodynamic approaches to ascertain whether these modifications may be observable in experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] Jean-FranÃ§ois Paquet et al., Phys.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), conditions are met to produce a hot, dense and strongly interacting medium known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).  Quarks and gluons from incoming nuclei collide to produce partons at high momenta early in the collision.  By fragmenting into collimated sprays of hadrons, these partons form \"jets\".  Within the framework of perturbative QCD, jet production is well understood in pp collisions and can be used as a baseline reference for comparing to heavy ion collision systems when studying jet quenching.  One approach is to measure the azimuthal correlations of a trigger and the associated hadrons in the event.  For a jet trigger, these are known as jet-hadron correlations, while a hadron trigger leads to di-hadron correlations.  Such correlations are examined in transverse momentum bins of the trigger, transverse momentum bins of the associated hadrons, and studied as a function of collision centrality.  The correlations are expected to be sensitive to broadening and softening of the associated recoil jet due to jet quenching.  We present azimuthal jet-hadron correlations constructed from a trigger R=0.2 full (charged + neutral) jet, which is correlated with charged hadrons.  In an effort to control the path length of the recoil jet and reduce the impact of the background, jets are required to pass a leading constituent cut and are reconstructed using only high energy and momentum constituents.  We present the current status of this analysis in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV.  To further probe the path length dependence, we will also present Pb-Pb jets relative to the event plane, which include a highly robust and precise background subtraction method to remove the complex, flow dominated, heavy ion background.  The jet yields and widths will be presented for the Pb--Pb analyses and compared to our baseline measurements in pp collisions.  In addition, yields and widths for di-hadron correlations in Pb-Pb will be presented.",

In particular, extensive jet energy loss measurements have allowed unique opportunity for probing the âinternal workingâ of such plasma and for understanding the nonperturbative dynamics that underlies the confinement transition at $T_c$. Significant progress has been made recently in constructing such a microscopic model â the semi-quark-gluon-monopole plasma (sQGMP) which integrates two essential elements of confinements, i.e. the Polyakov-loop suppression of quarks/gluons and emergent magnetic monopoles. Based on sQGMP, a new comprehensive framework for simulating jet energy loss has been developed, called CUJET3.0, which (1) treats the radiative energy loss in the DGLV formalism; (2) convolutes energy loss with a bulk evolution of heavy ion collisions from the state-of-the-art viscous hydrodynamic simulation (VISHNU hydro) that is data-validated; (3) constrains the thermodynamic contents of the plasma constituents by current lattice QCD data. The CUJET3.0 simulation results have successfully passed the test of seven sets of jet quenching (leading-hadron) observables, including light hadrons' $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at AuAu 200GeV and at PbPb 2.76TeV as well as D and B mesons $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at PbPb 2.76TeV.

The hard jet structure is sensitive to the virtuality evolution of a parton in the medium, as well as the role of (de)coherent gluon emitters. Results and prospects on the transverse momentum balance, mass and angular difference of the two hard subjets over a wide range of jet transverse momentum and various collision centrality selections are discussed.",

Recent works have pointed out the importance of colour coherence for jets passing through QCD matter. The results are indicative of a reorganisation of the jet fragmentation in terms of resolved subjets each of which are affected independently by energy loss in the medium. We study this picture in detail for groomed jets in heavy-ion collisions using the âsoft dropâ procedure which singles out two hard jet substructures. As a direct measurement of colour (de)coherence, we show how wide-angle structures should be strongly suppressed compared to narrow ones. We also discuss the sizeable effects of colour (de)coherence on inclusive as well as jet substructure observables.",

In this work, we report two field-theoretical analyses involving the shear and the bulk relaxation time. First, by carefully examining the analytic structure of the stress-energy tensor response functions, we have been able to derive, for the first time, a Kubo formula involving both the shear and the bulk relaxation times. Second, by evaluating the Kubo formula within the massless scalar theory, we have so far been able to calculate the shear relaxation time in a simple form.

      "Abstract": "Hard hadrons, including heavy flavor and high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ light flavor hadrons, serve as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) coupled to (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic model that simultaneously describes the temporal evolution of both heavy and light partons inside QGP on the same footing [1]. Both quasi-elastic [2] and inelastic [3,4,5] processes are included in our LBT model for parton energy loss in the de-confined QCD medium. On the freeze-out hypersurface, the hadronization of hard partons into their corresponding color neutral bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid fragmentation plus jet-thermal coalescence model [1,6].\r\n\r\nWithin this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering leads to linear increase of parton energy loss with respect to time and is important at early time, inelastic scattering results in quadratic increase of energy loss at early time but then saturates to linear increase and dominates parton evolution at later time. With proper incorporation of the temperature and energy dependences of parton-medium interaction, we simultaneously describe heavy ($D$ and $B$ mesons) and light flavor (charged hadron) suppression, 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows for all centrality bins and all collision energies as observed from RHIC to the LHC experiments. The temperature and momentum dependences of the jet transport coefficient ($\\hat{q}$) extracted from our model to data comparison are consistent with the range previously constrained by the JET Collaboration. While $\\Delta E_g > \\Delta E_q > \\Delta E_c > \\Delta E_b$ holds in our framework, we show that such flavor hierarchy in $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ at hadron level can be modified due to the combinatory effect of initial momentum spectra, parton energy loss and fragmentation functions.\r\n\r\nWe also perform a systematic comparison for the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows of heavy vs. light flavor hadrons, from which the degree of heavy quark thermalization inside QGP is investigated as functions of centrality and colliding energy. $D$-hadron and $e$-hadron correlation functions are studied for the first time as well and shown to be a good observable to quantify not only the thermalization degree of heavy quarks [7] but also the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles. Comparisons between our predictions and future measurements are expected to provide better insights of the interaction dynamics between hard partons and the QGP.\r\n\r\n[1] S. Cao, T. Luo, G.-Y.

      "Abstract": "Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are predominantly produced through initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions and, as such, they experience the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium created in such collisions. Therefore, they can provide important insights into the properties of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP).  For instance, the azimuthal anisotropy of charm quarks with respect to the reaction plane over a broad momentum range can provide information on the degree of thermalization for heavy flavor quarks in the medium and the bulk properties of the system. Specifically, at low transverse momenta we can examine the bulk properties in the strongly-coupled regime. Furthermore, several models have predicted that fluctuations in the initial conditions, together with strong charm-medium interactions, could lead to a finite triangular flow $v_3$ for the $D^0$ meson, providing another handle to study the early stages of the collisions.\r\n \r\n In this talk we present the measurement of azimuthal anisotropy of $D^0$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}= 200$ GeV with the Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. Compared to previously reported $D^0$ $v_2$ in minimum-bias collisions, the significance of the new result is improved by a factor of 2-4, allowing the study of the transverse momentum and centrality dependence of $D^0$ elliptic and triangular flow for the first time. The results will be compared with the measurements of other particle species and a series of model calculations. Charm quark dynamics in the sQGP medium will be discussed and the question of whether charm quarks are as thermalized as light quarks will be addressed.",

The measurements are performed over the transverse momentum range 4 <$p_{\\mathrm {T}}$< 14 GeV and over the 0-60% centrality interval. Backgrounds arising from in-flight pion and kaon decays, hadronic showers, and  mis-reconstructed muons are removed using a template-fit procedure. The heavy-flavor muon differential cross-sections and per-event yields are measured in $pp$  and Pb+Pb collisions, respectively. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ is observed to be independent of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ within uncertainties and to be less than unity, which indicates suppressed production of heavy flavor muons in Pb+Pb collisions. The heavy-flavor muon yield is also measured as a function of the azimuthal angle difference, $\\phi-Psi_{2}$, relative to the second-order event plane angle. Fourier coefficients associated with the $\\cos(2(\\phi-\\Psi_{2}))$ modulation, $v_2$ , are measured as a function of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$  and centrality. They vary slowly with $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and show a systematic variation with centrality that is characteristic of other $v_2$ measurements. The higher-order harmonics $v_3$ and $v_4$ are also measured.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Bottomonia are important probes of the quark-gluon plasma since they are produced at early times and propagate through the medium, mapping its evolution. They are also considered to be cleaner probes than charmonia due to the lack of regeneration even at the LHC energies. In Run 1 at the LHC, CMS was able to explore multiple measurements of the Y(nS) states in pp and PbPb collisions, down to $p_{T}$ = 0. In PbPb and pp, the production cross sections for all three Y(nS) states were measured at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeVwith the exception of the Y(3S) state, which was not observed in PbPb collisions. The suppression of the Y(1S) state was seen to depend on centrality, but not significantly on transverse momentum or rapidity. In Run 2, we have now measured the ground state to excited state ratios of Bottomonia in PbPb and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The Y(2S)/Y(1S) ratiois found to be below 1 over the full centrality range and a weak dependence is found as a function of dimuon kinematics. For the Y(3S) state, an upper limit has been obtained as a function of centrality where a Y(3S)/Y(1S) ratio compatible with 0 is observed over the full centrality range. In this talk, we will present the final CMS results on bottomonium production from Run 1, together with new Run 2 results from the high statistics PbPb data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV collected in 2015.",

However, the interpretation of J/Ï suppression is still challenging due to the regeneration contribution from the coalescence of uncorrelated $c\\bar{c}$ pairs in the medium and the cold nuclear matter effects. By comparing productions of different charmonium states in p+p, p+Au, and Au+Au collisions, the cold and hot nuclear matter effects can be systematically studied in detail.\n\nIn the 2014 and 2015 RHIC runs, the STAR experiment recorded a large amount of data in p+p, p+Au, and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV for charmonium studies via both the dielectron and dimuon channels. In this talk, we present precise measurements of nuclear modification factors for J/Ï production over a broad kinematic range in both p+Au and Au+Au collisions.

      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics is the main theoretical framework used to describe the quark-gluon plasma produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and, possibly, proton-proton and proton-ion collisions. Therefore, understanding the physical assumptions that enter in the hydrodynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions is crucial. Especially, it is essential to elucidate the reason behind the onset of fluid-dynamical behavior at the very early stages of the collisions. \n\nIn this contribution, we investigate the onset of hydrodynamic behavior for a gas of massless particles undergoing Bjorken expansion, a proxy for the dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. In this scheme, we demonstrate that the Chapman-Enskog series, i.e., a gradient expansion in the hydrodynamic variables, has zero radius of convergence and cannot be used to consistently derive relativistic hydrodynamics [1]. On the other hand, we show that the method of moments, traditionally employed to derive Israel and Stewart's theory of hydrodynamics, converges and can be used to systematically improve the applicability of fluid-dynamical theories [2]. We further discuss what are the extended theories of hydrodynamics that emerge from higher-order truncations of the method of moments and how they can help in the description of heavy ion collisions.\n\n[1] G.S.

      "Abstract": "Despite the success of modern nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) in describing nuclear hard-process data, they still suffer from large uncertainties. One of the shortcomings is the lack of data which would constrain the nuclear effects of all parton flavours simultaneously without any a priori assumptions. For example, it has been customary to assume that nuclear modifications for both valence quarks u and d are the same. We have studied the prospects of using the Drell-Yan dilepton process in pion-nucleus collisions as a novel input in the global analysis of nPDFs [1]. In a NLO QCD framework, we find the measured nuclear cross-section ratios from the NA3, NA10 and E615 experiments to be largely independent of pion parton distributions and also compatible with the EPS09 and nCTEQ15 nPDFs. These data sets can thus be included in global nPDF analyses without introducing significant new theoretical uncertainties or tension with the other data. In particular, we explore the constraining power of these data sets on the possible asymmetry of the valence-quark nuclear modifications.\n\n[1] P. Paakkinen, K. J. Eskola, H.

The strong decays are expected to dominate the branching ratios of heavy flavour baryons. Although the electromagnetic strength is weaker than that of the strong interaction, radiative channels are not phase space suppressed as in the case of pion transitions. Therefore, some radiative decay modes are expected to contribute significantly to heavy baryon branching fractions. In the present study, we employ a simple non-relativistic hypercentral approach with coulomb plus power potential to compute the radiative decays of the single heavy bottom baryons in terms of radiative transition magnetic moments and photon energy. The predicted radiative decay widths of singly heavy bottom baryons are in the range of few eV to KeV.",

      "Abstract": "In this talk, based on arXiv:1605.09176, we present a microscopic realization of the hollowness effect observed in proton-proton scattering at $\\sqrt s = 7$ TeV. The initial collision geometry proposed in our model could impact significantly the interpretation of data specially sensitive to it, like the eccentricities of proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.\nThe hollowness effect, not observed at lower energies, consists in a depletion of the inelasticity density at zero impact parameter of the collision. Counterintuitively, there is more inelasticity when the two protons are at about half a fermi transverse separation that for head-on collisions. Our analysis is based on three main ingredients: we rely gluonic hot spots inside the proton as effective degrees of freedom for the description of the scattering process. Next we assume that some non-trivial correlation between the transverse positions of the hot spots inside the proton exists. Finally we build the scattering amplitude from a multiple scattering, Glauber-like series of collisions between hot spots. In our approach, the onset of the hollowness effect is naturally explained as due to the diffusion or growth of the hot spots in the transverse plane with increasing collision energy. Furthermore, we will explore the impact of the non-trivial correlations between the transverse positions of the hot spots in the calculation of eccentricities in proton-proton collisions, a highly debated topic nowadays as there are suggestive signals of collective phenomena, associated to the formation of QGP in heavy ion collisions, in this smaller system that may be caused by the initial state geometry.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ is a useful tool for the study of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Recent studies with parton transport models suggest, however, that the majority of light quark $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons, not hydrodynamic flow [1-4]. Heavy quarks, produced by hard scatterings at early times in relativistic heavy ion collisions, are regarded as an excellent probe of the QGP. Is charm quark $v_2$ mainly from anisotropic escape or hydrodynamics? In this talk we try to address this question using a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model, which has been very successful in describing experimental data for the bulk matter [5]. We follow the entire evolution history of charm quarks in AMPT and study the development of charm $v_2$ in heavy ion collisions as well as small system collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies. We find the common escape mechanism to be at work for both charm and light quark $v_2$. However, in contrast to naive expectations, the charm $v_2$ appears to be more sensitive to hydrodynamics than light quarkâs $v_2$. We then use a simple Monte Carlo simulation to shed insights on the results. Our finding thus highlights the importance of heavy quark flow in the study of the QGP.\n\n[1] L. He, T. Edmonds, Z.-W.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Jet-hadron and di-hadron correlations are sensitive to the low momentum and large angle modifications induced by interactions with the medium and allow higher precision measurements than jet-by-jet measurements because the background can be determined by averaging over several jets.  However, the combinatorial background has limited the precision of these measurements.  The Zero Yield At Minimum method, the standard method, has limitations, particularly at low momenta where modifications may broaden the jet.  Typically the Fourier coefficients of the azimuthal asymmetries ($v_n$) of the background are taken from independent measurements of flow coefficients.  This means that the standard method is also not robust to effects which lead to different $v_n$ in jet-like correlations, including the impact of different $v_n$ due to flow and due to jet quenching at high momenta.  \n\nWe present an alternate method, the Reaction Plane Fit (RPF) method, which uses the reaction plane dependence of the $v_n$ to constrain the shape and level of the background in the background dominated region at large $\\Delta\\eta$.  We demonstrate the efficacy of this method using a toy model.  We then apply the RPF method to di-hadron correlations relative to the reaction plane measured by STAR.  We present the correlation functions and calculate the yields, per-trigger yield modification factor ($I_{AA}$), and the widths.  Using this method, the shape of the correlation functions show little shape dependence relative to the reaction plane, an increasing $I_{AA}$ with decreasing momentum.  This is consistent with the broadening and softening of jets seen in measurements of full jets at the LHC, rather than the \"Mach cone\" structure observed in earlier studies.",

We report significant progress along this direction by the construction of a new framework based on correlated ensemble of instanton-dyons, namely the constituents of the finite-temperature instantons with non-trivial holonomy. We present a comprehensive numerical study of confinement properties in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature, obtaining important observables such as the effective holonomy potential, the static-quark potentials from Polyakov loop correlators as well as spatial Wilson loops, among others. These results are compared with lattice data.

In the first approach, we obtain both the spinodal boundaries of the unstable modes with different wavelengths and the growth rates of them at a certain temperature and baryon density in the early stage of phase separation. We find the spinodal boundaries shrink with the wavelengths of the unstable modes, and the spinodal instability is suppressed by a repulsive vector interaction. In the second approach, we study the spinodal instability of the baryonic rich quark matter in both a static box and an expanding fireball by investigating the time evolution of the quantities such as the scaled density moments, the event distribution of the particle numbers in a sub-volume, the event distribution of the anisotropic flows, and the dilepton yield.",

      "Abstract": "Repulsive baryon and meson  interactions in HRG models show sizable effects on higher order fluctuations of conserved charges. When compared to lattice QCD simulations, âa point-particle formulation of the Hadron-Resonance Gas model is unable to describe the observables as calculated in Lattice GT, even when hithero undetected Quark Model States are implemented into the hadronic spectrum used in the ppt-HRG.\nHigher order fluctuations of conserved S/Q/B charges point towards the need for a distinctly different description of light quark hadrons and strange particles: the LQCD results are compatible with reduced âstrange hadron hardcores, in agreement with their smaller cross sections.\nImplementing this different behaviours of light and strange hadrons into a HRG model allows also to reproduce the measured hadron yields from Heavy-Ion Collisions.\nIn particular, this treatment completely removes the\nso-called 'proton anomaly' supposedly found by the ALICE collaboration - it is just the neglect of the distinction of the eigenvolume terms  which causes this non-anomaly. \nRepulsive interactions furthermore allow for a consistent inclusion of exotic resonances, as the kappa meson, which influences key observables, especially in the strange sector.",

Our relativistic quark model gives special emphasis to the construction of the three quark interaction within the Baryon. Here, we have computed the mass spectra of single heavy baryons using Martin-like potential in Dirac relativistic formalism. Electromagnetic properties of baryons are an important source of information on their internal structure. The predicted results (mass spectra and magnetic moment) of single heavy baryons are found to be in agreement with available experimental results and also with other theoretical results.",

Thus, $l^{+}l^{-}$ pair measurements play an essential role in the study of hot and dense nuclear matter, created in heavy-ion collisions. Recently, a significant excess of $J/\\psi$ yield at very low transverse momentum ($p_{T}<0.3$ GeV/$c$) was reported by the ALICE [1] and STAR collaborations in peripheral A+A collisions. These observations may point to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\\psi$ in violent hadronic interactions while traditionally coherent photoproduction is thought to only exist in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions when the traversing nuclei remain intact. It is interesting to investigate the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in a wider invariant mass region ($M_{ee}<4$ GeV/$c^{2}$) at very low $p_{T}$ in heavy-ion collisions for different centrality bins. If the coherent photoproduction mechanism is confirmed, the coherently photoproduced $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs accompanying violent hadronic collisions may provide a novel probe of the hot and dense nuclear matter.\n\nIn this talk, we will present $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair invariant mass spectra in three $p_{T}$ bins (0-0.15, 0.15-1, and 1-10 GeV/$c$) and $p_{T}$ spectra for $p_{T}<0.3$ GeV/$c$ in three mass regions (0.4-0.76, 1.2-2.6, and 2.8-3.2 GeV/$c^{2}$) in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and U+U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV.

We find a significant impact on antibaryons, Kaons and pions through all energies, although the influence at lower energies is more pronounced. The effect of the $B \\bar B \\leftrightarrow 3M$ reactions on the antibaryons rather than the baryons is notable due to the overall lower multiplicities of the antibaryons.

      "Abstract": "Understanding the properties of extreme phases of nuclear matter created in relativistic heavy ion collisions is one of the major challenges in theoretical physics. A question that is central to the understanding of the very early stages of such collisions near the cross-over temperature of QCD is: How do non-conformal properties affect the resulting plasma? In this presentation we address this problem in a strongly coupled setup via the gauge/gravity duality by utilizing numerical relativity techniques to describe black hole formation in the gravity side. This allows to access real-time dependent non-equilibrium dynamical quantities like pressure gradients and bulk viscosity. We observe that the equation of state is not obeyed out of equilibrium. We do a systematic explore when the equation of state is applicable again -  and will coin this time-scale the EoSization time. The scan in temperature with varying non-conformality shows that EoSization before hydrodynamization can actually happen with only a slight amount of bulk viscosity.",

The nominal Pb-Pb interaction and readout rate for ALICE after LS2 will be of 50 kHz. To remedy this problem the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT)ÃÅ is being designed and constructed. FIT will be the main forward trigger, luminometer, and collision time detector. It will also determine multiplicity, centrality, and reaction plane of heavy ion collisions. The detector will consist of two arrays of Cherenkov radiators with MCP-PMT sensors and of a single scintillator ring. The arrays will be placed around the beam line on the opposite sides of the interaction point: at ~800 mm on the hadron absorber side and at ~3200 mm on the other side where also a 1489 mm diameter scintillator ring will be located. The resolution of the interaction time extracted from the Cherenkov arrays will be equal or better than 40 ps for low multiplicity events and better than 30 ps at higher multiplicities.

      "Abstract": "The suppression of the quarkonium states in AA collisions, observed by the STAR and PHENIX collaborations at RHIC and by the CMS and ALICE collaborations at LHC, is one of the most convincing evidence for the creation of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). The precise survival of excited states vs ground states could even allow to measure the highest temperature reached in those collisions, according for instance to the sequential suppression scenario which is substantiated by calculations of the dissociation temperature based on lattice potentials evaluated at finite temperature. \n\nIn our contribution, we address the question of charmonium and bottomonium dissociations resorting to a dynamical approach, i.e. the non-linear Schroedinger-Langevin equation (SLE). In this scheme, a time-dependent real potential reflects the Debye-screening of the heavy quark/antiquark pair self interaction, while a fluctuation/dissipation mechanism expresses its hard interactions with the QGP. The SLE enables to treat the transitions to open quantum states and between bound states, which play an important role for excited state final populations. It allows to consider a realistic compact initial state, made of a linear superposition of eigenstates and to preserve quantum coherence and unitarity in the time-evolution of a pair.\nIn a stationary QGP, our SLE naturally leads to asymptotic distributions of the states following correct statistical weights, which allows to make the link with models based on the hypothesis of statistical recombination. This sanity check is a unique feature of our approach.\n \nWe will describe the most important properties of the SLE. We will then present the suppression prediction resulting from the SLE embedded in the state-of-the-art EPOS evolution scenario of the QGP background. Including initial cold nuclear matter effects, the pT and centrality dependences of the yields will be discussed both for RHIC and LHC energies. \n\nReferences: \n\n - Annals of Physics 368 (2016) 267-295 \n - arXiv:1601.01443 (accepted for publication in Nuclear Physics A)",

      "Abstract": "Quarkonia are mesons formed of either a charm and anti-charm quark pair (J/Psi, Psi(2S)), or a beauty and anti-beauty quark pair (Upsilon(1S), (2S) and (3S)). In high-energy hadronic collisions such as those delivered by the LHC between 2010 and 2015, quarkonium production results from the hard scattering of two gluons in a process which occurs very early in the collision followed by the hadronization of the heavy quark pair in a bound state. In pp collisions, quarkonium measurements help characterize production mechanisms. These same measurements also provide a reference baseline for p-A and A-A measurements which in turn quantify cold and hot nuclear properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). While charmonia are produced rather abundantly in such collisions, interpreting the measurement of their inclusive production is complicated by the presence of a sizable non-prompt contribution from the decay of b-hadrons. Bottomonia on the other hand have much smaller production cross sections but no non-prompt contribution. Moreover, their heavier mass makes them more suitable for perturbative QCD calculations. In this presentation we will report on forward rapidity ($2.5 \\lt y \\lt 4$) $\\rm{J}/\\psi$, $\\psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon$  latest results in the di-muon decay channel performed by ALICE in pp collisions at a center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, using data collected at the LHC during the 2015 run and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 3.5 pb$^{-1}$.

As a class of candidates, the consequences of constituent quark Glauber models are explored. Multiplicity density is found to scale with the number of quark participants for different systems and centrality's. Eccentricities show a sizable increase in both p+A and A+A systems, when a large (i.e. close to proton charge radius) quark rms radius is used. We argue that the increase in the two types of systems have different origins. The eccentricities are further used to validate acoustic scaling for a broad range of systems (p+p, p+Au, p+Pb, d+Au, p+Pb, etc.) and energies.",

An important aspect of this analysis is that the reconstruction is done using the central barrel detectors, with a much better momentum resolution, making our new measurement sensitive to key characteristics of the J/Ï coherent photo-production component, like the shape of the transverse momentum spectrum.\n\n \n\nTogether with the existing results at forward rapidity, in this talk we will present the J/Ï production cross-section in the very low-pT range at mid-rapidity in peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at âsNN = 5.02 TeV.

      "Abstract": "Current experimental findings at RHIC and LHC imply that a strongly coupled quark gluon plasma (QGP) is created in heavy-ion collisions. This calls for a non-perturbative investigation to understand relations between various observables and the underlying physical mechanisms. Considering the difficulties in first principle approaches, we have developed a tractable non-perturbative many-body T-matrix model to investigate the strongly coupled features of the QGP. Through our recent developments [1,2],  we can self-consistently solve the thermodynamics of our model including resummed non-perturbative t-channel contributions [3], where two-body resonance and scattering states are treated on equal footing. Inputs of the model are constrained by matching thermal Euclidian-time quantities with lattice QCD, such as static quark free energy, equation of states (EoS), and various susceptibilities. With these constrained inputs, the model can directly calculate various real-time amplitudes and spectral functions that closely relate to observables without involving analytic continuations. More concretely, matching to heavy-quark (HQ) free energy data, we extract a strongly coupled potential [1]. Using this potential as input, we find broad light-parton spectral functions by comparing to the EoS [2]. With these constraints, we obtain large HQ relaxation rates with nontrivial temperature and momentum dependences. Results from implementing these into a HQ transport model will be compared to low-momentum heavy-flavor observables from experiments [4]. We also discuss the calculation of the EoS at finite chemical potential and the comparison to susceptibilities at the finite temperature.\n\n[1] S. Y.F. Liu and R. Rapp, Nucl. Phys.

      "Abstract": "We study bottomonium production at RHIC and the LHC using a transport model including both suppression and regeneration mechanisms. The transport model utilizes a kinetic rate equation [1] to calculate the centrality dependence of the production yields, and a Boltzmann equation for transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra. It has been successful in describing and predicting charmonium data at SPS, RHIC and the LHC. The bottomonium dissociation rates are improved over previous work [2] by using in-medium binding energies from an in-medium T-matrix approach, which, in turn, require to account for both gluo-dissociation (dominant for large binding) and inelastic parton-induced break-up (dominant for weak binding) including interference effects [3]. We also update the equation of state for the bulk medium using lattice-QCD results. For the calculation of the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of the regeneration contribution we use a coalescence model [4] where the input bottom-quark spectra are taken from Langevin transport simulations of bottom quarks [5] to account for their non-equilibrium distributions. We then conduct a systematic analysis of bottomonium observables for the nuclear modification factor as a function of $N_{\\rm part}$ and $p_T$ in comparison to ALICE, CMS and STAR data. The comparison suggests that the centrality dependence of the total yields is sensitive to different scenarios for the screening of binding energies. The off-equilibrium bottom-quark spectra are found to play an important role in both the bottomonium $p_T$ spectra and their predicted elliptic, which helps to disentangle the role of regeneration contributions.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] X.

For physical quark mass the transition is a rapid crossover, with a pseudo-transition temperature and density of 151 MeV and 559 MeV, respectively.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are considered as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultra-realistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the simultaneous description of the heavy meson nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ poses a significant challenge for most commonly used transport modes, especially those based on Langevin transport. We propose a generalized ansatz for the temperature and momentum dependence of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient and subsequently extract its functional form by calibrating against RHIC and LHC data utilizing a Bayesian model-to-data analysis. Using the extracted transport coefficient, our improved Langevin framework is able to simultaneously reproduce the measured $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at both RHIC and LHC energies.\n\nThe Bayesian analysis used to extract  the transport coefficient is set up as follows: a set of input parameters, in which the temperature and momentum dependence of the transport coefficient $D_s$ is encapsulated, are evaluated via an event-by-event heavy flavor transport model. In a (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical model describes the QCD medium, heavy quarks propagate according to an improved Langevin equation that incorporates both radiative and collisional energy loss. Hadronization of heavy quarks occurs via a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination. Those model outputs are used to train Gaussian process emulators that mimic the behavior the heavy quark transport model, and act as a fast surrogate of the transport model to interpolate across the full model parameter space. We then calibrate the model parameters on experimental data via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Bayes' Theorem. The final results of the analysis are the posterior probability distribution of all the model parameters that contain the high likelihood parameters range  in which the model describes the data optimally. We find that the transport coefficient $D_s$ has a minimum value around critical temperature, and is comparable to lattice QCD calculation. A non-trivial momentum dependence of $D_s$ is observed as well.  With the extracted functional form of the transport coefficients, the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy quarks in different centralities at 200 GeV AuAu collisions and 2.76/5.02 TeV PbPb collisions are calculated, and observed to be consistent with the experimental data. The result of p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV is calculated and compared with experimental data.",

Examples include the collective behaviour of the QGP medium, jets, quantum statistics or Coulomb effects, conservation laws, and decays of resonances. In this talk, we report such measurements from ALICE with identified particles (pions, kaons, protons, and lambdas) in pp at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and p-Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV collisions. The analysis of identified particles in pp collisions reveals differences in particle production between baryons and mesons, which reflect the specific conservation laws for these quantum numbers. For baryon pairs, where both particles have the same baryon number, a near-side anti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak. Such effects have usually been connected to conservation laws in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions and were thought to be under theoretical control; however, our results present a challenge to the contemporary models (PYTHIA, PHOJET). In case of p-Pb collisions at LHC energies, we report results of two particle correlations with identified trigger particles (pions and protons) selected from the intermediate $p_T$ range (2.0 < $p_T$ < 4.0 GeV/c), where an inclusive baryon to meson enhancement has been observed. Our results are reported as a function of multiplicity. The large enhancement of the baryon to meson ratio observed at intermediate $p_T$ in central heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC can be attributed to coalescence and/or radial flow. These mechanisms may lead to a dilution of the near side jet-like yield, that impacts baryons and mesons differently. For these results, a comparison between data and model predictions (AMPT and EPOS3) will also be presented.",

      "Abstract": "We study the behavior of the real and the imaginary parts of the static \npotential between a heavy quark and its anti-quark, \nwhich are in relative motion with respect to the QGP medium. The heavy \nquark-antiquark complex potential is obtained by correcting both the\nCoulombic and the linear terms in the Cornell potential\nthrough the dielectric function in real-time formalism using the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation.\nWe show the variation of both the real and the imaginary parts of the potential for different values of velocity\nwhen the bound state is aligned in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the velocity of the thermal medium.\nWe find that real part of potential increases with the increase in velocity at short distances and becomes \nless screened but it decreases with increase in velocity at large distances for the parallel case. On the other\nhand, the potential decreases with the increase in velocity for the perpendicular case which results in \nthe more screening of the potential. Since the $ Q\\bar{Q} $ potential is effectively more screened \nin the moving plasma, it results in the earlier dissociation of quarkonium states in a moving medium.\nThe inclusion of string term makes the potential less screened as compared to the Coulombic term alone for both the cases.\nCombining all these effects we expect a stronger binding of a $ Q\\bar{Q} $ pair in moving medium in the presence of string\nterm as compared to the Coulombic term alone. The imaginary part decreases (in magnitude) with increase in velocity and \nincreases (in magnitude) with inclusion of string term. We also calculate the decay width of the quarkonium state  \nand find that width decreases with increase in velocity and increases with the inclusion of the string term.\nAll of these effects leads to the modification of the quarkonium suppression. \nWe also extend our calculation at finite chemical potential and show its effect on the properties of quarkonium states in a moving medium.",

      "Abstract": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR is designed to explore the QCD phase diagram in the region of large baryochemical potentials. One of the important experimental observables are dileptons, which probe the properties of the matter in the fireball from the first stage of the collision until freezeout. Dileptons  will be produced over a wide range of invariant mass region and offer the possibility to investigate the properties of low-mass vector mesons in the dense medium, the temperature of the fireball at intermediate masses, upto the production of charmonia.  In order to obtain a complete and high-precision dilepton data set, the CBM setup features both electron and  muon detection systems.\n\n\nA novel Muon Chamber system (MUCH) is under development for CBM consisting of alternating layers of detector triplets sandwiched between absorber slices of varying thickness. Detailed simulations have been performed using both using GEANT and FLUKA to optimize the detector configurations. MUCH will consist of a combination of five sets of absorber and detector stations. The tracks from the Silicon Tracking Station (STS) of CBM will be extrapolated to MUCH to identify muons. \n\nIn order to handle the high particle rate on the detectors corresponding to an interaction rate of 10 MHz of Au+Au collisions at CBM, GEM-based gaseous detectors will be used in the first two stations. Large size trapezoidal shaped, triple GEM detectors having progressively increasing pad-sizes will be read out using self-triggered electronics. Prototype detectors with realistic sizes (~2000 sq. cm) have been designed, fabricated and tested in a self-streaming mode using cosmic muons and particle beams. The tests satisfy the basic design criteria of detection efficiency and rate capability of the detector. The design optimization and performance of prototype detectors will be presented.",

The discovery of flow-like azimuthal correlations in pA and high-multiplicity pp collisions raises profound questions about the onset of collective flow and its relation to hydrodynamics. We seek independent experimental information on the degree of thermalization in order to identify those truly hydrodynamic collision systems in which flow is sensitive to equilibrium QCD properties. \n\nWe aim to develop a protocol for identifying the degree of thermalization using a combination of momentum and multiplicity correlation observables. To study the effect of thermalization on these correlations, we turn to the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation with Langevin noise. We derive a new nonequilibrium transport equation for the two-body distribution function that is consistent with the conservation laws obeyed by microscopic scattering processes. We find that these conservation laws constrain the long-range behavior of the correlation observables to behave differently depending on the degree of thermalization. We find that transverse momentum fluctuations in peripheral PbPb collisions at LHC markedly deviate from equilibrium behavior. We propose new measurements that can provide more refined information.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Magnetic monopoles are suggested to play an important role in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) near the deconfinement temperature. Lattice studies show that near the confinement temperature, $T_c$, quark-gluon plasma (QGP) contains both electric and magnetic quasiparticles. Further studies of the behavior of these quasiparticles at and above $T_c$, such as those by Liao and Shuryak (2006-2009) and DâElia and DâAlessandro (2007-2009), found that the magnetic component of QGP forms a liquid, and that the magnetic monopoles form a Bose-Einstein condensate as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, creating the dual-superconductor proposed as a mechanism for confinement. \n\nIn this work, we conduct path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of magnetic monopoles, in order to study their behavior at temperatures at and above the confinement temperature. First, we sought to replicate the lattice results of DâAlessandro, DâElia, and Shuryak (2009) through the study of the permutation cycles of one- and two-component plasmas of bosons interacting with a Coulomb potential. We found for the two-component plasma, as they did on the lattice, that as the system approaches $T_c$ from above the exponential suppression of permutation cycles of these bosons decreases before disappearing at $T_c$, indicating a phase transition. \n\nWe then study thermodynamics and physical distribution of magnetic monopoles, using the densities and coupling strengths given by DâAlessandro and DâElia (2007); and Liao and Shuryak (2009). At low temperatures, in addition to the formation of the condensate, we see formation of âdropletsâ of the magnetic charges at strong coupling. This suggesting that the monopoles are indeed forming a liquid, as seen by Liao and Shuryak in their classical molecular dynamics simulations. At low temperatures and large couplings, there are also signs of crystallization in this system, an interesting analog to systems of extremely high density, such as helium white dwarf stars. We then simulate the system at higher temperatures â along lower densities and strong coupling â and see the breakup of these drops of monopole âliquid.â Finally, we draw conclusions about the contribution of the monopoles to the overall thermodynamics of the QGP above the confinement temperature.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quark production in proton-nucleus (p$A$) collisions at RHIC and LHC provides important information on the gluon saturation dynamics at small-$x$  of a heavy nucleus. We report the update of our Color-Glass-Condensate (CGC) calculation of heavy flavor production including quarkoniums, open heavy flavor mesons and decay leptons. Moreover, we will implement more realistic treatment for the initial saturation scale in the target nucleus with the Monte-Carlo (MC) Glauber approach. Within the MC-Glauber approach, we can take into account the initial fluctuation of nucleon distribution and discuss event activity dependence of heavy quark production in p$A$ collisions.\n\nIn a series of our papers [1,2,3], we have computed heavy quark production in p$A$ collisions in the CGC framework. Essentially, our calculations have been based on the CGC framework at leading order (LO) with the running coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov equation (rcBK) which includes a subset of next-to-leading order (NLO) correction. A main difference between pp and p$A$ collisions is the choice of the initial saturation scale in the rcBK equation. \n\nWe update the evaluation of the nuclear modification factors of $J/\\psi$, $D$ meson productions (Refs. [1,2]) by varying the initial saturation scale more systematically and also by extending the calculation with the MC-Glauber implementation. We find that the $R_{{\\rm p}A}$ is quite sensitive to the initial saturation scale for nucleus. In Ref.

Recently, some of us have worked out analytic expressions for event-averaged quantities in the CGC formalism based on a near field approximation [Phys. Rev. C 92, 064912 (2015)]. Unlike numerical solutions, the analytic approach provides an intuitive picture of the classical gluon field, and its energy momentum tensor, at the earliest times (tau < 1/Qs).  Here we use our previous work as the basis for the construction of an event generator that can provide a dynamical evolution of the system at early times. We calculate the time-evolution of the field strength tensor and the energy momentum tensor event-by-event in full SU(3). Using the previously established analytic methods makes the event generator fast and well controlled. It also makes it easy to single out non-abelian effects in the time evolution and to study them separately. We discuss our method step-by-step and show first results.",

      "Abstract": "Studies of the production of heavy quarkonium states are crucial to improve our understanding of QCD and hadron formation. Large data samples of S-wave quarkonium states decaying in the dimuon channel have been collected by CMS in pp collisions at 7, 8 and 13 TeV, profiting from a very selective trigger and the record-level energy and luminosity provided by the LHC. This allowed the CMS collaboration to perform a series of systematic measurements in quarkonium production physics, including double-differential cross sections and polarizations, as a function of rapidity, transverse momentum, and charged-particle multiplicity, for five S-wave quarkonia: J/psi, psi(2S), Y(1S), Y(2S) and Y(3S). CMS can also reconstruct low-energy photons through their conversions to e+e- pairs, then tracked in the high-granularity silicon tracker with a very good precision, resulting in an extremely good mass resolution, so that the J=1 and J=2 chi_c states can be resolved. This allows CMS to determine cross section ratios and feed-down decay fractions involving the chi states, in both the charmonium and bottomonium families. This talk presents the CMS quarkonium production results, in pp collisions, placing emphasis on the latest measurements, which include results from the run 2 of the LHC. Preliminary results on the chi_c polarization should also become available in time for this talk. Such measurements provide crucial inputs for a better understanding of quarkonium production as a signal of new physics in Pb-Pb collisions.",

      "Abstract": "A typical approach to study the medium produced in heavy ion collisions is to understand the passage of elementary particles through it. As Z bosons and photons do not participate in the strong interaction, their correlation with jets within the same event is a clean probe of the medium-induced energy loss of (predominantly) quark jets. In this analysis, Z+jet and photon+jet correlations are studied using the high statistics PbPb and pp data taken at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector. The evolution of azimuthal angular distributions and average momentum imbalance between the jet and Z or photon as a function of transverse momentum of the color neutral probe will be presented. In addition the jet $I_{AA}$, as a function of photon $p_{T}$ and collision centrality is studied.",

      "Abstract": "Jet imbalance is a known signature of jet energy loss in the hot, dense medium produced in heavy ion collisions. New measurements of the dijet asymmetry at ATLAS are presented using the 2011 Pb+Pb data from the LHC  at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\\mbox{TeV}$ using jets reconstructed with the anti-k_t algorithm with parameters R=0.3 and 0.4. While previous measurements demonstrated a significant effect in the asymmetry, a detailed quantitative understanding was difficult to obtain due to the impact of the finite jet energy resolution. This measurement has been fully unfolded to account for\n bin migration from resolution effects.  It benefits from the major improvements in jet reconstruction in a heavy-ion environment since the original ATLAS dijet measurements. This result demonstrates a centrality and leading jet transverse energy dependence of the asymmetry when compared to the \\pp reference data at the same center of mass energy.",

Consequently, their distributions can be used to probe the freeze-out properties, such as correlation volume and local baryon density of the medium created in high-energy nuclear collisions.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we report the results of deuteron and anti-deuteron production in Au-Au collision at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7$-$200 GeV, measured by STAR at RHIC. The collision energy, centrality and transverse momentum dependence of the coalescence parameter $B_2$ for deuteron and anti-deuteron production is discussed. We find the values of $B_2$ for anti-deuteron are systematically lower than those for deuterons. The difference in $B_2$ for deuteron and anti-deuteron indicate the residual isospin brought in at the beginning of the collisions. The values of $B_2$ are found to decrease with increasing collision energy. The rate of decreasing seems to change around $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 20 GeV implying a dramatic change of the equation of state of the medium in these collisions.",

The vortical nature of the system is expected to polarize emitted hadrons along the direction of system angular momentum. $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ hyperons, which reveal their polarization through decay topology, should be polarized similarly. The vorticity of the fluid is an important parameter for the generation of a Chiral Vortical Effect (CVE).\r\n\r\nThese same collisions are also characterized by dynamic magnetic fields with magnitude as large as $10^{14}$ Tesla. A splitting between $\\Lambda$ and $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ polarization may signal a magnetic coupling and provide a quantitative estimate of the field strength at freeze out. Details of the magnetic field and its evolution are of particular interest to other novel phenomena, e.g. the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME).\r\n\r\nThe STAR Collaboration has made the first observation of global hyperon polarization in non-central Au+Au collisions at Beam Energy Scan energies. A magnetic splitting is hinted at, but the improved statistics and resolution achievable with future runs are required to make a definitive measurement of the magnetic field.",

This upgrade will allow ALICE to access new levels of sensitivity for untriggered processes.  The present TPC is limited to recording minimum bias lead-lead collisions at a rate of about 1000 Hz.  The upgrade will allow recording the full expected lead-lead collision rate of 50 kHz.\nThe present ALICE TPC uses multi-wire proportional (MWPC) chambers for readout. A gating grid is used to block positive ions created at the anode wires from flowing back into the main drift volume creating track distortions.  The gating grid has an intrinsic dead time that limits the maximum collision rate that can be recorded.  The goal of this upgrade is to replace the MWPCs and gating grid with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) arranged in a configuration that allows one to maintain the spatial and energy resolution of the present TPC. The electronics will be replaced with continuous readout electronics based on a new purpose designed chip.  The project involves building 80 quadruple-GEM chambers (72 installed in the TPC plus 4 spares) utilizing 640 GEM foils.  In order to accomplish such a large project the design, construction, quality assurance and testing are divided across many institutions and countries.\nThe motivation for the technology choices, status of the project, construction methods, quality assurance and testing procedures for the GEM foils and new readout chambers will be presented.  Results from testing GEM foils, first chambers and readout electronics also will be presented.",

In order to understand precisely how the jets are modified, it is important to measure how the jet momentum is carried by its fragmentation products. The longitudinal momentum fraction of charged particles in jets from Pb+Pb, p+Pb, and p+p collisions have been measured using the ATLAS detector. Proton-proton and p+Pb collisions provide necessary baseline measurements for quantifying the modifications in  Pb+Pb collisions.  In Run 1, ATLAS collected samples of p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV and a sample of p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. In Run 2, large samples of p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV have been collected providing a complete set of collision systems at 5.02 TeV.

      "Abstract": "The thermal suppression of heavy quark bound states represents an ideal observable for determining if one has produced a quark gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In recent years, however, a paradigm shift has taken place in the theory of quarkonium suppression due to new first principles calculations of the thermal widths of these states. These thermal widths are large, eg O(20-100 MeV) for the Upsilon, and cause in-medium suppression of the states at temperatures below their traditionally defined disassociation temperatures. In order to apply the newly developed understanding to phenomenology, however, one must make detailed 3+1d dissipative hydrodynamical models of the plasma including the effects of finite shear viscosity. These effects include not only the modification of the time evolution of the temperature of the system, flow, etc., but also the emergence of potentially large local momentum-space anisotropies which can affect the in-medium properties of the states. I will discuss the setup for these model calculations and present comparisons of theory with data from RHIC 200 GeV/nucleon Au-Au collisions, LHC 2.76 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb, and LHC 5.023 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb collisions as a function of number of participants, rapidity, and transverse momentum.",

Many of these new observables have not yet been measured at RHIC, leaving an opportunity to make predictions as a test of models across energies. We make predictions using NeXSPheRIO, a hydrodynamical model which has accurately reproduced a large set of single-harmonic correlations in a large range of transverse momenta and centralities at RHIC. Our predictions thus provide an important baseline for comparison to correlations of flow harmonics, which contain nontrivial information about the initial state as well as QGP transport properties. We also point out\nsignificant biases that can appear when using wide centrality bins and non-trivial event weighting, necessitating care in performing experimental analyses and in comparing  theoretical calculations to these measurements.",

Comparing particle production between Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions to pp collisions as a reference over a wide pseudorapidity range provides insight into the longitudinal (and low-x) nature of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions.\n\nStudies from pp collisions at various energies show that the width of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density distribution increases with increasing collision energy. This underlines the importance of investigating the system size dependence of the particle production at the same collision energy.

      "Abstract": "The modifications of jets in heavy-ion collisions are manifest in many measurements. However, inclusive observables are generally susceptible to the quantum mechanical nature of interactions of the jet fragments with the medium. We argue that contemporary jet substructure techniques facilitate a more direct measurement of the radiative mechanism caused by medium interactions. As a concrete example, we focus on jet grooming using the âsoft dropâ procedure that singles out the two leading jet substructures with largest angular separation inside an energetic jet. The interplay between hard, quasi-collinear vacuum or medium-induced radiation within the reconstructed cone and soft, large-angle emissions that are responsible for out-of-cone energy flow is studied. We find an enhancement of the splitting function at small energy-fractions which is attributed to rare, relatively hard medium-induced gluon radiation affected by LPM interference with the quark-gluon plasma.",

Studies of flow harmonics using the same order event plane have been used to extract the transport properties of the hot and dense medium produced in the collisions and to explore initial state effects. The mixed higher-order harmonics have been proposed to have strong sensitivity to the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\\eta$/s) of the medium. In this talk, for the first time, the $v_{5}$ and $v_{7}$ are measured with respect to the second and third order planes. With the nonlinear component of the flow harmonics extracted based on lower order event planes, the nonlinear response coefficients for n=4, 5, 6, 7 are also presented. The mixed harmonic coefficients are studied as a function of charged particle transverse momentum and collision centrality at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector. It is found that the nonlinear response coefficients for the odd flow harmonics are larger than for the even harmonics, reflecting a stronger contributions of the nonlinear part for odd harmonics.

      "Abstract": "When high-energy partons traversing a quark-gluon plasma lose energy via bremsstrahlung or pair production, the quantum duration of that splitting process is known as the formation time.  For high energy, the formation time exceeds the mean free time for collisions with the medium, leading to a significant reduction in the splitting rate: the LPM effect.  But there are interesting and potentially important corrections to the usual treatment of the LPM effect that arise from situations where the formation times of two consecutive splittings overlap each other, and various attempts have been made over the years to account for these effects.  I will summarize recent research on computing the effect of overlapping formation times, while avoiding soft-bremsstrahlung assumptions that have been used in some of the (very interesting) theoretical work of the last few years.  I will also explain the bottom line of why finding the size of these effects has potentially important conceptual implications for the Monte Carlo treatment of in-medium splitting of high-energy partons.",

Our description is based on 3-window modeling in which nuclear matter at nB < 2n0 (nB:baryon density, n_0:saturation density) is smoothly connected to strongly correlated quark matter at nB > 5n0. Our quark matter at zero temperature is in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase with the gap of 100-200 MeV. The latter is significantly constrained by the two-solar mass constraint. Applying a schematic quark model for the nB > 5n0 domain, we constrain the possible range of the model parameters, and then use them to calculate various quantities of NG modes. Our predictions differ from the weak coupling results for the CFL because we are treating the strongly correlated domain. The resulting equations of state are like neither gapless quark nor nuclear equations of state, due to different temperature dependence of thermal contributions. The difference affects the pattern of gravitational wave signals.",

This coincidence observable is calculable perturbatively in vacuum, and has previously been measured in pp and Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC, providing a new probe to measure quenching. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks using the anti-kT algorithm with low IR cutoff of jet constituents ($p_T^{track}>0.2$ GeV/c). The analysis applies a data-driven statistical approach to correct the complex uncorrelated jet background, including multi-partonic interactions. Recoil jet distributions are reported for $15 < p_{Tjet} <50$ GeV/c, for R=0.2 and 0.4. Events are classified by signal in the ALICE V0A detector, which measures forward multiplicity, and ZNA, which measures the number of neutrons at zero degrees.  The semi-inclusive observable corresponds to the ratio of inclusive cross sections, $d\\sigma^\\mathrm{h_{trig}+jet}/\\sigma^\\mathrm{h_{trig}}$, and comparison of the recoil jet yield in p--Pb collisions with different event activity therefore does not require knowledge of $T_\\mathrm{pPb}$, thereby avoiding the need for geometric modelling. We compare the trigger-normalized recoil jet yield for p--Pb collisions with different event activity to measure the effects of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC.",

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Dijet, dihadron, hadron-jet angular correlations have been reckoned as important probes of the transverse momentum broadening effects in relativistic nuclear collisions [1]. When a pair of high-energy jets created in hard collisions traverse the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, they become de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening [2, 3]. For the first time, we employ the systematical resummation formalism and establish a baseline calculation to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data in $pp$ and peripheral $AA$ collisions where the medium effect is negligible. We demonstrate that the medium effects, especially the so-called jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, can be extracted from the angular de-correlations observed in $AA$ collisions. A global $\\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data renders the best fit $\\langle \\hat q L\\rangle_{\\textrm{tot}} \\sim 14 \\textrm{GeV}^2$ for a quark jet at RHIC top energy, with $L$ the typical traversed medium length. Our approach [1] stands as a new and complimentary method for the extraction of the jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ as compared to the JET Collaboration effort [4].

Comparison of these two jet shapes in Pb-Pb and pp collisions highlights the role of coherence effects on jet quenching, in the presence of the QGP medium, by separating two-pronged jets from the rest of the jet population. Coherence effects relate to the ability of the medium to resolve a jet's substructure, which has an impact on the energy loss magnitude and mechanism of the traversing jet. In both collision systems charged jets are found with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm, a resolution parameter of R = 0.4 and a constituent cut off of 0.15 GeV. The reclustering algorithm used to obtain the hardest splitting is the exclusive-$k_t$ algorithm. This analysis uses hadron-jet coincidence techniques in Pb-Pb collisions to reject the combinatorial background and further corrects for background effects by employing various jet shape subtraction techniques and unfolding.

      "Abstract": "Despite intense theoretical and experimental investigation, the physical mechanisms governing the suppression of bound quark-antiquark states in nuclear collisions are not yet fully understood.  While color screening in a plasma phase is expected to play a role, there are numerous other possible suppression mechanisms that do not require deconfinement, as well as effects on the heavy quark initial state in the nucleus which can also play a role.  To study these effects, the PHENIX collaboration has used the flexibility of the RHIC accelerator complex to observe the evolution of open heavy flavor and quarkonia dynamics as both the projectile and target nuclei size are varied.  Open heavy flavor in small collision systems can serve as the baseline for interpreting quarkonia production in the nuclear environment, and comparisons of the $\\psi(2S)$ with the $J/\\psi$ show that in rapidity regions with relatively high hadron density, the larger $2S$ state is preferentially more suppressed than the more tightly bound $J/\\psi$.  This suggests that late-stage mechanisms may be at least partially responsible for quarkonia suppression in nuclear collisions.  In this talk, we will present results on excited-state quarkonia in $p+p$, $p$+Al, and $p$/$d$/$^3$He+Au collisions and open heavy flavor in small systems, and discuss how these measurements impact our understanding of heavy quark behavior in the quark-gluon plasma.",

      "Abstract": "High energy heavy ion collisions are found to be excellent factories for producing heavy hadrons and composite particles including light (anti)nuclei. With upgraded detectors, we are now able to measure hadrons beyond ground states. Thus, heavy ion collisions provide new ways of studying exotic hadrons, which are the primary interests in hadron physics, as many experiments other than heavy ion collisions have already found exotic candidates and their existence itself is related to the fundamental problems in QCD.\n\nWe discuss here the production of exotic hadrons with strange, charm and bottom quarks in heavy ion collisions, and show how, if measured, the production rates can be used to discriminate between compact multiquark configuration from hadronic molecular configurations [1,2]. We extend our previous study to include newly discovered states such as Zb, X(5568) and Pc, and present realistic estimates on their production yields. We furthermore discuss feasibility of confirming their existence and discriminating their structure from measurements in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC.   \n\nSpecifically, we consider the coalescence and statistical hadronization model to calculate the production yields of exotic hadrons. We give detailed discussions on the application of the coalescence model to resonant states by including finite decay widths, and show that the production yields are sensitive to structures of exotic hadrons, namely compact multi-quark states or extended hadronic molecule states. We also investigate the production of scalar mesons, Lambda(1405), dibaryons, and Ds mesons in addition to charmonium-like and bottomonium-like states called X, Y, Z, which have been recently reported in several accelerator facilities, Belle, BaBar, BESS, LHCb and so on.\n\n[1] S.

Encouraging evidence of CME-induced charge separation has been reported from both RHIC and LHC, albeit with ambiguity due to potential background contributions. Crucial for addressing such issue, is need of quantitative predictions of CME signal with sophisticated modeling tool. \n\n\nIn this talk we report a recently developed Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework, which simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the data-validated VISHNew bulk hydro evolution. With realistic initial conditions and magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively consistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV AuAu collisions. We further develop the event-by-event AVFD simulations that directly compute CME-induced two-particle correlations as well as the non-CME background. Finally we report predictions for the upcoming isobaric (RuRu v.s. ZrZr ) collisions that could provide the critical test of the CME in heavy ion collisions.",

The importance of these corrections on hadronic observables has been shown in [1]. However, their effects on electromagnetic observables has been explored only for the 2-to-2 scattering channels [2]. Viscous corrections to the inelastic leading-order photon production channels have been lacking so far. In this work, we will present first calculations of the shear and bulk viscous correction to the Arnold-Moore-Yaffe (AMY) photon production rates which include bremsstrahlung and pair annihilation without relying on the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. We fold the rate with a hydrodynamic evolution in order to examine the phenomenological implications on photonic observables in AA collisions.

We have studied the effects of these fluctuations using a lattice QCD-based equation of state. We find that these correlations extend over large rapidities for various choices of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, underlining the importance of hydrodynamic fluctuations. The boost-invariant solution is only an\napproximation to the true longitudinal dynamics, valid at mid-rapidity. We have also considered a non-boost-invariant viscous expansion and investigated the effect of hydrodynamic fluctuations within the framework of linearized hydrodynamics.

      "Abstract": "It is widely expected that the growth of parton densities at low x predicted from linear QCD evolution cannot continue indefinitely, and that non-linear effects will lead to gluon saturation. We propose the measurement of forward(3.5 < y < 5) direct photons in a new region of low x(â¼ 10 â6 ) in proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC as a decisive probe of gluon saturation. In order to discriminate decay photons with very small opening angle from neutral pions, which is the dominant background, an extremely high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeter is required, which we propose as a detector upgrade to the ALICE experiment, the Forward Calorimeter (FoCal).\n\n \n\nTo facilitate the design of the upgrade and to perform generic R&D necessary for such a novel calorimeter, a compact Si/W sampling electromagnetic calorimeter prototype using CMOS pixel sensors with a granularity of 30Ã30 Î¼m has been built and used for measurements in test beams. This digital calorimeter has shown to have good energy linearity and a very small Moliere radius(â¼11mm). We will discuss new results of the R&D with electromagnetic showers, in particular a position resolution of better than 30Î¼m, and first studies of hadron identification performance. This precise position determination and the detailed knowledge of the electromagnetic shower shape obtained will provide the crucial capability for two-photon separation down to a separation of a few mm. The results show the extremely high potential of this technology for future calorimeter development",

      "Speaker": "Jussi Auvinen",
      "Institute": "Duke University",
      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the past few years in determining QGP properties, such as the temperature dependence of shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$. However, $\\eta/s$ might depend also on the baryochemical potential $\\mu_B$, as has been hinted at in a recent beam energy scan study [1].\r\n\r\nIt is generally difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the extracted values of QGP properties, as the computational models used in the analysis typically have numerous interconnected parameters. We utilize novel optimization techniques based on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to calibrate the computational model to data. The end result of such an analysis is a conditional probability distribution, which provides a set of data-calibrated parameter values with a full uncertainty quantification. Gaussian process emulators are also used in the analysis to overcome its significant computational expense and predict model results for all needed input parameter combinations. These statistical methods have already been applied with great success to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [2].\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we investigate the $\\mu_B$ dependence of $\\eta/s$, with collision energy as the control parameter, by performing a Bayesian analysis on RHIC beam energy scan data, applying the same UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model as in [1], to verify if the reported differences between the energies remain significant even when uncertainties are included. We determine the probability distributions for the model parameters for Au+Au collisions at $19.6$, $39$, and $62.4$ GeV; the results indicate that while the uncertainty on the optimal value of $\\eta/s$ does increase at lower collision energies, the probability for a large value of the ratio is much higher at $19.6$ GeV with the median value $0.24$, compared to $62.4$ GeV with median value $0.07$ [3]. Moreover, we also find that multi-strange hadron yields provide significant constraints on the switching condition between the hydrodynamic evolution and the hadron transport afterburner and thus are essential for a proper model-to-data comparison [4].\r\n\r\n[1] Iu.

      "Abstract": "The RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program was proposed to look for the turn-off of signatures of the quark gluon plasma (QGP), search for a possible QCD critical point, and study the nature of the phase transition between hadronic and partonic matter. The results from the NA49 experiment at CERN have been used to claim that the onset of deconfinement occurs at â(s_NN )  â7 GeV, the low end of the BES range. Additionally, studies of several interesting observables during the BES, including v1 of protons and lambdas, v2 of identified hadrons, and net-proton higher moments, show interesting behavior below 20 GeV and could suggest a transition to a hadron dominated regime. Data from energies lower than 7 GeV could help determine whether these behaviors are indicative of phase transitions or criticality. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES-II with the same detector to lower energies than is feasible at RHIC with colliding beams. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we present results from STARâs first dedicated fixed-target test run conducted in 2015 with Au + Au collisions at â(s_NN )=4.5 GeV. Direct flow of protons, elliptic flow of identified hadrons, HBT radii, as well as pion, proton, kaon, K_S^{0}, and lambda spectra are compared with previous results from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). These results demonstrate that STAR has good event reconstruction and particle identification capabilities for this fixed-target configuration even though it was optimized for colliding beams in the center of the detector.

The data sample includes multi-differential representations of charged and neutral Kaons, Lambdas and Phi-mesons. The multiplicities, together with those for non-strange hadrons, have been analyzed in the context of statistical hadronization models. Overall, a good fit is obtained if an additional parameter ($R_c$) is used to account for canonical strangeness suppression. We find that about 30 % of observed $K^-$ are produced through Phi-decay.

      "Abstract": "The quark-gluon matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions may contain local domains in which P and CP symmetries are not preserved. When coupled with an external magnetic field, such P- and CP-odd domains will generate electric currents along the magnetic field --- a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC released data of charge-dependent azimuthal-angle correlators with features consistent with the CME expectation. However, the experimental observable is contaminated with significant background contributions from elliptic-flow-driven effects, which makes the interpretation of the data ambiguous. In this Letter, we show that the collisions of isobaric nuclei, $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr, provide an ideal tool to disentangle the CME signal from the background effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the two collision types at 200 GeV have more than 10% difference in the CME signal\r\nand less than 2% difference in the elliptic-flow-driven backgrounds for the centrality range of 20-60\\%.",

      "Abstract": "Local momentum anisotropies are large in the early stages of the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, due to the extreme difference in the initial longitudinal and transverse expansion rates. In such situations, fluid dynamics derived from an expansion around an isotropic local equilibrium state is bound to break down. Instead, we resum the effects of the slowest nonhydrodynamic degree of freedom (associated with the deviation from momentum isotropy) and include it at leading order, defining a local anisotropic quasi-equilibrium state, thereby treating the longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy nonperturbatively. Perturbative transport equations are then derived to deal with the remaining residual momentum anisotropies [1]. This procedure yields a complete transient effective theory called viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics [1,2]. \r\n\r\nThe anisotropic hydrodynamic approach, especially after perturbative inclusion all residual viscous terms, has been shown to dramatically outperform viscous hydrodynamics in several simplified situations for which exact solutions exist but which share with realistic expansion scenarios the problem of large dissipative currents [1,3,4]. We will discuss the present status of applying viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics to the phenomenological description of the quark-gluon plasma in realistic expansion scenarios. To satisfy the high-performance needs of the JETSCAPE Collaboration, standard [5] and anisotropic viscous hydrodynamics algorithms were implemented on graphical processing units (GPU), leading to a 100-fold speed-up. Results from these accelerated 3+1-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulations for event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions will be compared between the standard and anisotropic frameworks and with experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] D.

D 93, 114025 (2016)  and arXiv:1606.09019, based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic one-particle distribution function. In order to close the conservation laws, it is needed to choose an additional moment of the Boltzmann equation. This is achieved by selecting the relaxation equation for the longitudinal pressure with a suitable Landau matching condition. As a result one obtains two coupled differential equations for the energy density and the longitudinal pressure which respect the $SO(3)_q \\otimes SO(1,1) \\otimes Z_2$ symmetry of the Gubser flow in the deSitter space. These equations are solved numerically and compared with the predictions of the recently found exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We also compare our numerical results with other fluid dynamical models. We observe that the MNR description of anisotropic fluid dynamics describes better the space-time evolution of the system than all currently known hydrodynamical approaches.",

      "Abstract": "While small at very high temperature, the bulk viscosity of quantum chromodynamics is expected to grow in the confinement region. Although its precise magnitude and temperature-dependence in the cross-over region is not fully understood, recent theoretical and phenomenological studies [1-5] provided evidence that the bulk viscosity can be sufficiently large to have measurable consequences on the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. In this work, a Bayesian statistical analysis is used to establish probabilistic constraints on the temperature-dependence of bulk viscosity using combined hadronic measurements from RHIC and the LHC. IP-Glasma initial conditions are used to provide realistic event-by-event fluctuations, which are understood to have an important interplay with bulk viscosity. The width of the peak of bulk viscosity, along with the position of the peak in the transition region, are investigated phenomenologically for the first time. A lower but wider peak than the parametrization used in [3-5] is found to be preferred. Constraints on the position of the peak are found to be limited, with tension observed between the values favoured by RHIC and LHC measurements. The relative effect of shear and bulk viscosities on hadronic observables, in particular momentum anisotropies, is investigated.\n\n[1] Karsch, F., Kharzeev, D. and Tuchin, K. (2008) Phys. Lett.

An important early finding at RHIC was that hydrodynamic calculations can account for the measured anisotropy at low $p_{T}$ and relate them to the collision geometry. At higher $p_{T}$, where hard processes are dominant, energy loss of partons traversing the QGP also creates an azimuthal anisotropy in the final-state hadrons which is related to the collision geometry. In order to better understand the interplay between the soft and hard processes, PHENIX measured the charged-hadron $v_{n}$ coefficients over a wide $p_{T}$ range (up to 10 GeV/$c$) as a function of centrality and beam energy.    \nIn this talk, we will present new $v_{2}$ measurements for charged hadrons in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions as a function of $p_T$ and centrality and compare them to those from $\\pi^{0}$ mesons.

In addition to the single particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$, we study event-plane correlations, non-linear response coefficients $\\chi_n$, and flow factorization breaking ratios $r_n$, which were presented for the first time in the IP-Glasma framework.  Furthermore, we investigate event shape engineering as well higher flow harmonics such as $v_5$, $v_6$, and $v_7$, which were recently measured at 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS collaboration. Taken together, these observables provide a wealth of insight into the collective behavior of the QGP and initial state fluctuations. These quantities shed light on flow correlations in different $p_{T}$ ranges, flow at fixed system size but different initial geometries, as well as the non-linear hydrodynamic response to the initial state energy anisotropy. By synthesizing this information we can gain further insight into the transport properties of the QGP as well as the fluctuation spectrum of the initial state. Finally, we examine the effect of pre-equilibrium longitudinal flow, which has previously been neglected in phenomenological studies, such as the hadron and direct photon spectra and $v_n$.\r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{1609.02958}\r\n\r\nScott McDonald, Chun Shen, Francois Fillion-Gourdeau, Sangyong Jeon and Charles Gale.\r\n\\newblock Hydrodynamic Predictions for Pb+Pb Collisions at 5.02 A TeV, 2016;\r\n\\newblock arXiv:1609.02958.\r\n\r\n\\end{thebibliography}",

We find that an apparent decrease of $v_3$ with pseudorapidity in traditional measurements is not, in fact, a dependence on $\\eta$, which is negligible within the TPC acceptance, but instead is a dependence on relative pseudorapidity due to a lack of perfect correlation between $v_3$ at different rapidities.   We also observe short-range correlations, due to rapidity dependent fluctuations in the initial condition.  While the short-range correlation is slightly smaller in both magnitude and range, it serves as a demonstration that short-range correlations are not necessarily generated only by non-flow sources such as jets, but can have a significant contribution from purely hydrodynamic effects.",

However, other scenarios are also possible and may provide alternative explanations for the experimental results. New measurements of elliptic ($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) flow for positive and negative charged particles as a function of $A_{ch}$ in pPb and PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are presented, using data collected by the CMS experiment during the LHC runs 1 and 2. The slopes and intercepts of the charged-dependent $v_{n}$ harmonics vs. $A_{ch}$ are directly compared for pPb and PbPb collisions with similar charged-particle multiplicities, where a strong CMW effect is not expected in very high multiplicity pPb events. Moreover, a comparison is made of the slope parameters between $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ harmonics normalized by the inclusive charge particle $v_{n}$ in PbPb collisions as a function of centrality. These results provide a means to discriminate between the CMW and other scenarios such as local charge conservation as possible explanations for the observed charge dependent behavior.",

      "Abstract": "Recently, theoretical and experimental studies of flow and multiplicity correlations in the longitudinal direction in heavy ion collision have revealed a rich dynamics not probed by traditional measurements that focused only on the transverse direction. Event-by-event longitudinal fluctuations in the initial conditions are expected to result in a strong asymmetry in particle multiplicities at forward and backward (FB) rapidities. In this talk, FB multiplicity correlations are measured in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb  collisions, with a data-driven method utilized to separate long-range FB correlations (LRC) and short-range correlations (SRC). The magnitude of the LRC reveals a significant FB multiplicity asymmetry, quantified by its slope in pseudorapidity $a_1$, which decreases with increasing multiplicity and is similar in magnitude across the three collision systems. The measured correlation in $pp$ collisions is compared in detail with expectations from the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS-LHC models.  Both models significantly underpredict the measured $a_1$ values (by a factor of two), and PYTHIA 8 is found to significantly overpredict the magnitude of the SRC, even though both of these models were tuned to reproduce the total charged particle multiplicity distributions out to $N_{ch}$~120.  These findings imply that the measurement of FB multiplicity correlations provides supplementary constraints on multi-particle production mechanisms, including restricting the number of independent sources in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Azimuthally differential femtoscopic measurements, being sensitive to spatio-temporal characteristics of the source as well as to the collective velocity fields at freeze-out, provide very important information on the nature and dynamics of the system evolution. While the HBT radii modulations with respect to the second harmonic event plane reflect mostly the spatial geometry of the source, the third harmonic results are mostly defined by the system dynamics. Radii variations with respect to the third harmonic event plane unambiguously signal a collective expansion and anisotropy in the flow fields. Strong fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system lead to fluctuations in the anisotropic flow as well as the shape of the pion source at freeze-out. Event shape engineering (ESE) is a technique proposed to select events corresponding to a particular shape. Azimuthally differential HBT combined with ESE allows for a detailed analysis of the relation between initial geometry, anisotropic flow and the deformation of source shape.\n\nIn this talk, we present azimuthally differential pion femtoscopy with respect to second and third harmonic event planes as a function of the pion transverse momentum for different collision centralities. Our results on the dependence of the side-, out-, and long-radii on the pion emission angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane qualitatively agree with theoretical calculations, but the details show significant deviations. The final-state source eccentricity, estimated via side radius oscillations is found to be significantly smaller than the initial state source eccentricity. While the final-state source eccentricity for the second harmonic event plane remains positive in all centralities, the third harmonic event plane eccentricity becomes negative. All these results are compared to existing models. The effect of the selection of the events with high/low elliptic and/or triangular flow is also presented.",

As a result of strong collective flow, the spatial distribution of local vorticity on the freeze-out hypersurface converts to Lambda spins with intrinsic azimuthal angle distribution and correlation at RHIC and LHC energy. The azimuthal correlation of the transverse spin is shown to have a cosine form plus an offset due to a circular structure of the transverse vorticity around the beam direction and global angular momentum in non-central collisions. The longitudinal spin correlation shows a structure of vortex-pairing in the transverse plane due to the convective flow of hot spots in the radial direction. The dependence on colliding energy, rapidity, centrality and sensitivity to the shear viscosity are also investigated.",

      "Abstract": "The QCD phase diagram has been explored in the high temperature side at RHIC and LHC, while the high density side is barely explored. Systematic studies of the QCD matter from Bevalac to LHC energies have suggested that the highest density QCD matter can be reached around the AGS energies (sqrt(s_{NN})=~5-GeV) where a rich production of strange hadrons is expected.\r\n \r\nThe future heavy-ion program at J-PARC (J-PARC-HI) is focused to explore such a highest density QCD matter. The J-PARC-HI will accelerate ions up to Uranium with the cms energy of sqrt(s_{NN})=2-6.2-GeV at the beam rate up to 1.0e+11 ions per cycle, five orders of magnitude higher than that of AGS. We could reach as 8-10 times higher density as the normal nuclear matter with the Uranium ions. The heavy-ion acceleration scheme consists of a new linac and a booster as the injector, followed by the existing 3-GeV Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 50-GeV Main Ring (MR). The booster design is much advanced since last year by a new charge exchange injection scheme and multi-charge state acceptance.\r\n \r\nTaking advantage of the very high intensity beam, we introduce new event selection quantities, such as strangity (strange hadron fraction) and baryonity (net baryons), on top of the conventional centrality variable, which would exclusively select high-density matter events. We will then primarily measure the probes that were not measured at AGS, namely, electromagnetic probes (photons and lepton pairs), higher-order flow of particles and the fluctuation of conserved charges such as net-baryons.

The rates of dilepton production depend in general on four independent spectral functions, corresponding to two transverse polarizations, one longitudinal polarization, and -- in plasmas in which the anisotropy is not invariant under parity in the local rest frame of the matter -- a new spectral function, $\\rho_n$, related to the anisotropy direction in the collision.  The anisotropy appears in the difference of the two transverse spectral functions, as well as in $\\rho_n$.

      "Institute": "KEK",
      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "We discuss photon emission at the stage of hadronization as a possible resolution to the direct-photon puzzle. In an ordinary plasma, it is well known that photon emission occurs when a plasma goes back to a normal state through recombination processes such as $e^- + p^+ \\to H + \\gamma$ for an electron-proton plasma. This is called the âradiative recombinationâ. A similar process should take place when a QGP hadronizes. For example, meson formation from a quark and an antiquark will be accompanied by photon emission $q + \\bar q \\to meson + \\gamma$ to compensate the energy difference between the initial and final states. \r\n\r\nIn order to compute the number of photons emitted at hadronization, we employ the ârecombination modelâ developed by the Duke group. There, the number of produced hadrons is computed under the assumption that coalescence of valence (anti)quarks just occurs without emission of additional particles, which surely violates energy and entropy conservation. With the photon emission added in this coalescence process, however, energy and entropy can be made conserved. We reinterpret the production formula of hadrons in the original recombination model as that of artificial âresonant statesâ whose invariant masses are not necessarily equal to the masses of any physical hadrons. We further assume that the âresonant stateâ decays into a physical hadron and a photon. \r\n\r\nThis âimprovedâ recombination model has a potential to resolve the direct-photon puzzle: (1) a larger yield of photons since we add photon production at hadronization, which has been overlooked so far, and (2) radiated photons flow similarly as hadrons because photons are emitted in a collimated way with the resonant state's motion. Moreover, the pt distribution of emitted photons mimics thermal distribution whose effective temperature is essentially given by blue-shifted quarkâs temperature and thus becomes much higher than critical temperature.",

The status of the project will be summarized.\n\nOperating FCC-hh with heavy-ion beams would provide Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ of 39 and 63 TeV, respectively. Current estimates indicate that a luminosity of about 30/nb could be integrated during a one-month Pb-Pb run, that is more than one order of magnitude above the maximum projections for the LHC. The FCC-hh beams could also be used for fixed-target collisions, either with beam extraction or gaseous target techniques.\n\nThe Quark-Gluon Plasma state produced in Pb-Pb collisions at 39 TeV is expected to have initial temperature and energy density substantially larger than at LHC energy, a stronger flow field and freeze-out volume twice as large. The larger temperature could entail novel features, like e.g. abundant in-medium production of charm quarks. The latter could determine an increase in the number of degrees of freedom of the QGP and provide a new tool to study its temperature evolution. New, rarer, hard probes would be available, like boosted top quarks, which could give access to the time-evolution of the medium opacity. \n\nThe physics of high gluon densities at small Bjorken-$x$ and the onset of saturation can be studied using pA, AA, and $\\gamma$A collisions. The FCC-hh will provide access to the region down to $x<10^{-6}$ with perturbative probes like heavy quarks and quarkonia and to the region of high $Q^2$ down to $x\\sim 10^{-4}$ with W, Z and top. High-energy photon-photon interactions in ultraperipheral AA collisions will also enable the study of very rare processes such as light-by-light scattering and $\\gamma\\gamma\\to W^+W^-$.\n\nDetector design studies, focused on multipurpose pp experiments, and a survey of the possible technological solutions are ongoing and will be summarised as well in the presentation.\n\n[1] A.

Most of these particles will be studied for the first time in the FAIR energy range. In order to achieve the required precision, the measurements will be performed at very high reaction rates of 1 to 10 MHz.

Forward particle production in hadron collisions at RHIC probes gluons at small x where gluon density is high and expected to reach the saturation regime. Until today the golden channel at RHIC to observe strong hints of saturation has been the azimuthal angular correlation between two back-to-back particles produced in p(d)+nucleus collisions. These correlations test the underlying QCD dynamics of the quark-gluon scattering that dominates at forward rapidity. During the 2015 RHIC run, STAR has collected data for di-hadron correlations of neutral pion production at forward pseudo-rapidity (eta=2.6 to 4.0) using its electromagnetic calorimeter in p+p, p+Au and p+Al collisions at âsNN=200GeV.

Measuring the cross section differentially in transverse momentum transfer makes it possible to determine the transverse density profile (via coherent diffraction) and density fluctuations (incoherent diffraction) of the target hadron. This knowledge about the geometric fluctuations of the proton is particularly important for understanding collective phenomena observed in proton-nucleus collisions.\r\n\r\nWe calculate coherent and incoherent diffractive vector meson production in photon-proton scattering at high energy.  We demonstrate that incoherent gamma-p scattering is sensitive to sub-nucleon scale fluctuations, and show that the effect of geometric fluctuations can be disentangled from saturation scale fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe Bjorken-x (or energy) evolution of the fluctuations is studied by solving the JIMWLK evolution equation. In particular, we study the energy evolution of the diffractive cross section. This is particularly interesting, as the ALICE collaboration has recently observed the disappearance of the incoherent contribution to the diffractive cross section in ultraperipheral p+A collisions at high energies, which suggests that the proton gets smoother at small x.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuating proton, constrained by the HERA data, is then used as input for hydrodynamic calculations of azimuthal anisotropy coefficients in proton-nucleus collisions, which we show to be sensitive to initial state geometric fluctuations.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nH.

      "Abstract": "The study of particle production in proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions provides essential\r\ninformation about high-density effects (like gluon saturation) in the nuclear wavefunction and offers a benchmark for the corresponding studies in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The cross-sections for particle production in $pA$ can in principle be computed within perturbative QCD, using the framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). However, recent efforts trying to extend such calculations beyond the leading-order (LO)\r\napproximation met with an unexpected difficulty: the next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction for the hadron multiplicity suddenly turns negative at transverse momenta of the order of a few GeV, in a range where perturbation theory was expected to be reliable.\r\nThis problem triggered much interest and several studies over the last 5 years, but not satisfactory solution has emerged. \r\n\r\nIn a recent publication [1], we have revisited the previous proposals for the CGC \r\nfactorization at NLO and identified the source of the negativity problem: this is related\r\nto the subtraction method used to separate LO from NLO contributions. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new factorization scheme which involves no such a subtraction: the relevant, LO or NLO, perturbative contributions are included once and only once. We have thus obtained a manifestly positive expression for the cross-section for hadron multiplicities in $pA$. On this occasion, we have also extended the resummation program that we recently proposed [2] for the BK and JIMWLK evolution equations to the calculation of cross-sections. Besides its phenomenological implications, this new factorization scheme should provide a better framework for computing particle production in QCD at high energy.\r\n\r\n[1] \t``CGC factorization for forward particle production in proton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order,'' E.

We show that\r\nunder suitable approximations, the jet evolution is a Markovian stochastic process, \r\nwhich is exactly solvable. For this process, we construct exact analytic solutions \r\nfor all the n-point correlation functions describing the gluon distribution \r\nin the space of energy [1,2]. Using these results, we study the event-by-event distribution of the energy lost by the jet at large angles and of the multiplicities\r\nof the soft particles which carry this energy. We find that the event-by-event fluctuations are huge: the standard deviation in the energy loss is parametrically as large as its mean value [1]. This has important consequences for the phenomenology\r\nof di-jet asymmetry in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC: it implies that the fluctuations in the branching process can contribute to the measured asymmetry on an equal footing with the geometry of the di-jet event (i.e. as the difference between the in-medium path lengths of the two jets). We compute the higher moments of the multiplicity distribution and identify a remarkable regularity known as Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling [2]. \r\n\r\nThese predictions could be tested via event-by-event measurements of the di-jet asymmetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n[1] Event-by-event fluctuations in the medium-induced jet evolution \r\nM.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Within the context of a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching, we study the \r\nmodification of the angular distribution of the energy within jets in \r\nheavy ion collisions, as partons within jet showers lose energy\r\nand get kicked as they traverse the strongly coupled plasma\r\nproduced in the collision.  To describe \r\nthe dynamics transverse to the jet axis,  we add \r\nthe effects of transverse momentum broadening \r\ninto our hybrid construction, introducing a parameter $K\\equiv \\hat q/T^3$\r\nthat governs its magnitude. We show that, because of the quenching\r\nof the energy of partons within a jet, even when $K\\neq 0$ the jets\r\nthat survive with some specified energy in the final state are narrower\r\nthan jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this reason,\r\nmany standard observables are rather\r\ninsensitive to $K$.\r\nWe\r\npropose a new differential jet shape ratio observable in which\r\nthe effects of transverse momentum broadening are apparent.\r\nWe also analyze the response of the medium to the passage\r\nof the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\r\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After \r\nfreezeout this wake becomes soft particles with a broad angular\r\ndistribution but with net momentum in the jet direction, meaning that\r\nthe wake contributes to what is reconstructed as a jet.  This effect must\r\ntherefore be included in any description of the angular structure\r\nof the soft component of a jet.\r\nWe show that the particles coming from the response of the medium to the momentum\r\nand energy deposited in it leads to a correlation between the momentum of soft particles\r\nwell separated from the jet in angle with the direction of the jet momentum, and find\r\nqualitative but not quantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed\r\nto extract such a correlation.\r\nMore generally, by confronting the results that we obtain upon introducing transverse momentum\r\nbroadening and the response of the medium to the jet \r\nwith available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes for\r\nunderstanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets.",

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "We study modification of full jet structures in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium including effect of the hydrodynamic medium response. The structures and energies of jets in heavy ion collisions are significantly modified by the processes involving strong interactions during the propagation through the QGP medium, i.e., collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening, and induced parton radiation. The energy and momentum are deposited into the QGP medium by jets via the collisional energy loss and the $p_T$-broadening due to the energy-momentum conservation. The QGP medium is supposed to respond hydrodynamically to the deposited energy and momentum and flows propagating with the jets are caused. Particles originating from the jet-induced flows are observed as a part of the jets in the actual experiments, and contribute to the modification of the full jet structures. Studying this contribution is not only important for the precise interpretation of the experimental data but also provides a novel opportunity to investigate the collective response of the QGP. \r\n\r\nWe employ a full jet shower + QGP fluid model composed of transport equations for jet evolution and hydrodynamic equations with source terms for the QGP medium evolution. The transport equations describe the evolution of the three-dimensional momentum distributions of partons in the full jet [1]. In the transport equations, all the processes of the collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening and partonic splittings for all partons within the full showering jet are covered. The space-time evolution of the QGP medium is described by (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms [2]. The source terms transfer the deposited energy and momentum to the QGP fluid and are constructed with the evolving distributions of the partons in jets obtained as solutions of the transport equations. In this work, we study the shape and energy loss of the full jet in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC including the effect of the jet-induced flows. We find that the contribution of the particles originating from the jet-induced flows significantly modifies the full jet shape, and especially dominates it at large angles from the jet direction. We also find that this contribution increase the jet-cone size dependence of the full jet energy loss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] N.-B. Chang and G.-Y.

      "Abstract": "The heavy-ion physics program at the LHC aims at characterizing the high energy density, high temperature, deconfined partonic state of matter called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). High-momentum partons, that then hadronize in jets, are useful tools to study the QGP properties since they are produced via hard scattering processes and they probe the full evolution of the system, losing energy while passing through it.\n\nIn particular the characterization of the jet substructure can bring insight on the microscopic nature of modifications induced on these partons by the medium. These modifications can be studied using a set of jet shape observables like the first order radial moment, the jet momentum dispersion, the difference between the leading and sub-leading jet tracks. Moreover measurements of the jet mass will allow for direct experimental access to the virtuality evolution of partons interacting with the medium.\n\nMeasurements of these observables in pp or p-Pb collisions will be presented and compared with theoretical calculations, as well as with Monte Carlo generators, providing important tests of QCD in elementary collisions.\n\nWe will present final ALICE results on jet shapes in Pb-Pb collisions at \n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76~\\rm{TeV}$, in order to investigate possible modifications of the distribution of particles within the jets.

In our analysis, we combine event-by-event hydrodynamics, within the EKRT formulation, with jet quenching (ASW Quenching Weights) to obtain high-$p_T$ $R_{AA}$, $v_2$ and $v_3$ for charged particles at RHIC and LHC energies for different centralities.\r\n\r\nBy defining a $K$-factor that quantifies the departure of the transport coefficient, $\\hat{q}$, from an ideal estimate, $K = \\hat{q}/(2 \\epsilon^{3/4})$, we fit the single-inclusive experimental data for charged particles. Then, using the fitted $K$-value for each energy and centrality we also compute high-$p_T$ $v_2 $ and $v_3$, getting a good agreement with data. As obtained already in previous analyses, this $K$-factor is larger at RHIC than at the LHC but, surprisingly, it is almost independent of the centrality of the collision.

      "Abstract": "Jets and their modifications due to partonic energy loss provide a powerful tool to study the properties of the QGP created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. For correlation studies of jet energy loss, two complementary trigger object choices offer access to the initial hard partonâs energy: On the one hand, direct-photonâtagged jets are a self-generated tomographic medium probe, unaffected by the medium and hence with an unbiased in-medium path length. They are also expected to exhibit a different flavor-dependence of energy loss, since high-$p_T$ direct photons are primarily produced with a quark recoil. On the other hand, reconstructed jets offer the promise of path length control or Jet Geometry Engineering through cut parameters. Previously, $A_J$ measurements at STAR observed significant imbalance for anti-$k_T$ di-jets with a resolution parameter R = 0.4 and a âhard-coreâ selection using only constituents with $p_T$ above 2.0 GeV/c and a neutral high tower with $E_T$ > 5.5 GeV. When soft constituents are included, this imbalance is found restored to the balance of the p+p reference inside the original jet cone, indicative of milder modification due to more surface-biased production.\n\nWe present a study of correlated hadrons and semi-inclusive recoil jets coincident with direct photons and neutral pions with 9 < $E_T^{trig}$ < 20 GeV, as well\nas with respect to to the dijet selection from the above $A_J$ measurement. A\ncomparison between the two measurements, and a comparison to similar measurements at RHIC and the LHC establishes new systematic input into the flavor- and path-length dependence of light flavor energy loss in the QGP.",

      "Abstract": "Within the overwhelming majority of models, light quark and gluon jet quenching in heavy ion collisions is described as resulting predominantly from pQCD-type gluon radiation, but details of the underlying mechanisms differ greatly. One key difference lies in the treatment of the Altarelli-Parisi, AP, splitting functions. While in some models, such as Q-PYTHIA,  the splitting functions are directly modified in the medium, this core component remains unchanged in others (e.g. YaJEM). The *shared momentum fraction* $z_g$ was shown to be a Sudakov-safe measurement of the splitting function [1].\r\nThis quantity measures the $p_T$ ratio between the two dominant branches \r\nas determined by the SoftDrop grooming process.\r\n\r\nAn inclusive measurement of $z_g$ in p+p collisions at top RHIC energy will be presented.\r\nThe focus of our Au+Au results will be on a comparative study to p+p \r\nusing the specific di-jet selection introduced in our previous momentum imbalance measurement, \r\ni.e. jets geometrically matched to \"hard core\" jets found using only constituents above 2 GeV/$c$ and with a high tower above 5.5 GeV. Such di-jet pairs were found to be significantly imbalanced with respect to p+p, yet regained balance when all soft constituents were included. Individual examination of the splitting behavior of leading and recoil jet adds a new dimension to this observation, and new input to energy loss models.\r\n\r\n[1] A. J. Larkoski, S. Marzani and J.

      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy ion collisions, a hot medium with a high density of unscreened color charges is produced. Jets are produced at the early stages of this collision and are known to become attenuated as they propagate through the hot matter. One manifestation of this energy loss  is a lower yield of jets emerging from the medium than expected in the absence of medium effects. ATLAS has provided a quantification of jet suppression by measurements of jet R_AA in the LHC Run 1.  A factor of two suppression was observed in central heavy ion collisions with respect to pp collisions. R_AA was also found to exhibit only a weak rapidity dependence, and a slow (but significant) rise with increasing jet momentum. The high-statistics run 2 data of Pb+Pb and pp collisions provide the opportunity to extend the jet R_AA measurement, to evaluate the center-of-mass-energy dependence of this quantity and to explore new techniques for the study of jet substructure using subjets. This talk will presents the Run 1 results on inclusive jet production and new Run 2 results on inclusive jet suppression.

      "Abstract": "Recently our group analyzed how the probability distribution for the jet\nopening angle is modified in an ensemble of jets that has propagated\nthrough an expanding cooling droplet of plasma [1]. Each jet in the\nensemble is represented holographically by a string in the dual 4+1-\ndimensional gravitational theory with the distribution of initial energies and\nopening angles in the ensemble given by perturbative QCD. In [1], the full\nstring dynamics were approximated by assuming that the string moves at\nthe speed of light. We are now able to analyze the full string dynamics for\na range of possible initial conditions, giving us access to the dynamics of\nholographic jets just after their creation. We show that, after a period of\ntime that we compute, the string nullifies: the force of gravity accelerates\neach section of string until it approaches the speed of light. The\nnullification timescale and the features of the string when it has nullified\nare all results of the string evolution. This emboldens us to analyze the full jet shape, rather than just the opening angle of each jet in the ensemble as in [1]. We find the\nstriking result that the jet shape scales with the opening angle at any\nparticular energy. We construct an ensemble of dijets with energies and\nenergy asymmetry distributions taken from events in proton-proton\ncollisions, opening angle distribution as in [1], and jet shape taken from\nproton-proton collisions and scaled according to our result. We study how\nall of these observables are modified after we send the ensemble of dijets\nthrough the strongly-coupled plasma.\n\n[1] Krishna Rajagopal, Andrey V.

      "Abstract": "Direct photons, being colorless objects, provide an unmodified control particle that can be used in conjunction with jets to probe the quark-gluon plasma. To leading order the direct photon momentum balances the momentum of opposing jets and can therefore provide a clean handle on the jet energy. Therefore, angular correlations with direct photons provide a mechanism to study the fragmentation of the opposing jet without performing jet reconstruction.  Jet fragmentation modification has been measured previously in PHENIX in central Au+Au collisions.  Recent RHIC runs offer the potential to study these observables in heavy ion collisions with greater statistics and over different collision systems including asymmetric collision geometries.   In this talk we present results of isolated direct photon-triggered correlations in $d$+Au collisions and discuss the constraints of cold nuclear matter effects on the fragmentation functions.  We also present the latest results with higher statistics on direct photon-triggered correlations in Au+Au collisions including differential measurements of fragmentation function modification.   Finally, we present the status of the centrality and collision species dependence of these observables, including comparisons to related di-hadron correlations. Together these results can give a view of jet modification going from small to large system size.",

      "Abstract": "Single particle production has proven to be a valuable tool to study heavy ion collisions. The observation of collective behavior in $p$+Pb at the LHC and $d$+Au RHIC has spurred speculation that a plasma is formed in small collision systems. Jet production in the same collisions at the LHC and RHIC has an anomalous centrality dependence if centrality is determined the same way as in large ion-ion collisions. One interpretation could be that the nucleus probes the dynamical structure (\"color fluctuations\") of the projectile. Hints of gluon saturation effects have been observed at forward rapidities in $d$+Au collisions at RHIC. To systematically explore the physics using very asymmetric systems, RHIC has provided beams of $p$+Au, $p$+Al, $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au. Single particle production in these collisions should be sensitive to the physics of energy loss, modifications of the nuclear wavefunction, and the dynamics of the projectile wavefunction. PHENIX Central arms can measure pi0 at mid-rapidity. New MPC-EX detector allows $\\pi^0$ measurement for $3.1 < \\eta < 3.8$.

      "Abstract": "The measurement of jet substructure provides important detailed information on the dynamics of the jet-QGP interaction. However, our ability to reliably extract such information is contingent on understanding the sensitivity of any given substructure observable to specific features of in-medium jet dynamics. Monte Carlo event generators with transparent physics content and that have been validated for a wide set of observables, e.g. JEWEL, are powerful tools to establish the sensitivity of observables to specifics of jet-QGP interaction. Using the generic procedure we put forward in Eur.Phys.J. C76 (2016) no.5, 288 (arXiv:1512.08107 [hep-ph]) â where we applied it to establish the origin of the excess dijet asymmetry observed in AA collisions as due to fluctuations of the jet fragmentation pattern rather than, as widely believed in the community, to the difference in the amount of matter traversed by the two jets in the pair â we examine the z_g substructure observable recently measured by CMS and STAR. We find straightforward interpretations of the z_g measurement as indicating a QGP-induced modification of the QCD splitting function to be over-simplistic and confounded by the observable sensitivity to fluctuations of the jet-medium interaction pattern. We propose several complementary measurements that can further elucidate the potential of this, and related observables, to give information on in-medium jet dynamics.",

      "Abstract": "Hadrons carrying heavy flavour (charm or beauty quarks) constitute an exceptional probe to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are produced in initial hard parton-scattering processes of the nucleon-nucleon collisions and on short time scales compared to the QGP formation time. Therefore they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents. \n\nThe measurement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) of charmed hadrons \nallows us to gain insight into the colour-charge and parton-mass  dependence of energy loss as well as into possible modifications of hadronization in presence of the medium. \nResults from Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV indicate that momentum distributions of charmed mesons are modified in Pb--Pb with respect to pp collisions,\nowing to quenching of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium. The D-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ exhibits a suppression of a factor 5-6 for $p_{\\rm T}$ $\\approx$ 10 GeV/$c$ in central collisions, with a hint of reduced suppression for D$_{\\rm s}$ mesons as compared to non-strange D mesons.\nResults from Run 2 will allow us to reduce uncertainties and draw firmer conclusions about possible charm recombination at low and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ and about colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of energy loss.\n\nThe measurement of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) provides further insight into the deconfined phase. At low $p_{\\rm T}$, D-meson $v_2$ offers the unique opportunity to test whether also charm quarks participate in the collective expansion dynamics and possibly thermalize in the medium. At low and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$, the elliptic flow is also expected to be sensitive to the hadronization mechanism, while at high $p_{\\rm T}$, it can constrain the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. During the LHC Run 1, ALICE measured a positive $v_{2}$ for D$^{\\rm 0}$, D$^{\\rm +}$, D$^{\\rm *}$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV. The increased statistics of semi-central Pb--Pb events at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV, obtained with the LHC Run 2, provides access to more precise results for non-strange D-meson $v_{2}$ as well as to the first measurement of the D$_{\\rm s}$-meson elliptic flow at LHC energies.  \n\nIn this talk, the elliptic flow of D mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented, together with the status of the D-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ at the same energy.",

Significant suppression of open heavy flavor production at large tranverse momentum has been observed in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC. Such a suppression can be attributed to the energy losses of heavy flavor quarks due to their interactions with the QGP, which are expected to be different for bottom and charm quarks because of their different masses. In order to fully understand the parton-QGP interactions and thus the QGP properties, it is essential to measure open bottom and charm hadron suppressions separately in Au+Au collisions. Moreover, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects due to the different initial states in p+p and Au+Au collisions also need to be taken into account when interpreting these results.\n\nIn this talk, we will report measurements of open bottom and charm hadron production through multiple decay channels in p+p, p+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. We will show the first results on open bottom hadron production in Au+Au collisions, where electrons, $D^0$ and J/Ï from open bottom hadron decays are topologically identified utilizing the STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker. These results will be compared to those of open charm hadron production to study the mass dependence of parton interactions with the QGP at RHIC energies.

      "Abstract": "Measurements of quarkonium production have played an important role in understanding the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The suppression of quarkonia in the medium due to color screening has been proposed as a direct signature of the QGP formation. However, other effects, such as regeneration of quarkonia by the coalescence of uncorrelated quark-antiquark pairs, co-mover absorption, and cold nuclear matter effects, add additional complications to the interpretation of the observed quarkonium suppression. Compared to charmonia, bottomonia suffer much less from regeneration contribution and co-mover absorption. Furthermore, different bottomonium states may dissociate at different temperatures, known as \"sequential melting\", which can be used to constrain the temperature of the medium.\n\nQuarkonium measurements have been traditionally performed in the dielectron channel at STAR. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), which provides muon identification and triggering capabilities at mid-rapidity, was fully installed into the STAR experiment. It allows measurements of quarkonia via the di-muon channel with much smaller Bremsstrahlung radiation and thus much better invariant mass resolution than the dielectron channel. In this talk, we will present the measurements of Î¥ suppression in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via both the di-muon and dielectron channels. The centrality and transverse momentum dependences will be reported and compared to those at the LHC and theoretical calculations. We will also show the Î¥ measurements in p+p and p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via the dielectron channel using the data taken in year 2015.

      "Abstract": "Heavy-flavor observables are excellent probes of the properties of the in-medium interactions, the medium properties and the degrees of freedom of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. Progressing toward a quantitative description, we describe, in EPOSHQ, the dynamics of heavy quark coupled systematically to the EPOS3 model: heavy-quarks are produced from the EPOS3 flux tube initial conditions both in momentum and in coordinate space and subsequently propagated in parallel to the fluid dynamical evolution of the viscous QGP. Hadronization of the heavy quarks via coalescence and fragmentation and particlization of the fluid enable us to investigate the importance of the final hadronic rescatterings on the heavy-flavor observables.\nThis global description allows us to draw conclusions from the comparison to a variety of heavy-quark observables in different systems and constrain important aspects in our underlying model for the in-medium interaction, such as the contributions stemming from elastic and inelastic energy loss, or the mass dependence by comparing charm and bottom quark dynamics. We present strategies to quantify the off-equilibrium dynamics of heavy flavor at lower momentum compared to the bulk flow by focussing on the higher-order flow harmonics of B and D mesons and the light, charged hadrons and it's centrality dependence. At higher momentum path length differences become the driving force of flow observables. Our sophisticated energy loss models and QGP-heavy quark coupling allow us in particular to obtain robust estimates of different contributions to the heavy flavor flow in the intermediate momentum range.",

      "Abstract": "Many precision measurements of quarkonium suppression at the LHC, e.g. the nuclear modification factor R_AA of J/Psi, are well described by a multitude of different models [1]. Thus pinpointing the underlying physics is difficult and first principles guidance is needed. In-medium spectral properties, e.g. mass shifts or the broadening of states can help us to understand quarkonium production in a kinetically equilibrated setting. While potential based approaches with lattice input [2] have been used to estimate such modifications, a direct and quantitative determination from first principles lattice QCD is still outstanding.\n\nAdvancing towards this goal we present here a high statistics study of bottomonium and charmonium S-wave and P-wave spectral properties at finite temperature using the effective field theory NRQCD on the lattice. This EFT allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modelling assumptions in a realistic thermal QCD medium, described by state-of-the-art lattices of the HotQCD collaboration at almost physical pion mass [3]. The availability of two Bayesian methods for spectral functions (MEM and BR [4]) makes it possible to thoroughly test the systematic uncertainties of their reconstruction.\n\nOur new lattice QCD correlation functions and reconstructed spectra corroborate a picture of sequential modification of states with respect to their vacuum binding energy. We find that remnant features of the bottomonium S-wave may survive up to T~400MeV, while the P-wave ground state disappears around T~300MeV. The charmonium analysis hints at melting of the P-wave below T~190MeV while some S-wave remnant feature might survive up to T~245MeV.\n\nWith the inclusion of charmonium spectra, an extended temperature range and increased statistics by more than an order of magnitude our study provides a coherent picture of in-medium quarkonium modification extending significantly beyond our previous results of Ref.

      "Abstract": "We study fluctuations of the sigma field and the net-baryon number on the crossover side of the critical point within the model of nonequilibrium chiral fluid dynamics (N$\\chi$FD). Herein, the sigma field as the chiral order parameter is propagated explicitly and coupled to a fluid of quarks. Before investigating these fluctuations in an expanding nonequilibrium medium, we scrutinize the N$\\chi$FD model by comparing cumulants of the sigma and net-baryon number fluctuations in a thermalized box to (ratios of) susceptibilities as they are obtained from derivatives of the grand canonical potential. The dynamically determined cumulants follow the trend of the thermodynamic susceptibilities. After implementing a particlization procedure into this model, we study the behavior of the net-proton kurtosis in the critical region and find that it shows the typical shape around the pseudocritical temperature. This demonstrates how critical fluctuations are able to develop in a realistic heavy-ion collision scenario and, moreover, have observable consequences. Finally, we present results for different rapidity windows and transverse momentum cuts.",

      "Abstract": "The formation of a QGP in heavy ion collisions and the hydrodynamic expansion of the created medium are well established and reasonably well understood. This state of nuclear matter was not expected to be found in reactions involving smaller systems, such as the pA and pp collisions. Nevertheless, a wealth of experimental evidence in recent years has suggested the presence of collective phenomena and a possible QGP medium being formed also in high-multiplicity pPb collisions. A detailed investigation is needed to establish the cause of the observed collective behavior and to determine if, indeed, a QGP medium is being created or if another mechanism is responsible. Final results of differential $v_{n}$ harmonics in pPb collisions as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity obtained using scalar product, multi-particle cumulant and Lee-Yang Zeros methods are presented in various multiplicity classes. The effect of event plane decorrelations on the observed $\\eta$ dependence of $v_{n}$ is studied in detail. Furthermore, new measurements of correlation between $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ ($v_{4}$) harmonics are performed using the technique of symmetric cumulants to gain more insight to the initial state and possible medium response of the pPb system. The results shown in this talk relate to our understanding of the origin of azimuthal correlations in high-multiplicity pPb events and shed light on a potential QGP formation in small system collisions.",

The well-known DGLV, ASW, BDMPS-Z, AMY and HT calculations all exploit both the large separation distance (between scattering centre and radiation) and the large system approximations.  We relax the large system assumption and recompute the energy loss in the DGLV formalism in order to address the glaring lack of theoretical control over small-system energy loss.  Alarmingly, we find that the correction terms dominate at large energies, resulting in ~100% *negative* correction, calling into question the validity of the large formation time assumption used in *all* pQCD-based energy loss calculations.  Our results demand a complete overhaul of pQCD-based energy-loss calculations for all system sizes.",

The latter are employed by pQCD-inspired models which provide a consistent way to describe high-multiplicity pp collisions, where the probability of several parton scatterings per nucleon-nucleon collision is high. In this talk we present the latest ALICE measurements using the data from Run I and Run II at the LHC. The MPI results in pp collisons at an energy of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV will be presented as a function of multiplicity and compared to those in pp collisions at lower energies and in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV.

Since quarkonium suppression can occur through complicated processes not only related to the medium effect but also any other ones such as cold nuclear matter effects, good theoretical understanding of quarkonium behavior in the hot medium is required. Low frequency behavior of the quarkonium spectral functions for the vector channel also tells us transport properties of heavy quarks in quark-gluon plasma, which is important input for hydrodynamic models trying to explain collective phenomena in heavy-ion experiments. Therefore it is important to investigate the quarkonium spectral functions, especially using first-principle lattice QCD calculations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we report our recent study on quarkonium spectral functions in lattice QCD at finite temperature. To get correlation functions with high data quality, which is important to extract reliable spectral functions, we performed simulations on very large and fine lattices with a couple of lattice cutoffs towards the continuum limit. Our previous studies on some of these lattices have been reported in [1,2]. At temperatures in a range between 0.75$T_c$ and 2.3$T_c$ we reconstruct quarkonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators with both charm and bottom quark masses, where to estimate systematic uncertainties we adopt the conventional maximum entropy method as well as two different stochastic methods: one is the stochastic analytical inference based on the Bayes' theorem and the other is the stochastic optimization method, which does not rely on any prior information (see our preliminary works in [3,4]). We discuss dissociation of quarkonium states from temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions. We also estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient using low-frequency behavior of the spectral functions for the vector channel.\r\n\r\n[1] H.

      "Abstract": "Dileptons ($l^{+}l^{-}$) are produced throughout all stages of heavy-ion collisions and escape with minimum interaction with the strongly interacting medium. For this reason, $l^{+}l^{-}$ pair measurements play an essential role in the study of the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Dileptons in the low invariant mass region (up to M$_{ll}\\sim$1~GeV/c$^2$) retain information about the in-medium modification of vector mesons while dileptons in the intermediate mass region (extending out to M$_{ll}\\sim$3 GeV/c$^2$) predominantly originate from charm decays and thermal radiation of the medium. At higher invariant masses, recent studies of $J/\\psi$ yields in peripheral A$+$A collisions by the ALICE~\\cite{alice} and STAR collaborations showed significant excess at very low momentum transfers (p$_T$ $<$ 0.3~GeV/c). These observations may point to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\\psi$ in hadronic interactions which conflicts with traditional knowledge of the coherent photoproduction mechanism. It is interesting to investigate the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in a wider invariant mass region (M$_{ee}<$4 GeV/c$^2$) at very low p$_T$ in heavy-ion collisions for different centrality bins in order to study the production mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover $e^{+}e^{-}$ spectra with various invariant mass and p$_{T}$ differentials in Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and U$+$U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. The structure of the t (t = p$_{T}^{2}$ ) distributions of these mass regions will be shown and compared with the same distributions in ultra-peripheral collisions. Additionally, this talk will cover first measurements of $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ invariant mass spectra from STAR's recently installed Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) in p$+$p and Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Physics implications of the $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ results will be discussed in the context of STAR's published $e^{+}e^{-}$ results.",

In all collision systems, the ridge correlations are shown to be present even in events with a low\nmultiplicity of produced particles, implying that the long-range correlations are not unique to rare high-multiplicity events. The\nproperties of the correlation are shown to exhibit only a weak energy dependence and are remarkably similar to that observed in $p$+Pb collisions. Another new aspect of this talk is a detailed study of ridge properties in collisions containing hard processes,\ncharacterized by large four-momentum transfer. This may help answering the question whether the ridge arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale.\n\nIn order to assess the collective nature of multi-particle production, the correlation measurements are extended to include azimuthal\ncorrelations measured using multiparticle cumulants. The presented measurements of multi-particle cumulants $c_2 \\{2â8\\}$ confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions. However, for $pp$ collisions, the measurements of cumulants do not yet provide clear evidence for collectivity as they are susceptible to event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. In order to address this, results from a new modified cumulant method which suppress both the contribution of multiplicity fluctuation and non-flow effects are presented.",

      "Abstract": "The collisions of lead nuclei provided by the LHC in Run 2 provide new opportunities to study matter produced at unprecedented temperatures and densities. In particular, the study of the azimuthal anisotropy of produced charged particles not only constrains the initial state of the nuclear collisions and soft particle collective dynamics, but also sheds light on jet quenching via the measurement of flow harmonics at high transverse momenta. In this talk, new ATLAS measurements of flow harmonics from $v_2$ to $v_7$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, performed in a wide range of transverse momenta 0.5-40 GeV,  pseudorapidity ($|\\eta|$<2.5) and collision centrality are presented. This includes a first measurement of $v_6$ and $v_7$, as well as harmonics in ultra-central collisions. A procedure of removing correlations arising from back-to-back jets,\nrecently used in $pp$ collisions, is implemented in the Two-Particle Correlation method to evaluate $v_n$ without a jet bias. The scaling relations between the $v_n$ harmonics are also discussed.\n\nLongitudinal dynamics has recently become a topic of great interest in the study of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $\\Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions. Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $\\Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order\nflow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented. These result will help to constrain initial conditions along longitudinal direction and also help understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are sensitive probes to study the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies, since they are mainly produced in initial hard scattering processes and experience the entire evolution of the system.\nThe heavy quarks traversing the medium lose energy via collisional and radiative processes in the interaction with the medium constituents. The heavy-flavour energy loss can be investigated with measurements of the modification of the transverse momentum distribution of heavy-flavour particles in heavy-ion collisions with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions (nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm{AA}}$). An observable that complements the investigation of the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium is the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour particles, which is defined as the second harmonic ($v_{2}$) of the Fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution in momentum space. The measurement of the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at low transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) provides insight into the collective motion of heavy quarks in the medium, while the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at high $p_{\\rm T}$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of the energy loss of heavy quarks in the almond-shaped overlap area in non-central collisions.\nThe semi-leptonic decay channel of open heavy-flavour hadrons is well suited for heavy-flavour studies in ALICE, since the branching ratio is relatively large (10$\\%$) and ALICE has an unique capability for identification of electrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.8$) and muons at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4$) over a wide $p_{\\rm T}$ range.\nIn this talk, we will present the ALICE results on the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of open heavy flavour hadrons via their semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via their semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in PbâPb collisions. Progress on the measurements of leptons from heavy-flavour and beauty-hadron decays in PbâPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV will be discussed. The first results on the $R_{\\rm{AA}}$ and $v_{2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in PbâPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and prospects for measurements of electrons from beauty-hadron decays will be presented. The latest results concerning the measurements of the production cross section and nuclear modification factor of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ and collision centrality in PbâPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV will also be shown.

      "Abstract": "Beams of relativistic heavy ions are accompanied by a large flux of equivalent photons, and photon-induced reactions are the dominant interaction mechanism in heavy-ion collisions when the colliding nuclei have transverse separation larger that the nuclear diameter. In these ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) the photon can provide a clean probe of the partonic structure of the nucleus analogous with deep inelastic scattering. This talk presents measurements of dijet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions performed with the ATLAS detector. Events are selected using requirements on rapidity gaps and forward neutron production to identify the photo-nuclear processes. The relatively clean environment of these events allows for measurements in a region of x and Q^2 where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected to be present and not strongly constrained by previous measurements. \n\nThis talk also presents measurements of four-jet cross sections in pp and p+Pb collisions over a large kinematic range. In addition to higher order QCD effects, the four-jet cross section receives contributions from so-called double parton scatterings (DPS) in which two independent hard scattering processes occur in the same collision. Thus measurements of DPS, which have already been performed in 7 TeV pp collisions, can yield new information on the spacial and momentum correlations between partons in a nucleon beyond single parton distributions. In p+Pb collisions, additional mechanisms for DPS are possible when two partons in the proton scatter off partons in different nucleons in the nuclear target, leading to an enhancement in the four jet rate and a different sensitivity to the underlying correlations. Differential cross sections as well as measurements of momentum and angular correlations, which help disentangle the single and double parton scattering contributions, will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "Recent measurements of azimuthal particle correlations in small collision systems show striking simularities to flow signatures observed in gold-gold and lead-lead collisions, leading many to question if the origin of small system correlations is hydrodynamic in nature. The ensuing effort to construct a unified hydrodynamic model for small and large collision systems revealed new tension in the QGP initial conditions: heavy-ion collisions appear to prefer saturation based initial conditions [1209.6330, 1505.02677], while small system collectivity is currently best described using a Monte Carlo Glauber model [1502.04745].\n\nIt has since been suggested that adding subnucleonic structure to the QGP initial conditions could strongly affect flow in small collision systems and may explain apparent model discrepancies [1405.3605v1]. While practical implementations of subnucleonic structure are relatively straightforwardâone simply replaces smooth protons with lumpy protonsâthere exist large theoretical uncertainties regarding the fluctuated shape of the proton, and corresponding theory predictions are highly model dependent.\n\nIn this work, we extend previous efforts to parametrize and constrain the QGP initial conditions using systematic Bayesian analysis and study the effects of subnucleonic structure predicted by a simple constituent parton model. We vary both subnucleonic degrees of freedom, e.g. the constituent parton number and effective parton width, as well as typical transport parameters such as the hydrodynamic starting time and QGP viscosity. The initial conditions are then embedded in an event-by-event hydrodynamic model and calibrated to simultaneously fit charged particle yields, flows and mean $p_T$ for light-heavy and heavy-heavy collisions at RHIC. We finally apply Bayesian parameter estimation methods to extract posterior distributions for the optimal initial condition parameters and comment on the implied viability of related theoretical frameworks.",

These fields are traditionally computed by integrating the Maxwell equations with point sources. One might expect that such an approach is valid at distances much larger than the proton size and thus such a classical approach should work well for almost the entire interaction region in the case of heavy nuclei. We argue that, in fact, the contrary is true: due to the quantum diffusion of the proton  wave function, the classical approximation breaks down at distances of the order of the system size.\nWe compute the electromagnetic field created by a charged particle described initially as a Gaussian wave packet of width 1~fm and evolving in vacuum according to the Klein-Gordon equation. We completely neglect the medium effects. We show that the dynamics, magnitude and even sign of the electromagnetic field created by classical and quantum sources are different.",

      "Abstract": "Thermal-photon production from the quark gluon plasma (QGP) phase plays an imperative role for direct photon production in heavy ion collisions. In most of theoretical approaches, the emission rate from the perturbative calculation with hard thermal loop resummation is applied. In order to facilitate our understandings for the impact from coupling dependence on the photons from QGP phase, we resort to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Despite the distinction between holographic duals and strongly coupled QCD, former studies in holography have not incorporated the medium evolution and the contributions from other phases, which make the results difficult to be compared with experiments. We thus perform the state-of-the-art computations to embed the photon emission rates from holography into medium evolution and include other contributions for direct-photon production.  \n\nIn this work, the thermal-photon emission from strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature is calculated using holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano limit (V-QCD). The emission rates are then embedded in hydrodynamic simulations combined with prompt photons from hard scattering and the thermal photons from hadron gas to analyze the spectra and anisotropic flow of direct photons at RHIC and LHC. The results from different sources responsible for the thermal photons in QGP including the weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) from perturbative calculations, strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma (as a benchmark for reference), and Gubser's phenomenological holographic model are then compared. It is found that the direct-photon spectra are enhanced in the strongly coupled scenario compared with the ones in the wQGP, especially at intermediate and high momenta, which improve the agreements with data. Moreover, by using IP-glassma initial states, both the elliptic flow and triangular flow of direct photons are amplified at high momenta (pT>2.5 GeV) for V-QCD, while they are suppressed at low momenta compared to wQGP. The distinct results in holography stem from the blue-shift of emission rates in strong coupling. In general, compered to experiments, the theoretical results still underestimate the flow in RHIC. In addition, we further evaluate the spectra and flow in small collision systems for future comparisons. We emphasize that thermal photons from the deconfined phase are substantial to reconcile the spectra and flow at high momenta.\n\nThe presentation is based on arXiv:1609.07208.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "Very strong magnetic fields can arise in non-central heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies, which may not decay quickly due to induced currents in the conducting plasma. Presence of very strong magnetic fields in the plasma (of order $10^{15}$ Tesla) during early stages in RHICE has been explored extensively recently primarily in connection with the so called chiral magnetic effect. An important effect of the presence of such strong magnetic fields in the plasma will be to lead to strong variations in velocities of different types of waves in the plasma. In particular the velocity varies with the angle between the wave vector and the direction of the\nmagnetic field, and also has non-trivial dependence on pressure gradient. This can qualitatively affect the development of anisotropic flow. It was earlier believed that the magnetic field arising from the collision of initial nuclei peaks to strong values for a very short time, essentially the passing time of the Lorentz contracted nuclei (â¼ 0.2 fm for RHIC energies). Subsequently it rapidly decays. However, it was later realized that due to induced currents in the conducting plasma, the magnetic field may survive for much longer time of order several fm, and can lead to interesting effects. We carry out magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the effects of this magnetic field\non the evolution of the plasma. We focus on the the elliptic flow as well as the power spectrum of flow fluctuations. Our results show that magnetic field leads to enhancement in elliptic flow. We further find that there are qualitative patterns in the power spectrum of flow fluctuations due to the presence of magnetic field. These features in the power spectrum may provide a clean signal for the presence of strong magnetic field during initial stages. We also show generation of vorticity arising from nontrivial dependence of magnetosonic waves on pressure gradients and magnetic field direction.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "The electromagnetic field pattern created by spectators in relativistic heavy-ion collisions plants a seed of positive (negative) magnetic helicity in the hemisphere above (below) the reaction plane. Owing to the chiral anomaly, the magnetic helicity interacts with the fermionic helicity of the collision system and causes photons emitted in upper and lower hemispheres to have different preferences in the circular polarization. Similar helicity separation for massive particles, owing to the global vorticity, is also possible. In this talk, we lay out a procedure to measure the variation of the circular polarization with respect to the reaction plane in relativistic heavy-ion collisions for massless photons, as well as similar polarization patterns for vector mesons decaying into two daughters. We propose to study the yield differentially and compare the yield between upper and lower hemispheres to identify and quantify such effects. This procedure will facilitate the investigation of novel phenomena related to chirality, magnetic field and vorticity in the Quark Gluon Plasma.",

      "Abstract": "Open heavy-flavor mesons (particles made of a heavy quark, i.e. charm or beauty, and a light quark) are a unique tool to study and characterize the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in the initial stages of the collisions, and they experience the whole system evolution, interacting with the medium constituents. Since charm and beauty quarks have different mass, their in-medium energy loss is predicted to be different. Therefore, for charmed hadrons, it is crucial to distinguish prompt hadrons (which derive directly from the hadronization of a $c$-quark or from the decay of excited open charm and charmonium states) from those coming from B-hadron decays. The parton energy loss can be studied by measuring the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, defined as the ratio of the measured yield in nucleus-nucleus collisions to the one in proton-proton interactions, scaled by the average number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. Another interesting observable is the elliptic flow $v_2$ at low transverse momentum, which can give insight into the possible participation of heavy quarks in the collective expansion of the medium. \nFurthermore, the study of open heavy-flavor hadrons in proton-nucleus collisions, in which the formation of an extended QGP is not expected, can provide an important measurement of the Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects, which is crucial for the interpretation of the results from nucleus-nucleus collisions. \n\nIn this contribution, the results on D$^+$-meson production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 \\text{ and }5.02$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, are presented.

The parity doublet model has been improved by adding the six-point interaction of the $\\sigma$ (and $\\zeta$) meson in the effective mean field Lagrangian, resulting in a good description of nuclear ground-state properties, in particular the nuclear compressibility. The resulting phase diagram of the model agrees qualitatively with expectations from lattice QCD, i.e. it shows a crossover at zero net baryo-chemical potential and a critical point at finite density. Using this model we investigate the dependence of the higher order baryon number susceptibilities as function of temperature and chemical potential. Due to the interplay between the de-confinement and nuclear liquid-gas transition, the experimentally measured cumulants of the net baryon number may show very different beam energy dependence depending on the actual freeze-out temperature.",

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "High-energy nuclear collisions are often classified in terms of centrality. Theoretically, the centrality binning is determined by Glauber models which take the nuclear density as an input. The nuclear density is traditionally parametrized by the Woods-Saxon form and is taken to be the same for protons and neutrons. However, according to the theoretical expectations and experimental measurements as well, the tail of neutron density extends farther than that of the the protons. This results in growth of the neutron-to-proton ratio at the edges of nuclei - a phenomenon referred to as neutron-skin effect. In high-energy nuclear collisions this relative increase of neutrons at the edges will have an influence on the centrality dependence of high-$p_{\\rm T}$ electroweak observables. \n\nIn this talk we present NLO pQCD predictions for the centrality dependence of inclusive high-$p_{\\rm T}$ photon production in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC taking into account the neutron-skin effect and spatially dependent nuclear PDFs, EPS09s [[Helenius, Paukkunen, Eskola, arXiv:1606.09044]][1]. In addition, we consider the ratio between positively and negatively charged hadrons as well as W production [[Paukkunen, PLB 745 (2015) 73]][2]. The advantage of these latter observables is that the nuclear modifications of the PDFs largely cancel out allowing for a cleaner study of the neutron-skin effect. According to our predictions, the neutron-skin effect can lead to modifications up to 20% in the most peripheral collisions and could thereby serve as a partial benchmark for the experimental centrality measures. In the future, the neutron skin should play a role in the centrality studies at the planned electron-ion colliders EIC and LHeC.\n\n\n  [1]: http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1606.09044\n  [2]: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2015.04.037",

      "Abstract": "Transport coefficients of hot hadron and QGP matter characterize their behavior upon external perturbations. Although this can be interesting by itself, they are important input for many phenomenological models that explain data for heavy-ion collisions. In this talk, we present our   recent results from kinetic theory for the electric conductivity  in a hot hadron gas (see Phys.Rev.D 93 (2016), 096012). The electric conductivity is recently gaining attention within several new studies about the possibly strong magnetic field influence in heavy-ion collisions. Our mostly analytic method includes 11 (or more) hadron species with their mutual parametrized (resonance) cross sections. It is based on the Boltzmann equation with a linearized collision term, which can be solved for the coefficients with in principle arbitrary precision. We extend the calculations to the baryon diffusion constant, baryon conductivity and heat flow. Below the phase transition, there is so far very little knowledge about these quantities, and kinetic theory serves as a unique quantitative tool which has a clear physical interpretation. Our results for zero chemical potential are contrasted to  various strong coupling and lattice QCD results. Furthermore, results for finite chemical potentials can be obtained in the same framework. Baryon diffusion is a rather little explored but very important phenomenon in recent and future baryon-rich experiments, and our results could help to understand their data.",

Since they give immediate access to the energy scale of a hard scattering, direct photons allow further constraints of (nuclear) parton distribution functions, especially on the poorly known distribution of initial state gluons. Direct photons have, moreover, the potential to yield unambiguous information on hot nuclear matter; in contrast to hard partonic probes they are not strongly affected by the medium.\n\nIn the last two decades, fixed order calculations of direct photons beyond leading order and resummation methods beyond leading log accuracy came to fruition. Yet, a parton shower Monte Carlo approach beyond Leading Order has been neglected so far, which is a pressing issue with respect to the prevalence of shower Monte Carlo generators in the HEP community. Considering that photon fragmentation functions for fixed-order calculations received no major updates in the last two decades, the role of the shower Monte Carlo approach becomes even more significant.\n\nWe present the POWHEG BOX implementation of the dominant direct photon production processes $qg \\to q\\gamma$ and $q\\overline{q} \\to g\\gamma$ at Next-to-Leading Order, interfaced with the PYTHIA8 parton shower. We aim for a robust description of direct photons and investigate therefore various simulation parameters of both the hard scattering kernel and the shower Monte Carlo.

This is in contrast with other hard processes that are successfully described\nby pQCD, such as top and bottom production and the inclusive jet cross section.\nThe charm content of jets is known to arise both from prompt production in the process ${\\rm gg\\, (q\\bar{q})} \\rightarrow {\\rm c\\bar{c}}$, and\nfrom the parton shower of gluons and light-flavor quarks.\nThe relative contribution of these two competing mechanisms is understood only qualitatively\nand it is known to depend on the center-of-mass energy of the two colliding protons.\nFurthermore charm hadrons coming from the fragmentation of prompt charm jets \nare expected to carry a larger fraction of the total jet momentum,\nas compared to those where the charm content arises later in the\nparton shower. Therefore the measurement of charm jet fragmentation functions (FFs) \ncan be used to estimate the relative strength of the two mechanisms.\n\nHeavy-flavor jets can also provide important insights into the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nproduced in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as heavy quarks are predicted\nto interact with the QGP differently compared to light quarks and gluons. \nHowever, their production mechanisms must first be studied in the vacuum, \nin order to provide a baseline for the observation of possible modifications induced by the presence of the QGP. \n\nWe present the current status of the measurement of jets that contain a D meson (D-tagged jets) using the ALICE detector.\nThe aim of the analysis is to extract both the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectrum of the D-tagged jets and the jet-momentum fraction of the D mesons. \nWe identify D-meson candidates via their hadronic decay channels using topological selections and particle identification.\nThese D-meson candidates are combined with the other charged tracks reconstructed by the central tracking system, \nusing the anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ jet-finding algorithm.\nWe extract the yield of D-tagged jets through an invariant mass analysis of the D-meson candidates associated with each jet, \nin bins of jet $p_{\\rm T}$ and momentum fraction carried by the D meson. \nFor this analysis we use data collected\nby ALICE with minimum bias triggers in pp collisions at 7 TeV.

Correlations between different order flow harmonics are predicted to be sensitive to transport properties of the produced medium in heavy-ion collision.

In the PCM, neutral mesons are measured by detecting decay photons converted in electron-positron pairs which are reconstructed in the ALICE central barrel detectors, Inner tracking system and Time Projection Chamber. \n In this poster, we will present a detailed description of the analysis and the status of the measurements will be discussed.",

This is the case for all particles produced in hard scattering processes, that can be reconstructed in jets, since they are mainly produced before the complete medium formation and can interact with the plasma during its early stages and its evolution.\n\nHeavy-flavour and jet observables can be combined by reconstructing the spectra of jets that are back-to-back with respect to identified heavy-flavour electrons, produced in the fragmentation and decay of heavy quarks. Thus, this heavy-flavour based measurement is directly comparable to theory since heavy-flavour processes can be theoretically calculated and, similarly to the hadron-jet coincidence analysis, the combinatorial background jets subtraction is improved. The final aim is to compare the measurements in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions in order to identify the effects of nuclear matter and QGP.\n\nThis poster presents the status of the analysis in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarkonia can be used as probes in heavy-ion collisions since the yield will contain imprint of the initial states and in-medium evolution, which can be used to extract properties of the cold and hot nuclear matters. This use of quarkonium as a probe is complicated by several factors: the competition between dissociation and recombination of quarkonium inside the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and the feed-down contributions from excited states to the ground state. Among different quarkonium states, bottomonium ground state $\\Upsilon$(1S) is a special probe because of its smaller size and longer thermalization time. A clear understanding of the fate of $\\Upsilon$(1S) inside QGP can tell us more information about the suppression mechanism: whether it arises solely from the suppression of excited states, or originates from the suppression of both the ground and excited states. To this end, a consistent treatment of formation and dissociation is needed.\nWe use potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) to study $\\Upsilon$(1S) inside QGP. The dissociation has been studied in pNRQCD but not the formation. The potential terms for the color singlet and octet can be calculated under the weak coupling assumption or fitted from lattice QCD results of the quarkonium free energy. The singlet and octet wave functions are calculated by solving the corresponding Schr$\\ddot{\\mathrm{o}}$dinger equations. Then the wave functions are used to calculate the in-medium rates of $\\Upsilon$(1S) formation and dissociation, which are at leading order through a color dipole interaction. The rates depend on the quarkonium velocity relative to the medium. The two rates are compared as a function of the plasma temperature. Its connection to the phenomenological studies of Upsilon production from heavy-ion collisions will be discussed, together with a future plan to incorporate quarkonium formation and dissociation into transport models for heavy quarks.",

      "Abstract": "Chiral anomaly is a fundamental aspect of the quantum theory for chiral fermions. In a many-body system containing chiral fermions, such as the hot quark-gluon plasma created in heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC, the chiral anomaly leads to macroscopic anomalous transport effects. A notable example is the chiral magnetic effect (CME), in which a vector current is generated along an external magnetic field given a nonzero imbalance between right-handed and left-handed fermions in the system. An observation of the CME is of great interest and significant efforts have been made. Current experimental data show encouraging evidences, but suffer from backgrounds. Realistic and quantitative modeling of CME signal is thus critically needed. The magnetic field in heavy ion collisions, however, is likely very short-lived, with its life time shorter than the onset time of hydrodynamics. It is thus a most pressing issue to simulate the CME in the pre-thermal stage in heavy ion collisions. The theoretical tool to do this, is the so-called chiral kinetic theory. We report the first attempt to utilize this tool for quantifying the pre-thermal CME. Exact solutions for collision-less case as well as the relaxation-time-approximation are obtained and used to compute two different CME-induced consequences: a pre-thermal charge separation across reaction plane, as well as a nonzero anomalous current along B field direction. We discuss the integration of these CME-induced initial conditions with subsequent hydrodynamic evolutions, and the implication of such results for the description of experimental data.",

      "Abstract": "The effect of the transverse momentum broadening to the total jet energy loss within a given jet cone-size, and therefore to the nuclear suppression factor are studied. The radiated gluons induced by the medium are mostly collinear with the mother parton. Therefore, the energy carried by the radiated gluons outside of the jet-cone is very small. However, the $p_T$ broadening effect can enlarge the angle between the mother parton and the radiated gluons. We found that this $p_T$ broadening effect is very important, which almost doubled the radiative energy loss. We also studied the collisional energy loss based on the pQCD calculation. We found that the collisional energy loss is very small comparing with the radiative energy loss.\n\nWe carried out the calculation for the nuclear modification factor of the single jet production, $R_{AA}$. We found our results can describe the ALICE and ATLAS data  with different cone-sizes very well. We also calculated the suppression of the per-trigger yield of hadron-jet production, and compared with the latest data, which is not only sensitive to the full jet energy loss but also sensitive to the leading parton energy loss.",

      "Abstract": "Produced in a hard scattering at the early stage of the collision a highly energetic parton is first expected to lose energy in the medium before fragmenting into a hadronic spray of particles called jet. A detailed study of the modification of the jet structure and of its fragmentation pattern in vacuum and in medium should provide insights into the QGP properties.\nThe jet fragmentation functions describe the momentum distribution of hadrons inside a reconstructed jet. In proton-proton (pp) collisions their measurement is important for understanding the mechanisms of parton fragmentation. Such measurements also provide a test of perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (pQCD) as well as a baseline for similar measurements in p-A collisions (revealing potential cold nuclear matter effects) or in A-A collisions (shedding light on the energy loss mechanisms in presence of a hot and dense medium). However, in heavy-ion collisions the presence of a large underlying event and of its event-by-event fluctuations makes the measurement of jet fragmentation functions a challenging task. The use of the fragmentation function moments has been proposed [1] as a way to overcome this difficulty.\n\nThe ALICE detector at the LHC has unique tracking capabilities enabling to measure charged particles down to transverse momenta as low as $150~$MeV/c. This allows assessing possible modifications of the jet structure and helps constraining the jet fragmentation functions.\n\nWe will present the ALICE measurements of charged-jet fragmentation functions in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 2.76 TeV. The first studies of fragmentation function moments will be discussed. The results will also be compared to model predictions.\n\n[1] M. Cacciari et al.

This background contribution can be suppressed by rejecting $e^{+}$ and $e^{-}$ tracks that originate from photon conversion processes.

In this study, we include the $B\\bar{B}$  annihilation effect\ninto the thermal model [5] by introducing one more parameter for\nthe out-of-equilibrium annihilation loss of the protons. We use the quark model description for the annihilation losses of the other (anti-)baryons. We assume\n annihilation of a $B\\bar{B}$ pair produces a certain number of mesons\n (default 5 pions and kaons depending on the strangeness\n content) [4, 6]. We fit both heavy-ion data ($\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = $ 6.27 GeV to 2.76 TeV) and proton-proton collision data ($\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = $ 200, 900, and 7000 GeV) at SPS, RHIC and LHC energies. We obtain new chemical freeze-out parameters with significantly improved fit quality in comparison to the default thermal model. \nWe find that the baryon loss increases with increasing collision\nenergy while the antibaryon loss decreases.

And while lattice QCD studies have made progress in elucidating fully equilibrated quarkonium, our knowledge of its out-of equilibrium dynamics relevant for heavy-ion collisions remains scarce.\n\n\nHere we present numerical results for the non-equilibrium real-time evolution of heavy quarkonium states in the quark-gluon plasma based on a recently proposed stochastic potential model [1-3] . The model adds a noise term to the real-valued Debye screened potential term. This noise term explains naturally the complex potential between a heavy quark and a heavy anti-quark, which has been found by both perturbative calculation and lattice calculation, i.e. the imaginary part is related to nontrivial noise correlations. The addition of the noise term to the potential leads to a stochastic SchrÃ¶dinger equation, which implements unitary time evolution and provides insight on an important mechanism to play a role in the time evolution of a heavy quarkonium: decoherence of the wave function.\n\n\nWe investigate how the quarkonia evolve with the stochastic SchrÃ¶dinger equation derived from the stochastic potential. In particular, we show the time evolution of the ground and excited states, and how it depends on the temperature of the environment and the correlation length of the noise.\n\n\n[1] Y. Akamatsu, A.

Key measurements for locating the critical point and determining the first order phase transition are limited by poor event plane resolution, limited statistics and a TPC-only centrality determination. Therefore, phase II of the BES program was proposed to take data with upgraded detectors and increased statistics for the further investigation. A new event plane and collision centrality detector (EPD) is planned to replace the existing detector, the Beam-Beam Counter (BBC), with higher granularity and acceptance. The design of the EPD consists of two scintillator discs at z= $\\pm$ 3.75m from the center of STAR, covering 2.2 $< \\eta <$ 5.1, the same as the BBC. The detector will be read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) - an inexpensive and magnetic field insensitive replacement for the traditional phototube. A prototype of the detector, consisting of a single sector was integrated into STAR during the 2016 run, the results of which will be shown. The geometry and segmentation of the design optimizes event-plane resolution, centrality determination and flow harmonic measurements. We will discuss the plans to install one quarter of a disc into STAR for the 2017 run.",

At lower transverse momenta where the event-by-event reconstruction of jets becomes difficult, their event averaged effect generates observable correlations, which have been studied using triggered two-particle angular correlation measurements. To control the di-jet production point, we require two back-to-back trigger particles with different momenta.  Using symmetric and asymmetric trigger $p_{T}$ combinations, we are making an attempt to control the path lengths traversed by the triggers.These antipodal triggers allow us a simultaneous comparison of the near and away sides which is difficult otherwise due to the background subtraction involved on the away side, and so lets us compare the impact of different kinematic cuts on the fragmentation bias. \n\nIn this analysis the relative pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle distributions ($\\Delta\\eta$ - $\\Delta\\phi$) of particles with respect to both the triggers are constructed, and the yield extracted from a fit to the $\\Delta\\eta$ projection. The measurement is done in central and semi-central events for three $p_{T}$ combinations of primary and secondary triggers. Heavy ion measurements have been compared with pp reference data which forms a rigorous baseline for correlation measurements. The variation observed between near and away sides will be presented which will shed light on the modification of the $p_{T}$ of jet fragments. To further interpret the results in terms of path length dependence, the comparison of these results to JEWEL model simulations will be presented as well",

The initial conditions for hydrodynamics are generated using a Glauber-type model which replaces each nucleon in the collision by three quarks. In this model, the quarks obey a joint Gaussian distribution about a nucleon's center of mass, and each quark deposits a Gaussian-shaped cloud of entropy in the transverse plane. By varying the parameters of this model, we quantify the effect of quark substructure on observable quantities. Results from the simulations are compared with experimental data from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS experiments. In particular, the hydrodynamic approach reproduces the observed distribution of particle multiplicities, and further achieves a quantitatively accurate description of the flow coefficients $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$ at high multiplicities. From this, we draw conclusions about the initial shape of the droplet formed in p+p and p+Pb collisions.",

By following the parton collision history in AMPT, we have found that the opacity in AMPT is relatively small and the parton $v_n$ is primarily produced by the anisotropic escape mechanism [3]. In this study, we investigate the origin and development of the $v_n$ mass ordering of identified hadrons in heavy ion collisions as well as small system collisions at both RHIC and LHC energies [4]. We show that a fraction of the mass ordering arises from kinematics in the quark coalescence hadronization process, while resonance decays tend to reduce the mass ordering. We find that the majority of the mass ordering comes from hadronic rescatterings, although they have little effect on the overall magnitude of charged hadron $v_n$. These findings are qualitatively the same as those from hybrid models that couple hydrodynamics to a hadron cascade [5-7]. In addition, we find no qualitative difference between heavy ion collisions and small system collisions or between RHIC and LHC energies. Our results from the AMPT study thus demonstrate that the $v_n$ mass ordering may not be a distinctive signature of hydrodynamic collective flow, but can be a quantitative interplay of several physics processes.\n\n[1] Z.W.

These correlations have already been measured for both unidentified and identified light-flavor hadrons.

From our study we infer that large\ndeviation from the perfect scaling at LHC is because of the modification of the $v_{2}$ generated at the partonic phase by the final stage hadronic re-scatterings together with the\nextension of linear scaling between hadron and parton $v_{2}$ upto higher values of hadron $p_{T}$ because of high phase-space density at the partonic level.",

They interact with its consitutents and lose energy as they travel through the medium.

These goals include studying long-range rapidity correlations, event plane correlations in heavy-ion interactions, and studying the gluon contribution to the proton spin by measuring forward di-jets and forward-mid rapidity jet correlations in proton-proton collisions. Upgrades to the AGS E864 lead-scintillating fiber calorimeter have increased spatial resolution by utilizing cell pixelization. Pixelization increases spatial resolution by replacing a single photosensor on individual 10cm x 10cm cells by a set of nine photosensors, resulting in 3.3cm x 3.3cm pixels. Pixelization was tested with colliding beams at STAR and fixed target test beams at FNAL. Light collection has been optimized and fringe field effects have been minimized by the introduction of Fresnel lenses and mu-metal shielding. A prototype consisting of a 2x3 cell stack was installed into the forward region of STAR for the end of run16. This prototype investigated the introduction of these new techniques as well as a trial of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) as an alternate to traditional Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). SiPMs do not suffer from fringe field effects, but are susceptible to radiation damage by neutrons, so their performance during the prototype operation was analyzed.  The prototype observed Au+Au collisions at 200GeV. There is a proposal to install two 9-column x 12-row cell stacks as forward jet detectors at STAR, with 16 cells in each stack pixelized. This poster will discuss the effects of Fresnel lenses on light collection, mu-metal shielding effects on PMTs, and radiation effects on SiPMs.",

Specifically, the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio is investigated, and its temperature dependence between 75 MeV and 175 MeV is explored, and the effects of non-zero baryon and strange chemical potentials are probed. This is important to constrain the value of shear viscosity over entropy density used in hydrodynamic calculations of heavy ion reactions at RHIC and the LHC. Calculations are initialized using the corresponding particle densities computed from a thermal model in a hadronic box simulating infinite matter. After an appropriate equilibration delay, the shear viscosity $\\eta$ is computed using the Green-Kubo formalism. The entropy density $s$ is obtained using the Gibbs formula and $dN/dp$ spectral fitting to obtain the final (equilibrated) temperatures and chemical potentials of the system. As a check, the results for the entropy and shear viscosity of a massive and massless pion gas are compared to analytic estimates. The shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$ is found to be significantly lower than found in previous similar calculations by [Demir & Bass][1], but in qualitative agreement with other calculations using other methods by [Romatschke & Pratt][2] and [Song, Bass & Heinz][3].

This modification delays the quenching of partons with intermediate energy, resulting in the survival of more hadrons in the final state with $p_T$ in the several GeV range.\nWe demonstrate that this effect modifies the jet shapes and jet fragmentations functions, as it makes it more probable for particles carrying a small fraction of the jet energy at larger angles from the jet axis to survive their passage through the quark-gluon plasma.\nWe analyze the consequences of different choices for the value of the resolution length $L_{Res}$  on both partonic and hadronic jet shapes and fragmentation functions, as well as on missing-$p_T$ observables. \nMore generally, we discuss the qualitative consequences, and importance, of including the effects of finite resolution.",

Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions.  Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order flow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented.

      "Abstract": "The determination of transport coefficients plays a central role in characterizing hot and dense nuclear matter. In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot hadronic matter by extracting it from the rho-meson spectral function, as its zero-energy limit at vanishing momentum. Recent calculations of the electric conductivity in hot nuclear matter have been performed in different approaches but show significantly varying results.\nUsing hadronic many-body theory, we calculate the rho meson self-energy in a pion gas. Previously the effects of in medium nucleons and delta particles on the pion cloud of the rho propagator have been calculated. However the effects of thermal pions on the pion self-energies were not included. This requires the determination of the relevant interactions between in-medium pions and the rho meson, and the calculation of these interactions. This calculation requires the dressing of the pion propagators in the rho self-energy with pion-rho loops. To maintain gauge invariance one must calculate vertex corrections to the rho self-energy loops. Using guidance from previous works, we calculate these vertex corrections relativistically. The resulting spectral function is used to calculate the electric conductivity of hot hadronic matter. In particular, we analyze the transport peak of the spectral function and extract its behavior with temperature and coupling strength. Our results suggest that, while obeying lower bounds set by conformal field theories in the strong-coupling limit, the pion gas is a strongly coupled medium.",

      "Abstract": "Charm quarks, predominantly produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions, are believed to provide unique information on the hot and dense medium created in such collisions. At RHIC, an enhancement in baryon-to-meson ratios for light hadrons and hadrons containing strange quarks has been observed in central heavy-ion collisions compared to p+p and peripheral heavy-ion collisions in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2 < $p_T$ < 6 GeV/c). This was explained by the hadronization mechanism involving multi-parton coalescence. $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ is the lightest charmed baryon with the mass close to $D^0$ meson, and it has an extremely short life time ($c\\tau\\sim60$ $\\mu m$). Different models predict different levels of enhancement in the $\\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio depending on the degree of charm quark thermalization in the medium and how the coalescence mechanism is implemented. \n\nIn this poster, we will report the first measurement of $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ production in heavy-ion collisions using the recently installed Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ are reconstructed through the hadronic decay channel ($\\Lambda_{c}^+$ $\\rightarrow$ $pK\\pi$) using topological cuts optimized by the Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis (TMVA). After correcting for the reconstruction efficiency and acceptance, the transverse-momentum spectrum of $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be presented. The measured $\\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio will be compared with different model calculations, and the physics implications will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "In heavy-ion collisions, properties of the created QCD matter highly depend on the collision geometry or ''centrality''. In A+A collisions, centrality is related to the size of the overlap region determined by the impact parameter. In p+A collisions, the term ''centrality'' is still taken to be a classification of the amount of activity in the collision, which, however, is not strictly related to the impact parameter, but more closely to the number of p+N collisions in a Glauber-like picture. This study focuses on the determination of centrality classes in p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment using data taken in 2015. Simulation studies based on the Glauber model and the GEANT modelling of the STAR detector are performed to determine the sensitivity of different sub-detectors with different rapidity coverages to the event centrality. Comparisons of such studies to the data will be presented, and the implications on how to best determine centralities for p+Au collisions will be discussed.",

In this scenario, quark-antiquark pairs produced in the earlier stages of the collision are pulled apart due to collective effects, while pairs produced during hadronization are unlikely to separate. We present the measurements of such balance functions based on an analysis of data acquired at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ALICE detector. Balance functions have been measured for identified charged-pion pairs and for identified charged-kaon pairs in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV. These balance functions are presented in relative pseudorapidity $\\Delta\\eta$, relative rapidity $\\Delta y$ and relative azimuthal angle $\\Delta\\phi$. We observe that the charged-pion balance function widths in terms of $\\Delta\\eta$, $\\Delta y$ and $\\Delta\\phi$ are narrower in central Pb-Pb collisions compared to peripheral collisions. In addition, a comparison between the balance functions of charged-pions and unidentified charged particles will be shown. We will also report on the measurements of charged-kaon balance functions.

D-tagged jets are a valuable tool to characterize the charm interaction with the QGP. Furthermore, charmed jets can provide complementary information to D-meson measurements to study the mass-dependent energy loss by analysing the modification of the charm-jet yield in Pb--Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions as a function of the jet transverse momentum.

Theoretical models predict that single and double hypernuclei, and heavy multi-strange short-lived objects are produced via coalescence in heavy-ion collisions with the maximum yield in the region of SIS100 energies. The discovery and investigation of new hypernuclei and of hyper-matter will shed light on the hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon interactions. The key CBM observables include particles containing hidden charm, open charm and low-mass vector mesons decaying into leptons. Particularly demanding is the measurement of open charm particles with very low multiplicities, which is based on the real time selection of displaced vertices with an accuracy of about 50 Î¼m.

Their interactions with nuclear medium are sensitive to the medium properties. The Heavy Flavor Tracker (HFT) has been successfully integrated into the STAR experiment at RHIC since early 2014. Based on the state-of-the-art Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) technology, the HFT allows precise measurements  of open charm mesons ($D^{0}$, $D^{\\pm}$ and $D_{s}$) as well as the first measurements of open charm baryons ($\\Lambda_{c}$) and bottom hadron production in heavy-ion collisions over a wide range of transverse momentum.\n\nIn this talk we propose a faster pixel detector, based on the next generation of MAPS technology, for precise bottom hadron measurements to study the flavor dependence of partonic energy loss in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The advantages of the new MAPS sensors are that they have a much better radiation tolerance and a much faster integration time of less than 40 $\\mu$s, which allow for improved operation in high luminosity environment with less pile-up hits and better tracking efficiency. With the faster pixel detector and integrated luminosity of 10 nb$^{-1}$ for Au+Au collisions and 60 pb$^{-1}$ for p+p collisions at  $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV to be recorded, the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for non-prompt $J/\\psi$ and $D^{0}$ from beauty decays and $b$-tagged jets can be measured with good precision according to Monte Carlo simulations.

Comparison of the Î¥ modifications measured at RHIC and LHC therefore provides a relatively direct comparison of the effect of high energy density on three states of different radius and binding energy, at two different initial temperatures of the plasma. The sPHENIX experiment proposed at RHIC will be able to reconstruct Î¥ states with a mass resolution of approximately 80 MeV, providing a clear separation of the three Y(nS) states. In combination with the large acceptance of sPHENIX and the high luminosity at RHIC  this will provide a high quality measurement of the modification for all three states.

It will also allow identifying particle decays occurring within the aperture. \n\nThe STS consists of 8 tracking stations based on double-sided silicon microstrip sensors equipped with fast, self-triggering read-out electronics.  With about two million read-out channels, the STS will deliver a high-rate stream of time-stamped data that is transferred to a computing farm for on-line event determination and analysis. The functional building block is a detector module consisting of a sensor, microcables and two front-end electronics boards. The double-sided microstrip sensors have a strip pitch of 58 $\\mu$m, are AC-coupled and oriented under 7.5 degree stereo angle. Double metallization is employed for read-out routing. Ultra-thin microcables with up to 60 cm length and a line pitch matching that of the sensor strips transfer the analog signals to the readout electronics at the periphery of the stations where cooling and further infrastructure can be provided without compromising the material budget.

Given that HADES is not yet equipped with an electromagnetic calorimeter, our analysis relies on an indirect detection of the direct photons.

The approach is complicated by the fact that HADES is optimized for minimizing the related conversion process, which contributes to the background of other measurements. \n\nWe discuss in details the method of the direct photon reconstruction used and describe how to correct for the impact of combinatorial background and Dalitz decays.

This provides a prediction for $(R_{AA})$ for \n the upcoming $Pb-Pb$ run for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV. A detailed\n study of the ISF provides a novel method to understand the role of\n collectivity and energy loss at these energies.

The charged-pion balance function widths in terms of $\\Delta y$ and $\\Delta\\phi$ appear to be narrower in central Pb-Pb collisions compared to peripheral collisions. Furthermore, we present a comparison between the balance functions of charged-pions, charged-kaons and unidentified charged particles. The results of this analysis agree with the effects of delayed hadronization and radial flow, as well as the two-wave nature of quark production proposed in $[1]$.

On the theoretical side, the behavior of higher-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon charge from Lattice QCD may allows us to estimate its position via Taylor expansion of the density of states at $\\mu_B=0$. However, even if the series expansion continues to higher-orders, there is always the possibility to miss the critical point behavior due to truncation errors.  \n\nAn alternative approach to exploring the QCD critical point is using black hole engineering. This method allow us to obtain susceptibilities fitting the lattice data at $\\mu_B=0$ but also can be expanded out to extremely large baryonic chemical potentials as well. Additionally, in the black hold engineered EoS there is a clear critical point at $\\mu_B=725$ MeV and $T=80$ MeV.  In this talk, we obtain the freeze-out line and compare it with the hadron resonance gas model, lattice calculations, and experimental data.

While the latter conflates the effects of shear viscosity on freeze-out and on the time evolution of the flow field, and is sensitive to an averaged shear viscosity during that time evolution, our analysis is only sensitive to the shear viscosity at freeze-out and represents its value at the corresponding temperature.

From the intensive study based on relativistic viscous hydrodynamic models with event-by-event initial fluctuations, we can extract detailed information of the bulk feature of the QGP such as transport coefficients and the QCD equations of states. In the quantitative analyses of the QGP property, high-precision numerical treatment on the hydrodynamic calculation is important.\n\nRecently, we developed a new 3+1 dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code in Cartesian coordinates [1]. In the algorithm, we use a Riemann solver based on the two-shock approximation which is stable under existence of large shock waves. We extend the algorithm in Cartesian coordinates to that in Milne coordinates so that we can efficiently apply it to the analyses of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We check the correctness of the numerical algorithm by comparing numerical calculations and analytical solutions in various problems for ideal and viscous fluids. The new numerical scheme is stable even with small numerical viscosity [2], which is very important to discuss the physical viscosities at RHIC and LHC.\n\nWe apply our relativistic viscous hydrodynamics code to the analysis of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We find that the evolution of the hydrodynamic instability is sensitive to the values of the viscosities and the accuracy of the numerical calculation. We discuss possible existence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability originates from longitudinal fluctuations and effects of shear and bulk viscosities on the evolution of the instability [3].\n\n[1] Y.

The experiment will operate at high interaction rates up to 10 MHz, that requires a full event reconstruction in real time. \n\nIn order to make an efficient event selection online a clean sample of particles has to be provided by the reconstruction package called First Level Event Selection (FLES). The FLES package operates in two stages. First, particles registered in the CBM detector system are reconstructed. Then short-lived particles decayed before or inside the setup are searched based on their charged and neutral daughter particles. Since the FLES package is developed to run on many-core computer architectures, the reconstruction of particles is done in parallel that provides a possibility for a global competition between particle candidates. Such a global event topology reconstruction significantly improves suppression of a combinatorial background and provides for further physics analysis a very clean sample of particles produced at different stages of heavy ion collision. \n\nThe global event topology reconstruction procedure and the results of its application to simulated collisions in the CBM detector setup are presented and discussed in details.",

      "Abstract": "We compute the suppression, angular, and rapidity distribution of single open heavy flavor and the momentum, angular, and rapidity correlations for pairs of open heavy flavor at RHIC and LHC from an AdS/CFT-based energy loss model.  We quantitatively compare these strongly-coupled QGP predictions to the weakly-coupled QGP predictions of Nahrgang et al., PRC90 (2014) [arXiv:1305.3823].  In the strong-coupling energy loss model, we include both the mean energy loss and thermal fluctuations; in the weak-coupling energy loss model, one set of predictions corresponds to the inclusion of purely collisional processes while the other additionally incorporates radiative corrections.\n\n  When restricted to leading order production processes, we find that the strongly coupled correlations of high transverse momentum pairs ($>4$ GeV) are broadened less efficiently than the corresponding weak coupling based correlations, while low transverse momentum pairs ($1-4$ GeV) are broadened with similar efficiency, but with an order of magnitude more particles ending up in this momentum class. The strong coupling momentum correlations we compute account for initial correlations and reveal that the particle pairs suppressed from initially high momenta to the low momentum domain do not suffice to explain the stark difference to the weak coupling results in momentum correlations for $1-4$ GeV. From this, we conclude that heavy quark pairs are more likely to stay correlated in momentum when propagating through a strongly coupled plasma than a weakly coupled one.\n\n  When initialised at next-to-leading order (aMC@NLO with Herwig++), we observe significant additional broadening of azimuthal correlations, with the angular correlations of low momentum pairs ($1-4$ GeV) essentially washed.  However, the momentum correlations remain even when NLO production mechanisms are included. Thus, our conclusion for differences in momentum correlations with leading order production processes should carry over to next-to-leading order production processes once comparable predictions for a weakly-coupled QGP emerge.",

The baryon fluctuation can represent the critical dynamics, while the chiral fluctuation mode is a slave mode of the conserved densities.\n\nWe propose a stochastic diffusion equation in the rapidity space with critical nature being encoded in the time-dependent diffusion coefficient and baryon number susceptibility. We find a novel non-monotonic dependence of the critical fluctuation observables on the rapidity cuts, depending on the approach to the critical point during the time evolution. We show that the effect of critical dynamics could be sustainable as a non-monotonic behavior as the rapidity-window dependence of conserved-charge cumulants at the kinetic freeze-out.

      "Abstract": "The CBM fixed-target experiment at FAIR will investigate highly compressed baryonic matter at moderate temperatures in heavy-ion collisions with 2-11 AGeV beam energy for heaviest nuclei at the SIS100 accelerator at FAIR starting in 2022. The CBM experiment aims at understanding and characterizing nuclear matter at high net-baryon densities but moderate temperatures focussing on the investigation of rare probes as for example electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation, if measured with high precision, is particularly promising as is carries information on the temperature and evolution of the fireball, in-medium properties of vector-mesons and on the coupling to baryonic resonances. No measurements are available in this energy range so far, thus CBM has a high discovery potential due to the unprecedented reaction rates.\n\nThe major detector for clean electron identification in the CBM experiment at SIS 100 will be a RICH detector using CO${_2}$ as radiator gas, spherical glass mirrors with reflective Al+MgF${_2}$ coating as focusing elements and a photodetector plane consisting of an array of H12700 MAPMTs from Hamamatsu. This detector concept has been tested extensively with a real-size RICH prototype in testbeams and proven to show a high performance. The testbeam evaluations included a detailed study of layers of wavelength-shifting films for enhanced UV sensitivity and the development of MAPMT readout. Several MAPMT sensors were tested in this setup but also for radiation hardness in separate experimental campaigns with thermal neutron and gamma irradiation. As result the H12700 sensor was ordered from Hamamatsu in spring 2015, until now 500 MAPMTs have been measured and tested. The readout electronics is based on the TRB3 developments and focusses on good time resolution while offering moderate amplitude infromation via time-over-threshold. The close to final readout electronics is available and will be tested in testbeams at COSY and in the lab.\n\nIn order to make use of the early delivery of the photosensors with respect to the CBM time scales and to recuperate performance losses of the HADES RICH detector, the HADES RICH detector will be upgraded with these photosensors and readout electronics as developed for CBM. This upgrade program will be finished for the next HADES data taking period starting 2018.\n\nIn this contribution we will report on the design and development status of the CBM RICH detector including details from the MAPMT radiation hardness tests, MAPMT series measurements, readout electronics and the HADES RICH upgrade. Feasibility studies of di-electron measurements in CBM will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Longitudinal dynamics has recently become a topic of great interest in the study of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions.  Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order flow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented. These result will help to constrain initial conditions along longitudinal direction and also help understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.",

      "Institute": "Texas A&M University",
      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "We study bottomonium production at RHIC and the LHC using a transport model including both suppression and regeneration mechanisms. The transport model utilizes a kinetic rate equation [1] to calculate the centrality dependence of the production yields, and a Boltzmann equation for transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra. It has been successful in describing and predicting charmonium data at SPS, RHIC and the LHC. The bottomonium dissociation rates are improved over previous work [2] by using in-medium binding energies from an in-medium T-matrix approach, which, in turn, require to account for both gluo-dissociation (dominant for large binding) and inelastic parton-induced break-up (dominant for weak binding) including interference effects [3]. We also update the equation of state for the bulk medium using lattice-QCD results. For the calculation of the $p_T$-spectra and elliptic flow of the regeneration contribution we use a coalescence model [4] where the input bottom-quark spectra are taken from Langevin transport simulations of bottom quarks [5] to account for their non-equilibrium distributions. We then conduct a systematic analysis of bottomonium observables for the nuclear modification factor as a function of $N_{\\rm part}$ and $p_T$ in comparison to ALICE, CMS and STAR data. The comparison suggests that the centrality dependence of the total yields is sensitive to different scenarios for the screening of binding energies. The off-equilibrium bottom-quark spectra are found to play an important role in both the bottomonium $p_T$ spectra and their predicted elliptic, which helps to disentangle the role of regeneration contributions.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] X.

      "Abstract": "Currently at the Beam Energy Scan at RHIC experimental efforts are being made to find the QCD critical point. On the theoretical side, the behavior of higher-order susceptibilities of the net-baryon charge from Lattice QCD may allows us to estimate its position via Taylor expansion of the density of states at $\\mu_B=0$. However, even if the series expansion continues to higher-orders, there is always the possibility to miss the critical point behavior due to truncation errors.  \n\nAn alternative approach to exploring the QCD critical point is using black hole engineering. This method allow us to obtain susceptibilities fitting the lattice data at $\\mu_B=0$ but also can be expanded out to extremely large baryonic chemical potentials as well. Additionally, in the black hold engineered EoS there is a clear critical point at $\\mu_B=725$ MeV and $T=80$ MeV.  In this talk, we obtain the freeze-out line and compare it with the hadron resonance gas model, lattice calculations, and experimental data. We also explore fluctuations at the lowest energies at the beam energy scan to see if there are signatures of the critical point.",

      "Abstract": "Charm quarks, predominantly produced in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions, are believed to provide unique information on the hot and dense medium created in such collisions. At RHIC, an enhancement in baryon-to-meson ratios for light hadrons and hadrons containing strange quarks has been observed in central heavy-ion collisions compared to p+p and peripheral heavy-ion collisions in the intermediate $p_T$ range (2 < $p_T$ < 6 GeV/c). This was explained by the hadronization mechanism involving multi-parton coalescence. $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ is the lightest charmed baryon with the mass close to $D^0$ meson, and it has an extremely short life time ($c\\tau\\sim60$ $\\mu m$). Different models predict different levels of enhancement in the $\\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio depending on the degree of charm quark thermalization in the medium and how the coalescence mechanism is implemented. \n\nIn this poster, we will report the first measurement of $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ production in heavy-ion collisions using the recently installed Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ are reconstructed through the hadronic decay channel ($\\Lambda_{c}^+$ $\\rightarrow$ $pK\\pi$) using topological cuts optimized by the Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis (TMVA). After correcting for the reconstruction efficiency and acceptance, the transverse-momentum spectrum of $\\Lambda_{c}^+$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV will be presented. The measured $\\Lambda_{c}^+$/$D^0$ ratio will be compared with different model calculations, and the physics implications will be discussed.",

      "Abstract": "In this talk, based on arXiv:1605.09176, we present a microscopic realization of the hollowness effect observed in proton-proton scattering at $\\sqrt s = 7$ TeV. The initial collision geometry proposed in our model could impact significantly the interpretation of data specially sensitive to it, like the eccentricities of proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions.\nThe hollowness effect, not observed at lower energies, consists in a depletion of the inelasticity density at zero impact parameter of the collision. Counterintuitively, there is more inelasticity when the two protons are at about half a fermi transverse separation that for head-on collisions. Our analysis is based on three main ingredients: we rely gluonic hot spots inside the proton as effective degrees of freedom for the description of the scattering process. Next we assume that some non-trivial correlation between the transverse positions of the hot spots inside the proton exists. Finally we build the scattering amplitude from a multiple scattering, Glauber-like series of collisions between hot spots. In our approach, the onset of the hollowness effect is naturally explained as due to the diffusion or growth of the hot spots in the transverse plane with increasing collision energy. Furthermore, we will explore the impact of the non-trivial correlations between the transverse positions of the hot spots in the calculation of eccentricities in proton-proton collisions, a highly debated topic nowadays as there are suggestive signals of collective phenomena, associated to the formation of QGP in heavy ion collisions, in this smaller system that may be caused by the initial state geometry.",

      "Abstract": "We present a derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics from the moments of the Boltzmann equation based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic single-particle distribution function [1]. We construct such an expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum space orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the anisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle distribution function from the anisotropic distribution. Truncating this set via the 14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics. We further consider a particular choice for the anisotropic distribution function and the boost-invariant expansion of a fluid in one dimension, neglecting deviations from the chosen distribution function [2]. In order to close the conservation equations, we need to select in addition a particular moment of the Boltzmann equation. We discuss the influence of the choice of this moment on the time evolution of fluid-dynamical variables and identify the moment that provides the best match of anisotropic fluid dynamics to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation.\n\n[1] E.

      "Abstract": "Strong fluctuations of the elliptic flow in heavy ion collisions allow an efficient selection of the events corresponding to a specific initial geometry. This technique, Event Shape Engineering, was applied to select events corresponding to the \nsame centrality, but having very different values of elliptic flow. For those events, we present results on the centrality dependence of the charge-dependent two- and three-particle correlators in Pb-Pb collisions at \n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV recorded by the ALICE detector. The charge dependence of the three-particle \ncorrelator is often employed as evidence for the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The interpretation of the \nexperimental results is complicated by possible background contributions, including the modulation from elliptic flow. \nWe have used these measurements and a Monte-Carlo Glauber simulation of the magnetic field to derive an upper limit on \nthe CME contribution.",

The PHSD includes the deconfinement phase transition as well as essential aspects of CSR in the dense and hot hadronic medium, which are incorporated in the Schwinger mechanism for particle production. Our systematic studies show that chiral symmetry restoration plays a crucial role in the description of heavy-ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=3--20\\,GeV, realizing an increase of the hadronic particle production in the strangeness sector with respect to the non-strange one. We identify particle abundances and rapidity spectra to be suitable probes in order to extract information about CSR, while transverse mass spectra are less sensitive. Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the \"horn\" structure in the excitation function of the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio: the CSR in the hadronic phase produces the steep increase of this particle ratio up to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\approx$ 7 GeV, while the drop at higher energies is associated to the appearance of a deconfined partonic medium. Furthermore, the appearance/disappearance of the 'horn' structure is investigated as a function of the system size and collision centrality. We additionally present an analysis of strangeness production in the ($T,\\mu_B$)-plane (as extracted from the PHSD for central Au+Au collisions) and discuss the perspectives to identify a possible critical point in the phase diagram.",

We have investigated higher moments of e-by-e proton distributions using data from our high-statistics measurement of Au+Au collisions. Systematic effects have been studied making use of our GEANT-based detector response simulation which includes sophisticated digitizers for all detector systems in use. The data is corrected for detector effects like finite acceptance and multiplicity-dependent reconstruction efficiency using different approaches proposed by Koch and co-workers (arXiv-1206-4286, arXiv-1603-09057, arXiv-1607-07375).",

We study hadronic chemistry, identified particle spectra, anisotropic flow, and HBT interferometry over the energy range relevant to the RHIC BES.

Insight as to the nature of these fluctuations is obtained by calculating from $p(v_{n})$ the cumulants and moments associated with the event shape. Flow harmonic distributions in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are measured for the integrated $p_{T}$ ($\\eta$) range $0.3 \\leq p_{T} \\leq 3.0$ GeV/c ($|\\eta| \\leq 2.4$) using the CMS detector at the LHC. The event-shape engineering technique is used to further divide events into classes based on their ellipticity, which allows for the study of detailed correlations between initial-shape components that would otherwise be destroyed by event-averaging techniques. Hydrodynamic models predict the $2^{nd}$ order participant eccentricity distributions to have a negative skewness, which is identified as the main source of non-Gaussian behavior in $p(v_{2})$ distributions. The skewness for $p(v_{2})$ distributions is measured with high precision over the full centrality range. In addition, $p(v_{n})$ distributions are fitted with an elliptic power law parameterization to infer the proportionality constant between the flow harmonics and the initial-state geometry. Furthermore, correlations between different order harmonics are measured using the event-shape selection technique.",

Our analysis includes events selected based on asymmetries in spectators observed in the Zero-Degree-Calorimeters which preferentially select body-tip events [3].

In large systems, it is well established that the final-state particle correlations arise from anisotropic pressure gradients in the initial state of the collisions that drive a near-perfect fluid evolution. Whether QGP is also formed in small collision systems is presently under intense investigation. To study the origin of the collective behavior in small systems, the PHENIX experiment performed a series of geometry-controlled experiments using $p$+Al, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, and $^3$He+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. The elliptic ($v_2$)  and triangular ($v_3$) flow coefficients are measured as a function of $p_T$ for inclusive and identified charged hadrons.   Mass dependence is observed in $v_2(p_T)$ indicative of hydrodynamic evolution. The relation of the $v_n$ strengths and the corresponding initial eccentricities in the different systems is studied and compared to several theoretical predictions that invoke different mechanisms for producing final-state particle correlations. The distinct initial geometries provide discriminating power against the models.",

However, the observation of the CME remains inconclusive because of several possible sources of background correlations that may account for part or all of the observed signals. This talk will present the first application of three-particle, charge-dependent azimuthal correlation analysis in proton-nucleus collisions, using pPb data collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The differences found in comparing same and opposite sign correlations are studied as a function of event multiplicity and the pseudorapidity gap between two of the particles detected in the CMS tracker detector. After selecting events with comparable charge-particle multiplicities, the results for pPb collisions are found to be similar to those for PbPb collisions collected at the same collision energy. With a reduced magnetic field strength and a random field orientation in high multiplicity pPb events, the CME contribution to any charge separation signal is expected to be much smaller than found in peripheral PbPb events. These results pose a challenge for the interpretation of charge-dependent azimuthal correlations in heavy ion collisions in terms of the chiral magnetic effect.",

In order to relate the freeze-out geometry to particle flow, the radii are also presented as a function of azimuthal angle with respect to the second-order event plane. The amplitude of the azimuthal modulation is shown as a function of centrality and flow vector magnitude $v_2$. A correlation of the source size with the local multiplicity $dN/dy^{â}$ is demonstrated.The scaling of the extracted radii with the mean number of participants is also used to compare a selection of initial-geometry models. The cross term $R_{\\mathrm{ol}}$, which couples the radial and longitudinal expansion of the source, is measured as a function of rapidity. A departure from zero is observed in the proton-going side with $4.8\\sigma$ combined significance for the most central events.",

In equilibrium, correlations diverge at the critical point leading to large event-by-event fluctuations in conserved quantities. For expanding systems like in heavy-ion collisions it is important to study the dynamical formation of long-range correlations in the critical region. The critical mode is the diffusive baryon current and can be described fluid dynamically. We include the propagation of fluctuations in the fluid dynamical equations. Using an equation of state with a critical point we study the evolution of critical fluctuations, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, in static systems to compare to known analytical results. The requirements for the emergence of non-Gaussian correlations from underlying white noise will be explored. We investigate both relativistic and nonrelativistic fluid dynamics. Finally, moving toward more realistic scenarios of heavy-ion collisions, we discuss the development of critical fluctuations in expanding systems.",

      "Abstract": "Bulk viscosity has recently been shown to play an important role in describing both photon [1] and hadron [2] observables at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Cllider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The presence of a temperature-dependent bulk viscosity in the hydrodynamical evolution of the medium modifies the development of the hydronynamic momentum anisotropy differently in the high- and low-temperature regions. Thus, anisotropic flow coefficients of hadronic observables, which are emitted predominantly from low temperatures, are affected differently by bulk viscosity than electromagnetic probes which are radiated during the entire evolution. Starting from the IP-Glasma initial conditions [1,2], we study how thermal dilepton production gets modified owing to the presence of bulk viscosity at RHIC and LHC energies. With calculations at different collision energies we can draw more robust conclusions regarding the role of bulk viscosity in high energy heavy-ion collisions. Dilepton radiation from the dilute phase of the medium will be included for the first time using the Boltzmann-transport model SMASH [3] and compared to previous hydrodynamic approaches to ascertain whether these modifications may be observable in experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] Jean-FranÃ§ois Paquet et al., Phys.

The larger prompt photon cross-section and integrated luminosity with respect to 2.76 TeV data allow for new, differential studies of photon-jet correlations.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), conditions are met to produce a hot, dense and strongly interacting medium known as the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP).  Quarks and gluons from incoming nuclei collide to produce partons at high momenta early in the collision.  By fragmenting into collimated sprays of hadrons, these partons form \"jets\".  Within the framework of perturbative QCD, jet production is well understood in pp collisions and can be used as a baseline reference for comparing to heavy ion collision systems when studying jet quenching.  One approach is to measure the azimuthal correlations of a trigger and the associated hadrons in the event.  For a jet trigger, these are known as jet-hadron correlations, while a hadron trigger leads to di-hadron correlations.  Such correlations are examined in transverse momentum bins of the trigger, transverse momentum bins of the associated hadrons, and studied as a function of collision centrality.  The correlations are expected to be sensitive to broadening and softening of the associated recoil jet due to jet quenching.  We present azimuthal jet-hadron correlations constructed from a trigger R=0.2 full (charged + neutral) jet, which is correlated with charged hadrons.  In an effort to control the path length of the recoil jet and reduce the impact of the background, jets are required to pass a leading constituent cut and are reconstructed using only high energy and momentum constituents.  We present the current status of this analysis in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV.  To further probe the path length dependence, we will also present Pb-Pb jets relative to the event plane, which include a highly robust and precise background subtraction method to remove the complex, flow dominated, heavy ion background.  The jet yields and widths will be presented for the Pb--Pb analyses and compared to our baseline measurements in pp collisions.  In addition, yields and widths for di-hadron correlations in Pb-Pb will be presented.",

In particular, extensive jet energy loss measurements have allowed unique opportunity for probing the âinternal workingâ of such plasma and for understanding the nonperturbative dynamics that underlies the confinement transition at $T_c$. Significant progress has been made recently in constructing such a microscopic model â the semi-quark-gluon-monopole plasma (sQGMP) which integrates two essential elements of confinements, i.e. the Polyakov-loop suppression of quarks/gluons and emergent magnetic monopoles. Based on sQGMP, a new comprehensive framework for simulating jet energy loss has been developed, called CUJET3.0, which (1) treats the radiative energy loss in the DGLV formalism; (2) convolutes energy loss with a bulk evolution of heavy ion collisions from the state-of-the-art viscous hydrodynamic simulation (VISHNU hydro) that is data-validated; (3) constrains the thermodynamic contents of the plasma constituents by current lattice QCD data. The CUJET3.0 simulation results have successfully passed the test of seven sets of jet quenching (leading-hadron) observables, including light hadrons' $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at AuAu 200GeV and at PbPb 2.76TeV as well as D and B mesons $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at PbPb 2.76TeV.

The hard jet structure is sensitive to the virtuality evolution of a parton in the medium, as well as the role of (de)coherent gluon emitters.

We study this picture in detail for groomed jets in heavy-ion collisions using the âsoft dropâ procedure which singles out two hard jet substructures.

Unlike viscosites themselves, field theoretical calculations of the relaxation times are hard to come by in literature, especially for the bulk relaxation time. In this work, we report two field-theoretical analyses involving the shear and the bulk relaxation time. First, by carefully examining the analytic structure of the stress-energy tensor response functions, we have been able to derive, for the first time, a Kubo formula involving both the shear and the bulk relaxation times. Second, by evaluating the Kubo formula within the massless scalar theory, we have so far been able to calculate the shear relaxation time in a simple form. We will then show how this calculation can be extended to calculate the bulk relaxation time as well.",

      "Abstract": "Hard hadrons, including heavy flavor and high $p_\\mathrm{T}$ light flavor hadrons, serve as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We establish a Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) coupled to (3+1)-D viscous hydrodynamic model that simultaneously describes the temporal evolution of both heavy and light partons inside QGP on the same footing [1]. Both quasi-elastic [2] and inelastic [3,4,5] processes are included in our LBT model for parton energy loss in the de-confined QCD medium. On the freeze-out hypersurface, the hadronization of hard partons into their corresponding color neutral bound states is calculated utilizing our hybrid fragmentation plus jet-thermal coalescence model [1,6].\r\n\r\nWithin this newly developed framework, we demonstrate that while quasi-elastic scattering leads to linear increase of parton energy loss with respect to time and is important at early time, inelastic scattering results in quadratic increase of energy loss at early time but then saturates to linear increase and dominates parton evolution at later time. With proper incorporation of the temperature and energy dependences of parton-medium interaction, we simultaneously describe heavy ($D$ and $B$ mesons) and light flavor (charged hadron) suppression, 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows for all centrality bins and all collision energies as observed from RHIC to the LHC experiments. The temperature and momentum dependences of the jet transport coefficient ($\\hat{q}$) extracted from our model to data comparison are consistent with the range previously constrained by the JET Collaboration. While $\\Delta E_g > \\Delta E_q > \\Delta E_c > \\Delta E_b$ holds in our framework, we show that such flavor hierarchy in $R_\\mathrm{AA}$ at hadron level can be modified due to the combinatory effect of initial momentum spectra, parton energy loss and fragmentation functions.\r\n\r\nWe also perform a systematic comparison for the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic flows of heavy vs. light flavor hadrons, from which the degree of heavy quark thermalization inside QGP is investigated as functions of centrality and colliding energy. $D$-hadron and $e$-hadron correlation functions are studied for the first time as well and shown to be a good observable to quantify not only the thermalization degree of heavy quarks [7] but also the medium response to the energy deposited by hard probe particles. Comparisons between our predictions and future measurements are expected to provide better insights of the interaction dynamics between hard partons and the QGP.\r\n\r\n[1] S. Cao, T. Luo, G.-Y.

      "Abstract": "Due to their large masses, heavy quarks are predominantly produced through initial hard scatterings in heavy-ion collisions and, as such, they experience the entire evolution of the hot and dense medium created in such collisions. Therefore, they can provide important insights into the properties of the strongly-coupled Quark Gluon Plasma (sQGP).  For instance, the azimuthal anisotropy of charm quarks with respect to the reaction plane over a broad momentum range can provide information on the degree of thermalization for heavy flavor quarks in the medium and the bulk properties of the system. Specifically, at low transverse momenta we can examine the bulk properties in the strongly-coupled regime. Furthermore, several models have predicted that fluctuations in the initial conditions, together with strong charm-medium interactions, could lead to a finite triangular flow $v_3$ for the $D^0$ meson, providing another handle to study the early stages of the collisions.\r\n \r\n In this talk we present the measurement of azimuthal anisotropy of $D^0$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}}= 200$ GeV with the Heavy Flavor Tracker at STAR. Compared to previously reported $D^0$ $v_2$ in minimum-bias collisions, the significance of the new result is improved by a factor of 2-4, allowing the study of the transverse momentum and centrality dependence of $D^0$ elliptic and triangular flow for the first time. The results will be compared with the measurements of other particle species and a series of model calculations. Charm quark dynamics in the sQGP medium will be discussed and the question of whether charm quarks are as thermalized as light quarks will be addressed.",

The measurements are performed over the transverse momentum range 4 <$p_{\\mathrm {T}}$< 14 GeV and over the 0-60% centrality interval. Backgrounds arising from in-flight pion and kaon decays, hadronic showers, and  mis-reconstructed muons are removed using a template-fit procedure. The heavy-flavor muon differential cross-sections and per-event yields are measured in $pp$  and Pb+Pb collisions, respectively. The nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ is observed to be independent of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ within uncertainties and to be less than unity, which indicates suppressed production of heavy flavor muons in Pb+Pb collisions. The heavy-flavor muon yield is also measured as a function of the azimuthal angle difference, $\\phi-Psi_{2}$, relative to the second-order event plane angle. Fourier coefficients associated with the $\\cos(2(\\phi-\\Psi_{2}))$ modulation, $v_2$ , are measured as a function of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$  and centrality. They vary slowly with $p_\\mathrm{T}$ and show a systematic variation with centrality that is characteristic of other $v_2$ measurements. The higher-order harmonics $v_3$ and $v_4$ are also measured.

      "Abstract": "Bottomonia are important probes of the quark-gluon plasma since they are produced at early times and propagate through the medium, mapping its evolution. They are also considered to be cleaner probes than charmonia due to the lack of regeneration even at the LHC energies. In Run 1 at the LHC, CMS was able to explore multiple measurements of the Y(nS) states in pp and PbPb collisions, down to $p_{T}$ = 0. In PbPb and pp, the production cross sections for all three Y(nS) states were measured at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeVwith the exception of the Y(3S) state, which was not observed in PbPb collisions. The suppression of the Y(1S) state was seen to depend on centrality, but not significantly on transverse momentum or rapidity. In Run 2, we have now measured the ground state to excited state ratios of Bottomonia in PbPb and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The Y(2S)/Y(1S) ratiois found to be below 1 over the full centrality range and a weak dependence is found as a function of dimuon kinematics. For the Y(3S) state, an upper limit has been obtained as a function of centrality where a Y(3S)/Y(1S) ratio compatible with 0 is observed over the full centrality range. In this talk, we will present the final CMS results on bottomonium production from Run 1, together with new Run 2 results from the high statistics PbPb data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV collected in 2015.",

      "Abstract": "Relativistic hydrodynamics is the main theoretical framework used to describe the quark-gluon plasma produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions and, possibly, proton-proton and proton-ion collisions. Therefore, understanding the physical assumptions that enter in the hydrodynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions is crucial. Especially, it is essential to elucidate the reason behind the onset of fluid-dynamical behavior at the very early stages of the collisions. \n\nIn this contribution, we investigate the onset of hydrodynamic behavior for a gas of massless particles undergoing Bjorken expansion, a proxy for the dynamical evolution of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. In this scheme, we demonstrate that the Chapman-Enskog series, i.e., a gradient expansion in the hydrodynamic variables, has zero radius of convergence and cannot be used to consistently derive relativistic hydrodynamics [1]. On the other hand, we show that the method of moments, traditionally employed to derive Israel and Stewart's theory of hydrodynamics, converges and can be used to systematically improve the applicability of fluid-dynamical theories [2]. We further discuss what are the extended theories of hydrodynamics that emerge from higher-order truncations of the method of moments and how they can help in the description of heavy ion collisions.\n\n[1] G.S.

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks are considered as valuable probes of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created in ultra-realistic heavy-ion collisions. However, the simultaneous description of the heavy meson nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ poses a significant challenge for most commonly used transport modes, especially those based on Langevin transport. We propose a generalized ansatz for the temperature and momentum dependence of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient and subsequently extract its functional form by calibrating against RHIC and LHC data utilizing a Bayesian model-to-data analysis. Using the extracted transport coefficient, our improved Langevin framework is able to simultaneously reproduce the measured $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ at both RHIC and LHC energies.\n\nThe Bayesian analysis used to extract  the transport coefficient is set up as follows: a set of input parameters, in which the temperature and momentum dependence of the transport coefficient $D_s$ is encapsulated, are evaluated via an event-by-event heavy flavor transport model. In a (2+1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamical model describes the QCD medium, heavy quarks propagate according to an improved Langevin equation that incorporates both radiative and collisional energy loss. Hadronization of heavy quarks occurs via a hybrid model of fragmentation and recombination. Those model outputs are used to train Gaussian process emulators that mimic the behavior the heavy quark transport model, and act as a fast surrogate of the transport model to interpolate across the full model parameter space. We then calibrate the model parameters on experimental data via a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Bayes' Theorem. The final results of the analysis are the posterior probability distribution of all the model parameters that contain the high likelihood parameters range  in which the model describes the data optimally. We find that the transport coefficient $D_s$ has a minimum value around critical temperature, and is comparable to lattice QCD calculation. A non-trivial momentum dependence of $D_s$ is observed as well.  With the extracted functional form of the transport coefficients, the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy quarks in different centralities at 200 GeV AuAu collisions and 2.76/5.02 TeV PbPb collisions are calculated, and observed to be consistent with the experimental data. The result of p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV is calculated and compared with experimental data.",

      "Abstract": "Magnetic monopoles are suggested to play an important role in strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) near the deconfinement temperature. Lattice studies show that near the confinement temperature, $T_c$, quark-gluon plasma (QGP) contains both electric and magnetic quasiparticles. Further studies of the behavior of these quasiparticles at and above $T_c$, such as those by Liao and Shuryak (2006-2009) and DâElia and DâAlessandro (2007-2009), found that the magnetic component of QGP forms a liquid, and that the magnetic monopoles form a Bose-Einstein condensate as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, creating the dual-superconductor proposed as a mechanism for confinement. \n\nIn this work, we conduct path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of magnetic monopoles, in order to study their behavior at temperatures at and above the confinement temperature. First, we sought to replicate the lattice results of DâAlessandro, DâElia, and Shuryak (2009) through the study of the permutation cycles of one- and two-component plasmas of bosons interacting with a Coulomb potential. We found for the two-component plasma, as they did on the lattice, that as the system approaches $T_c$ from above the exponential suppression of permutation cycles of these bosons decreases before disappearing at $T_c$, indicating a phase transition. \n\nWe then study thermodynamics and physical distribution of magnetic monopoles, using the densities and coupling strengths given by DâAlessandro and DâElia (2007); and Liao and Shuryak (2009). At low temperatures, in addition to the formation of the condensate, we see formation of âdropletsâ of the magnetic charges at strong coupling. This suggesting that the monopoles are indeed forming a liquid, as seen by Liao and Shuryak in their classical molecular dynamics simulations. At low temperatures and large couplings, there are also signs of crystallization in this system, an interesting analog to systems of extremely high density, such as helium white dwarf stars. We then simulate the system at higher temperatures â along lower densities and strong coupling â and see the breakup of these drops of monopole âliquid.â Finally, we draw conclusions about the contribution of the monopoles to the overall thermodynamics of the QGP above the confinement temperature.",

The difference in $B_2$ for deuteron and anti-deuteron indicate the residual isospin brought in at the beginning of the collisions. The values of $B_2$ are found to decrease with increasing collision energy.

This upgrade will allow ALICE to access new levels of sensitivity for untriggered processes.  The present TPC is limited to recording minimum bias lead-lead collisions at a rate of about 1000 Hz.  The upgrade will allow recording the full expected lead-lead collision rate of 50 kHz.\nThe present ALICE TPC uses multi-wire proportional (MWPC) chambers for readout. A gating grid is used to block positive ions created at the anode wires from flowing back into the main drift volume creating track distortions.  The gating grid has an intrinsic dead time that limits the maximum collision rate that can be recorded.  The goal of this upgrade is to replace the MWPCs and gating grid with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) arranged in a configuration that allows one to maintain the spatial and energy resolution of the present TPC. The electronics will be replaced with continuous readout electronics based on a new purpose designed chip.  The project involves building 80 quadruple-GEM chambers (72 installed in the TPC plus 4 spares) utilizing 640 GEM foils.  In order to accomplish such a large project the design, construction, quality assurance and testing are divided across many institutions and countries.\nThe motivation for the technology choices, status of the project, construction methods, quality assurance and testing procedures for the GEM foils and new readout chambers will be presented.  Results from testing GEM foils, first chambers and readout electronics also will be presented.",

In order to understand precisely how the jets are modified, it is important to measure how the jet momentum is carried by its fragmentation products. The longitudinal momentum fraction of charged particles in jets from Pb+Pb, p+Pb, and p+p collisions have been measured using the ATLAS detector. Proton-proton and p+Pb collisions provide necessary baseline measurements for quantifying the modifications in  Pb+Pb collisions.  In Run 1, ATLAS collected samples of p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at a center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV and a sample of p+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. In Run 2, large samples of p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV have been collected providing a complete set of collision systems at 5.02 TeV. In this talk, we present the status of fragmentation function measurements at 5.02 TeV in the context of detailed studies of the fragmentation in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV.",

      "Abstract": "The thermal suppression of heavy quark bound states represents an ideal observable for determining if one has produced a quark gluon plasma in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. In recent years, however, a paradigm shift has taken place in the theory of quarkonium suppression due to new first principles calculations of the thermal widths of these states. These thermal widths are large, eg O(20-100 MeV) for the Upsilon, and cause in-medium suppression of the states at temperatures below their traditionally defined disassociation temperatures. In order to apply the newly developed understanding to phenomenology, however, one must make detailed 3+1d dissipative hydrodynamical models of the plasma including the effects of finite shear viscosity. These effects include not only the modification of the time evolution of the temperature of the system, flow, etc., but also the emergence of potentially large local momentum-space anisotropies which can affect the in-medium properties of the states. I will discuss the setup for these model calculations and present comparisons of theory with data from RHIC 200 GeV/nucleon Au-Au collisions, LHC 2.76 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb, and LHC 5.023 TeV/nucleon Pb-Pb collisions as a function of number of participants, rapidity, and transverse momentum.",

These new observables add constraints to theoretical models and probe aspects of the system that are independent of the traditional single-harmonic measurements such as 2-and multi-particle cumulants $v_n\\{m\\}$. Many of these new observables have not yet been measured at RHIC, leaving an opportunity to make predictions as a test of models across energies. We make predictions using NeXSPheRIO, a hydrodynamical model which has accurately reproduced a large set of single-harmonic correlations in a large range of transverse momenta and centralities at RHIC. Our predictions thus provide an important baseline for comparison to correlations of flow harmonics, which contain nontrivial information about the initial state as well as QGP transport properties. We also point out\nsignificant biases that can appear when using wide centrality bins and non-trivial event weighting, necessitating care in performing experimental analyses and in comparing  theoretical calculations to these measurements.",

Comparing particle production between Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions to pp collisions as a reference over a wide pseudorapidity range provides insight into the longitudinal (and low-x) nature of the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions.\n\nStudies from pp collisions at various energies show that the width of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density distribution increases with increasing collision energy. This underlines the importance of investigating the system size dependence of the particle production at the same collision energy. The approximate linearity versus Î· that is found in the ratio of the pseudorapidity density distributions of the different systems indicates a coherent particle production throughout the longitudinal extent of the collision region, while the dependence on pseudorapidity may reflect underlying mechanisms, for example colour fluctuations or Colour-Glass Condensate initial conditions.",

      "Abstract": "The modifications of jets in heavy-ion collisions are manifest in many measurements. However, inclusive observables are generally susceptible to the quantum mechanical nature of interactions of the jet fragments with the medium. We argue that contemporary jet substructure techniques facilitate a more direct measurement of the radiative mechanism caused by medium interactions. As a concrete example, we focus on jet grooming using the âsoft dropâ procedure that singles out the two leading jet substructures with largest angular separation inside an energetic jet. The interplay between hard, quasi-collinear vacuum or medium-induced radiation within the reconstructed cone and soft, large-angle emissions that are responsible for out-of-cone energy flow is studied. We find an enhancement of the splitting function at small energy-fractions which is attributed to rare, relatively hard medium-induced gluon radiation affected by LPM interference with the quark-gluon plasma.",

Studies of flow harmonics using the same order event plane have been used to extract the transport properties of the hot and dense medium produced in the collisions and to explore initial state effects. The mixed higher-order harmonics have been proposed to have strong sensitivity to the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio ($\\eta$/s) of the medium. In this talk, for the first time, the $v_{5}$ and $v_{7}$ are measured with respect to the second and third order planes. With the nonlinear component of the flow harmonics extracted based on lower order event planes, the nonlinear response coefficients for n=4, 5, 6, 7 are also presented. The mixed harmonic coefficients are studied as a function of charged particle transverse momentum and collision centrality at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector. It is found that the nonlinear response coefficients for the odd flow harmonics are larger than for the even harmonics, reflecting a stronger contributions of the nonlinear part for odd harmonics.

      "Abstract": "When high-energy partons traversing a quark-gluon plasma lose energy via bremsstrahlung or pair production, the quantum duration of that splitting process is known as the formation time.  For high energy, the formation time exceeds the mean free time for collisions with the medium, leading to a significant reduction in the splitting rate: the LPM effect.  But there are interesting and potentially important corrections to the usual treatment of the LPM effect that arise from situations where the formation times of two consecutive splittings overlap each other, and various attempts have been made over the years to account for these effects.  I will summarize recent research on computing the effect of overlapping formation times, while avoiding soft-bremsstrahlung assumptions that have been used in some of the (very interesting) theoretical work of the last few years.  I will also explain the bottom line of why finding the size of these effects has potentially important conceptual implications for the Monte Carlo treatment of in-medium splitting of high-energy partons.",

Multi-particle azimuthal correlation techniques can be utilized to disentangle the contribution from collective and non-flow process involved in the dynamical evolution of heavy-ion reactions. At low energies v1 and v2, related to directed and elliptic flow, have been measured for pions, charged kaons, protons, neutrons and fragments at the BEVALAC and SIS18, but so far high-order harmonics have not been studied.

Our quark matter at zero temperature is in the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase with the gap of 100-200 MeV. The latter is significantly constrained by the two-solar mass constraint. Applying a schematic quark model for the nB > 5n0 domain, we constrain the possible range of the model parameters, and then use them to calculate various quantities of NG modes. Our predictions differ from the weak coupling results for the CFL because we are treating the strongly correlated domain. The resulting equations of state are like neither gapless quark nor nuclear equations of state, due to different temperature dependence of thermal contributions.

      "Abstract": "We report measurement of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) hadron trigger, for p--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =5.02$ TeV that have been classified by event activity. This coincidence observable is calculable perturbatively in vacuum, and has previously been measured in pp and Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC, providing a new probe to measure quenching. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks using the anti-kT algorithm with low IR cutoff of jet constituents ($p_T^{track}>0.2$ GeV/c). The analysis applies a data-driven statistical approach to correct the complex uncorrelated jet background, including multi-partonic interactions. Recoil jet distributions are reported for $15 < p_{Tjet} <50$ GeV/c, for R=0.2 and 0.4. Events are classified by signal in the ALICE V0A detector, which measures forward multiplicity, and ZNA, which measures the number of neutrons at zero degrees.  The semi-inclusive observable corresponds to the ratio of inclusive cross sections, $d\\sigma^\\mathrm{h_{trig}+jet}/\\sigma^\\mathrm{h_{trig}}$, and comparison of the recoil jet yield in p--Pb collisions with different event activity therefore does not require knowledge of $T_\\mathrm{pPb}$, thereby avoiding the need for geometric modelling. We compare the trigger-normalized recoil jet yield for p--Pb collisions with different event activity to measure the effects of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC.",

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "Dijet, dihadron, hadron-jet angular correlations have been reckoned as important probes of the transverse momentum broadening effects in relativistic nuclear collisions [1]. When a pair of high-energy jets created in hard collisions traverse the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions, they become de-correlated due to the vacuum soft gluon radiation associated with the Sudakov logarithms and the medium-induced transverse momentum broadening [2, 3]. For the first time, we employ the systematical resummation formalism and establish a baseline calculation to describe the dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data in $pp$ and peripheral $AA$ collisions where the medium effect is negligible. We demonstrate that the medium effects, especially the so-called jet quenching parameter $\\hat q$, can be extracted from the angular de-correlations observed in $AA$ collisions. A global $\\chi^2$ analysis of dihadron and hadron-jet angular correlation data renders the best fit $\\langle \\hat q L\\rangle_{\\textrm{tot}} \\sim 14 \\textrm{GeV}^2$ for a quark jet at RHIC top energy, with $L$ the typical traversed medium length. Our approach [1] stands as a new and complimentary method for the extraction of the jet quenching parameter $\\hat{q}$ as compared to the JET Collaboration effort [4]. Further experimental and theoretical efforts along the direction of this work shall significantly advance the quantitative understanding of transverse momentum broadening and help us acquire unprecedented knowledge of jet quenching parameter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1].

Comparison of these two jet shapes in Pb-Pb and pp collisions highlights the role of coherence effects on jet quenching, in the presence of the QGP medium, by separating two-pronged jets from the rest of the jet population. Coherence effects relate to the ability of the medium to resolve a jet's substructure, which has an impact on the energy loss magnitude and mechanism of the traversing jet. In both collision systems charged jets are found with the anti-$k_t$ algorithm, a resolution parameter of R = 0.4 and a constituent cut off of 0.15 GeV. The reclustering algorithm used to obtain the hardest splitting is the exclusive-$k_t$ algorithm. This analysis uses hadron-jet coincidence techniques in Pb-Pb collisions to reject the combinatorial background and further corrects for background effects by employing various jet shape subtraction techniques and unfolding. Measurements of the Nsubjettiness for jet momenta of $20 - 60$ GeV/c in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7.00 TeV will be presented and compared to PYTHIA simulations.",

      "Abstract": "Despite intense theoretical and experimental investigation, the physical mechanisms governing the suppression of bound quark-antiquark states in nuclear collisions are not yet fully understood.  While color screening in a plasma phase is expected to play a role, there are numerous other possible suppression mechanisms that do not require deconfinement, as well as effects on the heavy quark initial state in the nucleus which can also play a role.  To study these effects, the PHENIX collaboration has used the flexibility of the RHIC accelerator complex to observe the evolution of open heavy flavor and quarkonia dynamics as both the projectile and target nuclei size are varied.  Open heavy flavor in small collision systems can serve as the baseline for interpreting quarkonia production in the nuclear environment, and comparisons of the $\\psi(2S)$ with the $J/\\psi$ show that in rapidity regions with relatively high hadron density, the larger $2S$ state is preferentially more suppressed than the more tightly bound $J/\\psi$.  This suggests that late-stage mechanisms may be at least partially responsible for quarkonia suppression in nuclear collisions.  In this talk, we will present results on excited-state quarkonia in $p+p$, $p$+Al, and $p$/$d$/$^3$He+Au collisions and open heavy flavor in small systems, and discuss how these measurements impact our understanding of heavy quark behavior in the quark-gluon plasma.",

Experimental observation of CME is of great interest and significant efforts have been made to look for signals of CME in heavy ion collisions. Encouraging evidence of CME-induced charge separation has been reported from both RHIC and LHC, albeit with ambiguity due to potential background contributions. Crucial for addressing such issue, is need of quantitative predictions of CME signal with sophisticated modeling tool. \n\n\nIn this talk we report a recently developed Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD) framework, which simulates the evolution of fermion currents in QGP on top of the data-validated VISHNew bulk hydro evolution. With realistic initial conditions and magnetic field lifetime, the predicted CME signal is quantitatively consistent with measured change separation data in 200GeV AuAu collisions. We further develop the event-by-event AVFD simulations that directly compute CME-induced two-particle correlations as well as the non-CME background. Finally we report predictions for the upcoming isobaric (RuRu v.s. ZrZr ) collisions that could provide the critical test of the CME in heavy ion collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Significant progress has been made in the past few years in determining QGP properties, such as the temperature dependence of shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\\eta/s$. However, $\\eta/s$ might depend also on the baryochemical potential $\\mu_B$, as has been hinted at in a recent beam energy scan study [1].\r\n\r\nIt is generally difficult to determine the uncertainties associated with the extracted values of QGP properties, as the computational models used in the analysis typically have numerous interconnected parameters. We utilize novel optimization techniques based on Bayesian statistics and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to calibrate the computational model to data. The end result of such an analysis is a conditional probability distribution, which provides a set of data-calibrated parameter values with a full uncertainty quantification. Gaussian process emulators are also used in the analysis to overcome its significant computational expense and predict model results for all needed input parameter combinations. These statistical methods have already been applied with great success to Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [2].\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we investigate the $\\mu_B$ dependence of $\\eta/s$, with collision energy as the control parameter, by performing a Bayesian analysis on RHIC beam energy scan data, applying the same UrQMD + viscous hydrodynamics hybrid model as in [1], to verify if the reported differences between the energies remain significant even when uncertainties are included. We determine the probability distributions for the model parameters for Au+Au collisions at $19.6$, $39$, and $62.4$ GeV; the results indicate that while the uncertainty on the optimal value of $\\eta/s$ does increase at lower collision energies, the probability for a large value of the ratio is much higher at $19.6$ GeV with the median value $0.24$, compared to $62.4$ GeV with median value $0.07$ [3]. Moreover, we also find that multi-strange hadron yields provide significant constraints on the switching condition between the hydrodynamic evolution and the hadron transport afterburner and thus are essential for a proper model-to-data comparison [4].\r\n\r\n[1] Iu.

Additionally, studies of several interesting observables during the BES, including v1 of protons and lambdas, v2 of identified hadrons, and net-proton higher moments, show interesting behavior below 20 GeV and could suggest a transition to a hadron dominated regime. Data from energies lower than 7 GeV could help determine whether these behaviors are indicative of phase transitions or criticality. The goal of the STAR Fixed-Target Program is to extend the collision energy range in BES-II with the same detector to lower energies than is feasible at RHIC with colliding beams. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we present results from STARâs first dedicated fixed-target test run conducted in 2015 with Au + Au collisions at â(s_NN )=4.5 GeV. Direct flow of protons, elliptic flow of identified hadrons, HBT radii, as well as pion, proton, kaon, K_S^{0}, and lambda spectra are compared with previous results from the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). These results demonstrate that STAR has good event reconstruction and particle identification capabilities for this fixed-target configuration even though it was optimized for colliding beams in the center of the detector. The implications of these results on future STAR fixed-target physics runs are discussed.",

      "Abstract": "Strangeness production in heavy-ion collision at energies below the free NN production threshold is an excellent tool to study medium properties of dense baryonic systems. For the first time, a nearly complete set of strange particles has been reconstructed in the 40% most central Au+Au collisions at $1.23 A$ GeV. The data sample includes multi-differential representations of charged and neutral Kaons, Lambdas and Phi-mesons. The multiplicities, together with those for non-strange hadrons, have been analyzed in the context of statistical hadronization models. Overall, a good fit is obtained if an additional parameter ($R_c$) is used to account for canonical strangeness suppression. We find that about 30 % of observed $K^-$ are produced through Phi-decay. If we correct the observed $K^-$ transverse momentum spectra for feed down from $\\phi$ decay, all extracted slope parameters also support the assumption of a homogenous emission source for all particle types.",

      "Abstract": "The quark-gluon matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions may contain local domains in which P and CP symmetries are not preserved. When coupled with an external magnetic field, such P- and CP-odd domains will generate electric currents along the magnetic field --- a phenomenon called the chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, the STAR Collaboration at RHIC and the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC released data of charge-dependent azimuthal-angle correlators with features consistent with the CME expectation. However, the experimental observable is contaminated with significant background contributions from elliptic-flow-driven effects, which makes the interpretation of the data ambiguous. In this Letter, we show that the collisions of isobaric nuclei, $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr, provide an ideal tool to disentangle the CME signal from the background effects. Our simulation demonstrates that the two collision types at 200 GeV have more than 10% difference in the CME signal\r\nand less than 2% difference in the elliptic-flow-driven backgrounds for the centrality range of 20-60\\%.",

      "Abstract": "Local momentum anisotropies are large in the early stages of the quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, due to the extreme difference in the initial longitudinal and transverse expansion rates. In such situations, fluid dynamics derived from an expansion around an isotropic local equilibrium state is bound to break down. Instead, we resum the effects of the slowest nonhydrodynamic degree of freedom (associated with the deviation from momentum isotropy) and include it at leading order, defining a local anisotropic quasi-equilibrium state, thereby treating the longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy nonperturbatively. Perturbative transport equations are then derived to deal with the remaining residual momentum anisotropies [1]. This procedure yields a complete transient effective theory called viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics [1,2]. \r\n\r\nThe anisotropic hydrodynamic approach, especially after perturbative inclusion all residual viscous terms, has been shown to dramatically outperform viscous hydrodynamics in several simplified situations for which exact solutions exist but which share with realistic expansion scenarios the problem of large dissipative currents [1,3,4]. We will discuss the present status of applying viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics to the phenomenological description of the quark-gluon plasma in realistic expansion scenarios. To satisfy the high-performance needs of the JETSCAPE Collaboration, standard [5] and anisotropic viscous hydrodynamics algorithms were implemented on graphical processing units (GPU), leading to a 100-fold speed-up. Results from these accelerated 3+1-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic simulations for event-by-event fluctuating initial conditions will be compared between the standard and anisotropic frameworks and with experimental data.\r\n\r\n[1] D.

      "Abstract": "In this work we describe the dynamics of a highly anisotropic system undergoing a boost-invariant longitudinal and azimuthally symmetric radial expansion (Gubser flow) for arbitrary shear viscosity to entropy density ratio. We derive the equations of motion of dissipative anisotropic hydrodynamics by considering the moments method recently derived by Molnar et al. (MNR), Phys. Rev. D 93, 114025 (2016)  and arXiv:1606.09019, based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic one-particle distribution function. In order to close the conservation laws, it is needed to choose an additional moment of the Boltzmann equation. This is achieved by selecting the relaxation equation for the longitudinal pressure with a suitable Landau matching condition. As a result one obtains two coupled differential equations for the energy density and the longitudinal pressure which respect the $SO(3)_q \\otimes SO(1,1) \\otimes Z_2$ symmetry of the Gubser flow in the deSitter space. These equations are solved numerically and compared with the predictions of the recently found exact solution of the relaxation-time-approximation Boltzmann equation subject to the same flow. We also compare our numerical results with other fluid dynamical models. We observe that the MNR description of anisotropic fluid dynamics describes better the space-time evolution of the system than all currently known hydrodynamical approaches.",

      "Abstract": "While small at very high temperature, the bulk viscosity of quantum chromodynamics is expected to grow in the confinement region. Although its precise magnitude and temperature-dependence in the cross-over region is not fully understood, recent theoretical and phenomenological studies [1-5] provided evidence that the bulk viscosity can be sufficiently large to have measurable consequences on the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma. In this work, a Bayesian statistical analysis is used to establish probabilistic constraints on the temperature-dependence of bulk viscosity using combined hadronic measurements from RHIC and the LHC. IP-Glasma initial conditions are used to provide realistic event-by-event fluctuations, which are understood to have an important interplay with bulk viscosity. The width of the peak of bulk viscosity, along with the position of the peak in the transition region, are investigated phenomenologically for the first time. A lower but wider peak than the parametrization used in [3-5] is found to be preferred. Constraints on the position of the peak are found to be limited, with tension observed between the values favoured by RHIC and LHC measurements. The relative effect of shear and bulk viscosities on hadronic observables, in particular momentum anisotropies, is investigated.\n\n[1] Karsch, F., Kharzeev, D. and Tuchin, K. (2008) Phys. Lett.

An important early finding at RHIC was that hydrodynamic calculations can account for the measured anisotropy at low $p_{T}$ and relate them to the collision geometry. At higher $p_{T}$, where hard processes are dominant, energy loss of partons traversing the QGP also creates an azimuthal anisotropy in the final-state hadrons which is related to the collision geometry. In order to better understand the interplay between the soft and hard processes, PHENIX measured the charged-hadron $v_{n}$ coefficients over a wide $p_{T}$ range (up to 10 GeV/$c$) as a function of centrality and beam energy.    \nIn this talk, we will present new $v_{2}$ measurements for charged hadrons in 200 GeV Au+Au collisions as a function of $p_T$ and centrality and compare them to those from $\\pi^{0}$ mesons.

In addition to the single particle spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients $v_n$, we study event-plane correlations, non-linear response coefficients $\\chi_n$, and flow factorization breaking ratios $r_n$, which were presented for the first time in the IP-Glasma framework.  Furthermore, we investigate event shape engineering as well higher flow harmonics such as $v_5$, $v_6$, and $v_7$, which were recently measured at 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS collaboration. Taken together, these observables provide a wealth of insight into the collective behavior of the QGP and initial state fluctuations. These quantities shed light on flow correlations in different $p_{T}$ ranges, flow at fixed system size but different initial geometries, as well as the non-linear hydrodynamic response to the initial state energy anisotropy. By synthesizing this information we can gain further insight into the transport properties of the QGP as well as the fluctuation spectrum of the initial state. Finally, we examine the effect of pre-equilibrium longitudinal flow, which has previously been neglected in phenomenological studies, such as the hadron and direct photon spectra and $v_n$.\r\n\r\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\r\n\r\n\\bibitem{1609.02958}\r\n\r\nScott McDonald, Chun Shen, Francois Fillion-Gourdeau, Sangyong Jeon and Charles Gale.\r\n\\newblock Hydrodynamic Predictions for Pb+Pb Collisions at 5.02 A TeV, 2016;\r\n\\newblock arXiv:1609.02958.\r\n\r\n\\end{thebibliography}",

We find that an apparent decrease of $v_3$ with pseudorapidity in traditional measurements is not, in fact, a dependence on $\\eta$, which is negligible within the TPC acceptance, but instead is a dependence on relative pseudorapidity due to a lack of perfect correlation between $v_3$ at different rapidities.   We also observe short-range correlations, due to rapidity dependent fluctuations in the initial condition.  While the short-range correlation is slightly smaller in both magnitude and range, it serves as a demonstration that short-range correlations are not necessarily generated only by non-flow sources such as jets, but can have a significant contribution from purely hydrodynamic effects.",

However, other scenarios are also possible and may provide alternative explanations for the experimental results. New measurements of elliptic ($v_{2}$) and triangular ($v_{3}$) flow for positive and negative charged particles as a function of $A_{ch}$ in pPb and PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV are presented, using data collected by the CMS experiment during the LHC runs 1 and 2. The slopes and intercepts of the charged-dependent $v_{n}$ harmonics vs. $A_{ch}$ are directly compared for pPb and PbPb collisions with similar charged-particle multiplicities, where a strong CMW effect is not expected in very high multiplicity pPb events. Moreover, a comparison is made of the slope parameters between $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ harmonics normalized by the inclusive charge particle $v_{n}$ in PbPb collisions as a function of centrality. These results provide a means to discriminate between the CMW and other scenarios such as local charge conservation as possible explanations for the observed charge dependent behavior.",

The dielectron continuum is extremely rich in physics sources: on top of ordinary Dalitz and resonance decays of pseudoscalar and vector mesons, thermal black-body radiation is of particular interest as it carries information about the temperature of the hot and dense system created in such collisions. Dielectron invariant-mass distribution is furthermore sensitive to medium modifications of the spectral function of short-lived vector mesons that are linked to the potential restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperatures. Correlated electron pairs from semi-leptonic charm and beauty decays provide complementary information about the heavy-quark energy loss.\n\nIn this talk, we will present an extensive summary of the LHC Run-1 results in all three collisions systems: pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb, the former two providing crucial vacuum and cold-nuclear matter references for the latter. Furthermore, we will discuss the status of the ongoing Run-2 pp and Pb-Pb analyses with a focus on pp collisions collected with a trigger on high charged-particle multiplicities and conclude with an outlook for future measurements in Run-3 following the ALICE detector upgrades during the second long shutdown phase.",

      "Abstract": "The chiral magnetic effect (CME) and the chiral vortical effect (CVE)\nhave been under intensive theoretical and experimental investigations in\nrecent years [1]. A three-point correlator, Î³ [2], has been used to measure electric/baryonic charge separations across the reaction plane as the\nexperimental manifestation of the CME/CVE. Considerable background\nsources arising from charge/momentum conservation coupled with elliptic\nflow anisotropy (v2) have been identified. Disentanglement of background\nand the possible CME/CVE signal has been the central focal point of theoretical and experimental efforts. We report recent progresses from the\nSTAR experiment in searching for the CME/CVE with identified particles\nusing background suppression methods. The Î³ correlator measurements\nof ÏâÏ, ÏâK, pâÏ, KâK, pâK, pâp, pâÎ pairs are presented as a\nfunction of centrality and beam energy in Au+Au collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\n= 7.7 to 200 GeV. We explore the range of background variations to establish where a signal may exist. We use event-shape engineering [3] as well as mixed-event subtraction as a function of the event-by-event elliptic anisotropy [4,5] to reduce the flow background. In addition, preliminary results of small system 200 GeV d+Au collisions will also be discussed. These measurements will represent a major advance in our understanding of possible CME/CVE contributions to the three-point correlation.\n \n[1] Kharzeev, D.E. et al. Prog. Part. Nucl.

      "Abstract": "Recently, theoretical and experimental studies of flow and multiplicity correlations in the longitudinal direction in heavy ion collision have revealed a rich dynamics not probed by traditional measurements that focused only on the transverse direction. Event-by-event longitudinal fluctuations in the initial conditions are expected to result in a strong asymmetry in particle multiplicities at forward and backward (FB) rapidities. In this talk, FB multiplicity correlations are measured in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb  collisions, with a data-driven method utilized to separate long-range FB correlations (LRC) and short-range correlations (SRC). The magnitude of the LRC reveals a significant FB multiplicity asymmetry, quantified by its slope in pseudorapidity $a_1$, which decreases with increasing multiplicity and is similar in magnitude across the three collision systems. The measured correlation in $pp$ collisions is compared in detail with expectations from the PYTHIA 8 and EPOS-LHC models.  Both models significantly underpredict the measured $a_1$ values (by a factor of two), and PYTHIA 8 is found to significantly overpredict the magnitude of the SRC, even though both of these models were tuned to reproduce the total charged particle multiplicity distributions out to $N_{ch}$~120.  These findings imply that the measurement of FB multiplicity correlations provides supplementary constraints on multi-particle production mechanisms, including restricting the number of independent sources in $pp$, $p$+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions.",

      "Abstract": "Azimuthally differential femtoscopic measurements, being sensitive to spatio-temporal characteristics of the source as well as to the collective velocity fields at freeze-out, provide very important information on the nature and dynamics of the system evolution. While the HBT radii modulations with respect to the second harmonic event plane reflect mostly the spatial geometry of the source, the third harmonic results are mostly defined by the system dynamics. Radii variations with respect to the third harmonic event plane unambiguously signal a collective expansion and anisotropy in the flow fields. Strong fluctuations in the initial geometry of the system lead to fluctuations in the anisotropic flow as well as the shape of the pion source at freeze-out. Event shape engineering (ESE) is a technique proposed to select events corresponding to a particular shape. Azimuthally differential HBT combined with ESE allows for a detailed analysis of the relation between initial geometry, anisotropic flow and the deformation of source shape.\n\nIn this talk, we present azimuthally differential pion femtoscopy with respect to second and third harmonic event planes as a function of the pion transverse momentum for different collision centralities. Our results on the dependence of the side-, out-, and long-radii on the pion emission angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane qualitatively agree with theoretical calculations, but the details show significant deviations. The final-state source eccentricity, estimated via side radius oscillations is found to be significantly smaller than the initial state source eccentricity. While the final-state source eccentricity for the second harmonic event plane remains positive in all centralities, the third harmonic event plane eccentricity becomes negative. All these results are compared to existing models. The effect of the selection of the events with high/low elliptic and/or triangular flow is also presented.",

Due to spin-vorticity coupling, the spin polarization density is proportional to the local fluid vorticity at the next-to-leading order of a gradient expansion in a quantum kinetic theory. As a result of strong collective flow, the spatial distribution of local vorticity on the freeze-out hypersurface converts to Lambda spins with intrinsic azimuthal angle distribution and correlation at RHIC and LHC energy. The azimuthal correlation of the transverse spin is shown to have a cosine form plus an offset due to a circular structure of the transverse vorticity around the beam direction and global angular momentum in non-central collisions. The longitudinal spin correlation shows a structure of vortex-pairing in the transverse plane due to the convective flow of hot spots in the radial direction. The dependence on colliding energy, rapidity, centrality and sensitivity to the shear viscosity are also investigated.",

      "Abstract": "The QCD phase diagram has been explored in the high temperature side at RHIC and LHC, while the high density side is barely explored. Systematic studies of the QCD matter from Bevalac to LHC energies have suggested that the highest density QCD matter can be reached around the AGS energies (sqrt(s_{NN})=~5-GeV) where a rich production of strange hadrons is expected.\r\n \r\nThe future heavy-ion program at J-PARC (J-PARC-HI) is focused to explore such a highest density QCD matter. The J-PARC-HI will accelerate ions up to Uranium with the cms energy of sqrt(s_{NN})=2-6.2-GeV at the beam rate up to 1.0e+11 ions per cycle, five orders of magnitude higher than that of AGS. We could reach as 8-10 times higher density as the normal nuclear matter with the Uranium ions. The heavy-ion acceleration scheme consists of a new linac and a booster as the injector, followed by the existing 3-GeV Rapid-Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) and 50-GeV Main Ring (MR). The booster design is much advanced since last year by a new charge exchange injection scheme and multi-charge state acceptance.\r\n \r\nTaking advantage of the very high intensity beam, we introduce new event selection quantities, such as strangity (strange hadron fraction) and baryonity (net baryons), on top of the conventional centrality variable, which would exclusively select high-density matter events. We will then primarily measure the probes that were not measured at AGS, namely, electromagnetic probes (photons and lepton pairs), higher-order flow of particles and the fluctuation of conserved charges such as net-baryons. We will also perform systematic measurement of conventional hadronic observables.\r\n \r\nA large acceptance heavy-ion spectrometer based on a Toroidal magnet has been designed for the high density QCD matter study. We will show the updated acceleration scheme as well as the detector performance and expected physics result.\r\n \r\nA search for the exotic hadrons and nuclei such as dibaryons, kaonic nuclei, and measure hypernuclei is also possible at this cms energy. We will also discuss about this measurement.",

The rates of dilepton production depend in general on four independent spectral functions, corresponding to two transverse polarizations, one longitudinal polarization, and -- in plasmas in which the anisotropy is not invariant under parity in the local rest frame of the matter -- a new spectral function, $\\rho_n$, related to the anisotropy direction in the collision.  The anisotropy appears in the difference of the two transverse spectral functions, as well as in $\\rho_n$.

      "Country": "Japan",
      "Abstract": "We discuss photon emission at the stage of hadronization as a possible resolution to the direct-photon puzzle. In an ordinary plasma, it is well known that photon emission occurs when a plasma goes back to a normal state through recombination processes such as $e^- + p^+ \\to H + \\gamma$ for an electron-proton plasma. This is called the âradiative recombinationâ. A similar process should take place when a QGP hadronizes. For example, meson formation from a quark and an antiquark will be accompanied by photon emission $q + \\bar q \\to meson + \\gamma$ to compensate the energy difference between the initial and final states. \r\n\r\nIn order to compute the number of photons emitted at hadronization, we employ the ârecombination modelâ developed by the Duke group. There, the number of produced hadrons is computed under the assumption that coalescence of valence (anti)quarks just occurs without emission of additional particles, which surely violates energy and entropy conservation. With the photon emission added in this coalescence process, however, energy and entropy can be made conserved. We reinterpret the production formula of hadrons in the original recombination model as that of artificial âresonant statesâ whose invariant masses are not necessarily equal to the masses of any physical hadrons. We further assume that the âresonant stateâ decays into a physical hadron and a photon. \r\n\r\nThis âimprovedâ recombination model has a potential to resolve the direct-photon puzzle: (1) a larger yield of photons since we add photon production at hadronization, which has been overlooked so far, and (2) radiated photons flow similarly as hadrons because photons are emitted in a collimated way with the resonant state's motion. Moreover, the pt distribution of emitted photons mimics thermal distribution whose effective temperature is essentially given by blue-shifted quarkâs temperature and thus becomes much higher than critical temperature.",

The larger temperature could entail novel features, like e.g. abundant in-medium production of charm quarks. The latter could determine an increase in the number of degrees of freedom of the QGP and provide a new tool to study its temperature evolution. New, rarer, hard probes would be available, like boosted top quarks, which could give access to the time-evolution of the medium opacity. \n\nThe physics of high gluon densities at small Bjorken-$x$ and the onset of saturation can be studied using pA, AA, and $\\gamma$A collisions.

Measuring the cross section differentially in transverse momentum transfer makes it possible to determine the transverse density profile (via coherent diffraction) and density fluctuations (incoherent diffraction) of the target hadron. This knowledge about the geometric fluctuations of the proton is particularly important for understanding collective phenomena observed in proton-nucleus collisions.\r\n\r\nWe calculate coherent and incoherent diffractive vector meson production in photon-proton scattering at high energy.  We demonstrate that incoherent gamma-p scattering is sensitive to sub-nucleon scale fluctuations, and show that the effect of geometric fluctuations can be disentangled from saturation scale fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThe Bjorken-x (or energy) evolution of the fluctuations is studied by solving the JIMWLK evolution equation. In particular, we study the energy evolution of the diffractive cross section. This is particularly interesting, as the ALICE collaboration has recently observed the disappearance of the incoherent contribution to the diffractive cross section in ultraperipheral p+A collisions at high energies, which suggests that the proton gets smoother at small x.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuating proton, constrained by the HERA data, is then used as input for hydrodynamic calculations of azimuthal anisotropy coefficients in proton-nucleus collisions, which we show to be sensitive to initial state geometric fluctuations.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nH.

      "Abstract": "The study of particle production in proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions provides essential\r\ninformation about high-density effects (like gluon saturation) in the nuclear wavefunction and offers a benchmark for the corresponding studies in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The cross-sections for particle production in $pA$ can in principle be computed within perturbative QCD, using the framework of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC). However, recent efforts trying to extend such calculations beyond the leading-order (LO)\r\napproximation met with an unexpected difficulty: the next-to-leading order (NLO) prediction for the hadron multiplicity suddenly turns negative at transverse momenta of the order of a few GeV, in a range where perturbation theory was expected to be reliable.\r\nThis problem triggered much interest and several studies over the last 5 years, but not satisfactory solution has emerged. \r\n\r\nIn a recent publication [1], we have revisited the previous proposals for the CGC \r\nfactorization at NLO and identified the source of the negativity problem: this is related\r\nto the subtraction method used to separate LO from NLO contributions. To overcome this difficulty, we proposed a new factorization scheme which involves no such a subtraction: the relevant, LO or NLO, perturbative contributions are included once and only once. We have thus obtained a manifestly positive expression for the cross-section for hadron multiplicities in $pA$. On this occasion, we have also extended the resummation program that we recently proposed [2] for the BK and JIMWLK evolution equations to the calculation of cross-sections. Besides its phenomenological implications, this new factorization scheme should provide a better framework for computing particle production in QCD at high energy.\r\n\r\n[1] \t``CGC factorization for forward particle production in proton-nucleus collisions at next-to-leading order,'' E.

The ALICE collaboration has published measurements of UPC J/Psi and psi(2S) production in LHC Run 1 at forward (J/psi) and mid-rapidity, and has obtained a substantially larger data set in 2015 from LHC Run 2, allowing much more detailed studies of the production mechanism to be performed. In particular, the increased energy and more detailed measurements in the forward region in Run 2 give access to significantly lower values of Bjorken-x than in previous studies.

The absolute rates of single and multiple neutron emission into one or both zero-degree calorimeters (ZDCs) will be presented, to test theoretical predictions for the photon fluxes as well as the photonuclear absorption.  High-mass dilepton pair continuum rates have been measured and compared with theoretical predictions to test expectations for two-photon interactions, and good agreement with model calculations is obtained.  Finally, evidence for the elastic scattering of photons Î³Î³âÎ³Î³ (âlight-by-lightâ scattering) will be presented, a previously unobserved process made possible by the high photon flux and low event pileup provided by the LHC.

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Within the context of a hybrid strong/weak coupling model of jet quenching, we study the \r\nmodification of the angular distribution of the energy within jets in \r\nheavy ion collisions, as partons within jet showers lose energy\r\nand get kicked as they traverse the strongly coupled plasma\r\nproduced in the collision.  To describe \r\nthe dynamics transverse to the jet axis,  we add \r\nthe effects of transverse momentum broadening \r\ninto our hybrid construction, introducing a parameter $K\\equiv \\hat q/T^3$\r\nthat governs its magnitude. We show that, because of the quenching\r\nof the energy of partons within a jet, even when $K\\neq 0$ the jets\r\nthat survive with some specified energy in the final state are narrower\r\nthan jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this reason,\r\nmany standard observables are rather\r\ninsensitive to $K$.\r\nWe\r\npropose a new differential jet shape ratio observable in which\r\nthe effects of transverse momentum broadening are apparent.\r\nWe also analyze the response of the medium to the passage\r\nof the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\r\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After \r\nfreezeout this wake becomes soft particles with a broad angular\r\ndistribution but with net momentum in the jet direction, meaning that\r\nthe wake contributes to what is reconstructed as a jet.  This effect must\r\ntherefore be included in any description of the angular structure\r\nof the soft component of a jet.\r\nWe show that the particles coming from the response of the medium to the momentum\r\nand energy deposited in it leads to a correlation between the momentum of soft particles\r\nwell separated from the jet in angle with the direction of the jet momentum, and find\r\nqualitative but not quantitative agreement with experimental data on observables designed\r\nto extract such a correlation.\r\nMore generally, by confronting the results that we obtain upon introducing transverse momentum\r\nbroadening and the response of the medium to the jet \r\nwith available jet data, we highlight the importance of these processes for\r\nunderstanding the internal, soft, angular structure of high energy jets.",

      "Country": "UK",
      "Abstract": "We study modification of full jet structures in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) medium including effect of the hydrodynamic medium response. The structures and energies of jets in heavy ion collisions are significantly modified by the processes involving strong interactions during the propagation through the QGP medium, i.e., collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening, and induced parton radiation. The energy and momentum are deposited into the QGP medium by jets via the collisional energy loss and the $p_T$-broadening due to the energy-momentum conservation. The QGP medium is supposed to respond hydrodynamically to the deposited energy and momentum and flows propagating with the jets are caused. Particles originating from the jet-induced flows are observed as a part of the jets in the actual experiments, and contribute to the modification of the full jet structures. Studying this contribution is not only important for the precise interpretation of the experimental data but also provides a novel opportunity to investigate the collective response of the QGP. \r\n\r\nWe employ a full jet shower + QGP fluid model composed of transport equations for jet evolution and hydrodynamic equations with source terms for the QGP medium evolution. The transport equations describe the evolution of the three-dimensional momentum distributions of partons in the full jet [1]. In the transport equations, all the processes of the collisional energy loss, $p_T$-broadening and partonic splittings for all partons within the full showering jet are covered. The space-time evolution of the QGP medium is described by (3+1)-dimensional ideal hydrodynamic equations with source terms [2]. The source terms transfer the deposited energy and momentum to the QGP fluid and are constructed with the evolving distributions of the partons in jets obtained as solutions of the transport equations. In this work, we study the shape and energy loss of the full jet in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC including the effect of the jet-induced flows. We find that the contribution of the particles originating from the jet-induced flows significantly modifies the full jet shape, and especially dominates it at large angles from the jet direction. We also find that this contribution increase the jet-cone size dependence of the full jet energy loss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] N.-B. Chang and G.-Y.

For correlation studies of jet energy loss, two complementary trigger object choices offer access to the initial hard partonâs energy: On the one hand, direct-photonâtagged jets are a self-generated tomographic medium probe, unaffected by the medium and hence with an unbiased in-medium path length. They are also expected to exhibit a different flavor-dependence of energy loss, since high-$p_T$ direct photons are primarily produced with a quark recoil. On the other hand, reconstructed jets offer the promise of path length control or Jet Geometry Engineering through cut parameters. Previously, $A_J$ measurements at STAR observed significant imbalance for anti-$k_T$ di-jets with a resolution parameter R = 0.4 and a âhard-coreâ selection using only constituents with $p_T$ above 2.0 GeV/c and a neutral high tower with $E_T$ > 5.5 GeV. When soft constituents are included, this imbalance is found restored to the balance of the p+p reference inside the original jet cone, indicative of milder modification due to more surface-biased production.\n\nWe present a study of correlated hadrons and semi-inclusive recoil jets coincident with direct photons and neutral pions with 9 < $E_T^{trig}$ < 20 GeV, as well\nas with respect to to the dijet selection from the above $A_J$ measurement.

      "Abstract": "Within the overwhelming majority of models, light quark and gluon jet quenching in heavy ion collisions is described as resulting predominantly from pQCD-type gluon radiation, but details of the underlying mechanisms differ greatly. One key difference lies in the treatment of the Altarelli-Parisi, AP, splitting functions. While in some models, such as Q-PYTHIA,  the splitting functions are directly modified in the medium, this core component remains unchanged in others (e.g. YaJEM). The *shared momentum fraction* $z_g$ was shown to be a Sudakov-safe measurement of the splitting function [1].\r\nThis quantity measures the $p_T$ ratio between the two dominant branches \r\nas determined by the SoftDrop grooming process.\r\n\r\nAn inclusive measurement of $z_g$ in p+p collisions at top RHIC energy will be presented.\r\nThe focus of our Au+Au results will be on a comparative study to p+p \r\nusing the specific di-jet selection introduced in our previous momentum imbalance measurement, \r\ni.e. jets geometrically matched to \"hard core\" jets found using only constituents above 2 GeV/$c$ and with a high tower above 5.5 GeV. Such di-jet pairs were found to be significantly imbalanced with respect to p+p, yet regained balance when all soft constituents were included. Individual examination of the splitting behavior of leading and recoil jet adds a new dimension to this observation, and new input to energy loss models.\r\n\r\n[1] A. J. Larkoski, S. Marzani and J.

      "Country": "Italy",
      "Abstract": "In relativistic heavy ion collisions, a hot medium with a high density of unscreened color charges is produced. Jets are produced at the early stages of this collision and are known to become attenuated as they propagate through the hot matter. One manifestation of this energy loss  is a lower yield of jets emerging from the medium than expected in the absence of medium effects. ATLAS has provided a quantification of jet suppression by measurements of jet R_AA in the LHC Run 1.  A factor of two suppression was observed in central heavy ion collisions with respect to pp collisions. R_AA was also found to exhibit only a weak rapidity dependence, and a slow (but significant) rise with increasing jet momentum. The high-statistics run 2 data of Pb+Pb and pp collisions provide the opportunity to extend the jet R_AA measurement, to evaluate the center-of-mass-energy dependence of this quantity and to explore new techniques for the study of jet substructure using subjets. This talk will presents the Run 1 results on inclusive jet production and new Run 2 results on inclusive jet suppression. It will furthermore presents new results on the measurement of jet substructure from the Run 2 data.",

      "Country": "USA",
      "Abstract": "Recently our group analyzed how the probability distribution for the jet\nopening angle is modified in an ensemble of jets that has propagated\nthrough an expanding cooling droplet of plasma [1]. Each jet in the\nensemble is represented holographically by a string in the dual 4+1-\ndimensional gravitational theory with the distribution of initial energies and\nopening angles in the ensemble given by perturbative QCD. In [1], the full\nstring dynamics were approximated by assuming that the string moves at\nthe speed of light. We are now able to analyze the full string dynamics for\na range of possible initial conditions, giving us access to the dynamics of\nholographic jets just after their creation. We show that, after a period of\ntime that we compute, the string nullifies: the force of gravity accelerates\neach section of string until it approaches the speed of light. The\nnullification timescale and the features of the string when it has nullified\nare all results of the string evolution. This emboldens us to analyze the full jet shape, rather than just the opening angle of each jet in the ensemble as in [1]. We find the\nstriking result that the jet shape scales with the opening angle at any\nparticular energy. We construct an ensemble of dijets with energies and\nenergy asymmetry distributions taken from events in proton-proton\ncollisions, opening angle distribution as in [1], and jet shape taken from\nproton-proton collisions and scaled according to our result. We study how\nall of these observables are modified after we send the ensemble of dijets\nthrough the strongly-coupled plasma.\n\n[1] Krishna Rajagopal, Andrey V.

      "Abstract": "Direct photons, being colorless objects, provide an unmodified control particle that can be used in conjunction with jets to probe the quark-gluon plasma. To leading order the direct photon momentum balances the momentum of opposing jets and can therefore provide a clean handle on the jet energy. Therefore, angular correlations with direct photons provide a mechanism to study the fragmentation of the opposing jet without performing jet reconstruction.  Jet fragmentation modification has been measured previously in PHENIX in central Au+Au collisions.  Recent RHIC runs offer the potential to study these observables in heavy ion collisions with greater statistics and over different collision systems including asymmetric collision geometries.   In this talk we present results of isolated direct photon-triggered correlations in $d$+Au collisions and discuss the constraints of cold nuclear matter effects on the fragmentation functions.  We also present the latest results with higher statistics on direct photon-triggered correlations in Au+Au collisions including differential measurements of fragmentation function modification.   Finally, we present the status of the centrality and collision species dependence of these observables, including comparisons to related di-hadron correlations. Together these results can give a view of jet modification going from small to large system size.",

      "Abstract": "Single particle production has proven to be a valuable tool to study heavy ion collisions. The observation of collective behavior in $p$+Pb at the LHC and $d$+Au RHIC has spurred speculation that a plasma is formed in small collision systems. Jet production in the same collisions at the LHC and RHIC has an anomalous centrality dependence if centrality is determined the same way as in large ion-ion collisions. One interpretation could be that the nucleus probes the dynamical structure (\"color fluctuations\") of the projectile. Hints of gluon saturation effects have been observed at forward rapidities in $d$+Au collisions at RHIC. To systematically explore the physics using very asymmetric systems, RHIC has provided beams of $p$+Au, $p$+Al, $d$+Au and $^3$He+Au. Single particle production in these collisions should be sensitive to the physics of energy loss, modifications of the nuclear wavefunction, and the dynamics of the projectile wavefunction. PHENIX Central arms can measure pi0 at mid-rapidity. New MPC-EX detector allows $\\pi^0$ measurement for $3.1 < \\eta < 3.8$.

      "Abstract": "The measurement of jet substructure provides important detailed information on the dynamics of the jet-QGP interaction. However, our ability to reliably extract such information is contingent on understanding the sensitivity of any given substructure observable to specific features of in-medium jet dynamics. Monte Carlo event generators with transparent physics content and that have been validated for a wide set of observables, e.g. JEWEL, are powerful tools to establish the sensitivity of observables to specifics of jet-QGP interaction. Using the generic procedure we put forward in Eur.Phys.J. C76 (2016) no.5, 288 (arXiv:1512.08107 [hep-ph]) â where we applied it to establish the origin of the excess dijet asymmetry observed in AA collisions as due to fluctuations of the jet fragmentation pattern rather than, as widely believed in the community, to the difference in the amount of matter traversed by the two jets in the pair â we examine the z_g substructure observable recently measured by CMS and STAR. We find straightforward interpretations of the z_g measurement as indicating a QGP-induced modification of the QCD splitting function to be over-simplistic and confounded by the observable sensitivity to fluctuations of the jet-medium interaction pattern. We propose several complementary measurements that can further elucidate the potential of this, and related observables, to give information on in-medium jet dynamics.",

      "Abstract": "Hadrons carrying heavy flavour (charm or beauty quarks) constitute an exceptional probe to study the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Heavy quarks are produced in initial hard parton-scattering processes of the nucleon-nucleon collisions and on short time scales compared to the QGP formation time. Therefore they experience the entire evolution of the medium interacting with its constituents. \n\nThe measurement of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) of charmed hadrons \nallows us to gain insight into the colour-charge and parton-mass  dependence of energy loss as well as into possible modifications of hadronization in presence of the medium. \nResults from Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV indicate that momentum distributions of charmed mesons are modified in Pb--Pb with respect to pp collisions,\nowing to quenching of heavy quarks in the hot and dense medium. The D-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ exhibits a suppression of a factor 5-6 for $p_{\\rm T}$ $\\approx$ 10 GeV/$c$ in central collisions, with a hint of reduced suppression for D$_{\\rm s}$ mesons as compared to non-strange D mesons.\nResults from Run 2 will allow us to reduce uncertainties and draw firmer conclusions about possible charm recombination at low and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ and about colour-charge and parton-mass dependence of energy loss.\n\nThe measurement of the elliptic flow ($v_2$) provides further insight into the deconfined phase. At low $p_{\\rm T}$, D-meson $v_2$ offers the unique opportunity to test whether also charm quarks participate in the collective expansion dynamics and possibly thermalize in the medium. At low and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$, the elliptic flow is also expected to be sensitive to the hadronization mechanism, while at high $p_{\\rm T}$, it can constrain the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. During the LHC Run 1, ALICE measured a positive $v_{2}$ for D$^{\\rm 0}$, D$^{\\rm +}$, D$^{\\rm *}$ mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 2.76$ TeV. The increased statistics of semi-central Pb--Pb events at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV, obtained with the LHC Run 2, provides access to more precise results for non-strange D-meson $v_{2}$ as well as to the first measurement of the D$_{\\rm s}$-meson elliptic flow at LHC energies.  \n\nIn this talk, the elliptic flow of D mesons in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}_{\\rm NN} = 5.02$ TeV will be presented, together with the status of the D-meson $R_{\\rm AA}$ at the same energy.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy flavor quarks have been suggested as excellent probes to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Significant suppression of open heavy flavor production at large tranverse momentum has been observed in Au+Au collisions relative to p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV at RHIC. Such a suppression can be attributed to the energy losses of heavy flavor quarks due to their interactions with the QGP, which are expected to be different for bottom and charm quarks because of their different masses. In order to fully understand the parton-QGP interactions and thus the QGP properties, it is essential to measure open bottom and charm hadron suppressions separately in Au+Au collisions. Moreover, Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects due to the different initial states in p+p and Au+Au collisions also need to be taken into account when interpreting these results.\n\nIn this talk, we will report measurements of open bottom and charm hadron production through multiple decay channels in p+p, p+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR experiment. We will show the first results on open bottom hadron production in Au+Au collisions, where electrons, $D^0$ and J/Ï from open bottom hadron decays are topologically identified utilizing the STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker. These results will be compared to those of open charm hadron production to study the mass dependence of parton interactions with the QGP at RHIC energies. Nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ for electrons from inclusive open heavy flavor hadron decays will also be shown to quantify the CNM effects on open heavy flavor production.",

      "Abstract": "Measurements of quarkonium production have played an important role in understanding the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) formed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The suppression of quarkonia in the medium due to color screening has been proposed as a direct signature of the QGP formation. However, other effects, such as regeneration of quarkonia by the coalescence of uncorrelated quark-antiquark pairs, co-mover absorption, and cold nuclear matter effects, add additional complications to the interpretation of the observed quarkonium suppression. Compared to charmonia, bottomonia suffer much less from regeneration contribution and co-mover absorption. Furthermore, different bottomonium states may dissociate at different temperatures, known as \"sequential melting\", which can be used to constrain the temperature of the medium.\n\nQuarkonium measurements have been traditionally performed in the dielectron channel at STAR. In early 2014, the Muon Telescope Detector (MTD), which provides muon identification and triggering capabilities at mid-rapidity, was fully installed into the STAR experiment. It allows measurements of quarkonia via the di-muon channel with much smaller Bremsstrahlung radiation and thus much better invariant mass resolution than the dielectron channel. In this talk, we will present the measurements of Î¥ suppression in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via both the di-muon and dielectron channels. The centrality and transverse momentum dependences will be reported and compared to those at the LHC and theoretical calculations. We will also show the Î¥ measurements in p+p and p+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV via the dielectron channel using the data taken in year 2015. These measurements provide a significantly improved p+p reference and quantification of the cold nuclear matter effects for Î¥ measurements at RHIC.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy-flavor observables are excellent probes of the properties of the in-medium interactions, the medium properties and the degrees of freedom of the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. Progressing toward a quantitative description, we describe, in EPOSHQ, the dynamics of heavy quark coupled systematically to the EPOS3 model: heavy-quarks are produced from the EPOS3 flux tube initial conditions both in momentum and in coordinate space and subsequently propagated in parallel to the fluid dynamical evolution of the viscous QGP. Hadronization of the heavy quarks via coalescence and fragmentation and particlization of the fluid enable us to investigate the importance of the final hadronic rescatterings on the heavy-flavor observables.\nThis global description allows us to draw conclusions from the comparison to a variety of heavy-quark observables in different systems and constrain important aspects in our underlying model for the in-medium interaction, such as the contributions stemming from elastic and inelastic energy loss, or the mass dependence by comparing charm and bottom quark dynamics. We present strategies to quantify the off-equilibrium dynamics of heavy flavor at lower momentum compared to the bulk flow by focussing on the higher-order flow harmonics of B and D mesons and the light, charged hadrons and it's centrality dependence. At higher momentum path length differences become the driving force of flow observables. Our sophisticated energy loss models and QGP-heavy quark coupling allow us in particular to obtain robust estimates of different contributions to the heavy flavor flow in the intermediate momentum range.",

      "Country": "Germany",
      "Abstract": "Many precision measurements of quarkonium suppression at the LHC, e.g. the nuclear modification factor R_AA of J/Psi, are well described by a multitude of different models [1]. Thus pinpointing the underlying physics is difficult and first principles guidance is needed. In-medium spectral properties, e.g. mass shifts or the broadening of states can help us to understand quarkonium production in a kinetically equilibrated setting. While potential based approaches with lattice input [2] have been used to estimate such modifications, a direct and quantitative determination from first principles lattice QCD is still outstanding.\n\nAdvancing towards this goal we present here a high statistics study of bottomonium and charmonium S-wave and P-wave spectral properties at finite temperature using the effective field theory NRQCD on the lattice. This EFT allows us to capture the physics of quarkonium without modelling assumptions in a realistic thermal QCD medium, described by state-of-the-art lattices of the HotQCD collaboration at almost physical pion mass [3]. The availability of two Bayesian methods for spectral functions (MEM and BR [4]) makes it possible to thoroughly test the systematic uncertainties of their reconstruction.\n\nOur new lattice QCD correlation functions and reconstructed spectra corroborate a picture of sequential modification of states with respect to their vacuum binding energy. We find that remnant features of the bottomonium S-wave may survive up to T~400MeV, while the P-wave ground state disappears around T~300MeV. The charmonium analysis hints at melting of the P-wave below T~190MeV while some S-wave remnant feature might survive up to T~245MeV.\n\nWith the inclusion of charmonium spectra, an extended temperature range and increased statistics by more than an order of magnitude our study provides a coherent picture of in-medium quarkonium modification extending significantly beyond our previous results of Ref.

Herein, the sigma field as the chiral order parameter is propagated explicitly and coupled to a fluid of quarks. Before investigating these fluctuations in an expanding nonequilibrium medium, we scrutinize the N$\\chi$FD model by comparing cumulants of the sigma and net-baryon number fluctuations in a thermalized box to (ratios of) susceptibilities as they are obtained from derivatives of the grand canonical potential. The dynamically determined cumulants follow the trend of the thermodynamic susceptibilities. After implementing a particlization procedure into this model, we study the behavior of the net-proton kurtosis in the critical region and find that it shows the typical shape around the pseudocritical temperature. This demonstrates how critical fluctuations are able to develop in a realistic heavy-ion collision scenario and, moreover, have observable consequences.

This state of nuclear matter was not expected to be found in reactions involving smaller systems, such as the pA and pp collisions. Nevertheless, a wealth of experimental evidence in recent years has suggested the presence of collective phenomena and a possible QGP medium being formed also in high-multiplicity pPb collisions. A detailed investigation is needed to establish the cause of the observed collective behavior and to determine if, indeed, a QGP medium is being created or if another mechanism is responsible. Final results of differential $v_{n}$ harmonics in pPb collisions as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity obtained using scalar product, multi-particle cumulant and Lee-Yang Zeros methods are presented in various multiplicity classes. The effect of event plane decorrelations on the observed $\\eta$ dependence of $v_{n}$ is studied in detail. Furthermore, new measurements of correlation between $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ ($v_{4}$) harmonics are performed using the technique of symmetric cumulants to gain more insight to the initial state and possible medium response of the pPb system. The results shown in this talk relate to our understanding of the origin of azimuthal correlations in high-multiplicity pPb events and shed light on a potential QGP formation in small system collisions.",

The well-known DGLV, ASW, BDMPS-Z, AMY and HT calculations all exploit both the large separation distance (between scattering centre and radiation) and the large system approximations.  We relax the large system assumption and recompute the energy loss in the DGLV formalism in order to address the glaring lack of theoretical control over small-system energy loss.  Alarmingly, we find that the correction terms dominate at large energies, resulting in ~100% *negative* correction, calling into question the validity of the large formation time assumption used in *all* pQCD-based energy loss calculations.

      "Abstract": "ALICE is the LHC experiment dedicated to the study of ultra relativistic \nheavy-ion collisions where the formation of a hot and dense \nstrongly-interacting medium, a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is expected. \nConsiderable theoretical and experimental efforts have been invested in \nthe last 30 years to study the properties of the QGP. One of the signals \nof QGP formation is the charmonium suppression. Measurements from Pb-Pb \ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$  TeV revealed a suppression of \ncharmonium yields in central collisions, compared to binary-scaled pp \ncollisions. However, the magnitude of the suppression is smaller than \nwhat was observed at lower energies at the SPS and RHIC, indicating that \nJ/$\\psi$ regeneration via  recombination of  charm and anti-charm quarks \nplays an important role at LHC energies.\n\nIn this contribution, charmonium ($\\psi(2S)$ and J$/\\psi$) measurements \nat forward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4$) in Pb-Pb collisions at \n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with ALICE will be presented. \nThe analyses are performed in the dimuon decay channel down to zero \ntransverse momentum ($\\it{p}_T$) with the  data sample collected in 2015 \n(about 7 times more statistics than that collected in Pb-Pb collisions \nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$  TeV). Together with results on the \nJ$/\\psi$ nuclear modification factor $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ as a function of \ncentrality, transverse momentum and rapidity, new multi-differential \nmeasurements will be presented. First results on the J/$\\psi$ $\\langle \np_{\\rm T} \\rangle$ and $\\langle p_{\\rm T}^2 \\rangle$ as a function of \ncentrality will be discussed. Preliminary results on the \n($\\psi(2S)$/J$/\\psi$) ratio as a function of  centrality and transverse \nmomentum will also be shown.

      "Abstract": "Quarkonium spectral functions have all information about in-medium properties of heavy quarkonia such as dissociation temperatures, which are important to understand suppression of quarkonium yields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC, where many interesting results on $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ suppression have been reported already. Since quarkonium suppression can occur through complicated processes not only related to the medium effect but also any other ones such as cold nuclear matter effects, good theoretical understanding of quarkonium behavior in the hot medium is required. Low frequency behavior of the quarkonium spectral functions for the vector channel also tells us transport properties of heavy quarks in quark-gluon plasma, which is important input for hydrodynamic models trying to explain collective phenomena in heavy-ion experiments. Therefore it is important to investigate the quarkonium spectral functions, especially using first-principle lattice QCD calculations.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we report our recent study on quarkonium spectral functions in lattice QCD at finite temperature. To get correlation functions with high data quality, which is important to extract reliable spectral functions, we performed simulations on very large and fine lattices with a couple of lattice cutoffs towards the continuum limit. Our previous studies on some of these lattices have been reported in [1,2]. At temperatures in a range between 0.75$T_c$ and 2.3$T_c$ we reconstruct quarkonium spectral functions from temporal Euclidean meson correlators with both charm and bottom quark masses, where to estimate systematic uncertainties we adopt the conventional maximum entropy method as well as two different stochastic methods: one is the stochastic analytical inference based on the Bayes' theorem and the other is the stochastic optimization method, which does not rely on any prior information (see our preliminary works in [3,4]). We discuss dissociation of quarkonium states from temperature and quark mass dependence of the spectral functions. We also estimate the heavy quark diffusion coefficient using low-frequency behavior of the spectral functions for the vector channel.\r\n\r\n[1] H.

In particular, the comparison between the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) of light- and heavy-flavour particles provides insights into the expected flavour dependence of in-medium parton energy loss. Furthermore, azimuthal anisotropy coefficient ($v_{n}$) of heavy-flavor particles provide insights into the degree of the thermalization of the bulk medium at low $p_{T}$, and unique information about the path length dependence of heavy quark energy loss at high $p_{T}$. Using the large statistics proton-proton and PbPb samples collected at 5.02 TeV during the 2015 LHC run, high precision open charm measurements are performed with the CMS detector in a wide transverse momentum range. This allows us to set an important milestone in our understanding of the interactions between charm quark and the medium. In this talk, the most recent results of $R_{AA}$, $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ of $D^{0}$ mesons in PbPb collisions at 5.02 TeV are presented and compared to the same results for charged hadrons at the same energy.",

For this reason, $l^{+}l^{-}$ pair measurements play an essential role in the study of the hot and dense nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. Dileptons in the low invariant mass region (up to M$_{ll}\\sim$1~GeV/c$^2$) retain information about the in-medium modification of vector mesons while dileptons in the intermediate mass region (extending out to M$_{ll}\\sim$3 GeV/c$^2$) predominantly originate from charm decays and thermal radiation of the medium. At higher invariant masses, recent studies of $J/\\psi$ yields in peripheral A$+$A collisions by the ALICE~\\cite{alice} and STAR collaborations showed significant excess at very low momentum transfers (p$_T$ $<$ 0.3~GeV/c). These observations may point to evidence of coherent photoproduction of $J/\\psi$ in hadronic interactions which conflicts with traditional knowledge of the coherent photoproduction mechanism. It is interesting to investigate the $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in a wider invariant mass region (M$_{ee}<$4 GeV/c$^2$) at very low p$_T$ in heavy-ion collisions for different centrality bins in order to study the production mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover $e^{+}e^{-}$ spectra with various invariant mass and p$_{T}$ differentials in Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV and U$+$U collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV. The structure of the t (t = p$_{T}^{2}$ ) distributions of these mass regions will be shown and compared with the same distributions in ultra-peripheral collisions. Additionally, this talk will cover first measurements of $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ invariant mass spectra from STAR's recently installed Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) in p$+$p and Au$+$Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. Physics implications of the $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ results will be discussed in the context of STAR's published $e^{+}e^{-}$ results.",

In all collision systems, the ridge correlations are shown to be present even in events with a low\nmultiplicity of produced particles, implying that the long-range correlations are not unique to rare high-multiplicity events. The\nproperties of the correlation are shown to exhibit only a weak energy dependence and are remarkably similar to that observed in $p$+Pb collisions. Another new aspect of this talk is a detailed study of ridge properties in collisions containing hard processes,\ncharacterized by large four-momentum transfer. This may help answering the question whether the ridge arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale.\n\nIn order to assess the collective nature of multi-particle production, the correlation measurements are extended to include azimuthal\ncorrelations measured using multiparticle cumulants. The presented measurements of multi-particle cumulants $c_2 \\{2â8\\}$ confirm the evidence for collective phenomena in $p$+Pb and low-multiplicity Pb+Pb collisions. However, for $pp$ collisions, the measurements of cumulants do not yet provide clear evidence for collectivity as they are susceptible to event-by-event multiplicity fluctuations. In order to address this, results from a new modified cumulant method which suppress both the contribution of multiplicity fluctuation and non-flow effects are presented.",

      "Abstract": "The collisions of lead nuclei provided by the LHC in Run 2 provide new opportunities to study matter produced at unprecedented temperatures and densities. In particular, the study of the azimuthal anisotropy of produced charged particles not only constrains the initial state of the nuclear collisions and soft particle collective dynamics, but also sheds light on jet quenching via the measurement of flow harmonics at high transverse momenta. In this talk, new ATLAS measurements of flow harmonics from $v_2$ to $v_7$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, performed in a wide range of transverse momenta 0.5-40 GeV,  pseudorapidity ($|\\eta|$<2.5) and collision centrality are presented. This includes a first measurement of $v_6$ and $v_7$, as well as harmonics in ultra-central collisions. A procedure of removing correlations arising from back-to-back jets,\nrecently used in $pp$ collisions, is implemented in the Two-Particle Correlation method to evaluate $v_n$ without a jet bias. The scaling relations between the $v_n$ harmonics are also discussed.\n\nLongitudinal dynamics has recently become a topic of great interest in the study of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. Measurement of the longitudinal fluctuations of the flow harmonic coefficients $v_n$ and event-plane angles $\\Psi_n$ can provide a more complete picture of space-time evolution of the hot, dense medium formed in heavy ion collisions. Longitudinal flow decorrelations can be modeled with two contributions: magnitude fluctuations and event plane twist. However, existing observables do not separate these two effects. In this analysis, a new 4-particle correlator is used to separate the event-plane twist from magnitude fluctuations in 2.76 and 5.02 Pb+Pb collisions. Results show both effects have a linear dependence on pseudorapidity separation for v_{2-5}, and show a small but measurable variation with collision energy. The correlation of $\\Psi_n$ of different order are also expected to have longitudinal fluctuations due to the non-linear mixing effects between lower and higher order\nflow harmonics.  First measurement of such non-linear mode-mixing effects as a function of pseudorapidity is also presented. These result will help to constrain initial conditions along longitudinal direction and also help understand the longitudinal evolution of the fireball.",

      "Abstract": "Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are sensitive probes to study the properties of the strongly-interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions at ultra-relativistic energies, since they are mainly produced in initial hard scattering processes and experience the entire evolution of the system.\nThe heavy quarks traversing the medium lose energy via collisional and radiative processes in the interaction with the medium constituents. The heavy-flavour energy loss can be investigated with measurements of the modification of the transverse momentum distribution of heavy-flavour particles in heavy-ion collisions with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions (nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm{AA}}$). An observable that complements the investigation of the interaction of heavy quarks with the medium is the elliptic flow of heavy-flavour particles, which is defined as the second harmonic ($v_{2}$) of the Fourier expansion of the particle azimuthal distribution in momentum space. The measurement of the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at low transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) provides insight into the collective motion of heavy quarks in the medium, while the heavy-flavour particle $v_{2}$ at high $p_{\\rm T}$ is sensitive to the path-length dependence of the energy loss of heavy quarks in the almond-shaped overlap area in non-central collisions.\nThe semi-leptonic decay channel of open heavy-flavour hadrons is well suited for heavy-flavour studies in ALICE, since the branching ratio is relatively large (10$\\%$) and ALICE has an unique capability for identification of electrons at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.8$) and muons at forward rapidity ($2.5 < y < 4$) over a wide $p_{\\rm T}$ range.\nIn this talk, we will present the ALICE results on the nuclear modification factor and elliptic flow of open heavy flavour hadrons via their semi-electronic decays at mid-rapidity and via their semi-muonic decay channel at forward rapidity in PbâPb collisions. Progress on the measurements of leptons from heavy-flavour and beauty-hadron decays in PbâPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV will be discussed. The first results on the $R_{\\rm{AA}}$ and $v_{2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays in PbâPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV and prospects for measurements of electrons from beauty-hadron decays will be presented.

      "Abstract": "Beams of relativistic heavy ions are accompanied by a large flux of equivalent photons, and photon-induced reactions are the dominant interaction mechanism in heavy-ion collisions when the colliding nuclei have transverse separation larger that the nuclear diameter. In these ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) the photon can provide a clean probe of the partonic structure of the nucleus analogous with deep inelastic scattering. This talk presents measurements of dijet production in ultra-peripheral Pb+Pb collisions performed with the ATLAS detector. Events are selected using requirements on rapidity gaps and forward neutron production to identify the photo-nuclear processes. The relatively clean environment of these events allows for measurements in a region of x and Q^2 where significant nuclear PDF modifications are expected to be present and not strongly constrained by previous measurements. \n\nThis talk also presents measurements of four-jet cross sections in pp and p+Pb collisions over a large kinematic range. In addition to higher order QCD effects, the four-jet cross section receives contributions from so-called double parton scatterings (DPS) in which two independent hard scattering processes occur in the same collision. Thus measurements of DPS, which have already been performed in 7 TeV pp collisions, can yield new information on the spacial and momentum correlations between partons in a nucleon beyond single parton distributions. In p+Pb collisions, additional mechanisms for DPS are possible when two partons in the proton scatter off partons in different nucleons in the nuclear target, leading to an enhancement in the four jet rate and a different sensitivity to the underlying correlations. Differential cross sections as well as measurements of momentum and angular correlations, which help disentangle the single and double parton scattering contributions, will be presented.",

      "Abstract": "Recent measurements of azimuthal particle correlations in small collision systems show striking simularities to flow signatures observed in gold-gold and lead-lead collisions, leading many to question if the origin of small system correlations is hydrodynamic in nature. The ensuing effort to construct a unified hydrodynamic model for small and large collision systems revealed new tension in the QGP initial conditions: heavy-ion collisions appear to prefer saturation based initial conditions [1209.6330, 1505.02677], while small system collectivity is currently best described using a Monte Carlo Glauber model [1502.04745].\n\nIt has since been suggested that adding subnucleonic structure to the QGP initial conditions could strongly affect flow in small collision systems and may explain apparent model discrepancies [1405.3605v1]. While practical implementations of subnucleonic structure are relatively straightforwardâone simply replaces smooth protons with lumpy protonsâthere exist large theoretical uncertainties regarding the fluctuated shape of the proton, and corresponding theory predictions are highly model dependent.\n\nIn this work, we extend previous efforts to parametrize and constrain the QGP initial conditions using systematic Bayesian analysis and study the effects of subnucleonic structure predicted by a simple constituent parton model. We vary both subnucleonic degrees of freedom, e.g. the constituent parton number and effective parton width, as well as typical transport parameters such as the hydrodynamic starting time and QGP viscosity. The initial conditions are then embedded in an event-by-event hydrodynamic model and calibrated to simultaneously fit charged particle yields, flows and mean $p_T$ for light-heavy and heavy-heavy collisions at RHIC. We finally apply Bayesian parameter estimation methods to extract posterior distributions for the optimal initial condition parameters and comment on the implied viability of related theoretical frameworks.",

      "Abstract": "Electromagnetic fields are generated in high energy nuclear collisions by spectator valence protons. These fields are traditionally computed by integrating the Maxwell equations with point sources. One might expect that such an approach is valid at distances much larger than the proton size and thus such a classical approach should work well for almost the entire interaction region in the case of heavy nuclei. We argue that, in fact, the contrary is true: due to the quantum diffusion of the proton  wave function, the classical approximation breaks down at distances of the order of the system size.\nWe compute the electromagnetic field created by a charged particle described initially as a Gaussian wave packet of width 1~fm and evolving in vacuum according to the Klein-Gordon equation. We completely neglect the medium effects. We show that the dynamics, magnitude and even sign of the electromagnetic field created by classical and quantum sources are different.",

      "Abstract": "The recent BES data of the energy dependent ÎºÏ^2 for net protons in Au+Au collisions presented large deviations from the statistical baselines at lower collision energies, and non-monotonic behavior at around 20 GeV, which indicates possible signals for the existence of the QCD critical point [1]. \n\n  In our recent paper [2], we introduce a freeze-out scheme to the dynamical models near the QCD critical point. Our model calculations for the static critical fluctuations  on the freeze-out surface shows that the C_4 and ÎºÏ^2  data of net protons can be roughly described. However, C_2 and C_3 are always over-predicted due to the positive static critical fluctuations. After solving the time evolution equations of the various cumulants of the sigma field,  the BNL group found the Skewness and Kurtosis could change their sign after the evolution, which indicates that dynamical critical fluctuations could solve the sign problem of C_3  [3]. However, such BNL approach can not be easily combined with our freeze-out scheme to compared with the experimental data since only the zero mode of sigma field are considered there, which already erase the needed spatial information.\n\n  Within the framework of Langevin dynamics, we simulate the dynamical evolution of the fluctuating sigma field in position space and calculate the cumulants of the sigma field in the critical regime[4]. Our numerical simulations show that C_2 automatically increases as the system evolves in the critical regime, which represents the spontaneous increase of the chiral fieldâs correlation. Besides, for both C_3 and C_4, the sign in the earlier times can be remembered during the dynamical evolution due to the memory effects near the critical point[4].

      "Country": "Unknown",
      "Abstract": "We present a derivation of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics from the moments of the Boltzmann equation based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic single-particle distribution function [1]. We construct such an expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum space orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the anisotropy. From the Boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle distribution function from the anisotropic distribution. Truncating this set via the 14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics. We further consider a particular choice for the anisotropic distribution function and the boost-invariant expansion of a fluid in one dimension, neglecting deviations from the chosen distribution function [2]. In order to close the conservation equations, we need to select in addition a particular moment of the Boltzmann equation. We discuss the influence of the choice of this moment on the time evolution of fluid-dynamical variables and identify the moment that provides the best match of anisotropic fluid dynamics to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation.\n\n[1] E.
